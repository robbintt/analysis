# Data Understanding Survey: Pursuing Improved Dataset Characterization Via Tensor-based Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.14161
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14161
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Tensor-based methods offer improved dataset characterization through multilinearity and ability to preserve latent relationships that conventional matrix-based approaches lose.

## Executive Summary
This survey paper explores tensor-based methods as a promising alternative to conventional dataset characterization techniques. Traditional approaches like statistical, structural, and model-based analyses often fall short in capturing nuanced characteristics of complex, high-dimensional data. The authors review existing tensor data analysis (TDA) methods across various domains and highlight their potential for improved dataset characterization through properties like multilinearity, separability, and preservation of latent relationships.

The paper presents two illustrative examples: the Generalized Canonical Polyadic (GCP) decomposition, which allows flexible statistical assumptions via customizable loss functions, and a novel tensor comparison method that leverages implicit tensor decompositions. These methods demonstrate the malleability of TDA for tailoring analysis to specific data properties and the ability to circumvent computational challenges through implicit formulations. The authors conclude that tensors and TDA methods have significant potential to enhance dataset characterization, particularly in domains like artificial dataset generation and explainable AI.

## Method Summary
The paper surveys tensor-based methods for dataset characterization, focusing on two specific approaches. The first is Generalized Canonical Polyadic (GCP) decomposition, which reformulates standard tensor decomposition as maximum likelihood estimation with customizable loss functions tailored to specific data distributions (Gaussian, Bernoulli, Poisson, etc.). The second is an implicit tensor comparison method that verifies structural similarity between tensors by comparing column spaces of matricized forms, avoiding explicit NP-hard decomposition. The methods are demonstrated on synthetic data including exponential polynomial sources mixed into observations, using Hankelization to create tensor representations and singular value thresholding for rank estimation.

## Key Results
- Tensors preserve multi-way relationships and latent structures that are destroyed when data is flattened into matrices for conventional analysis
- GCP decomposition allows tailoring the analysis to specific statistical distributions through customizable loss functions, improving characterization accuracy
- Implicit tensor formulations enable comparison of dataset structures without explicitly computing NP-hard decompositions
- Tensor methods show potential for improved dataset characterization in domains like artificial dataset generation and explainable AI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Representing data as tensors preserves multi-way relationships (latent structures) that are destroyed when data is flattened into matrices for conventional analysis. Tensors function as multilinear maps that maintain dependencies between different data modes (e.g., space, time, and frequency simultaneously). By avoiding vectorization/matricization, the "latent spaces and structures formed by multi-relational datasets" remain intact, allowing for more robust structural characterization. The core assumption is that the dataset inherently possesses higher-order relationships that are separable and multilinear; if the data is purely vector-based without inter-mode dependencies, the overhead may not yield benefits.

### Mechanism 2
Dataset characterization can be improved by tailoring the tensor decomposition loss function to the specific statistical distribution of the data (e.g., non-Gaussian). The Generalized Canonical Polyadic (GCP) decomposition reformulates the standard Least Squares fit as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). This allows the use of specific link functions (e.g., Poisson for count data, Bernoulli for binary data), reducing noise and improving the interpretability of the resulting components compared to standard Gaussian assumptions. The core assumption is that the underlying data distribution is known or hypothesized (e.g., the data is count-based) and deviates significantly from Gaussian; otherwise, standard CP decomposition suffices.

### Mechanism 3
Implicit tensor formulations allow for the comparison of dataset structures without explicitly computing NP-hard decompositions. By matricizing the tensor (unfolding it into matrices) and comparing the column spaces of these unfoldings, one can verify if two tensors share the same underlying rank-1 terms. This circumvents the computational complexity and ill-conditioning often associated with direct higher-order tensor decomposition. The core assumption is that the structural similarity between datasets is primarily driven by shared subspace components in their matricized forms, rather than complex nonlinear interactions that require the full tensor form.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multilinear Algebra & Rank**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the difference between matrix rank (linear) and tensor rank (multilinear) is crucial. Tensor rank is NP-hard to compute, which motivates the paper's focus on "implicit" methods and low-rank approximations.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the rank of a tensor is not simply the rank of its matricized form?

- **Concept: Tensor Decomposition (CP vs. Tucker)**
  - Why needed here: The paper advocates for GCP (a variant of CP) and BTD (Block Term Decomposition). Knowing that CP decomposes a tensor into a sum of rank-1 outer products helps explain how the "malleable" GCP isolates statistical features.
  - Quick check question: How does the CP decomposition differ from the Tucker decomposition in terms of core tensor usage?

- **Concept: Meta-features & Data Characterization**
  - Why needed here: To evaluate the efficacy of tensor methods, you must know what they are trying to measure. Concepts like "landmarking" (model performance) and "statistical moments" are the baselines the paper argues are insufficient.
  - Quick check question: Why might two datasets with identical means and variances (like the Datasaurus Dozen) require structural characterization methods like clustering or tensor analysis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Data -> Tensorization (Hankelization) -> Analysis Engine (GCP or Implicit Comparison) -> Feature Output (Meta-features or Generative Parameters)
- **Critical path:** The definition of the loss function (GCP) and the matricization strategy. If these are misaligned with the data type (e.g., using Gaussian loss on sparse binary data), the characterization fails.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Expressiveness vs. Computation: Tensors capture more nuance than matrices but suffer from the "curse of dimensionality" and NP-hard optimization
  - Explicit vs. Implicit: Explicit decomposition (GCP) gives detailed components but is computationally heavy; Implicit comparison is faster (Linear Algebra) but gives a coarser similarity metric
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Degeneracy: The decomposition algorithm fails to converge or yields unstable factors (common in CP)
  - Over-flattening: Using Matrix analysis on Tensor data results in the loss of "latent relationships" mentioned in the abstract
  - Statistical Mismatch: Using standard Euclidean loss on count data, resulting in poor fit (GCP aims to fix this)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline vs. Tensor: Reproduce the "Datasaurus Dozen" comparison using simple statistics vs. a Tensor Clustering method to demonstrate structural differentiation
  2. GCP Sensitivity: Run GCP on a synthetic count-data tensor using a Poisson loss vs. a Gaussian loss to measure improvement in rank estimation
  3. Implicit Comparison: Implement the implicit column-space comparison on two mixed signal sets to see if it detects shared sources without running full Blind Source Separation decomposition

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the analysis of weight tensor ranks in Tensor Neural Networks (t-NNs) provide a more insightful characterization of datasets than traditional model-based meta-features? While tensor-based NN architectures (like t-NNs) have been developed, their internal structural properties (e.g., the rank of weight tensors) have not been systematically evaluated as meta-features for characterizing the datasets used to train them. Empirical studies comparing the efficacy of t-NN weight characteristics against standard model-based meta-features in tasks such as algorithm selection or dataset similarity would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How can tensor-based dataset characterization metrics be incorporated into the loss functions of generative models to improve artificial dataset generation? Current generative models typically rely on low-order statistics or pixel-wise errors; a mechanism to backpropagate error signals based on high-order tensor structural comparisons has not been developed. Implementation of a GAN or autoencoder where the training objective includes a penalty term derived from tensor decomposition discrepancies between real and generated datasets would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
Can the identification of latent structures via tensor decompositions serve as a formal basis for Explainable AI (XAI)? The theoretical link between the unique factorizations offered by tensors and the explainability of model decisions is proposed but not yet formalized into a framework that connects data characteristics to model behavior. A framework where specific components (factors) of a decomposed dataset tensor are mapped directly to human-interpretable concepts or decision rules within a trained AI model would resolve this.

### Open Question 4
Do implicit tensor formulations provide sufficient robustness and accuracy for dataset characterization in noisy, real-world environments compared to explicit decomposition methods? While implicit methods solve the rank determination problem algebraically, their sensitivity to noise relative to iterative optimization methods in the specific context of dataset characterization is not established. Comparative analysis of implicit tensor comparison methods versus explicit iterative decomposition on benchmark datasets with injected noise, measuring stability of extracted structural characteristics, would resolve this.

## Limitations

- The paper provides conceptual frameworks but lacks empirical validation with real-world datasets to demonstrate claimed improvements in dataset characterization
- Implementation details for GCP decomposition and implicit comparison method are sparse, making direct reproduction challenging without assumptions about algorithmic parameters
- The claim that tensors "preserve latent relationships" is theoretically sound but the paper does not quantify the information loss when using matrix-based methods on tensor-structured data

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The theoretical advantages of tensor methods (multilinearity, separability) are well-established in the literature and accurately presented
- **Medium Confidence:** The GCP framework for customizable loss functions is conceptually valid, though the paper doesn't provide sufficient implementation details or empirical validation
- **Medium Confidence:** The implicit comparison method for avoiding NP-hard decompositions is innovative but the practical benefits over existing methods are not demonstrated

## Next Checks

1. Implement the GCP decomposition and implicit comparison method, then benchmark against standard statistical characterization methods (e.g., PCA, k-means clustering) on synthetic datasets with known ground truth structures
2. Systematically evaluate how both methods perform under varying noise levels and data distributions to identify failure modes and limitations
3. Apply the methods to at least one real-world dataset (e.g., spatiotemporal data, multi-modal sensor data) to assess practical utility beyond synthetic examples
