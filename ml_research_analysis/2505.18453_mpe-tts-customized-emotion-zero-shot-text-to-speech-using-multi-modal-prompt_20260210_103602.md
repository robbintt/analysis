# MPE-TTS: Customized Emotion Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech Using Multi-Modal Prompt

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.18453
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18453
- Reference count: 0
- MPE-TTS is a zero-shot text-to-speech system that enables flexible emotion customization using multi-modal prompts (text, image, or speech)

## Executive Summary
MPE-TTS introduces a novel zero-shot text-to-speech system that enables flexible emotion customization through multi-modal prompts including text, images, or speech. The system disentangles speech into content, timbre, emotion, and prosody using a hierarchical approach, employing a multi-modal prompt emotion encoder based on Emotion2Vec and an LLM-like prosody predictor with emotion consistency loss. The diffusion-based acoustic model generates mel-spectrograms that preserve emotional characteristics from the input prompts.

The proposed approach was evaluated on the MEAD-TTS dataset and demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline systems like Meta-StyleSpeech, GenerSpeech, and MM-TTS. The system shows significant improvements in both objective metrics (WER and emotion accuracy) and subjective evaluations (MOS, ESMOS, and SSMOS) across all three prompt modalities, with speech prompts showing the highest performance.

## Method Summary
MPE-TTS employs a hierarchical disentanglement approach that separates speech into content, timbre, emotion, and prosody components. The system uses a multi-modal prompt emotion encoder (MPEE) based on Emotion2Vec to extract emotion information from any input modality, combined with an LLM-like prosody predictor that includes emotion consistency loss to maintain emotional characteristics in generated speech. A diffusion-based acoustic model then generates the target mel-spectrogram. This architecture enables zero-shot emotion customization by allowing users to control the emotional expression of synthesized speech through any of the three input modalities.

## Key Results
- MPE-TTS achieved WER improvements of 5.6-8.4% over baseline systems
- Emotion accuracy improved by 13-19% compared to competitors
- Subjective evaluations showed MOS improvements from 3.55 to 3.73, ESMOS improvements from 3.75 to 4.05, and SSMOS improvements from 3.55 to 3.73 when using speech prompts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hierarchical disentanglement of speech components enables independent control of emotional expression while maintaining content integrity. The multi-modal prompt emotion encoder can extract emotional information from diverse input sources, making the system flexible and user-friendly. The emotion consistency loss in the prosody predictor ensures that the generated speech maintains the emotional characteristics from the input prompts, while the diffusion-based acoustic model provides high-quality mel-spectrogram generation with fine-grained control over emotional expression.

## Foundational Learning

**Emotion2Vec Embedding**: A learned representation that captures emotional characteristics from various input modalities. Why needed: To create a unified emotional representation space that can be extracted from text, images, or speech. Quick check: Verify that embeddings from different modalities map to similar regions in the emotional space for the same expressed emotion.

**Diffusion-Based Acoustic Modeling**: A generative approach that progressively denoises a random signal to produce high-quality audio. Why needed: To enable fine-grained control over emotional expression while maintaining audio quality. Quick check: Compare generated mel-spectrograms against ground truth for both spectral fidelity and emotional characteristics.

**Hierarchical Disentanglement**: Separation of speech into content, timbre, emotion, and prosody components. Why needed: To allow independent manipulation of emotional expression without affecting other speech attributes. Quick check: Verify that modifying emotion parameters doesn't significantly impact content or timbre preservation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text/Image/Speech Input -> MPEE -> Emotion Embedding -> Prosody Predictor -> Diffusion Acoustic Model -> Mel-Spectrogram -> Audio

**Critical Path**: Input Modality → MPEE → Emotion Embedding → Prosody Predictor → Diffusion Model → Audio Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The multi-modal approach increases flexibility but adds computational complexity compared to single-modality systems. The hierarchical disentanglement provides better control but requires more sophisticated training procedures.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor emotion transfer when input and target speaker characteristics differ significantly, degraded audio quality when emotion intensity is extreme, potential loss of emotional nuance with overly compressed emotion embeddings.

**Exactly 3 First Experiments**:
1. Test emotion transfer accuracy using each input modality separately with controlled emotion pairs
2. Evaluate robustness by varying input emotion intensity levels and measuring output quality
3. Assess cross-speaker emotion transfer by using emotion prompts from speakers different from the target speaker

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily conducted on MEAD-TTS dataset, limiting generalizability
- Limited exploration of cross-lingual or cross-cultural emotion transfer capabilities
- Computational requirements for the multi-modal approach are not fully characterized
- Long-term stability and robustness under varied real-world conditions remains untested

## Confidence
- High confidence in objective metrics comparisons with baselines
- Medium confidence in subjective evaluation results due to potential rater bias
- Medium confidence in the effectiveness of MPEE and emotion consistency loss based on ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MPE-TTS on additional emotion-rich datasets beyond MEAD-TTS to assess generalizability
2. Conduct cross-lingual emotion transfer experiments to validate multi-lingual emotion preservation capabilities
3. Perform extensive computational complexity analysis comparing MPE-TTS against baseline systems across different hardware configurations
