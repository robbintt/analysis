# Time-Varying Optimization for Streaming Data Via Temporal Weighting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13052
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13052
- Authors: Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar; Nicolò Michelusi; Erik G. Larsson
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: The paper analyzes tracking error bounds for time-varying optimization using temporal weighting schemes

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of tracking time-varying optimal model parameters in streaming data environments. The authors propose a structured approach using weighted averages of past data sample losses, analyzing two specific weighting strategies: uniform weights that treat all samples equally and discounted weights that geometrically decay older data's influence. The work establishes theoretical convergence guarantees and tracking error bounds for both approaches using gradient descent optimization.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs gradient descent with a fixed step size to minimize a time-varying objective function constructed as a weighted average of past data sample losses. For uniform weights, the objective gives equal importance to all historical samples, while discounted weights apply geometric decay to older samples' contributions. The analysis derives tight bounds on the tracking error - the deviation between the current model parameter and the time-varying optimum. The theoretical framework provides O(1/t) asymptotic convergence for uniform weights and characterizes the nonzero asymptotic error floor for discounted weights based on the discount factor and gradient update count.

## Key Results
- Uniform weighting achieves O(1/t) asymptotic convergence with vanishing tracking error
- Discounted weighting incurs a nonzero asymptotic error floor dependent on the discount factor
- Numerical simulations validate theoretical predictions using scalar quadratic loss functions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by explicitly incorporating temporal information into the optimization objective through weighted averaging of historical data. The uniform weighting strategy ensures all past information contributes equally, allowing the algorithm to converge to the time-varying optimum as the number of samples grows. The discounted weighting introduces a controlled forgetting mechanism that prioritizes recent data while maintaining some historical context, creating a tradeoff between adaptation speed and steady-state accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Time-varying optimization** - needed to model streaming data scenarios where optimal parameters change over time; quick check: verify the objective function explicitly depends on time
2. **Weighted averaging of losses** - needed to incorporate historical data into current optimization decisions; quick check: confirm weight normalization and temporal decay properties
3. **Gradient descent tracking error analysis** - needed to establish convergence guarantees for non-stationary optimization problems; quick check: verify step size conditions for stability
4. **Asymptotic convergence rates** - needed to quantify the tradeoff between adaptation speed and steady-state accuracy; quick check: confirm O(1/t) rate derivation is mathematically sound
5. **Non-stationary stochastic optimization** - needed to handle the streaming data setting with time-varying objectives; quick check: verify assumptions about objective function smoothness and boundedness
6. **Temporal discounting** - needed to balance recent versus historical information in streaming contexts; quick check: confirm geometric decay properties of the discount factor

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data samples -> Weighted loss computation -> Gradient descent update -> Model parameter tracking

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves computing the weighted loss function at each time step, performing gradient descent updates with fixed step size, and tracking the deviation from the time-varying optimum. The algorithm must balance computational efficiency with tracking accuracy.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The uniform weighting strategy provides better asymptotic convergence but requires storing all historical data, creating memory constraints. Discounted weighting offers computational efficiency through controlled forgetting but introduces a nonzero steady-state error floor. The fixed step size simplifies implementation but may not adapt well to varying optimization landscapes.

**Failure Signatures:** The algorithm may fail to track rapid changes in the time-varying optimum, especially with aggressive discounting or inappropriate step sizes. Memory constraints may become prohibitive for long-term streaming applications using uniform weights. Non-convex or noisy objective functions may violate the smoothness assumptions required for theoretical guarantees.

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement both weighting strategies on synthetic time-varying quadratic objectives with known optima to validate tracking error bounds
2. Compare tracking performance on real-world streaming datasets with varying degrees of temporal variation
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on step size selection and discount factor tuning across different problem characteristics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Uniform weighting requires perfect memory of all historical data, creating computational barriers for long-term streaming applications
- Discount factor selection lacks clear guidelines for optimal choice across different problem domains
- Fixed step size assumption without addressing adaptive step size strategies that might improve tracking performance
