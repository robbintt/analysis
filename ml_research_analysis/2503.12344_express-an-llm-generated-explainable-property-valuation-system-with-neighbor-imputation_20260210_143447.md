core_contribution: EXPRESS is a property valuation system that combines LLM-generated
  explanations with neighbor-based imputation to handle missing values and provide
  interpretability. The system uses a configurable dynamic nearest neighbor search
  to find similar properties, imputes missing values from these neighbors, and employs
  LightGBM for price prediction.

# EXPRESS: An LLM-Generated Explainable Property Valuation System with Neighbor Imputation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.12344
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12344
- Reference count: 4
- Combines LLM-generated explanations with neighbor-based imputation for property valuation

## Executive Summary
EXPRESS is a property valuation system that addresses the challenge of incomplete property information while providing transparent, interpretable predictions. The system integrates LightGBM for price prediction with a novel approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate feature-wise explanations by comparing target properties with similar neighbors. By employing dynamic nearest neighbor search and imputation techniques, EXPRESS handles missing values effectively and produces natural language explanations that improve user trust and understanding of valuation results.

## Method Summary
EXPRESS combines several key components to create an interpretable property valuation system. The core methodology uses dynamic nearest neighbor search to identify similar properties, which are then used for imputing missing values through configurable neighbor-based approaches. LightGBM serves as the primary predictive model for price estimation. The system's innovation lies in using LLM technology to generate explanations by comparing the target property against its similar neighbors, highlighting feature differences and their impact on price. This approach allows for customizable filtering conditions and flexible handling of different property types while maintaining interpretability through natural language explanations.

## Key Results
- Combines LLM-generated explanations with neighbor-based imputation for interpretable property valuation
- Uses dynamic nearest neighbor search to find similar properties for missing value imputation
- Employs LightGBM for price prediction with feature-wise explanations comparing target to similar properties
- Addresses real estate appraisal challenges where users lack complete property information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by leveraging the complementary strengths of different AI approaches. LightGBM provides accurate price predictions through gradient boosting on decision trees, while the neighbor imputation approach fills missing data gaps using real property examples. The LLM component transforms these technical comparisons into human-understandable explanations by analyzing feature differences between the target property and its neighbors. This multi-layered approach addresses both the technical challenge of incomplete data and the practical need for transparency in property valuation decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **LightGBM Gradient Boosting**: Needed for accurate price prediction; quick check: verify model performance metrics on validation set
- **Dynamic Nearest Neighbor Search**: Required for finding relevant similar properties; quick check: measure neighbor search accuracy and relevance scores
- **LLM Explanation Generation**: Essential for creating interpretable feature comparisons; quick check: evaluate explanation coherence and relevance to predictions
- **Neighbor-Based Imputation**: Critical for handling missing property data; quick check: compare imputed vs. actual values on complete records
- **Property Feature Engineering**: Important for capturing relevant valuation factors; quick check: assess feature importance rankings from LightGBM
- **Natural Language Processing**: Necessary for converting technical comparisons to user-friendly explanations; quick check: validate explanation readability and comprehension

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Property Data -> Dynamic Neighbor Search -> Missing Value Imputation -> LightGBM Prediction -> LLM Explanation Generation -> User Interface

**Critical Path:** Data Input -> Neighbor Search -> Imputation -> Price Prediction -> Explanation Generation -> Output

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system prioritizes interpretability over pure prediction accuracy by incorporating LLM explanations, potentially sacrificing some predictive performance for transparency. The neighbor-based imputation approach may be computationally intensive but provides contextually relevant data completion.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor neighbor search results in irrelevant imputation and explanations; inadequate property feature representation leads to inaccurate predictions; LLM explanation generation may produce generic or incorrect comparisons if neighbor data quality is low.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test neighbor search accuracy using synthetic datasets with known property relationships
2. Evaluate imputation quality by comparing predicted vs. actual values on properties with artificially removed features
3. Validate explanation coherence by measuring user comprehension of generated feature comparisons

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No comparative analysis against established baseline models, making performance improvements unclear
- Validation relies primarily on synthetic data rather than real-world property datasets
- LLM-generated explanations lack quality evaluation through user studies or automated metrics

## Confidence
- System Architecture and Methodology: **Medium** - The overall framework is well-described but lacks empirical validation
- LLM Explanation Generation: **Low** - No evaluation of explanation quality or effectiveness
- Missing Value Imputation: **Medium** - Approach is described but not benchmarked against alternatives

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comparative experiments against established property valuation baselines (e.g., traditional hedonic regression, neural network approaches) using real-world property datasets with known ground truth prices
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (neighbor imputation, LLM explanations, LightGBM model) to overall system performance
3. Design and execute a user study to evaluate the effectiveness and comprehensibility of the LLM-generated explanations, measuring whether they actually improve user trust and understanding compared to black-box predictions
