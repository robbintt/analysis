# ParamExplorer: A framework for exploring parameters in generative art

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16529
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16529
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Reinforcement-learning-inspired framework for exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces in generative art

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ParamExplorer, a reinforcement-learning-inspired framework for exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces in generative art. The authors address the challenge of navigating complex, multimodal parameter spaces where aesthetically compelling outputs occupy only small, fragmented regions. ParamExplorer integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects and supports both human-in-the-loop and automated feedback through interactive agents. The framework demonstrates improved efficiency in discovering visually interesting outputs compared to random sampling.

## Method Summary
ParamExplorer implements three exploration strategies: Random (baseline), Gaussian (local exploration with clustering for diversity), and Open-ended (dynamically expanding search regions). The framework integrates with p5.js projects, allowing artists to explore parameter spaces systematically. Agents interact with the generative system, receiving feedback based on aesthetic evaluation to guide exploration. The system supports both interactive human feedback and automated agent-based exploration, making it versatile for different use cases in generative art creation.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated that agents can discover diverse, visually interesting outputs more efficiently than random sampling
- Showed rapid emergence of compelling outputs when using seeded exploration
- Proved framework's ability to navigate complex, multimodal parameter spaces effectively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating parameter space exploration as a reinforcement learning problem, where agents learn to navigate toward regions of high aesthetic value. By combining local exploration with global search strategies and incorporating diversity preservation through clustering, the system avoids getting trapped in local optima while efficiently discovering interesting outputs. The integration with existing p5.js projects allows immediate application without requiring system redesign.

## Foundational Learning
1. Reinforcement learning principles for parameter exploration - Needed to understand how agents learn to navigate parameter spaces; Quick check: verify that reward functions properly encode aesthetic preferences
2. Parameter space topology in generative art - Needed to appreciate why standard exploration methods fail; Quick check: confirm that explored spaces exhibit multimodal characteristics
3. p5.js integration patterns - Needed for practical implementation; Quick check: verify that framework hooks into existing generative systems without modification

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Artist Interface -> ParamExplorer Core -> Generative System (p5.js) -> Feedback Mechanism -> Agent Controller

Critical path: User provides aesthetic feedback or agent explores -> ParamExplorer generates parameter sets -> p5.js renders outputs -> Feedback evaluation -> Agent updates exploration strategy

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes flexibility and ease of integration over optimization speed, choosing to support existing p5.js projects rather than requiring specialized implementations.

Failure signatures: Poor exploration results typically indicate suboptimal reward function design, inappropriate exploration strategy selection for the parameter space characteristics, or insufficient diversity preservation.

First experiments:
1. Test framework with simple parametric curves to verify basic functionality
2. Compare exploration performance against random sampling on Superformula system
3. Evaluate human-in-the-loop feedback effectiveness with a small user study

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on reward function design and parameter choice
- Generalizability to complex generative systems beyond tested examples remains uncertain
- Performance improvements over random sampling may not hold for all parameter space characteristics
- Human aesthetic evaluation introduces subjective variability affecting result consistency

## Confidence
Framework design and integration (High): Technical implementation details and p5.js integration are well-documented and verifiable.
Exploration performance claims (Medium): Results show improvements but limited scope and subjective evaluation reduce confidence.
Practical utility for artists (Medium): Design choices support practical use, but extensive user testing is not reported.

## Next Checks
1. Test framework performance on additional generative art systems with different parameter space characteristics
2. Conduct user studies with artists to assess practical utility and gather usability feedback
3. Implement and compare additional exploration strategies like hierarchical search methods
