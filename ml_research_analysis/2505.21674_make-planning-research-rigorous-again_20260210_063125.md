# Make Planning Research Rigorous Again!

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.21674
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21674
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Planning research should adopt rigorous methodologies from automated planning to avoid pitfalls as LLMs are increasingly used for planning tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that planning research needs to return to the rigorous standards that have historically characterized the field, particularly as large language models are increasingly applied to planning tasks. The authors identify common methodological issues in current planning research, including the use of ill-defined problems, improper comparison of planners, lack of validation, and insufficient attention to dataset provenance and complexity. They emphasize the importance of incorporating established methodologies, tools, and data from the automated planning community to accelerate progress and avoid known pitfalls.

The paper provides practical guidance for improving planning research rigor, including careful benchmark selection, sound validation practices, and transparent experimental reporting. The authors also offer pointers to tools and resources for working with planning domains and languages like PDDL, aiming to help researchers bridge the gap between LLM-based approaches and established planning methodologies.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a methodological critique and recommendations rather than a specific research method. It synthesizes best practices from the automated planning community and identifies gaps in current LLM-based planning research. The authors draw on historical precedent in planning research to establish standards for problem definition, planner comparison, validation, and experimental reporting. They provide concrete examples of common pitfalls and offer specific tools and resources that researchers can use to improve their work.

## Key Results
- Planning research should adopt established methodologies from the automated planning community to accelerate progress
- Common issues include ill-defined problems, improper planner comparisons, lack of validation, and insufficient attention to dataset provenance
- The paper provides specific tools and resources for working with planning domains and languages like PDDL

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's arguments are grounded in the historical success of rigorous methodology in automated planning research. By advocating for the adoption of established practices, the authors aim to prevent the field from repeating known mistakes and to leverage decades of accumulated knowledge. The mechanism works by providing concrete guidance and resources that help researchers avoid common pitfalls and produce more reliable, comparable results.

## Foundational Learning

**Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)**: A standardized language for describing planning problems and domains. *Why needed*: Provides a common framework for problem specification and enables meaningful comparisons between planners. *Quick check*: Can you write a simple PDDL domain for a blocks world problem?

**Benchmark Suite Selection**: The process of choosing appropriate and representative planning problems for evaluation. *Why needed*: Ensures that planner performance is evaluated on problems that are well-understood and properly characterized. *Quick check*: Are the benchmarks you're using from established planning competitions?

**Validation Techniques**: Methods for verifying that a planner's output is correct and meaningful. *Why needed*: Prevents incorrect or meaningless results from being reported as successful planning. *Quick check*: Does your validation process check both syntactic correctness and semantic validity?

**Complexity Analysis**: Understanding the computational complexity of planning problems. *Why needed*: Helps researchers choose appropriate problems for their evaluation and interpret their results correctly. *Quick check*: Can you characterize the complexity class of your planning problems?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Research Community -> Planning Methodologies -> LLM Planning Approaches -> Rigorous Evaluation
Planning Tools and Resources -> PDDL Support -> Benchmark Datasets -> Validation Frameworks

**Critical Path**: Define problem → Choose benchmarks → Implement planner → Validate results → Report transparently
The most critical step is proper problem definition, as it affects all subsequent stages.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Rigor vs. speed of experimentation (more rigorous methods take longer but produce more reliable results), generality vs. specificity (broad methods vs. domain-specific optimizations), and simplicity vs. completeness (minimal vs. comprehensive evaluation).

**Failure Signatures**: Ill-defined problems lead to incomparable results; improper comparisons produce misleading performance metrics; lack of validation allows incorrect solutions to be reported as correct; insufficient provenance makes results unreproducible.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Take a simple PDDL domain and implement two different planners, comparing their performance on established benchmarks
2. Validate the output of an LLM planner on a well-defined planning problem using automated validation tools
3. Analyze the complexity characteristics of a planning benchmark suite and relate them to observed planner performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the input.

## Limitations
- The claim that LLM-based planners should adopt established planning methodologies lacks empirical evidence of performance improvement
- The assertion about widespread methodological flaws in LLM planning research is supported by examples but not quantified across the broader literature
- Claims about the overall state of LLM planning research lack systematic review data to back them up

## Confidence

**High**: Identification of specific technical tools and resources for planning research (concrete and verifiable)

**Medium**: Characterization of common pitfalls in current planning research (plausible but may not represent full spectrum of practices)

**Low**: Claims about the overall state of LLM planning research without systematic review data

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic review of recent LLM planning papers to quantify the prevalence of identified methodological issues (ill-defined problems, improper comparisons, lack of validation, etc.)

2. Run controlled experiments comparing LLM planners using standard planning methodologies versus current ad-hoc approaches on benchmark domains

3. Survey the automated planning community to assess awareness and usage of the recommended tools and resources mentioned in the paper
