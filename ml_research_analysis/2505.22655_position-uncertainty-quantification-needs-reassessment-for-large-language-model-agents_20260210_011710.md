core_contribution: The paper highlights that large language models (LLMs) can hallucinate
  and that uncertainty quantification is critical for improving trust and transparency.
  However, traditional uncertainty frameworks, which rely on separate aleatoric and
  epistemic measures, do not fit the open, interactive nature of LLM-agent interactions.

# Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for Large-language Model Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.22655
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22655
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Primary result**: Traditional uncertainty quantification frameworks are inadequate for LLM-agent dialogue; novel approaches are needed to address underspecification, interactive learning, and richer output uncertainty communication.

## Executive Summary
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents in interactive, open-ended settings, but their tendency to hallucinate undermines user trust. Conventional uncertainty quantification methods—relying on aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty—are ill-suited to conversational contexts where inputs are ambiguous, incomplete, or evolve dynamically. This paper argues that uncertainty must be rethought for LLM-agent interactions, proposing three new research directions: underspecification uncertainty, interactive learning, and output uncertainty expressed in natural language. These approaches aim to improve transparency, user trust, and the accessibility of LLM-agent dialogues. While traditional uncertainty terms remain useful in training, novel frameworks are essential for effective real-world deployment.

## Method Summary
The paper does not present a new empirical method but instead synthesizes findings from recent literature to critique existing uncertainty quantification frameworks. It identifies limitations in applying traditional aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty concepts to conversational LLM agents and proposes three conceptual research directions—underspecification uncertainty, interactive learning, and output uncertainty—to address these gaps. The authors focus on theoretical arguments and literature review rather than experimental validation.

## Key Results
- Large language models' hallucinations and ambiguous user inputs necessitate new uncertainty quantification frameworks for agent interactions.
- Traditional aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty concepts are ill-defined, often conflicting, and impractical for conversational contexts.
- Three new research directions are proposed: underspecification uncertainty, interactive learning, and output uncertainty through natural language expressions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper’s mechanism rests on recognizing that LLM-agent interactions are fundamentally different from static prediction tasks: inputs are underspecified, contexts evolve, and trust depends on transparent communication of uncertainty. By shifting from rigid aleatoric/epistemic splits to adaptive, conversational uncertainty handling, the proposed approaches directly target the sources of user confusion and model error in dialogue.

## Foundational Learning
- **Aleatoric Uncertainty**: Statistical uncertainty inherent in data (e.g., noisy measurements); useful in training but insufficient for interactive settings. Quick check: Can be quantified with probabilistic models.
- **Epistemic Uncertainty**: Model uncertainty due to limited knowledge; helpful for training but poorly defined in conversations. Quick check: Reducible with more data or better models.
- **Underspecification Uncertainty**: Uncertainty from incomplete or ambiguous user inputs; needed to handle real-world conversational ambiguity. Quick check: Requires parsing user intent and clarifying missing information.
- **Interactive Learning**: Agent actively asks clarifying questions to reduce ambiguity; essential for user-aligned outcomes. Quick check: Measured by reduction in follow-up questions and task success.
- **Output Uncertainty**: Expressing uncertainty in natural language rather than technical scores; improves user comprehension and trust. Quick check: Evaluated via user studies on trust and clarity.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Input -> Underspecification Handler -> Interactive Learner -> Output Uncertainty Generator -> Agent Response
**Critical Path**: Input ambiguity detection and clarification → Interactive query generation → Uncertainty expression in output
**Design Tradeoffs**: Rich uncertainty communication vs. user cognitive load; proactive clarification vs. interaction efficiency
**Failure Signatures**: Over-clarification (user frustration), under-clarification (misaligned outputs), unclear uncertainty expressions (reduced trust)
**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Benchmark underspecification detection in diverse dialogue datasets; 2) A/B test interactive vs. static clarification on task success; 3) User study comparing natural language vs. technical uncertainty expressions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions, including the practical feasibility of implementing underspecification uncertainty and interactive learning at scale, the scalability of natural language uncertainty expressions in complex dialogues, and the lack of empirical validation for the proposed approaches in real-world deployments.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation; concepts are largely theoretical and drawn from literature review.
- Unclear how well proposed approaches will scale to complex, real-world dialogue scenarios.
- Claims about inadequacy of traditional uncertainty frameworks are supported by literature, not systematic experiments.

## Confidence
- **High**: Need for novel uncertainty frameworks in LLM-agent dialogue is well-supported by documented hallucination issues.
- **Medium**: Claims about traditional uncertainty frameworks being ill-defined in conversations are based on literature review.
- **Low**: Practical impact and scalability of proposed methods remain uncertain without empirical validation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies to measure whether interactive learning and natural language uncertainty expressions improve user trust and task success rates in diverse conversational contexts.
2. Develop benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols for underspecification uncertainty in LLM-agent interactions to enable systematic comparison of proposed approaches.
3. Perform systematic empirical studies to quantify the frequency and severity of traditional uncertainty quantification failures in real-world LLM-agent dialogues versus the proposed methods.
