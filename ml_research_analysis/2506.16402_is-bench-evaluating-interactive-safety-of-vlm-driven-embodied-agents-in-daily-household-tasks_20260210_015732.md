# IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.16402
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402
- Reference count: 40
- 16 VLM-driven agents tested; success rate below 40% on interactive safety tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate interactive safety of Vision-Language Model (VLM)-driven embodied agents performing daily household tasks. Unlike prior static safety evaluations, IS-Bench employs a process-oriented framework that assesses agents' ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in correct procedural order. The benchmark features 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks across 10 domestic categories, instantiated in the OmniGibson simulator. Experiments with 16 VLM-driven agents reveal significant deficiencies in safety awareness, with success rates below 40%, though safety-aware Chain-of-Thought prompting shows promise with a 9.3% average safety improvement.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a process-oriented evaluation framework that contrasts with traditional static, termination-oriented safety assessments. IS-Bench evaluates agents through three key dimensions: Safety Awareness (whether agents detect safety risks), Safety Response (whether agents take appropriate mitigation actions), and Safety Awareness and Response Order (whether agents perceive and respond in correct procedural sequence). The benchmark includes 161 challenging scenarios across 10 daily household categories, featuring 388 unique safety risks instantiated in the OmniGibson simulator. Safety risks are explicitly introduced through environmental modifications, object states, or dynamic elements, and agents must detect these risks and execute appropriate mitigation steps while completing the primary task.

## Key Results
- VLM-driven agents achieve below 40% success rate on interactive safety tasks
- Safety-aware Chain-of-Thought prompting improves safety performance by 9.3% on average
- Safety-aware prompting reduces task completion by 9.4%, revealing a fundamental trade-off
- Proactive risk perception identified as the primary bottleneck rather than following safety constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The process-oriented evaluation framework works by explicitly modeling the temporal dynamics of safety risks and requiring agents to detect and respond to risks in correct procedural order. Unlike static evaluations that only check final outcomes, this approach captures whether agents can anticipate risks before they materialize and take preventive actions. The framework's strength lies in its comprehensive coverage of 388 unique safety risks across diverse household scenarios, allowing for systematic assessment of agent capabilities across different risk types and contexts.

## Foundational Learning

**Safety risk perception**: Understanding how agents detect environmental hazards through multi-modal inputs (vision, language, context). Why needed: Without accurate risk detection, agents cannot initiate appropriate safety responses. Quick check: Can the agent correctly identify a wet floor before attempting to walk across it?

**Procedural safety reasoning**: The ability to determine correct sequence of safety actions relative to task steps. Why needed: Safety responses must be temporally coordinated with task execution. Quick check: Does the agent turn off the stove before leaving the kitchen during a cooking task?

**Multi-modal integration**: Combining visual perception with language understanding to assess safety in context. Why needed: Safety risks often involve both physical states and semantic understanding. Quick check: Can the agent recognize that a child near a hot stove represents a safety risk requiring intervention?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: VLM -> Perception Module -> Safety Risk Detector -> Safety Response Generator -> Action Execution -> Environment Feedback -> Safety Assessment

**Critical path**: The evaluation pipeline follows: Scenario instantiation in OmniGibson → Agent perception and reasoning → Safety risk detection → Mitigation action selection → Environment state update → Safety and task success evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: Explicit risk instantiation vs. emergent risk generation; comprehensive scenario coverage vs. simulation complexity; process-oriented evaluation vs. computational overhead

**Failure signatures**: Agents fail primarily through missing risk detection (perception failures), incorrect response sequencing (reasoning failures), or delayed responses (timing failures). Most failures occur in the perception phase rather than action execution.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test baseline VLM agents on simple safety scenarios (single risk, clear mitigation)
2. Evaluate safety-aware prompting across different VLM architectures
3. Compare process-oriented vs. termination-oriented evaluation metrics on same scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several critical open questions:
- How to enable agents to detect risks that are not explicitly instantiated but emerge naturally from agent-environment interactions
- Whether safety-aware prompting techniques can be integrated into end-to-end training pipelines rather than being applied at inference time
- How to balance safety constraints with task efficiency in long-horizon household tasks
- Whether current VLM architectures are fundamentally limited in their ability to reason about safety or if this is primarily a data and training issue

## Limitations
- Simulation environment cannot fully capture real-world physical interaction complexity
- Safety risks are explicitly instantiated rather than emerging naturally from agent-environment interactions
- Evaluation focuses on predefined procedural steps, potentially missing emergent safety behaviors
- Limited exploration of how different VLM architectures handle safety perception differently
- Safety-aware prompting increases computational overhead and may not scale to real-time applications
- Benchmark scenarios may not fully represent the diversity of real household environments and cultural safety norms

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The benchmark design and scenario instantiation methodology are rigorously described and reproducible. The core finding that current agents struggle with interactive safety tasks is well-supported by experimental results.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that proactive risk perception is the primary bottleneck requires further validation, as the evaluation metrics may conflate perception failures with action selection issues.

**Medium confidence**: The reported trade-off between safety improvement and task completion (9.3% vs 9.4%) is statistically valid but may be influenced by the specific VLM models tested.

## Next Checks

1. Validate benchmark scenarios in a physical robot platform to assess real-world performance and identify simulation-to-reality gaps in safety perception and response.

2. Conduct ablation studies isolating perception components (vision encoders, attention mechanisms) from action components to quantify their relative contributions to safety performance.

3. Test agent generalization by introducing novel risk scenarios not seen during training or fine-tuning to evaluate true safety awareness versus pattern matching.
