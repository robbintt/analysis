# A Unified Perspective on Optimization in Machine Learning and Neuroscience: From Gradient Descent to Neural Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18812
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18812
- Reference count: 40
- This review provides a unified perspective on optimization methods across machine learning and neuroscience, bridging classic optimization theory with neural network training and biological learning.

## Executive Summary
This review bridges optimization theory in machine learning with biological learning mechanisms, proposing that zeroth-order optimization methods provide a unifying framework. While gradient-based methods like backpropagation dominate machine learning, they face scalability challenges in high-dimensional settings. The review argues that zeroth-order optimization—which relies on random exploration and function evaluations rather than explicit gradients—offers a computationally efficient alternative that may better model biological learning processes.

The authors categorize optimization approaches by derivative order, exploring their applications in neural network training and arguing that biological learning may be understood as a form of zeroth-order optimization that leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource. This framework has implications for developing neuromorphic hardware that exploits hardware noise for energy-efficient AI systems.

## Method Summary
The review synthesizes existing research on optimization methods across machine learning and neuroscience, categorizing approaches based on their use of derivatives. It examines classic gradient-based methods alongside derivative-free approaches, analyzing their theoretical foundations, computational requirements, and practical applications. The authors draw parallels between optimization algorithms and biological learning mechanisms, proposing that zeroth-order methods may better capture the essence of neural adaptation than traditional gradient-based approaches.

## Key Results
- Zeroth-order optimization methods can achieve performance competitive with backpropagation in neural network models
- Biological learning mechanisms may be better understood as zeroth-order optimization leveraging intrinsic neural noise
- This unified perspective has implications for designing energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The review proposes that zeroth-order optimization works by leveraging randomness and feedback-guided adaptation rather than explicit gradient computation. This approach reduces computational overhead while maintaining optimization effectiveness, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where gradient estimation becomes expensive. The mechanism relies on function evaluations and stochastic sampling to approximate optimal solutions without requiring derivative information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Derivative-based optimization**: Uses gradient information to navigate parameter space efficiently. Needed to understand the computational advantages of gradient-free methods. Quick check: Can you derive the gradient descent update rule from first principles?
- **Zeroth-order optimization**: Relies on function evaluations and random perturbations to estimate gradients. Needed to grasp the computational efficiency claims. Quick check: What is the fundamental difference between first-order and zeroth-order methods?
- **Random search algorithms**: Use stochastic exploration to find optimal solutions. Needed to understand how noise can be leveraged as a computational resource. Quick check: How does increasing random perturbations affect convergence speed?
- **Neuromorphic computing principles**: Hardware architectures that mimic neural systems. Needed to understand the energy efficiency implications. Quick check: What are the key architectural differences between von Neumann and neuromorphic systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Machine Learning Optimization -> Biological Learning Mechanisms -> Neuromorphic Hardware Design

Critical Path:
Zeroth-order optimization theory -> Empirical validation in neural networks -> Biological plausibility analysis -> Hardware implementation considerations

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational efficiency vs. optimization accuracy
- Biological plausibility vs. engineering practicality
- Energy efficiency vs. performance requirements

Failure Signatures:
- Poor convergence in high-dimensional spaces
- Inability to escape local optima
- Mismatch between theoretical and empirical performance

Three First Experiments:
1. Benchmark zeroth-order optimization against backpropagation across multiple neural network architectures
2. Measure intrinsic noise characteristics in biological neural systems and correlate with learning performance
3. Prototype neuromorphic hardware implementation testing noise exploitation for optimization tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Empirical validation of zeroth-order methods' competitive performance across diverse neural network architectures remains limited
- Biological plausibility arguments rely heavily on analogy rather than direct evidence of such mechanisms in biological systems
- Neuromorphic hardware applications are largely speculative with practical implementations still in early stages

## Confidence
- High confidence in the technical accuracy of optimization method classifications
- Medium confidence in claims about zeroth-order methods' competitive performance
- Low confidence in biological learning mechanism parallels and neuromorphic hardware implications

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical benchmarking of zeroth-order optimization methods across multiple neural network architectures (CNNs, RNNs, transformers) to verify competitive performance claims
2. Design controlled experiments to test whether intrinsic neural noise in biological systems exhibits characteristics consistent with computational resource utilization as proposed
3. Develop prototype neuromorphic hardware implementations to measure actual energy efficiency improvements when leveraging intrinsic noise for optimization tasks
