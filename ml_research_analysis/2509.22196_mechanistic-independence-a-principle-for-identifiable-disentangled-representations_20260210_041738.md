# Mechanistic Independence: A Principle for Identifiable Disentangled Representations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.22196
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22196
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces mechanistic independence as a framework for identifiable disentangled representations, unifying several recent identifiability results under a single mechanistic lens

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a new principle for disentangled representation learning that focuses on how latent factors act on observations through the generator, rather than their statistical independence. The authors introduce four independence criteria—Type D (support-based), Type M (mutual non-inclusion), Type S (sparsity gap), and Type H (higher-order)—each leading to identifiability of latent subspaces even under nonlinear, non-invertible mixing. They establish a hierarchy among these criteria and show that independent factors correspond to connected components in graphs derived from mechanistic assumptions. The framework generalizes and unifies recent identifiability results while clarifying when disentangled representations can be identified without distributional assumptions.

## Method Summary
The framework characterizes disentanglement through mechanistic independence criteria rather than statistical independence. Given a generator g: S → X mapping latent factors to observations, the method analyzes the Jacobian structure to identify support disjointness (Type D), mutual non-inclusion (Type M), sparsity gaps (Type S), and higher-order independence (Type H). Each criterion yields identifiability of latent subspaces up to block-permutation. The authors propose compositional contrast as a surrogate loss to approximate these criteria in practice. The framework assumes the generator is a local diffeomorphism and latent space is path-connected with irreducible factors.

## Key Results
- Establishes a hierarchy of independence criteria (D → M → S → H) with progressively weaker requirements
- Proves that Type D independence yields local identifiability of latent subspaces
- Shows that independent and irreducible factors correspond to connected components in graphs constructed from mechanistic assumptions
- Generalizes and unifies recent identifiability results under a mechanistic framework
- Provides experimental validation on synthetic compositional data with varying overlap ratios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Support Disjointness (Type D) → Local Identifiability
- **Claim:** If latent factors influence non-overlapping observation coordinates, and no factor can be split into smaller independent components, then any learned decoder with matching structure recovers the true factorization up to block-permutation.
- **Mechanism:** Hadamard orthogonality of Jacobian column blocks creates isolated "control regions" in observation space. When both ground-truth generator g and learned decoder ĝ exhibit this, their composition forces a block-diagonal alignment—misalignment would create spurious interactions violating the disjointness constraint.
- **Core assumption:** Generator is a local diffeomorphism; latent space is open with path-connected (K-1)-slices; factors are irreducible (cannot decompose further while maintaining independence).

### Mechanism 2: Sparsity Gap (Type S) → Identifiable Factorization
- **Claim:** When the sparsest Jacobian representation is achieved only in a basis aligned with the true factor decomposition, this gap prevents misaligned representations from achieving equivalent sparsity.
- **Mechanism:** The sparsity gap ρ⁺_B(s) < ρ⁻_B(s) creates an optimization "energy landscape" where the correct factorization is a unique minimum. Any basis transformation mixing factors strictly increases ℓ₀-norm, making the true decomposition the only sparse solution.
- **Core assumption:** Generator exhibits strictly lower sparsity in factor-aligned basis than any misaligned basis; factors are irreducible under sparsity criterion.

### Mechanism 3: Connected Components Graph Structure → Subspace Recovery
- **Claim:** Independent and irreducible factors correspond to connected components of graphs constructed from mechanistic assumptions, and the number of such components provides a testable criterion.
- **Mechanism:** Define graph G_D where edges connect factors sharing observation support. Under Type D independence, true factors form disconnected components. Any misaligned basis reduces the component count, creating a detectable gap that identifies the correct factorization.
- **Core assumption:** Generator is sufficiently smooth; graph construction respects product structure; irreducibility prevents spurious internal splits.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Local Diffeomorphism and Tangent Space Analysis**
  - Why needed here: All identifiability proofs assume generators are local diffeomorphisms, and independence is expressed via differentials in tangent spaces.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why local invertibility of the Jacobian (not global invertibility) suffices for extending local disentanglement to global?

- **Concept: Hadamard (Element-wise) Product vs. Standard Inner Product**
  - Why needed here: Type D independence uses Hadamard orthogonality for support analysis, distinct from the inner-product orthogonality in IMA methods.
  - Quick check question: Why does Hadamard orthogonality capture support disjointness while inner-product orthogonality does not?

- **Concept: Irreducibility and Minimal Decomposition**
  - Why needed here: Independence alone is insufficient—irreducibility rules out trivial factorizations that would undermine identifiability.
  - Quick check question: If a factor S_i is reducible of Type D, what does that imply about the internal structure of its tangent space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Ground-truth generator g: S → X (latent to observation manifold) → Learned decoder ĝ: Z → X (must match g's mechanistic structure) → Jacobian analysis module (computes Dg_s and block support patterns) → Sparsity/orthogonality regularizer (enforces independence criteria) → Connected component detector (validates irreducibility)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Verify generator is local diffeomorphism (Jacobian full rank everywhere)
  2. Compute support sets Ω_i(s) for each factor across multiple latent points
  3. Test independence criterion (pairwise Hadamard products zero for Type D, sparsity gap for Type S)
  4. Verify irreducibility by checking no internal decomposition exists
  5. Confirm path-connectedness of latent space slices

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Type D is strongest but requires disjoint supports (rare in practice)
  - Type S is more general but intractable to optimize directly (use surrogate losses like compositional contrast)
  - Higher-order criteria (Type H) require smooth generators but allow overlap
  - Trade stronger within-factor coherence for tolerance of between-factor interactions

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Constant Jacobian on open sets (no sparsity gap, Type M/S break)
  - Factors with identical support patterns (cannot distinguish via Type D/M)
  - Reducible factors misidentified as atomic (premature stopping in decomposition)
  - Non-path-connected latent slices (global extension fails)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Synthetic validation:** Construct MLP generators with known factor supports (varying overlap ratios 0%, 5%, 20%, 50%). Train autoencoder with reconstruction + compositional contrast loss. Measure disentanglement recovery vs. overlap.
  2. **Ablation on independence types:** Compare identifiability under Type D vs. Type S vs. Type H criteria on same data distribution. Quantify the "gap" each criterion exploits and when it vanishes.
  3. **Graph connectivity test:** For each learned representation, construct G_D and count connected components. Verify that correct factorization maximizes component count and that early stopping can be detected by component count stabilization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can more robust surrogate losses be identified to practically achieve Type S identifiability?
  - **Basis in paper:** Page 6 states: "Identifying more robust surrogate losses remains an open problem, which we leave for future work."
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper shows that while compositional contrast works for small support overlaps, it frequently fails (gets trapped in local minima) as the overlap ratio increases (Figure 1), despite Type S theory allowing for such overlap.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A novel loss function that consistently recovers disentangled representations in experiments with high overlap ratios, aligning empirical performance with the theoretical guarantees of Type S.

- **Question:** How can mechanistic independence be combined with stochastic (statistical) independence to relax constraints?
  - **Basis in paper:** The conclusion (Page 9) calls for "future work that ... combines mechanistic and stochastic assumptions."
  - **Why unresolved:** This paper establishes identifiability based purely on the generator's mechanism, ignoring the latent density. It is unclear if adding statistical assumptions (like non-Gaussianity) could weaken the required mechanistic constraints (e.g., reduce the required sparsity gap).
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical framework proving identifiability under hybrid conditions where neither mechanistic nor stochastic constraints are sufficient alone, but are sufficient together.

- **Question:** Can the basis-dependence of Type M independence be relaxed for general manifolds?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 3.2 notes Type M independence "depends on the choice of basis" and is restricted to S ⊆ ℝ^d_s to use the canonical basis.
  - **Why unresolved:** Unlike Type D, S, or H, Type M relies on a specific coordinate system to define mutual non-inclusion. This limits its applicability to latent spaces that are not subsets of Euclidean space or lack a clear canonical basis.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A coordinate-free definition of mutual non-inclusion that preserves identifiability guarantees on general smooth manifolds without relying on the standard basis.

## Limitations
- Type D criteria requires disjoint support patterns which are rare in practical applications
- Type S sparsity gap may not hold for many neural network generators, limiting practical applicability
- Experimental validation limited to synthetic data with controlled overlap ratios
- Dependence on irreducibility assumption adds practical complexity without clear verification heuristics
- The framework assumes local diffeomorphism property which may not hold for ReLU networks common in practice

## Confidence
- Type D → local identifiability: High (rigorous proofs with clear assumptions)
- Type S → global identifiability: Medium (generator-dependent, sparsity gaps may not hold)
- Graph-theoretic characterization: Medium (proofs sound, but empirical validation limited)
- Compositional contrast as surrogate loss: Low (shown to fail at higher overlap ratios)

## Next Checks
1. **Generator sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary generator architecture (MLP depth/width, activation functions) to identify when sparsity gaps emerge or vanish
2. **Real-world dataset testing:** Apply the framework to established disentanglement benchmarks (dSprites, 3DShapes) with known generative factors
3. **Robustness to noise:** Evaluate identifiability under observation noise and distribution shift to test practical limits
