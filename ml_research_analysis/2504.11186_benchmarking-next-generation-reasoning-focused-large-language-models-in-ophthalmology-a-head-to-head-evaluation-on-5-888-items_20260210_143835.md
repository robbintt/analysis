# Benchmarking Next-Generation Reasoning-Focused Large Language Models in Ophthalmology: A Head-to-Head Evaluation on 5,888 Items

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.11186
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11186
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: OpenAI o1 achieved highest accuracy (0.902) and Macro-F1 (0.900) among four evaluated reasoning-focused LLMs on 5,888 ophthalmology MCQs

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated four reasoning-focused LLMs—DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking—using 5,888 ophthalmology multiple-choice questions from the MedMCQA dataset. Accuracy, Macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore, BARTScore, AlignScore) were measured. OpenAI o1 (accuracy 0.902, Macro-F1 0.900) and DeepSeek-R1 (accuracy 0.888) achieved the highest accuracy. O3-mini excelled in ROUGE-L (0.151), o1 in METEOR (0.232), DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini tied in BERTScore (0.673), DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking in BARTScore (-4.105), and o3-mini and o1 in AlignScore (0.181 and 0.176). DeepSeek-R1 had the longest average inference time (40.4s), while Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking was fastest (6.7s). Qualitative assessment revealed DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking provided more detailed reasoning, whereas o1 and o3-mini were more concise.

## Method Summary
The study used 5,888 ophthalmology MCQ items from MedMCQA (filtered from 6,990, excluding 920 with poor ground-truth explanations and 182 DeepSeek-R1 timeouts). Four reasoning-focused LLMs were evaluated in zero-shot mode using standardized role-play prompts requiring JSON-formatted outputs. Models were assessed using accuracy, Macro-F1 (bootstrapped 1,000 repeats), and five text-generation metrics comparing model explanations against ground-truth reasonings. A 100-item subset was used to measure inference latency.

## Key Results
- OpenAI o1 achieved highest accuracy (0.902) and Macro-F1 (0.900)
- DeepSeek-R1 had longest inference time (40.4s) with 182 timeouts on 6,070 items
- Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking was fastest (6.7s) but showed lower accuracy on complex differential diagnosis
- Qualitative analysis showed DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini provided more detailed reasoning versus o1 and o3-mini's concise outputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Inherent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Structuring
Reasoning-focused LLMs improve reliability by internalizing intermediate reasoning steps prior to producing final outputs. Unlike standard LLMs requiring explicit "think step-by-step" prompts, these models (e.g., o1, DeepSeek-R1) are architected to automatically decompose complex queries into logical progressions, enabling self-correction and deeper context analysis. This internal reasoning generation causally links to higher accuracy rather than simply larger parameter counts. However, the latency added by generating intermediate steps (DeepSeek-R1's 40.4s inference time) may negate utility in time-sensitive environments.

### Mechanism 2: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Load Balancing
DeepSeek-R1 utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts architecture activating 37B parameters out of 671B total for specific tokens or reasoning steps. This allows vast knowledge storage (beneficial for niche medical data) without full computational cost of dense models for every word. The observed performance (high accuracy but high latency) results from routing complexity within the MoE layer, where difficult reasoning paths trigger more complex routing. This design leads to timeouts (182 items failed) when server infrastructure cannot handle memory bandwidth requirements.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Alignment Evaluation
Effective benchmarking requires evaluating semantic similarity to ground-truth logic, not just lexical overlap or binary accuracy. Metrics like BERTScore and AlignScore check factual consistency and semantic embeddings, capturing "right for the wrong reason" cases and preventing over-reliance on simple accuracy scores. The ground truth explanations in MedMCQA serve as valid semantic anchors for these metrics, though their quality directly impacts metric discriminative power when explanations are noisy or missing.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Zero-shot Prompting**
  - **Why needed here**: The study relies on zero-shot capabilities to assess models' intrinsic medical knowledge and reasoning, distinct from ability to mimic provided examples.
  - **Quick check question**: If a model answers correctly only after seeing 5 examples in the prompt, is that zero-shot performance?

- **Concept**: **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - **Why needed here**: This is the core differentiator of evaluated models. Understanding CoT explains why these models produce "verbose" or "step-by-step" outputs compared to standard predictive text.
  - **Quick check question**: Does a standard GPT-4 model generate internal reasoning tokens by default without specific prompt, or does it only predict next visible word?

- **Concept**: **Inference Latency vs. Reasoning Depth**
  - **Why needed here**: The study highlights critical tradeoff: models that "think" longer (DeepSeek-R1) are more accurate but slower. This is central to architecture trade-offs.
  - **Quick check question**: If a model has high accuracy but 40s latency, is it viable for real-time clinical decision support?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: MedMCQA dataset -> 4 Reasoning LLMs (OpenAI o1/o3-mini via API, DeepSeek-R1 via Azure, Gemini via API) -> Composite evaluator measuring Accuracy, Macro-F1, and 5 text-gen metrics

- **Critical path**:
  1. **Data Curation**: Excluding items with poor ground-truth explanations ensures metric validity
  2. **Standardization**: Uniform "role-play" prompts and default hyperparameters (temperature 1 or 0.7) ensure fair comparison
  3. **Output Parsing**: Extracting JSON answers vs. reasoning text for separate evaluation pipelines

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Transparency vs. Performance**: OpenAI o1 is faster and accurate but hides intermediate reasoning ("black box" reasoning). DeepSeek-R1 shows full reasoning but is significantly slower.
  - **Cost vs. Control**: DeepSeek-R1 is open-weight (local control, privacy) but requires heavy hardware; OpenAI/Gemini are managed services (higher API cost, no local control).

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **DeepSeek-R1**: Timeouts on ~3% of questions (182 items), indicating resource exhaustion or routing inefficiencies in MoE under specific loads
  - **Gemini/o3-mini**: Lower accuracy on complex differential diagnosis tasks suggests "concise" reasoning may miss nuances

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Latency Profiling**: Run 100-item subset test on local hardware for DeepSeek-R1 to see if 40.4s latency holds or improves with dedicated resources
  2. **Metric Sensitivity Analysis**: Correlate human expert qualitative scores with text-generation metrics to see which metric (e.g., AlignScore vs. ROUGE-L) best predicts human judgment
  3. **Timeout Investigation**: Isolate 182 failed DeepSeek-R1 items to determine if specific question structures trigger MoE routing failure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How do reasoning-focused LLMs perform on real-world ophthalmology tasks beyond multiple-choice questions, such as clinical case vignettes, image interpretation, and treatment planning?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state "the MedMCQA ophthalmological dataset... does not encompass all potential real-world applications and tasks in ophthalmological practice. Thus, future study on the real-world evaluation of these reasoning-focused LLMs is warranted."
- **Why unresolved**: This study only evaluated MCQ exam questions using zero-shot prompts, which may not reflect complexity of actual clinical decision-making involving patient history synthesis, multimodal data, and longitudinal care.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluation on clinical vignettes, fundus image interpretation tasks, electronic health record-based scenarios, and prospective deployment in clinical workflows with outcome tracking.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can robust, quantitative human evaluation frameworks reliably assess LLM reasoning quality across diverse ophthalmology clinical scenarios?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors note "future research should focus on robust, quantitative human evaluations of the LLM's reasonings across varied clinical scenarios, so as to holistically validate their practical utility."
- **Why unresolved**: Current text-generation metrics are ground-truth dependent and may lack context awareness to fully capture reasoning quality. Qualitative evaluation involved only 2 ophthalmologists reviewing 300 differential diagnosis questions.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Development and validation of standardized human evaluation rubrics with larger expert panels, inter-rater reliability assessment, and correlation with clinical outcome measures.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does lack of access to complete intermediate chain-of-thought reasoning in proprietary models (o1, o3-mini) affect clinical interpretability and trust?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state "as OpenAI restricts access to the full intermediate thinking steps of its o1 and o3-mini models, we were only able to examine the model-generated reasoning summaries, rather than their complete internal thinking processes."
- **Why unresolved**: While o1 achieved highest accuracy (0.902), clinicians cannot fully verify reasoning pathway, unlike with DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking which expose detailed intermediate steps.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative user studies with clinicians evaluating trust, error detection capability, and diagnostic confidence when using models with visible versus hidden reasoning chains.

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: What strategies can mitigate trade-offs between reasoning quality, inference speed, and cost for clinical deployment of reasoning-focused LLMs?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] DeepSeek-R1 had longest inference time (40.4s), while Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking was fastest (6.7s). OpenAI models have significantly higher financial costs, with o1 requiring nearly fifteen times the cost of o3-mini.
- **Why unresolved**: No single model excelled across all dimensions; each presents distinct trade-offs that may limit practical deployment in time-sensitive clinical environments.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Studies optimizing hyperparameters, evaluating model distillation techniques, or testing hybrid approaches that route queries to appropriate models based on complexity and urgency.

## Limitations
- **Ground truth quality filtering**: Exclusion of 920 items based on GPT-4o-mini evaluation introduces potential bias that could systematically skew text-generation metrics
- **Timeout handling**: DeepSeek-R1's 182 timeouts (~3%) were excluded without detailed breakdown of whether failures correlate with question complexity or structural features
- **Metric validity**: Sensitivity of text-generation metrics to ground-truth explanation quality remains unverified; noisy or incomplete explanations could disproportionately affect AlignScore and BERTScore

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: OpenAI o1 achieving highest accuracy (0.902) and Macro-F1 (0.900) among evaluated models
- **Medium confidence**: DeepSeek-R1's superior reasoning transparency versus latency tradeoff
- **Low confidence**: Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking's practical viability for complex clinical scenarios

## Next Checks
1. **Ground truth validation audit**: Manually review 50 randomly selected items excluded during GPT-4o-mini filtering to verify automated quality assessment
2. **Timeout pattern analysis**: Isolate and analyze 182 DeepSeek-R1 timeout items to identify structural patterns triggering failures
3. **Clinician relevance correlation**: Conduct blinded expert review comparing model outputs to determine which text-generation metric best predicts clinically useful reasoning quality
