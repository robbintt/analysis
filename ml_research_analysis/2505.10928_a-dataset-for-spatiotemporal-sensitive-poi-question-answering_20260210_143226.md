- Dataset introduces spatiotemporal-sensitive POI QA with real trajectory data and manual validation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces POI-QA, a novel spatiotemporal-sensitive QA dataset designed to evaluate models' ability to reason over both spatial and temporal dimensions in POI-related tasks. The dataset is constructed using real vehicle trajectory data from GAIA and high-precision POI information, with manual validation and bilingual (Chinese/English) QA pair generation. Evaluations on state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B) reveal significant limitations: even the best-performing model (Qwen2.5-7B fine-tuned with RAG+LoRA) achieves only a Hit Ratio (HR@10) of 0.41 on the easiest task, far below human performance at 0.56. The dataset highlights persistent challenges in LLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and serves as a robust benchmark for advancing algorithms in this domain.

## Method Summary
The POI-QA dataset is constructed using real vehicle trajectory data from GAIA combined with high-precision POI information from Gaode Maps. The construction process involves three key steps: (1) spatial-temporal filtering of trajectory data to identify relevant POI visitation patterns, (2) manual question generation by human annotators following predefined spatiotemporal reasoning patterns, and (3) bilingual (Chinese/English) QA pair creation with cross-validation. The dataset covers diverse spatiotemporal reasoning scenarios including sequential POI visits, temporal frequency analysis, and spatial proximity queries. Evaluation is conducted using both automated metrics (HR@10, ROUGE-L) and human assessment across multiple state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.

## Key Results
- Qwen2.5-7B fine-tuned with RAG+LoRA achieves HR@10 of 0.41, significantly below human performance of 0.56
- All evaluated models show substantial performance gaps in complex spatiotemporal reasoning tasks
- The dataset reveals persistent limitations in current LLMs' ability to integrate spatial and temporal information for POI-related queries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its grounding in real-world vehicle trajectory data, which captures authentic spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility and POI interactions. By requiring models to reason across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously, it exposes the limitations of traditional QA approaches that often treat these dimensions separately. The manual validation process ensures high-quality questions that genuinely require spatiotemporal reasoning rather than pattern matching or simple lookup.

## Foundational Learning

**Spatiotemporal Reasoning**: Understanding how spatial and temporal dimensions interact in real-world scenarios. Why needed: POI interactions inherently involve both where and when elements that must be considered together. Quick check: Can the model correctly answer questions about sequential visits to multiple POIs across different time periods?

**Trajectory Data Analysis**: Processing and extracting meaningful patterns from vehicle movement data. Why needed: Real mobility patterns provide authentic spatiotemporal relationships for training and evaluation. Quick check: Does the dataset capture realistic visitation frequencies and temporal distributions of POI interactions?

**Multilingual QA Generation**: Creating questions and answers in multiple languages while maintaining semantic consistency. Why needed: Ensures broader applicability and evaluation across different language contexts. Quick check: Are the Chinese and English versions of questions semantically equivalent and equally challenging?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: GAIA Trajectory Data -> POI Database -> Manual Annotation -> QA Pair Generation -> Model Evaluation

Critical Path: Data Collection (GAIA) -> POI Integration (Gaode Maps) -> Question Generation (Human Annotators) -> Model Testing (LLMs) -> Performance Analysis

Design Tradeoffs: Real trajectory data provides authenticity but limits geographic generalizability; manual annotation ensures quality but introduces potential bias; bilingual approach increases utility but doubles annotation effort.

Failure Signatures: Models struggle with questions requiring integration of multiple temporal intervals; performance drops significantly on queries involving less common spatiotemporal patterns; current approaches fail to capture nuanced spatial relationships beyond simple proximity.

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline models on simplified spatiotemporal queries (single POI, single time period)
2. Test model performance on increasing temporal complexity (multiple time intervals)
3. Assess spatial reasoning capabilities with varying geographic scales (neighborhood vs city-wide)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Geographic focus on Xiamen, China limits generalizability to other urban mobility patterns
- Manual annotation process may introduce human bias in question generation and validation
- Coarse evaluation metrics (HR@10, ROUGE-L) may not capture nuanced spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities
- Limited coverage analysis of spatiotemporal reasoning pattern diversity and edge cases

## Confidence

High confidence in dataset construction methodology and evaluation results showing current LLM limitations.

Medium confidence in the claim that this dataset represents significant advancement for spatiotemporal reasoning research, given limited comparative analysis with existing benchmarks.

Low confidence in the assertion that the dataset will directly improve real-world POI recommendation systems without further practical deployment validation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-regional validation using trajectory data from different cities or countries to assess dataset generalizability and identify potential geographic biases.

2. Perform ablation studies comparing POI-QA performance with existing spatiotemporal QA datasets to quantify its unique contribution to the field.

3. Implement human-in-the-loop evaluation with domain experts to assess practical utility of model responses beyond automated metrics, particularly for complex spatiotemporal reasoning tasks.
