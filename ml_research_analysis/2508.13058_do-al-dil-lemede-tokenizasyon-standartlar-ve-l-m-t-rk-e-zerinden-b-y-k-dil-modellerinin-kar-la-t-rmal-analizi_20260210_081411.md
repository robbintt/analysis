- Introduces novel evaluation framework for tokenization in morphologically-rich languages using Turkish case study

## Executive Summary
This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework for tokenization in morphologically-rich and low-resource languages, with Turkish as the primary case study. The research introduces two novel metrics—language-specific token percentage (TR%) and token purity (Pure%)—designed to assess how effectively tokenizers preserve linguistic structures in morphologically complex languages. The framework is empirically tested using the TR-MMLU dataset containing 6,200 multiple-choice questions, comparing four prominent tokenizers: gemma-2, llama-3.1, Qwen2.5, and aya-expanse. Results demonstrate that language-specific token percentages show stronger correlation with downstream performance metrics than token purity, suggesting that preserving linguistic structures is more critical than other tokenization aspects for model effectiveness.

## Method Summary
The study develops a novel evaluation framework specifically designed for tokenization in morphologically-rich languages. The framework introduces two metrics: language-specific token percentage (TR%) measuring how well tokenizers capture language-specific structures, and token purity (Pure%) assessing the preservation of linguistic integrity. The TR-MMLU dataset, comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions, serves as the benchmark for evaluation. Four tokenizers are compared: gemma-2, llama-3.1, Qwen2.5, and aya-expanse. The evaluation correlates tokenization metrics with downstream performance (MMLU scores) to determine which aspects of tokenization most strongly influence model effectiveness. The study specifically examines whether increasing model parameters translates to better linguistic performance, finding that parameter scaling alone does not guarantee improved tokenization quality.

## Key Results
- Language-specific token percentages (TR%) show stronger correlation with downstream MMLU performance than token purity metrics
- Morphological preservation in tokenization is more critical for model effectiveness than previously recognized
- Increasing model parameters does not guarantee improved linguistic performance in tokenization
- The proposed framework demonstrates robust standards for tokenization evaluation in morphologically complex languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by establishing language-specific metrics that capture the unique challenges of morphologically-rich languages like Turkish, where word formation involves complex agglutination patterns. By measuring how well tokenizers preserve these structures (TR%) and maintain linguistic purity (Pure%), the framework creates a quantitative basis for comparing tokenization approaches beyond traditional metrics. The correlation between TR% and downstream performance validates that morphological preservation directly impacts model effectiveness, making the framework particularly valuable for low-resource languages where linguistic structure preservation is crucial.

## Foundational Learning

**Morphological Agglutination** - Why needed: Understanding how Turkish words combine morphemes is essential for evaluating tokenization effectiveness. Quick check: Verify that TR% metric captures agglutinative patterns rather than breaking them into suboptimal subword units.

**Subword Tokenization Methods** - Why needed: Different tokenizers (BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece) handle morphological complexity differently. Quick check: Confirm that comparison includes tokenizers using diverse tokenization algorithms to ensure comprehensive evaluation.

**Downstream Task Correlation** - Why needed: Establishing relationship between tokenization quality and actual model performance validates the framework's practical utility. Quick check: Ensure statistical significance of correlation between TR% and MMLU scores across multiple evaluation runs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Dataset (TR-MMLU) -> Tokenizers (gemma-2, llama-3.1, Qwen2.5, aya-expanse) -> Metrics (TR%, Pure%) -> Correlation Analysis -> Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path:** Data preprocessing → Tokenizer application → Metric calculation → Performance correlation → Framework validation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes linguistic structure preservation over computational efficiency, potentially limiting real-time applications but ensuring accuracy for low-resource languages.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor correlation between metrics and performance suggests either inadequate dataset representation or metrics that don't capture relevant linguistic features.

**First Experiments:**
1. Apply framework to Finnish and Hungarian datasets to test cross-linguistic validity
2. Compare TR% and Pure% metrics against human linguistic judgments for ground truth validation
3. Test framework sensitivity by introducing controlled noise in morphological structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Framework validation relies heavily on single benchmark dataset (TR-MMLU) and one target language (Turkish)
- Proposed metrics (TR% and Pure%) lack validation against established tokenization standards or human linguistic judgments
- Study does not address computational efficiency trade-offs or practical deployment considerations
- Correlation findings require broader statistical validation across multiple datasets and tasks

## Confidence
High: Framework introduces novel metrics and demonstrates empirical correlation between tokenization quality and performance
Medium: Cross-linguistic generalizability and metric validity require further validation
Low: Computational efficiency and practical deployment considerations not addressed

## Next Checks
1. Replicate evaluation framework across multiple morphologically-rich languages (Finnish, Hungarian, Korean) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies on TR% and Pure% metrics to establish sensitivity and specificity compared to human linguistic judgments
3. Test correlation between tokenization metrics and downstream performance across diverse NLP tasks beyond multiple-choice questions
