# Boosting Explainability through Selective Rationalization in Pre-trained Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.03182
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03182
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: PLMR achieves up to 17% higher F1 scores for rationale selection compared to previous methods using PLMs, and up to 9% higher than methods using GRU

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of applying selective rationalization to pre-trained language models (PLMs), which suffer from severe degeneration and failure problems due to token homogeneity in PLMs. The authors propose Pre-trained Language Model's Rationalization (PLMR), which splits PLMs into a generator and a predictor. The generator uses earlier transformer layers and dimension-reduction layers to select rationales while alleviating token homogeneity, while the predictor uses full-text information to regularize predictions. Experiments on two datasets across multiple PLMs show that PLMR effectively addresses rationalization degeneration and failure problems in PLMs while providing more accurate explanations than existing methods.

## Method Summary
The PLMR framework proposes a novel approach to selective rationalization for pre-trained language models by addressing token homogeneity issues. The method splits the PLM into two components: a generator that uses earlier transformer layers and dimension-reduction layers to select rationales, and a predictor that uses full-text information to regularize predictions. The generator operates on lower-level transformer layers to mitigate token homogeneity, while dimension reduction helps in creating more diverse token representations. The predictor component ensures that the full-text information is utilized to maintain prediction accuracy. This architectural separation allows PLMR to overcome the degeneration and failure problems that plague traditional rationalization approaches when applied to PLMs.

## Key Results
- PLMR achieves up to 17% higher F1 scores for rationale selection compared to previous methods using PLMs
- PLMR achieves up to 9% higher F1 scores than methods using GRU for rationalization
- The method effectively addresses rationalization degeneration and failure problems in PLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PLMR works by addressing the fundamental issue of token homogeneity in pre-trained language models. Traditional rationalization approaches fail when applied to PLMs because the high-level transformer layers produce increasingly similar token representations, making it difficult to distinguish relevant from irrelevant tokens. By splitting the model and using earlier layers for the generator, PLMR leverages the more diverse token representations available at lower levels. The dimension-reduction layers further enhance this diversity, allowing the generator to select more meaningful rationales. The predictor component, which uses full-text information, ensures that the model maintains its predictive accuracy while providing explanations, creating a balance between interpretability and performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Selective rationalization**: A technique for identifying and extracting the most relevant portions of text (rationales) that justify a model's prediction. Why needed: To provide interpretable explanations for model decisions without sacrificing performance.
- **Token homogeneity**: The phenomenon in PLMs where higher transformer layers produce increasingly similar token representations. Why needed: Understanding this issue is crucial for developing effective rationalization methods for PLMs.
- **Generator-predictor architecture**: A two-component model where one part generates explanations and another makes predictions. Why needed: This separation allows for specialized optimization of each component's objectives.
- **Dimension reduction**: Techniques for reducing the dimensionality of token representations. Why needed: Helps mitigate token homogeneity by creating more diverse and interpretable representations.
- **Cross-entropy loss**: A standard loss function for classification tasks. Why needed: Used in the predictor component to maintain prediction accuracy.
- **F1 score**: A metric combining precision and recall. Why needed: Used to evaluate the quality of selected rationales against ground truth annotations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input text -> Lower transformer layers (Generator) -> Dimension reduction -> Rationale selection -> Full text + rationales -> Higher transformer layers (Predictor) -> Prediction output

**Critical path:** The generator must first process the input through lower transformer layers and dimension reduction to create diverse token representations, then select rationales. These rationales, along with the full text, are then processed by the predictor to generate the final prediction.

**Design tradeoffs:** The key tradeoff is between explainability and performance. Using earlier layers for the generator sacrifices some of the rich semantic representations available in higher layers, but this sacrifice is necessary to overcome token homogeneity. The dimension reduction adds computational overhead but is essential for creating diverse representations. The split point between generator and predictor layers must be carefully chosen to balance these competing objectives.

**Failure signatures:** The method may fail if the split point is chosen too early (losing too much semantic information) or too late (not sufficiently addressing token homogeneity). It may also struggle with tasks requiring very long-range dependencies, as the generator only sees lower-level representations. Additionally, the method assumes the availability of ground truth rationales for training, which may not always be available.

**3 first experiments:**
1. Vary the layer split point (l) systematically to identify the optimal balance between generator diversity and predictor performance
2. Compare the token similarity distributions at different layer levels to empirically validate the reduction in token homogeneity
3. Perform ablation studies removing the dimension reduction component to quantify its contribution to performance improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the PLMR framework be effectively adapted for non-classification tasks such as regression and unsupervised clustering?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states: "Although our method... focuses on classification problems... our work can also be applied to other types of tasks, such as regression and unsupervised clustering."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper exclusively evaluates PLMR on sentiment classification (binarized labels). The current loss functions and regularization terms (e.g., cross-entropy) are designed for discrete labels, and it is unclear if the "homogeneity" analysis holds for continuous outputs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results on regression datasets (e.g., aspect rating prediction with continuous scores) showing that PLMR maintains high fidelity and rationale quality compared to baseline methods.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the selection of precise rationales via PLMR inherently provide robustness against adversarial attacks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion identifies a future direction: "Investigating whether PLMR can provide robustness to adversarial attacks by selecting precise rationales is also significant research in future."
- **Why unresolved:** While PLMR prunes "irrelevant tokens" to aid explainability, the paper does not test if this pruning mechanism filters out adversarial perturbations or if the model remains vulnerable via the rationale tokens themselves.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative robustness evaluations (e.g., accuracy under textfooler or other attack methods) between PLMR and standard PLMs to see if rationale selection acts as a defensive mechanism.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the layer-splitting and dimension-reduction strategy of PLMR scale efficiently to Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state: "We plan to explore LLM explainability in future work."
- **Why unresolved:** PLMR requires splitting the model into a generator and predictor and training dimension-reduction layers. Applying this architectural modification to massive LLMs presents unknown challenges regarding computational cost and the preservation of emergent abilities.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation of PLMR on an LLM architecture (e.g., LLaMA), demonstrating that the method improves explainability without causing catastrophic forgetting or prohibitive training overhead.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Is there a theoretical or automated method to determine the optimal split point $l$ (generator layers) for different model architectures without manual search?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 6.3.3 empirically varies $l$ (layers 1-11) to find the "balance" (optimal at $l=7$ for BERT-base), implying the optimal point is currently found via resource-intensive grid search rather than a principled heuristic.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper links the split to "token heterogeneity" but does not provide a fixed rule or formula to predict the optimal $l$ for a new model (e.g., does the split scale linearly with model depth?).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A derivation or heuristic (e.g., based on the variance-covariance trace analysis used in the paper) that consistently identifies the layer where token homogeneity begins to degrade rationale quality across multiple distinct PLM architectures.

## Limitations
- The method requires ground truth rationales for training, limiting applicability to tasks without annotated explanations
- The optimal split point between generator and predictor must be determined empirically through grid search, which is computationally expensive
- The approach has only been validated on two datasets, raising questions about generalization to other NLP tasks and domains

## Confidence
- **PLMR architecture effectiveness**: Medium - Strong empirical results but limited ablation and generalization analysis
- **Token homogeneity mitigation**: Low - Mechanism described but not empirically validated beyond performance gains
- **General superiority over existing methods**: Medium - Results impressive but dataset-limited and lacking comparative simplicity analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies testing alternative layer selections for the generator and predictor components to isolate architectural contributions
2. Evaluate PLMR across 3-5 additional diverse NLP datasets to assess generalization beyond the two reported tasks
3. Compare PLMR against simplified variants that apply selective masking or regularization to existing rationalization methods without full architectural changes
