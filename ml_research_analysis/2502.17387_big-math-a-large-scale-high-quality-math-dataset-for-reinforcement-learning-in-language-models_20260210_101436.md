# Big-Math: A Large-Scale, High-Quality Math Dataset for Reinforcement Learning in Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.17387
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17387
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 250,000+ high-quality math problems with rigorous filtering achieving >90% precision/recall

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Big-Math, a large-scale dataset of over 250,000 high-quality math problems specifically designed for reinforcement learning in language models. The dataset addresses key limitations in existing math datasets by focusing on problems with uniquely verifiable solutions, open-ended formulations, and closed-form answers. The authors developed a comprehensive filtering pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification to ensure quality standards. Additionally, they created Big-Math-Reformulated, a novel subset of 47,000 problems converted from multiple-choice to open-ended formats.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a rigorous filtering pipeline to extract math problems meeting three key desiderata: uniquely verifiable solutions, open-ended formulations, and closed-form answers. Using human-in-the-loop verification, they achieved over 90% precision and recall in their filtering process. The dataset was created by sourcing problems from existing repositories and applying multiple filtering stages including automated checks and human validation. A novel reformulation component converted multiple-choice problems into open-ended formats while preserving mathematical integrity. The dataset spans diverse mathematical domains and includes problems of varying difficulty levels.

## Key Results
- Dataset contains over 250,000 high-quality math problems with >90% precision/recall in filtering
- Big-Math-Reformulated subset includes 47,000 problems converted from multiple-choice to open-ended format
- Dataset enables more effective RL training compared to existing smaller or lower-quality alternatives
- Problems span diverse mathematical domains with varying difficulty levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its rigorous quality filtering that ensures problems have uniquely verifiable solutions and closed-form answers, making them suitable for RL training where clear reward signals are essential. The human-in-the-loop approach maintains high precision while the automated components enable scalability. The reformulation of multiple-choice problems to open-ended formats expands the problem space while maintaining mathematical rigor.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training paradigm where agents learn through trial-and-error with reward feedback; needed because traditional supervised learning doesn't capture the iterative problem-solving process in mathematics
- **Open-ended vs Multiple-choice**: Open-ended problems require generation of solutions rather than selection; needed because RL requires environments where actions (solution steps) can be evaluated independently
- **Verifiable Solutions**: Mathematical problems where correctness can be algorithmically checked; needed because RL requires clear reward signals to guide learning
- **Closed-form Answers**: Solutions expressed as explicit formulas rather than iterative approximations; needed because they provide definitive correctness criteria for training signals
- **Dataset Curation**: Process of selecting and filtering data for training; needed because raw collected data often contains noise and inconsistencies unsuitable for RL
- **Problem Reformulation**: Converting problem formats while preserving mathematical meaning; needed to expand available problem sets and create more challenging training scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Data Sources -> Automated Filtering -> Human Verification -> Quality Control -> Big-Math Dataset

**Critical Path**: Data Collection → Filtering Pipeline → Human Review → Quality Assessment → Dataset Assembly

**Design Tradeoffs**: The authors balanced dataset size against quality by implementing strict filtering criteria that reduced the initial problem pool but ensured higher quality. They chose to reformulate multiple-choice problems to increase open-ended content, trading some potential solution ambiguity for more diverse training data.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor filtering could result in problems without unique solutions, making RL training unstable. Inadequate human verification might allow incorrect problems to pass through. Reformulation errors could introduce solution ambiguity or mathematical errors. Domain imbalance could lead to biased mathematical reasoning capabilities.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test RL training performance using Big-Math versus traditional supervised learning on standard math datasets
2. Evaluate model generalization across difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard) within Big-Math
3. Compare solution accuracy rates between original multiple-choice problems and their reformulated open-ended versions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Quality assessment relies heavily on human verification without detailed metrics on annotator expertise or inter-rater reliability
- Reformulation process from multiple-choice to open-ended problems lacks systematic validation for mathematical equivalence
- Domain coverage analysis doesn't demonstrate balanced representation across mathematical fields

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Dataset Size and Basic Structure | High |
| Filtering Pipeline Effectiveness | Medium |
| Problem Quality and Diversity Claims | Low |
| RL Training Effectiveness Claims | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent expert review of 500 randomly sampled problems to verify >90% precision claims and assess actual problem quality
2. Perform systematic analysis of problem distribution across mathematical domains to validate diversity claims and identify representation gaps
3. Run controlled RL experiments comparing model performance when trained on Big-Math versus existing datasets, measuring both final performance and training efficiency metrics
