# V2P-Bench: Evaluating Video-Language Understanding with Visual Prompts for Better Human-Model Interaction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.17736
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17736
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Visual prompts improve model performance and user experience over text-only prompts, but top models still achieve only 71.8% accuracy versus human expert 88.3%

## Executive Summary
V2P-Bench introduces a new evaluation framework for video-language models that uses visual prompts (bounding boxes, arrows, etc.) to provide precise spatial and temporal references, addressing limitations of text-only prompts. The benchmark includes 980 videos and 1,172 QA pairs across 5 tasks and 12 dimensions, focusing on instance-level fine-grained understanding. Experiments with 15 models reveal that visual prompts significantly improve both model performance and user experience compared to text prompts. The study also uncovers widespread "hack behaviors" where models rely on linguistic priors rather than visual evidence, particularly with longer videos and lower frame sampling rates.

## Method Summary
V2P-Bench is an evaluation-only benchmark that assesses video-language models using multiple-choice QA across 12 dimensions of understanding. The framework uses 980 videos from 12 public datasets and 1,172 QA pairs, with visual prompt frames (rectangle, arrow, scribble, etc.) placed after sampled video frames. Models are evaluated using accuracy metrics, with baseline blind LLMs scoring below 10% to verify question quality. The benchmark tests models under varying frame rates (4-128 frames) to analyze "hack phenomena" and includes both open-source and closed-source models with different frame sampling strategies.

## Key Results
- Visual prompts significantly improve model performance over text-only prompts, with Gemini-2.5-Pro dropping 15.1% when visual prompts are converted to text
- Top models like o1 achieve only 71.8% accuracy, far below human experts at 88.3%, revealing current limitations in spatiotemporal understanding
- "Hack phenomena" intensify with longer videos and lower frame sampling rates, with models achieving up to 33.8% accuracy on shuffled video-question pairs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spatial Disambiguation via Visual Overlays
Visual prompts (e.g., bounding boxes, arrows) reduce referential ambiguity inherent in text-only prompts, allowing models to bypass complex natural language grounding. Text prompts require decoding descriptions like "the person on the left in the blue shirt" into specific visual regions, while visual prompts provide direct spatial masks overlaid on frames. The vision encoder must treat these overlays as distinct feature signals rather than noise, and the LLM connector must preserve this spatial-signature.

### Mechanism 2: Exposing "Hack Phenomena" via Information Scarcity
The benchmark reveals that LVLMs often rely on linguistic priors rather than visual evidence, behavior exposed when video length increases but frame sampling density decreases. As visual evidence becomes unavailable, models default to LLM-based hallucination or "test-taking" strategies. This occurs because models prioritize generating plausible linguistic responses over verifying visual grounding, likely reinforced by instruction-tuning on datasets where visual context is redundant.

### Mechanism 3: Temporal Consistency via Instance Tracking
Evaluating instance-level understanding stresses the model's ability to maintain object permanence across frames, distinct from global scene captioning. V2P-Bench requires associating a visual prompt in one frame with the same entity in temporally distant frames, requiring feature extraction from the prompted region and tracking across subsequent frames. This requires correspondence matching or token tracking across frames rather than averaging frame-level features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Visual Grounding (Referential Expression)**: Models must map visual regions to semantic concepts. Understanding this is crucial because visual prompts invert or simplify this traditional grounding process.
  - *Quick check question:* Does your model identify "the car" by global scene features or by bounding box coordinates?

- **Frame Sampling Strategies (Uniform vs. Keyframe)**: "Hack phenomena" and performance drops are directly linked to frame sampling density. Understanding the tradeoff between context window limits and temporal granularity is critical for interpreting results.
  - *Quick check question:* If you sample 4 frames from a 2-hour video, can the model plausibly answer a question about a 5-second event?

- **Instruction Tuning vs. Visual Alignment**: The paper attributes "hacking" to models being trained as "instruction-following agents." Distinguishing between following prompt format versus extracting visual truth is central to the critique.
  - *Quick check question:* If you feed a model a blank image but a detailed text question, does it refuse or invent an answer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Video + Visual Prompt Frame) -> Vision Encoder (processes frames with overlay) -> Projector (maps to LLM space) -> LLM (generates answer) -> Evaluator (accuracy + Hack Ratio)
- **Critical path:** Visual Prompt Encoding is critical. The system must correctly identify the visual overlay as a distinct token or attention mask within the vision encoder. If treated as noise, subsequent temporal reasoning fails immediately.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Sampling Rate: High sampling (128 frames) improves temporal reasoning but increases compute; low sampling (4 frames) induces "hacking"
  - Prompt Type: Rectangles (high info density) perform better than Arrows (low info density) or Doodles (unstable boundaries)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Hack" Response: High accuracy on shuffled videos indicates model not using visual inputs
  - Temporal Drift: High Basic Perception but low Object Direction scores indicates failure to track objects across time
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Blind Baseline Test: Run V2P-Bench QA pairs through model without video inputs. If accuracy >0%, questions contain biases or model is hallucinating.
  2. Sampling Rate Ablation: Evaluate long videos using 4, 16, 64, 128 frames to verify correlation between frame count and Hack Ratio.
  3. Prompt Type Comparison: Replace rectangle prompts with doodle-style prompts to test reliance on precise geometric features vs. general region saliency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can LVLMs be trained or constrained to proactively refuse to answer or request clarification when visual context is insufficient, thereby mitigating "Hack Phenomena"?
- **Basis:** Section 4.2 states models should proactively request clarification when visual context is insufficient.
- **Why unresolved:** Paper identifies open-ended evaluation reduces hacking but introduces subjectivity without proposing concrete MCQ mechanisms.
- **Evidence needed:** Training methodology or decoding strategy that significantly lowers Hack Ratio without degrading performance.

### Open Question 2
What architectural modifications are required to improve fine-grained spatiotemporal understanding, specifically for dynamic tasks like Object Direction and Spatial Relationship?
- **Basis:** Section 4.2 notes models struggle with spatiotemporal understanding, achieving significantly lower scores on Object Direction (23.1%) compared to static tasks.
- **Why unresolved:** Current models rely on transferring image-level understanding without robust mechanisms for tracking trajectories or dynamic spatial changes.
- **Evidence needed:** Model architecture achieving performance parity between Basic Perception and Temporal Understanding tasks.

### Open Question 3
How does the inclusion of audio modality and support for interruptible, multi-turn dialogue impact the effectiveness of visual prompts in real-time human-model interaction?
- **Basis:** Section H lists lack of audio input and support only for offline videos as limitations, with plans for "V2P-Bench v2" incorporating full-modality inputs.
- **Why unresolved:** Current benchmark evaluates static, offline interactions; utility of visual prompts in streaming, multi-modal environments remains unmeasured.
- **Evidence needed:** Evaluation results from benchmark extending V2P-Bench with audio tracks and streaming video inputs.

## Limitations
- Benchmark relies on multiple-choice formats that may artificially constrain assessment of model reasoning capabilities
- 1,172 question set represents relatively small sample size for drawing definitive conclusions across all 12 dimensions
- Visual prompt effectiveness claims lack comprehensive analysis of whether models truly understand spatial references or simply learn to attend to highlighted regions

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (Mechanism 1 - Spatial Disambiguation): Experimental evidence showing substantial accuracy drops when converting visual prompts to text descriptions provides strong support. Controlled comparisons across prompt types and consistent performance improvements across multiple models establish this robustly.

**Medium Confidence** (Mechanism 2 - Hack Phenomena): Paper provides compelling evidence through controlled experiments with shuffled videos and varying frame rates, but exact causal mechanisms remain partially speculative. Attribution to instruction-tuning effects is plausible but not definitively proven through ablation studies.

**Medium Confidence** (Mechanism 3 - Temporal Consistency): Performance gaps between basic perception and object direction tasks support temporal tracking claim, but paper lacks detailed analysis of how different models implement spatiotemporal reasoning. Evidence is suggestive but could benefit from architectural analysis.

## Next Checks

1. **Blind Model Architecture Analysis**: Conduct systematic study varying model architectures (single-stream vs. dual-stream) and training regimes (pretraining vs. instruction tuning) to isolate whether "hack phenomena" stems from architectural design choices or training data biases.

2. **Open-Ended Response Validation**: Implement open-ended response version of V2P-Bench to determine whether multiple-choice formats artificially constrain model behavior. Compare performance and failure modes between MCQ and free-response formats.

3. **Visual Prompt Robustness Testing**: Systematically vary visual prompt quality (precise vs. imprecise boundaries, different shapes, occlusion levels) to determine whether models rely on exact geometric features or general region saliency.
