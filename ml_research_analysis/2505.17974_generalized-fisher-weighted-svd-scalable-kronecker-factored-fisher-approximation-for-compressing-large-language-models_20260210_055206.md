# Generalized Fisher-Weighted SVD: Scalable Kronecker-Factored Fisher Approximation for Compressing Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17974
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17974
- Reference count: 15
- Proposed GFWSVD method achieves 6% higher accuracy than ASVD, 3% higher than SVD-LLM, and 5% higher than FWSVD at 20% compression on MMLU benchmark.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of compressing large language models (LLMs) by proposing Generalized Fisher-Weighted SVD (GFWSVD), which improves upon existing approaches by capturing both diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the Fisher information matrix. Unlike prior methods that use diagonal approximations and ignore parameter correlations, GFWSVD employs a Kronecker-factored approximation to capture row- and column-wise dependencies within weight matrices. The authors introduce a scalable adaptation that reduces computational complexity from quartic to cubic in weight matrix size. Experiments on BERT and LLaMA 2 models show consistent improvements over existing compression methods across multiple benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The proposed GFWSVD method extends Fisher-Weighted SVD by incorporating Kronecker-factored approximations of the Fisher information matrix to capture both diagonal and off-diagonal parameter correlations. The method computes a weighted SVD where weights are derived from the Fisher matrix, but uses a Kronecker decomposition to make the computation tractable for large matrices. The key innovation is a scalable algorithm that reduces the computational complexity from O(n⁴) to O(n³) for weight matrices of size n×n. This is achieved by approximating the Fisher matrix as a Kronecker product of smaller matrices representing row and column dependencies, then computing the SVD on these compressed representations. The approach maintains the benefits of Fisher weighting while being computationally feasible for modern LLMs.

## Key Results
- GFWSVD consistently outperforms existing compression methods including FWSVD, SVD-LLM, and ASVD across BERT and LLaMA 2 models.
- At 20% compression rate on MMLU benchmark, GFWSVD achieves 6% higher accuracy than ASVD, 3% higher than SVD-LLM, and 5% higher than FWSVD.
- The method demonstrates robust performance across multiple evaluation benchmarks including GLUE and MMLU.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by capturing the full structure of parameter importance through Kronecker-factored Fisher approximation rather than relying on diagonal approximations that ignore parameter correlations. By decomposing the Fisher matrix into Kronecker products of row and column factors, the method can represent both local (within rows/columns) and global (across the entire matrix) parameter relationships. This enables more informed rank selection during compression, preserving the most task-relevant parameters while achieving higher compression ratios. The scalable algorithm makes this approach computationally feasible for large language models where traditional Fisher-based methods would be intractable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Fisher Information Matrix**: Measures the expected information that an observable random variable carries about an unknown parameter. Why needed: Provides a theoretically grounded way to measure parameter importance for compression. Quick check: Verify that gradients are properly accumulated to estimate the FIM.
- **Kronecker Product**: A mathematical operation that creates a block matrix from two smaller matrices. Why needed: Enables decomposition of large matrices into tractable smaller components. Quick check: Confirm Kronecker decomposition correctly approximates the original Fisher matrix.
- **Low-Rank Matrix Approximation**: Technique to approximate a matrix using fewer singular values/vectors. Why needed: Core mechanism for model compression while preserving important information. Quick check: Validate that truncated SVD preserves task performance.
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Factorization of a matrix into three components (U, Σ, V). Why needed: Fundamental operation for rank-based compression. Quick check: Ensure proper truncation of singular values during compression.
- **Computational Complexity Analysis**: Evaluation of algorithmic efficiency in terms of operations required. Why needed: Demonstrates scalability advantage over existing methods. Quick check: Verify complexity claims through empirical timing experiments.
- **Layer-wise Compression**: Independent compression of each layer in a neural network. Why needed: Practical approach for deep networks, though potentially suboptimal. Quick check: Compare layer-wise vs joint compression performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Weight Matrix → Kronecker Fisher Approximation → Weighted SVD → Compressed Weight Matrix

**Critical Path**: The most computationally intensive step is computing the Kronecker-factored Fisher approximation, which involves gradient accumulation and matrix operations. This must be optimized for scalability, followed by the weighted SVD computation which is relatively straightforward once weights are computed.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades some approximation accuracy (rank-1 Kronecker) for computational efficiency. Higher-rank approximations would capture more structure but increase computational cost quadratically. The layer-wise approach simplifies implementation but misses cross-layer dependencies that could improve compression.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor compression performance may indicate: 1) Insufficient gradient samples for accurate FIM estimation, 2) Kronecker approximation too coarse to capture important structure, or 3) Rank selection too aggressive, removing task-critical parameters.

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare GFWSVD against FWSVD, SVD-LLM, and ASVD on a single BERT layer with varying compression rates to establish baseline improvements. 2) Perform ablation study removing Kronecker factors to quantify their contribution. 3) Test on a small weight matrix (<1000 parameters) to verify theoretical complexity advantages before scaling up.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can utilizing a higher-rank Kronecker series approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix capture richer task-relevant information and improve compression performance over the current rank-1 approximation?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states that the reliance on a "rank-1 Kronecker approximation of the Fisher matrix may oversimplify important structure" and suggests future work could explore "higher-rank Kronecker series."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation is restricted to a rank-1 approximation to balance computational efficiency with approximation accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments evaluating the trade-off between the increased computational cost of higher-rank approximations and the resulting gains in downstream task accuracy (e.g., MMLU, GLUE).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can joint compression strategies that account for cross-layer dependencies improve model performance compared to the current per-layer approach?
- Basis in paper: The limitations section identifies the "lack of coordination across layers" as a key constraint and suggests future work should focus on "modeling these interactions to enable joint compression strategies."
- Why unresolved: The current method assumes layer independence (block-diagonal FIM), optimizing compression for each layer individually without considering transitive correlations across the network.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of a global compression objective that optimizes rank allocation or decomposition across multiple layers simultaneously, compared against the current layer-wise results.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the GFWSVD framework be enhanced by integrating activation-based signals, similar to KFAC schemes, to further refine parameter importance estimates?
- Basis in paper: The related work section notes that while the method is structure-driven, it is "potentially compatible with these activation-based refinements" and states that "integrating such signals... is a promising direction we leave for future work."
- Why unresolved: The authors focused on a "clean evaluation setting" using only gradient information to isolate the contributions of their Kronecker-factorization approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies combining GFWSVD's Fisher-weighting with activation-aware weighting mechanisms (e.g., from ASVD or SVD-LLM) on the same model architectures.

## Limitations
- The scalability benefits are based on theoretical complexity reduction from quartic to cubic, but practical computational overhead on extremely large matrices (>10K dimensions) is not fully characterized.
- The method's performance on model architectures beyond BERT and LLaMA 2 remains unverified, limiting generalizability claims.
- The impact on inference latency and memory footprint post-compression is not discussed, which are critical factors for practical deployment.

## Confidence
- **Core theoretical contribution (Kronecker-factored Fisher approximation)**: High confidence - the mathematical framework is well-established and the algorithmic adaptations are clearly described.
- **Empirical performance improvements**: Medium confidence - while improvements are consistent across experiments, the evaluation focuses on accuracy metrics without comprehensive ablation studies or analysis of failure modes.
- **Scalability benefits**: Low confidence - the complexity claims are theoretical; empirical scaling behavior on truly large matrices is not demonstrated.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on Kronecker factors**: Systematically evaluate the contribution of row-wise vs. column-wise Kronecker factors to determine whether both are necessary for the reported improvements.
2. **Memory and latency characterization**: Measure actual memory usage and inference time for compressed models compared to baselines to validate practical deployment benefits.
3. **Scaling experiment**: Test the method on a weight matrix with dimensions exceeding 10,000 to empirically verify the claimed cubic complexity advantage over quartic methods.
