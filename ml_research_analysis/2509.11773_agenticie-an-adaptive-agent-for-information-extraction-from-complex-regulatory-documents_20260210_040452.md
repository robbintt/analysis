# AgenticIE: An Adaptive Agent for Information Extraction from Complex Regulatory Documents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.11773
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11773
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: AgenticIE achieves 16-26% improvements over GPT-4o baselines on EU construction regulation document extraction

## Executive Summary
AgenticIE is an adaptive agent system designed to extract key information from complex Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents mandated by EU regulations. These documents contain critical construction product specifications but present significant challenges due to their varied layouts, structures, and multilingual nature. The system addresses these challenges through a domain-specific agentic architecture that dynamically adapts to user intent and document modality, outperforming standard LLM approaches on both Key Information Extraction and Question Answering tasks.

## Method Summary
The AgenticIE system employs a planner-executor-corresponder pattern to handle the variability and complexity of regulatory documents. The architecture consists of three core components: a planner that interprets user intent and decomposes tasks, an executor that processes document modalities (text, images, or both) to extract information, and a corresponder that validates and refines extracted data. The system operates in two modes - Document-to-Text (D2T) for direct information extraction and Question Answering (QA) for user queries. A novel high-density dataset of 80 multilingual DoP documents with over 15,000 expert annotations was created to train and evaluate the system.

## Key Results
- AgenticIE achieves Exact Match (EM) score of 0.396, outperforming GPT-4o (0.342) by 16% and GPT-4o-V (0.314) by 26%
- The system demonstrates strong performance across both Key Information Extraction and Question Answering tasks
- Dataset includes 80 multilingual (English/German) documents with 174 pages and 15,000+ annotations, averaging 190+ annotations per document

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The agentic architecture's effectiveness stems from its adaptive approach to handling document variability. Unlike static LLMs that struggle with diverse layouts and structures, AgenticIE's planner dynamically interprets user intent and selects appropriate extraction strategies. The executor processes different document modalities based on available content, while the corresponder ensures validation and refinement of extracted information. This multi-component approach allows the system to handle the inherent heterogeneity of regulatory documents more effectively than monolithic LLM solutions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents**: Standardized EU regulatory documents containing construction product specifications - needed for understanding domain context; quick check: verify document structure matches EU Regulation 305/2011 requirements
- **Agentic system architecture**: Multi-component AI systems with specialized roles (planner, executor, corresponder) - needed for adaptive information processing; quick check: confirm each component handles its designated function without overlap
- **Document modality processing**: Handling text-only, image-only, or multimodal documents - needed for extracting information from varied document formats; quick check: test system performance across different modality combinations
- **Exact Match (EM) evaluation**: Metric measuring exact string matching between predictions and ground truth - needed for quantifying extraction accuracy; quick check: calculate EM scores for sample predictions against annotations
- **Multilingual document processing**: Extraction from documents in multiple languages (English/German) - needed for regulatory compliance across EU member states; quick check: validate language-specific performance metrics
- **High-density annotation**: Dense labeling schemes with multiple annotations per document - needed for comprehensive evaluation; quick check: verify annotation density averages 190+ per document

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Query -> Planner -> Executor (Text/Image/Both) -> Corresponder -> Output

**Critical Path:**
1. User query interpretation by Planner
2. Task decomposition and strategy selection
3. Document modality analysis by Executor
4. Information extraction based on selected modality
5. Validation and refinement by Corresponder
6. Final output generation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The agentic architecture trades computational overhead for adaptability. While monolithic LLMs offer faster processing, AgenticIE's component-based approach provides superior handling of document variability at the cost of increased complexity. The system prioritizes accuracy over speed, with each component adding processing time but improving extraction quality.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Planner failures manifest as incorrect task decomposition or strategy selection
- Executor failures occur when document modality is misidentified or processing pipeline errors
- Corresponder failures result in validation errors or refinement inaccuracies
- System-wide failures typically stem from poor query interpretation or document preprocessing issues

**First Experiments:**
1. Test planner accuracy on varied user query types to ensure proper task decomposition
2. Validate executor performance across different document modality combinations
3. Evaluate corresponder effectiveness in catching and correcting extraction errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Dataset limited to English and German languages, restricting multilingual generalizability
- Domain-specific focus on EU construction regulations may not transfer to other regulatory contexts
- Evaluation compared only against basic LLM baselines rather than specialized information extraction systems
- System performance drops significantly on documents with complex layouts or poor image quality

## Confidence
- AgenticIE performance superiority: Medium
- Planner-Executor-Corresponder architecture effectiveness: Medium
- Dataset representativeness for real-world applications: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing AgenticIE against established information extraction frameworks (e.g., SpaCy, Stanford CoreNLP) on the same dataset
2. Test the system on documents from other regulatory domains (pharmaceutical, financial) to evaluate domain transfer capabilities
3. Perform error analysis on the 60.4% of cases where EM scores are not achieved to identify systematic failure patterns and architectural bottlenecks
