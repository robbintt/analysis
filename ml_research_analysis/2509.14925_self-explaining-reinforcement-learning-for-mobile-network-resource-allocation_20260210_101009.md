# Self-Explaining Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Network Resource Allocation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14925
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14925
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Introduces self-explaining RL using SENNs with PPO for interpretable mobile network resource allocation, achieving competitive performance with local/global explanations

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a self-explaining reinforcement learning approach for mobile network resource allocation using Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENNs) integrated with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The method provides interpretable local explanations through relevance scores and effect vectors, while global explanations are extracted via effect distributions and clustering. The approach demonstrates performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining explainability, with a focus on stability-constrained feature attribution through Lipschitz continuity enforcement.

## Method Summary
The method combines PPO with a SENN actor network that uses an identity conceptizer (passing raw features through) and a trainable bias aggregator. The SENN outputs relevance scores θ(x) for each feature-action pair, which are combined with the state and bias to produce action distributions. A robustness loss term enforces Lipschitz continuity, ensuring stable explanations by constraining how much relevance scores can change with small input perturbations. Global explanations are extracted through effect distributions and K-means clustering of effect vectors, revealing distinct policy strategies. The framework is evaluated on a mobile network resource allocation task with 3 UEs and 3 base stations.

## Key Results
- SENN-PPO achieves episodic returns of approximately 1,250 across 2M timesteps, comparable to PPO baseline and outperforming heuristic methods
- Local explanations demonstrate stable relevance scores with Lipschitz constant estimates of approximately 1.1-1.2
- Clustering reveals distinct policy strategies, with clusters showing action purity above 0.6 threshold
- Bias-augmented SENNs outperform regular SENNs, with bias values exposing model preferences for specific actions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Stability-Constrained Feature Attribution
- Claim: The model generates stable local explanations by explicitly penalizing erratic changes in feature relevance scores during training.
- Mechanism: A robustness loss term ($L_\theta$) forces the gradient of the model output with respect to the input to approximate the learned relevance scores ($\theta(x)$). This effectively binds the model's sensitivity to specific features, ensuring that small input perturbations do not drastically alter the explanation.
- Core assumption: The optimization landscape allows the model to converge on accurate relevance scores that genuinely reflect feature importance rather than simply satisfying the linearity constraint via artifact.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The method achieves a Lipschitz constant estimate of approximately 1.1-1.2, indicating stable local explanations."
  - [section III]: "L_theta... guarantees that relevance scores behave linearly locally, imposing local stability... indifference of relevance score values to small changes."
  - [corpus]: [SymbXRL] and [Enhancing Interpretability...] support the general trend of enforcing constraints for reliable attributions, though specific Lipschitz constraints for SENN are unique to this paper's cited lineage.
- Break condition: If the robustness loss factor ($\lambda$) is set too high, the model over-regularizes and predictive performance degrades significantly (see Fig. 7).

### Mechanism 2: Disentangling Action Modes via Clustering
- Claim: Global policy behavior is clarified by clustering local effect vectors, revealing distinct "strategies" (e.g., connecting to a base station due to high SNR vs. connecting due to proximity to another station).
- Mechanism: The method aggregates local effect vectors ($E_i = \theta(x_i) \odot x$) using K-means. By analyzing centroids of clusters with high "purity" (dominated by a single action), engineers can inspect the typical input-feature interactions that trigger specific actions, bypassing the ambiguity of simple averaging.
- Core assumption: The state space can be segmented into distinct regions where linear approximations (effect vectors) are sufficient to represent the policy's logic.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV.C]: "Clustering complements the effect distributions by providing a representative input samples for each action... Every centroid reflects a typical activation."
  - [section VI.C]: "Cluster 9 positively weighs connection to BS2... While cluster 10 emphasises the utility."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence for *clustering effect vectors* specifically in related XRL papers; this appears to be a methodological contribution specific to this work.
- Break condition: If the policy is highly stochastic or the state space is chaotic, clusters will have low purity (low $\tau$), making centroids unrepresentative of specific actions.

### Mechanism 3: Bias-Augmented Expressivity
- Claim: Introducing a trainable bias vector in the aggregator restores predictive capacity and exposes the model's systemic preference for certain actions.
- Mechanism: Standard SENNs (inner product $\theta(x)^T x$) may lack the flexibility to model baseline action probabilities independent of input features. The modified aggregator ($f'(x) = \theta(x)^T x + b$) decouples the feature-based reasoning from the base rate, allowing the bias $b$ to serve as a global explanation of action propensity.
- Core assumption: The optimal policy includes a significant "intercept" term (base action preference) that cannot be efficiently encoded in the feature relevance scores alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV.A]: Equation 5 modifies the aggregator to include bias $b$.
  - [section VI.A]: "Biased SENNs outperform regular SENNs... Bias value [Table II] exposes model biases towards actions."
  - [corpus]: Standard RL architectures typically use bias terms; related XRL papers do not explicitly discuss the *interpretability* trade-off of removing/adding bias in this specific architecture.
- Break condition: If the bias term grows too large relative to the relevance term, the model effectively ignores input features, becoming a trivial constant policy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Lipschitz Continuity**
  - Why needed here: This is the mathematical proxy for "explanation stability." You cannot trust a relevance score if it fluctuates wildly with minor input noise.
  - Quick check question: If I perturb the input SNR by 1%, does the relevance score change by less than $K$% (where $K$ is the Lipschitz constant)?

- Concept: **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - Why needed here: PPO is the underlying "black box" RL algorithm being augmented. Understanding the Actor-Critic split is necessary to know *where* the SENN is inserted (The Actor).
  - Quick check question: In this architecture, does the SENN predict the Value function or the Action probabilities? (Answer: Action probabilities/Policy).

- Concept: **Identity Conceptizer**
  - Why needed here: Standard SENNs use neural networks to extract "concepts" from raw data (e.g., pixels). This paper uses an Identity function because the inputs (SNR, Utility) are already human-readable concepts.
  - Quick check question: Does the conceptizer reduce dimensionality in this paper? (Answer: No, it passes features through directly).

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - State $x$ -> Parametrizer (MLP) -> Relevance $\theta(x)$ -> Aggregator ($f(x) = \theta(x)^T x + b$) -> Action Distribution

- Critical path:
  1. Input State $x$ enters.
  2. Parametrizer (DNN) outputs Relevance $\theta(x)$.
  3. Aggregator computes $f(x) = \theta(x)^T x + b$.
  4. PPO uses $f(x)$ to sample actions and compute loss.
  5. **Robustness Loss** $L_\theta$ is calculated simultaneously to constrain $\theta$.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **$\lambda$ (Robustness Loss Factor)**: Increasing $\lambda$ improves explanation stability (lowers Lipschitz constant) but degrades reward/accuracy. You must tune this on a validation set.
  - **Identity vs. Learned Conceptizer**: Using Identity preserves semantic meaning of features (SNR is SNR) but limits the model's ability to discover complex latent variables.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Constant Relevance**: If $\lambda$ is too high, relevance scores flatten out; the model explains everything as "equally important" to satisfy the stability constraint.
  - **Bias Dominance**: If the bias vector values are significantly larger than the $\theta(x)^T x$ term, the model has learned a hardcoded policy and is ignoring the environment state.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sanity Check**: Train a Biased-SENN agent with $\lambda=0$. Verify it matches standard PPO performance (proving the architecture can learn).
  2. **Stability Sweep**: Run ablation on $\lambda$ (e.g., 0.0, 0.001, 0.1). Plot Episodic Reward vs. Lipschitz Estimate to find the "elbow" of the trade-off curve.
  3. **Global Verification**: Run the clustering method on the trained agent. Check if "Action: Connect to BS1" clusters align with high "SNR BS1" relevance (does the explanation make physical sense?).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do human stakeholders subjectively rate the utility and cognitive relief of SENN-generated explanations compared to standard post-hoc methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that "the method of evaluating provided explanations, especially its subjective evaluation, should be more rigid, for instance, by conducting survey research."
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation relies on proxy metrics (Lipschitz constants) and comparison with post-hoc attribution methods (GradSHAP, DeepLift) rather than direct human assessment of interpretability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from a controlled user study measuring human interpretation speed, accuracy, and trust when using SENN explanations versus post-hoc explanations for the resource allocation task.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the Self-Explaining Reinforcement Learning framework maintain performance and stability when applied to high-variance environments or problems with higher dimensionality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion suggests that "SENNs could be applied on a larger array of RL problems, especially high variance ones similar to mobile-env."
- Why unresolved: The current study is restricted to a specific low-dimensional resource allocation problem (13-element input vector) to ensure the identity conceptizer is valid.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing the SENN-PPO agent's performance and Lipschitz stability when trained on environments with high-dimensional state spaces (e.g., image-based inputs) or significantly higher reward variance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the methods for extracting global explanations be refined to reduce vagueness and visual complexity while maintaining correctness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "The proposed methods for extraction of global explanations performed reasonably well but did not achieve particularly strong results," specifically citing the "vagueness" of Effect Distributions and the "higher visual complexity" of clustering.
- Why unresolved: Current global extraction relies on simple averaging (Effect Distributions) or clustering centroids, which sometimes disagree with established post-hoc baselines or obfuscate the model's behavior.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of a global explanation aggregation technique that aligns more closely with post-hoc attributions (correctness) while presenting a simplified view of feature contributions (explicitness).

## Limitations

- Limited hyperparameter transparency: Exact neural network architectures and PPO hyperparameters are unspecified, making exact replication challenging
- Narrow evaluation scope: Restricted to single mobile network environment with only 3 base stations and 3 user equipment, limiting generalizability
- Clustering method limitations: Purity threshold appears arbitrary without sensitivity analysis, and clustering-based explanations lack rigorous validation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using SENNs within PPO for interpretable RL is well-founded, drawing from established self-explaining neural network literature. The mathematical formulation of the robustness loss and its connection to Lipschitz continuity is sound.

**Medium Confidence**: The performance claims (comparable to PPO baseline) are reasonable given the architecture, but the exact margin and conditions under which SENN-PPO matches or exceeds baselines remain unclear without full hyperparameter disclosure.

**Low Confidence**: The clustering-based global explanations and their interpretation, while methodologically interesting, lack rigorous validation. The claim that clustered effect vectors reveal distinct "strategies" is plausible but not definitively proven across diverse scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary λ (robustness loss factor) and PPO hyperparameters to quantify their impact on the performance-explainability trade-off curve, particularly focusing on the knee point where stability gains diminish.

2. **Generalization Testing**: Evaluate the trained SENN-PPO agent on modified environments with different numbers of base stations and user equipment to assess whether the interpretable explanations remain coherent and useful in scaled scenarios.

3. **Ablation on Bias Term**: Conduct an ablation study comparing Biased vs. Unbiased SENNs across multiple λ values to definitively measure the impact of the bias vector on both predictive performance and the interpretability of relevance scores.
