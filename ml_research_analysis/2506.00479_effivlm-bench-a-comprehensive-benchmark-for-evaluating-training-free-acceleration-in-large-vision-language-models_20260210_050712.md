# EffiVLM-BENCH: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Training-Free Acceleration in Large Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00479
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00479
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces a benchmark for evaluating training-free acceleration methods in large vision-language models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents EffiVLM-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation framework for training-free acceleration methods in large vision-language models (LVLMs). The benchmark systematically assesses both token compression and parameter compression techniques across diverse model architectures, benchmarks, and metrics including performance, generalization, loyalty, and efficiency. The work fills a critical gap in the evaluation of LVLM efficiency by providing standardized assessment protocols for compression methods like FastV, VisionZip, PruMerge+, and various KV cache compression approaches.

The benchmark reveals that parameter compression methods (EcoFLAP, Wanda, AWQ, GPTQ) generally preserve performance more effectively than token compression, even at higher compression ratios. Token compression performance is highly task-dependent and sensitive to both benchmark choice and model architecture, with KV cache methods typically outperforming token pruning in generalization and loyalty. These findings provide practical insights into the trade-offs between performance and efficiency in LVLM deployment.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates training-free acceleration methods by testing them across multiple LVLM architectures using standardized datasets and evaluation metrics. The assessment framework measures performance degradation, generalization capabilities, loyalty to original model behavior, and computational efficiency gains. Methods are categorized into token compression (including FastV, VisionZip, PruMerge+, and KV cache compression) and parameter compression (EcoFLAP, Wanda, SparseGPT, AWQ, GPTQ). The evaluation spans diverse vision-language tasks to capture the varying effectiveness of acceleration techniques across different application scenarios.

## Key Results
- Parameter compression methods consistently preserve LVLM performance better than token compression across compression ratios
- Token compression effectiveness is highly dependent on specific benchmarks and LVLM architectures
- KV cache compression methods generally outperform token pruning in generalization and loyalty metrics
- Optimal acceleration strategies are task-specific, with no universal best approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by systematically isolating and measuring the impact of different compression strategies on LVLM performance across multiple dimensions. By evaluating both token-level and parameter-level compression methods on standardized tasks and metrics, the framework reveals how different acceleration approaches affect model behavior. The inclusion of loyalty metrics ensures that compressed models maintain consistent behavior with their uncompressed counterparts, while generalization assessments reveal how well acceleration methods preserve performance on unseen data.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Token Compression vs Parameter Compression**: Why needed - These represent fundamentally different approaches to model acceleration with distinct trade-offs. Quick check - Does the method reduce the number of tokens processed or the model parameters themselves?

2. **KV Cache Compression**: Why needed - Attention mechanisms in transformers create memory bottlenecks that can be addressed through cache compression. Quick check - Does the method optimize the key-value cache during inference rather than the model architecture?

3. **Loyalty Metrics**: Why needed - Performance alone doesn't capture whether a compressed model behaves consistently with the original. Quick check - Does the evaluation measure behavioral consistency beyond raw accuracy?

4. **Generalization Assessment**: Why needed - Acceleration methods must preserve model performance on unseen data, not just training benchmarks. Quick check - Are evaluation datasets held out from training and validation sets?

5. **Attention Sink Tokens**: Why needed - Certain tokens can disproportionately influence attention patterns and model behavior. Quick check - Does the method identify or preserve specific attention-critical tokens?

6. **Layer-Adaptive Sparsity**: Why needed - Different layers in transformers have varying importance for overall model performance. Quick check - Does the compression strategy vary sparsity levels across different transformer layers?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> LVLM Architecture -> Acceleration Method -> Performance Metrics -> Efficiency Metrics

**Critical Path**: The evaluation pipeline processes input data through the LVLM, applies acceleration methods, then measures performance degradation, generalization loss, loyalty changes, and efficiency gains across standardized benchmarks.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The benchmark balances comprehensive evaluation against practical feasibility by focusing on post-training compression methods while acknowledging that training-aware optimization could yield different results. The choice of metrics reflects both academic rigor and practical deployment concerns.

**Failure Signatures**: Methods showing high performance retention but poor loyalty indicate optimization for specific metrics rather than consistent behavior. Large variations across benchmarks suggest overfitting to particular task characteristics rather than robust acceleration.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Apply FastV compression to a small LVLM and measure performance degradation across 3-5 representative vision-language tasks
2. Compare EcoFLAP and Wanda parameter compression at 2x and 4x compression ratios using the same model and benchmarks
3. Evaluate KV cache compression against token pruning on a streaming inference task to measure real-time efficiency gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Benchmark results show significant variability across LVLM architectures, limiting generalizability of conclusions
- Evaluation focuses primarily on post-training compression, excluding training-aware optimization strategies
- Performance patterns are highly task-dependent, suggesting results may not transfer reliably to new deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence: Parameter compression methods consistently preserve performance better than token compression
- Medium confidence: Task-dependent nature of token compression effectiveness across benchmarks and models
- Low confidence: Claim that KV cache compression universally outperforms token pruning for generalization and loyalty

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-architecture validation by applying the same acceleration methods to additional LVLM families beyond those tested
2. Implement ablation studies isolating the impact of attention sink tokens and layer-adaptive sparsity mechanisms
3. Test benchmark methods on temporally extended or streaming scenarios to validate real-time deployment advantages
