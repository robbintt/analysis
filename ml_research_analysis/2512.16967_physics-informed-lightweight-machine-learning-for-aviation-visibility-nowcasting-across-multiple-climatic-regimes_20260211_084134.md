# Physics-Informed Lightweight Machine Learning for Aviation Visibility Nowcasting Across Multiple Climatic Regimes
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.16967
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16967
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** 2.5-4.0x higher recall than TAFs in tactical nowcasting of aviation visibility events

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a physics-informed, lightweight machine learning framework using XGBoost to nowcast aviation visibility events across 11 international airports with diverse climates. The method employs 14 METAR-derived features based on thermodynamic, kinematic, and radiative principles and is trained locally per station without manual configuration. In blind tests against operational TAF forecasts at tactical horizons (e.g., +3 hours), the model achieved 2.5 to 4.0 times higher recall while reducing false alarms, notably detecting 85.0% fewer un-warned IFR events at SCEL. SHAP analysis confirmed the model implicitly captures physical drivers like advection and radiation, supporting situational awareness. The approach is computationally trivial, enabling edge deployment, and is robust across a decade of data.

## Method Summary
The framework uses XGBoost with 14 physics-informed features derived from METAR reports, capturing thermodynamic, kinematic, and radiative processes relevant to visibility degradation. Models are trained locally per airport using historical data, eliminating the need for manual tuning or expert meteorological input. The approach emphasizes interpretability through SHAP analysis, allowing meteorologists to understand which physical drivers contribute to predictions. The lightweight architecture enables deployment on edge computing devices while maintaining accuracy across diverse climatic regimes.

## Key Results
- Achieved 2.5 to 4.0 times higher recall than operational TAF forecasts for visibility events
- Reduced false alarms significantly, with 85.0% fewer un-warned IFR events at SCEL
- Demonstrated robust performance across 11 airports spanning diverse climatic regimes over a decade

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by integrating fundamental physical principles directly into feature engineering rather than relying on black-box approaches. By deriving 14 features from thermodynamic, kinematic, and radiative principles using METAR data, the model captures the essential drivers of visibility degradation. Local station training allows the model to learn airport-specific microclimates while maintaining the physics-informed feature structure. The XGBoost algorithm's ability to handle non-linear relationships and feature interactions enables accurate prediction while SHAP analysis provides interpretability, allowing meteorologists to validate predictions against known physical processes.

## Foundational Learning
- **METAR meteorological reports**: Standardized aviation weather observations providing essential visibility and atmospheric data
  - *Why needed*: Source of high-quality, standardized visibility observations and atmospheric variables
  - *Quick check*: Verify METAR format compliance and data completeness across stations
- **Thermodynamic principles**: Temperature, dew point, and moisture relationships governing fog formation
  - *Why needed*: Physical basis for understanding when and why visibility deteriorates
  - *Quick check*: Validate feature engineering correctly captures temperature-dew point spreads
- **Kinematic processes**: Wind patterns and atmospheric advection affecting visibility distribution
  - *Why needed*: Determines transport and persistence of visibility-reducing phenomena
  - *Quick check*: Ensure wind features capture directional patterns relevant to local topography

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: METAR data -> Feature engineering (14 physics-informed features) -> XGBoost model -> SHAP analysis -> Predictions
- **Critical path**: Data collection and preprocessing -> Feature engineering -> Model training -> Validation against TAFs -> Interpretability analysis
- **Design tradeoffs**: Local training maximizes accuracy for specific airports but requires separate models per location; physics-informed features enhance interpretability but may miss novel patterns; lightweight architecture enables edge deployment but may limit complexity
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance in convective events, hemispheric transfer limitations, potential overfitting to local patterns without physical justification
- **3 first experiments**:
  1. Compare feature importance rankings across different climatic regimes
  2. Test model performance on progressively shorter tactical horizons
  3. Evaluate sensitivity to feature engineering variations while holding model architecture constant

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions: generalizability to convective and rapidly evolving visibility hazards, the potential benefits of incorporating high-temporal-resolution satellite or radar data, and the framework's performance consistency when deployed across different hemispheres and climate zones beyond the current sample.

## Limitations
- Framework shows reduced effectiveness for convective events with rapid visibility changes
- Performance validation limited to 11 airports primarily in Northern Hemisphere
- Exclusion of sub-hourly satellite and radar data may limit detection of rapidly evolving events

## Confidence
- **Core claims (recall improvement, false alarm reduction)**: High
- **Scalability and interpretability assertions**: Medium
- **Edge-level computational efficiency**: High
- **Generalizability to diverse climates**: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on convective-prone airports with frequent thunderstorm-related visibility disruptions
2. Validate performance using sub-hourly satellite and radar inputs to assess detection of rapidly evolving events
3. Conduct cross-hemispheric deployment trials to evaluate performance consistency in Southern Hemisphere and tropical climates
