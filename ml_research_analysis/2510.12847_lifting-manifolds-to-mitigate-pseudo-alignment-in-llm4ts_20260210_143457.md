core_contribution: The paper identifies pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS models as arising
  from the interplay of the cone effect in pretrained LLM components and the low-dimensional
  manifold of time-series data. It introduces TimeSUP, a novel technique that mitigates
  this issue by increasing the dimensionality of time-series representations to better
  match language embeddings, thereby enabling the model to distinguish temporal signals
  while preserving shared structures across modalities.

# Lifting Manifolds to Mitigate Pseudo-Alignment in LLM4TS

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12847
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12847
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TimeSUP mitigates pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS by increasing time-series dimensionality, achieving consistent performance gains across multiple forecasting datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in large language model for time-series (LLM4TS) forecasting: pseudo-alignment between time-series and language embeddings. The authors identify that pretrained LLM components create a "cone effect" that, combined with the low-dimensional manifold structure of time-series data, leads to poor model performance. To resolve this, they introduce TimeSUP, a technique that lifts the dimensionality of time-series representations to better match language embeddings. The method demonstrates consistent improvements over state-of-the-art LLM4TS approaches and lightweight baselines across multiple long-term forecasting datasets, with average MSE reductions of approximately 11% on the Illness dataset and 2% on ETTh1.

## Method Summary
TimeSUP addresses pseudo-alignment by transforming low-dimensional time-series embeddings into higher-dimensional representations that better align with pretrained language model embeddings. The approach leverages the geometric properties of both time-series manifolds and language embeddings to create representations that preserve temporal signal while enabling better cross-modal alignment. By increasing the dimensionality of time-series data, TimeSUP helps the model distinguish temporal signals more effectively while maintaining shared structures across modalities. The technique is designed to be easily integrated into existing LLM4TS pipelines without requiring architectural overhauls.

## Key Results
- TimeSUP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and lightweight baselines across multiple long-term forecasting datasets
- Achieves average MSE reduction of approximately 11% on the Illness dataset and 2% on ETTh1 compared to baseline approaches
- Demonstrates effective mitigation of pseudo-alignment issues in LLM4TS through dimensionality lifting of time-series representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of TimeSUP stems from addressing the fundamental mismatch between time-series and language embeddings. Pretrained LLM components create a "cone effect" in the embedding space, while time-series data naturally forms lower-dimensional manifolds. This geometric misalignment causes the model to struggle distinguishing temporal signals from shared structures across modalities. By lifting the dimensionality of time-series representations, TimeSUP creates embeddings that better match the structure of language embeddings, enabling the model to preserve temporal information while maintaining cross-modal compatibility. This dimensionality matching allows the model to leverage the rich semantic understanding of language models while preserving the unique characteristics of time-series data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cone effect in language models**: Describes how pretrained LLM components create a specific geometric structure in embedding space that can interfere with time-series representation - needed to understand why standard LLM4TS approaches struggle with temporal data, quick check: examine embedding geometry of frozen LLM layers
- **Manifold learning**: The study of how high-dimensional data often lies on or near lower-dimensional manifolds - essential for understanding the intrinsic dimensionality of time-series data, quick check: verify intrinsic dimensionality of test datasets
- **Cross-modal alignment**: The challenge of aligning representations from different data modalities (text vs. time-series) in a shared embedding space - critical for LLM4TS success, quick check: measure alignment quality between modalities
- **Dimensionality matching**: The principle that representation spaces should have compatible dimensionalities for effective learning - fundamental to TimeSUP's approach, quick check: compare dimensionality requirements across datasets
- **Pseudo-alignment**: The phenomenon where different modalities appear aligned in embedding space but lack meaningful correspondence - the core problem TimeSUP addresses, quick check: test for pseudo-alignment before and after TimeSUP application

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Input time-series -> TimeSUP dimensionality lifting -> Aligned embeddings -> LLM backbone -> Forecasting head

Critical path:
The critical path involves the TimeSUP module transforming raw time-series embeddings into higher-dimensional representations that properly align with the frozen LLM components. This transformation must preserve temporal signal while creating embeddings compatible with the language model's geometric structure. The quality of this alignment directly determines forecasting accuracy.

Design tradeoffs:
- Higher dimensionality improves alignment but increases computational cost
- Preservation of temporal signal vs. adaptation to language model geometry
- Integration complexity vs. performance gains
- Frozen LLM parameters vs. trainable time-series adaptation

Failure signatures:
- Poor alignment persists despite dimensionality lifting
- Temporal signal degradation during transformation
- Computational overhead outweighs performance benefits
- Overfitting to specific dataset characteristics

First experiments:
1. Measure intrinsic dimensionality of time-series datasets to verify manifold structure assumptions
2. Test TimeSUP with different dimensionality increases to find optimal balance
3. Compare forecasting performance with and without TimeSUP on held-out validation sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The cone effect mechanism analysis is primarily based on LLaMA models and may not generalize to all language model architectures
- Evaluation scope is limited to a small set of datasets that may not represent the full diversity of real-world time-series forecasting challenges
- While performance improvements are demonstrated, ablation studies could be more extensive to isolate the precise contribution of dimensionality matching
- Theoretical claims about manifold learning benefits are supported by geometric intuition but lack rigorous mathematical proof linking dimensionality to forecasting accuracy

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: TimeSUP consistently outperforms baseline methods on the tested datasets and provides measurable improvements in forecasting accuracy
- **Medium Confidence**: The cone effect is a primary driver of pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS, though the universality across different LLM architectures requires further validation
- **Medium Confidence**: Dimensionality matching between time-series and language embeddings is necessary for optimal performance, though the exact relationship needs more empirical exploration

## Next Checks
1. Test TimeSUP across a broader range of LLM backbones (e.g., GPT variants, Mistral) to verify cone effect universality and performance consistency
2. Conduct extensive ablation studies isolating the contribution of dimensionality matching from other architectural components in TimeSUP
3. Evaluate TimeSUP on additional time-series forecasting datasets with varying characteristics (seasonality, noise levels, temporal dependencies) to assess robustness across diverse scenarios
