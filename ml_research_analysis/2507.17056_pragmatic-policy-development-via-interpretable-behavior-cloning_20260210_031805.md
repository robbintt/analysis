# Pragmatic Policy Development via Interpretable Behavior Cloning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17056
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17056
- Reference count: 29
- Interpretable policies derived from most common treatments outperform current practice in RA and sepsis datasets

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of developing interpretable and reliably evaluable treatment policies for clinical decision-making using observational data. The authors propose pragmatic policy development via interpretable behavior cloning, where target policies are derived from the most frequently chosen treatments in each patient state, as estimated by an interpretable behavior policy model. They use decision trees to model the behavior policy, leveraging their natural ability to group patients based on treatment patterns.

In experiments with rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis datasets, policies derived under this framework—specifically those based on the single most common treatment—are estimated to outperform current clinical practice. These interpretable policies show lower variance in off-policy evaluation estimates compared to reinforcement learning approaches, with substantially higher effective sample sizes (406.1 vs 3.0-7.3 for RA). The approach offers a practical alternative that captures collective clinical expertise while maintaining transparency and evaluation reliability.

## Method Summary
The method fits an interpretable behavior policy model using decision trees to capture treatment patterns across patient states. A meta-estimator approach decomposes treatment decisions into whether to switch treatment and what treatment to switch to, improving model accuracy. Target policies are then constructed by selecting the top-k most common treatments from the behavior policy for each patient state. Off-policy evaluation uses importance sampling, with effective sample size computed to assess evaluation reliability. The approach is evaluated on rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis datasets, comparing interpretable policies against current clinical practice and reinforcement learning baselines.

## Key Results
- Interpretable policies based on most common treatments (k=1) estimated to outperform current clinical practice
- Effective sample sizes for interpretable policies: 406.1 (RA) and 64.1 (sepsis) vs 3.0-7.3 (RL policies) for RA
- MC policies achieve better value estimates with lower variance than RL approaches in off-policy evaluation
- Decision tree behavior policy models achieve 94.9 AUROC on RA data with meta-estimator variant

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Tree-based behavior policy models provide interpretability by partitioning patients into clinically meaningful subgroups with similar treatment patterns.
- Mechanism: Decision trees recursively split the state space based on covariates, creating leaf nodes where patients share similar propensity scores pμ(At|St). Each leaf represents a homogeneous subgroup where treatment variation reflects practice patterns rather than confounding (if state captures confounders).
- Core assumption: The state representation St includes all confounders that causally affect both treatment and outcome.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By using a tree-based model, which is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural grouping of states with respect to treatment."
  - [Section 3] "Each leaf node groups patients with similar propensity scores... If the state St fully captures all confounding variables, the variation in At within each leaf... reflects practice variation among clinicians that does not stem from confounding."
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; neighboring papers focus on RL optimization rather than interpretability mechanisms.
- Break condition: If state St omits key confounders, leaf-level treatment variation may reflect bias rather than legitimate practice variation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Deriving target policies from the most frequent actions under the behavior policy ensures higher effective sample size (ESS) for off-policy evaluation compared to RL-derived policies.
- Mechanism: The target policy π selects from Top-k(st; μ̂), guaranteeing pπ(a|s) > 0 only when pμ(a|s) > 0. This maintains overlap, preventing importance sampling weights from exploding. ESS is computed as (∑wi)²/∑wi², and remains high when target and behavior policies align.
- Core assumption: Importance sampling estimators require overlapping support between target and behavior policies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "interpretable policies show lower variance in off-policy evaluation estimates compared to reinforcement learning approaches, with substantially higher effective sample sizes (406.1 vs 3.0-7.3 for RA)"
  - [Table 2] MC (k=1) ESS: 406.1 for RA, 64.1 for sepsis vs. RL policies with ESS 1.7-19.3
  - [corpus] Consistent with "Mildly Conservative Regularized Evaluation" noting distribution shift causes OOD overestimation.
- Break condition: If k is set too low in sparse data regions, some state-action pairs may have insufficient support even within Top-k.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Separating treatment switching prediction from treatment selection improves behavior policy accuracy when patients often continue the same treatment.
- Mechanism: A meta-estimator uses two trees: (1) binary classifier for p(switch|St), (2) multi-class classifier for p(treatment|St, switch=1). Final probability combines: p(At=k|St) = (1-psμ(St))·1[k=at-1] + psμ(St)·p̃tμ(k|St). This prevents the previous-treatment variable from dominating and creating redundant subtrees.
- Core assumption: Treatment decisions decompose naturally into "whether to switch" then "what to switch to."
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4] "The previous-treatment variable, At-1, dominates the left branch... Many of the same decision rules are repeated across subtrees, leading to unnecessary model complexity."
  - [Table 1] DT-BLS achieves 94.9 AUROC vs. 92.0 for standard DT on RA data.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support; neighboring papers do not address this decomposition.
- Break condition: For acute conditions with continuous treatment adjustment (e.g., sepsis), the switch/continue decomposition is less natural; Table 1 shows minimal improvement for sepsis.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) via importance sampling
  - Why needed here: The paper's central claim depends on showing that interpretable policies have higher ESS than RL policies in OPE. Understanding how importance weights relate to policy overlap is essential.
  - Quick check question: Given behavior policy μ(a|s)=0.1 for all actions and target policy π(a|s)=1.0 for one action, what happens to the importance weight when π's chosen action differs from the observed action?

- Concept: Propensity score and confounding in observational data
  - Why needed here: The framework assumes state St captures all confounders; tree leaves group patients by propensity score. Without this understanding, you cannot assess when the approach is valid.
  - Quick check question: If unmeasured confounders exist, what bias could appear in outcome-guided policy (MC+O) value estimates?

- Concept: Behavior cloning vs. reinforcement learning objective
  - Why needed here: This paper positions behavior cloning as a practical alternative to offline RL. Understanding why BC is simpler but potentially limited helps evaluate tradeoffs.
  - Quick check question: Why does behavior cloning not require reward signals during training, and what limitation does this create?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing -> Behavior policy model -> Target policy constructor -> OPE evaluator

- Critical path:
  1. Fit behavior policy meta-estimator on training split
  2. Calibrate probabilities (sigmoid calibration)
  3. For each k ∈ {1,2,3}, construct MC and MC+O target policies
  4. Evaluate on held-out test set using WIS; compute ESS

- Design tradeoffs:
  - k=1 (deterministic): Maximum interpretability, highest ESS, but may miss better treatments
  - k>1 (stochastic): More flexible, lower variance in sepsis, but requires clinician to choose among k options
  - MC+O vs MC: Incorporates outcomes but assumes no unmeasured confounding within leaves; higher variance estimates

- Failure signatures:
  - Low ESS (<10% of trajectories): Target policy deviates too far from behavior; increase k
  - Identical performance across k values: Behavior policy model may be poorly calibrated or state representation inadequate
  - Large confidence intervals on MC+O: Potential unmeasured confounding; fall back to MC only

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate behavior policy modeling comparison (DT vs DT-S vs DT-BLS) on a held-out validation fold; verify AUROC and calibration metrics match Table 1 ranges.
  2. Construct MC policies with k=1,2,3 and compute WIS value estimates plus ESS; confirm ESS decreases as k decreases and that k=1 achieves ESS >50 for both datasets.
  3. Fit at least one offline RL baseline (BCQ or CQL) and compare ESS against MC policies; verify the paper's claimed ESS gap (order of magnitude difference).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the presence of unmeasured confounders specifically bias the estimated value of the outcome-guided (MC+O) policy compared to the most-common (MC) policy?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 6 that if unmeasured confounders exist within the leaves of a fully grown tree, the estimated value of the outcome-guided policy "may be biased upwards."
  - Why unresolved: The paper assumes the state includes all confounders, but this is often impossible to verify in real-world observational data.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analyses on semi-synthetic datasets where latent confounders are artificially introduced to measure the resulting bias in MC+O estimates.

- Question: Can Doubly Robust (DR) estimators significantly reduce the high variance observed in the outcome-guided (MC+O) policies to make them reliably evaluable?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 notes the study focused exclusively on importance sampling and suggests that "Doubly robust methods... could help reduce the variance of value estimates."
  - Why unresolved: The outcome-guided policies showed promising value estimates but suffered from high variance (low ESS), and DR methods were not tested in the experiments.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Applying DR estimators to the MC+O policies in the RA and sepsis datasets to determine if Effective Sample Size (ESS) increases without introducing unacceptable bias.

- Question: In cases where sparse decision trees fit the data unsatisfactorily, can prototype-based models provide better behavior policy estimation while maintaining interpretability?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 states, "there may be cases where these models fit the data unsatisfactorily... Prototype-based models may offer a better solution in such cases."
  - Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to tree-based models; the performance of prototype-based approaches was hypothesized but not demonstrated.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring the calibration error and AUROC of prototype networks versus decision trees on complex clinical datasets where tree performance is suboptimal.

## Limitations
- Proprietary RA dataset prevents full reproducibility
- Strong assumptions about state representation completeness and behavior policy model quality
- MC+O variant's unmeasured confounding assumption is untested in practice
- Empirical advantage of MC policies over RL may reflect evaluation bias rather than true performance differences

## Confidence
- High confidence: Behavior policy modeling approach (mechanism and empirical results clearly supported)
- Medium confidence: ESS advantage over RL (strong empirical support but potential evaluation bias concerns)
- Medium confidence: Clinical utility claims (outperformance of current practice plausible but requires prospective validation)

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce sepsis behavior policy modeling**: Reimplement DT-BLS on publicly available MIMIC-III sepsis data; verify AUROC and SCE metrics match paper's Table 1 ranges.
2. **Validate ESS computation**: Implement importance sampling with ESS calculation; confirm k=1 policies achieve ESS >50 while RL policies show ESS <20 on both datasets.
3. **Test unmeasured confounding sensitivity**: Construct synthetic datasets with hidden confounders; compare MC vs MC+O performance to quantify robustness to confounding violations.
