# VICoT-Agent: A Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework for Interpretable Multimodal Reasoning and Scalable Remote Sensing Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.20085
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20085
- **Authors:** Chujie Wang; Zhiyuan Luo; Ruiqi Liu; Can Ran; Shenghua Fan; Xi Chen; Chu He
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** VICoT framework achieves 65% token reduction and 48% latency improvement in multimodal remote sensing reasoning while maintaining interpretability

## Executive Summary
VICoT-Agent introduces a Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought framework that dynamically integrates visual tool outputs into reasoning chains for interpretable multimodal reasoning in remote sensing. The framework uses a stack-based structure with modular MCP-compatible tools to enable multi-round vision-language interleaved reasoning. To address deployment challenges, the authors propose Reasoning Stack Distillation, fine-tuning smaller models like Qwen3-14B on reasoning traces generated by GPT-4o. Experiments on five remote sensing datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art frameworks while reducing computational requirements for edge deployment.

## Method Summary
The VICoT framework addresses multimodal reasoning challenges in remote sensing by interleaving visual tool outputs with chain-of-thought reasoning. It employs a stack-based architecture where each reasoning step can invoke visual tools (object detection, image cropping, super-resolution, enhancement, etc.) and incorporate their outputs into subsequent reasoning steps. The framework uses a Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool suite with 10 modular tools that can be dynamically invoked based on the reasoning context. For lightweight deployment, Reasoning Stack Distillation fine-tunes smaller models on reasoning traces generated by GPT-4o, enabling efficient inference on consumer GPUs with only 12 GB of VRAM. The approach includes Region-Aware Captioned Prompting for handling ultra-high-resolution images through tiling and region-specific descriptions.

## Key Results
- **Performance gains:** 65% reduction in token consumption and 48% latency improvement compared to baseline frameworks
- **Tool invocation accuracy:** 94.3% accuracy on tool selection and parameter generation tasks
- **Distilled model efficiency:** Qwen3-14B achieves strong performance with only 12 GB VRAM using AWQ 4-bit quantization
- **Interpretability:** Significantly higher reasoning transparency and report quality than existing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by tightly coupling visual perception with reasoning through interleaved tool invocation. Rather than treating vision and language as separate modules, VICoT dynamically decides when to use visual tools based on the current reasoning state, allowing the model to "see" relevant information exactly when needed. The stack-based structure maintains complete reasoning traces, enabling both interpretability and efficient distillation. By generating high-quality reasoning traces with GPT-4o and fine-tuning smaller models on these traces, the approach transfers complex reasoning capabilities to more deployable models without sacrificing performance.

## Foundational Learning

**MCP Tool Protocol** - Standardized interface for tool integration; needed for modular tool management and dynamic invocation; quick check: verify XML tool definitions parse correctly
**Stack-based Reasoning** - Maintains complete reasoning trace as LIFO structure; needed for interpretability and error recovery; quick check: ensure stack operations preserve reasoning context
**Region-Aware Captioning** - Divides ultra-high-res images into regions with localized descriptions; needed for handling images larger than model context; quick check: confirm tile coverage matches original image dimensions
**AWQ Quantization** - Activation-aware weight quantization for efficient inference; needed for reducing VRAM requirements; quick check: verify 4-bit quantized model maintains performance
**Parallel Stack Pooling** - Maintains multiple reasoning paths with heuristic scoring; needed for exploring alternative reasoning strategies; quick check: validate heuristic scoring function prioritizes correct paths
**Vision-Language Interleaving** - Alternates between tool invocation and language reasoning; needed for context-aware tool usage; quick check: confirm tool outputs are properly incorporated into reasoning

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Query → Stack Manager → Tool Selection → MCP Tools → Tool Outputs → Reasoning Update → Answer Generation

**Critical Path:** Query Reception → Stack Initialization → Vision-Language Loop (Tool Invocation → Output Processing → Context Update) → Answer Synthesis → Tool Accuracy Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** VICoT trades some inference speed for interpretability and accuracy by maintaining complete reasoning traces and enabling multi-round tool invocation, whereas baseline models prioritize speed over transparency

**Failure Signatures:** Tool invocation failures due to invalid parameters (out-of-bounds coordinates, incorrect file paths); XML parsing errors from malformed tool outputs; redundant tool calls with identical parameters

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement basic stack-based reasoning loop with single tool (object detection) and verify correct stack operations
2. Test MCP tool suite integration with groundingDINO and validate tool output incorporation
3. Evaluate reasoning accuracy on simple VICoT-HRSC samples before full fine-tuning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for Qwen3-14B distillation are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Parallel-stack pool width selection criteria lack rigorous justification and systematic evaluation
- Region-Aware Captioned Prompting implementation details are conceptually described but lack specific parameter values
- Generalizability to domains beyond tested remote sensing datasets remains unproven

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Core VICoT framework architecture and stack-based reasoning approach
- **Medium confidence:** Performance metrics and comparative results against baselines
- **Low confidence:** Fine-tuning details for distillation and specific implementation parameters

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the parallel-stack pool width selection heuristic with different values of W_t to determine optimal performance
2. Conduct ablation studies on the Region-Aware Captioning Prompting method with varying tile sizes and confidence thresholds
3. Validate the framework's performance on additional remote sensing datasets beyond the five tested to assess generalizability
