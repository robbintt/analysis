# Teach Me Sign: Stepwise Prompting LLM for Sign Language Production

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10972
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10972
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: First method using off-the-shelf LLM for sign language production via stepwise prompting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TEAM-Sign, a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to produce sign language videos without requiring gloss supervision. The key innovation is a stepwise prompting strategy that extracts the LLM's internal knowledge of sign language to guide generation. By encoding sign videos into discrete tokens using VQ-VAE and mapping them to spoken language through LLM reasoning, the method bridges the modality gap between sign and spoken language. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines on Phoenix14T and How2Sign datasets.

## Method Summary
TEAM-Sign employs a stepwise prompting strategy to extract LLM knowledge for sign language production. Sign videos are first encoded into discrete tokens via VQ-VAE, then mapped to spoken language using the LLM's reasoning capabilities. Auxiliary sequences are generated through carefully designed prompts to improve alignment between sign and spoken language representations. This approach eliminates the need for gloss supervision by leveraging the LLM's internal understanding of sign language structure and semantics.

## Key Results
- Outperforms strong baseline by 18.7% in BLEU score on Phoenix14T dataset
- Achieves 20.9% improvement in DTW-MJE metric on How2Sign dataset
- Demonstrates effective bridging of sign-spoken language modality gap through LLM reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the LLM's internal knowledge structure and reasoning capabilities to map between sign and spoken language modalities. The stepwise prompting strategy extracts latent sign language knowledge embedded within the LLM, which is then used to guide the generation process. This approach bypasses the need for explicit gloss supervision by tapping into the model's implicit understanding of sign language semantics and syntax.

## Foundational Learning
- **VQ-VAE encoding**: Converts continuous sign video data into discrete tokens; needed for bridging continuous video data with discrete LLM processing; quick check: verify tokenization preserves essential sign features
- **Stepwise prompting**: Sequentially extracts and applies LLM knowledge; needed for controlled knowledge extraction without overwhelming the model; quick check: validate prompt effectiveness through ablation studies
- **Discrete token mapping**: Aligns sign video tokens with spoken language representations; needed for creating a common representation space; quick check: ensure bidirectional consistency between modalities

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Sign Video -> VQ-VAE Encoder -> Discrete Tokens -> LLM Reasoning -> Generated Sign Output
- **Critical path**: Video encoding through VQ-VAE is the bottleneck for real-time applications
- **Design tradeoffs**: Discrete tokens lose fine-grained spatial/temporal details vs. improved computational efficiency
- **Failure signatures**: Poor alignment between sign and spoken language outputs indicates LLM knowledge gaps
- **First experiments**: 1) Baseline VQ-VAE-only generation, 2) LLM-only text-to-sign generation, 3) Ablation of stepwise prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on LLM's internal knowledge without external validation of sign accuracy
- Discrete token approach may lose crucial fine-grained temporal and spatial details
- Evaluation metrics measure alignment rather than actual sign language comprehension

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Technical implementation of stepwise prompting and quantitative performance improvements
- Medium Confidence: LLM reasoning effectively bridges sign-spoken language modality gap
- Low Confidence: Discrete token representations capture sufficient sign language expressiveness for practical applications

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies with sign language users to assess naturalness and comprehensibility of generated signs
2. Test approach across multiple sign languages to evaluate generalization beyond Phoenix14T and How2Sign datasets
3. Perform ablation studies removing LLM reasoning components to quantify stepwise prompting contribution
