# Reproducibility: The New Frontier in AI Governance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11595
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11595
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Low reproducibility standards in AI research undermine effective governance

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies low reproducibility standards in AI research as a critical bottleneck for effective governance. The authors propose stricter reproducibility protocols—including preregistration, improved statistical power, and negative result reporting—as essential tools for policymakers. By analyzing reproducibility crises in economics, cancer biology, and psychology, they demonstrate how irreproducible research undermines policy decisions. The study shows that AI publications are growing faster than other fields but with weaker reproducibility, creating an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio that erodes policymaker effectiveness.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a quantitative analysis of publication trends across scientific domains using Dimensions database queries, supplemented by qualitative assessments of reproducibility standards. They analyzed GitHub mentions in NeurIPS papers from 2019-2024 as a proxy for replicability. The methodology combined bibliometric data with case studies of reproducibility failures in other fields, complemented by proposed governance frameworks and a Theory of Change model linking reproducibility protocols to improved policy outcomes.

## Key Results
- AI publications are growing at 72% annually, faster than any other scientific domain analyzed
- AI has the weakest reproducibility standards among compared fields despite high publication speed
- GitHub mentions in NeurIPS papers show increasing code availability but do not guarantee replicability
- Current publication speeds combined with weak reproducibility protocols erode policymaker effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Preregistration reduces "postdiction" bias, filtering noise from the governance signal
- Mechanism: By registering hypotheses and methods prior to data observation, researchers can distinguish genuine predictive capability from hypotheses retrofitted to explain observed data
- Core assumption: The primary source of "noise" in AI governance is the conflation of post-hoc explanations with genuine predictions
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.1] explains how preregistration enables reviewers to distinguish prediction from postdiction; [abstract] links weak reproducibility to eroded policymaker power

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dedicated compute resources for statistical leverage increase the robustness of capability claims
- Mechanism: Allocating specific "AI Factory" resources for high-sample-rate testing allows for smaller standard errors and higher statistical power
- Core assumption: Researchers will utilize open access compute specifically to increase sample sizes and statistical rigor
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.2] notes AI research is not bottlenecked by human subject availability but by compute; [figure 1/table 1] contextualizes AI's high publication speed but low reproducibility

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mandating negative result reporting reduces publication bias and corrects the risk landscape
- Mechanism: Systematic reporting of negative results provides a "ground truth" counterweight, preventing policymakers from overestimating AI capabilities based on skewed success samples
- Core assumption: There is latent knowledge of negative results currently suppressed by incentive structures
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.3] states negative result publication is seldom practiced in AI; [section 2.1] cites the "Growth in the Time of Debt" case showing how irreproducible reporting leads to harmful policy

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in Governance**
  - Why needed here: This is the central metric the paper uses to diagnose the failure of AI governance
  - Quick check question: Does a 72% growth in publication count improve or degrade governance if reproducibility rate remains static?

- Concept: **Reproducibility vs. Replicability (B2 Definition)**
  - Why needed here: The paper strictly defines these terms to avoid ambiguity
  - Quick check question: If a team downloads code from GitHub and runs it on the original dataset, are they testing Reproducibility or Replicability? (Answer: Replicability)

- Concept: **Postdiction vs. Prediction**
  - Why needed here: This cognitive bias is the target of the Preregistration mechanism
  - Quick check question: Why does postdiction "inflate the likelihood of false positive results" in AI capability evaluations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Preregistration Registry -> Compute Subsidy Layer -> Negative Result Channel
- Critical path: Policy Mandate requires Preregistration IDs -> Researchers apply for verification compute -> Results submitted to Negative Result Channel if rejected
- Design tradeoffs: Speed vs. Trust (slower output but higher trust) and Burden vs. Rigor (increased administrative burden for higher certainty)
- Failure signatures: High GitHub mentions but low actual replicability, vague preregistration allowing postdiction slippage, policymakers relying on singular irreproducible papers
- First 3 experiments: 1) Replicate "GitHub Mention" proxy analysis on NeurIPS dataset, 2) Pilot negative result sweep on 5 high-impact recent AI claims, 3) Statistical power audit of sample sizes in LLM evaluations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can GitHub repository mentions serve as a reliable quantitative proxy for actual reproducibility in AI research?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix A.2 lists this as a limitation, noting that providing code does not guarantee replicability
- Why unresolved: The paper uses this proxy to generate Figure 2 but admits it is imperfect and excludes non-empirical studies
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring overlap between papers with GitHub links and those passing independent reproducibility audits

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the actual reproducibility standards across scientific domains under exhaustive analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix A.1.2 states the authors have not conducted exhaustive analysis across research databases
- Why unresolved: The current visualization relies on broad domain categorizations and selective data points
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic meta-analysis of reproducibility rates across all domains using unified methodology

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does mandating reproducibility protocols empirically result in more effective AI governance and reduced regulatory capture?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Appendix B proposes a "Theory of Change" model but remains conceptual rather than proven
- Why unresolved: The paper argues theoretically but lacks real-world case studies showing governance success from these protocols
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies of policy decisions derived from high-reproducibility research versus standard research

## Limitations

- The paper does not address potential perverse incentives from implementing reproducibility protocols
- Analysis of reproducibility across domains relies on qualitative assessments rather than quantitative metrics
- No empirical data is presented on the actual prevalence of postdiction in AI research

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Characterization of AI publication speed (72% growth) and observation that code availability doesn't guarantee replicability
- **Medium confidence**: Proposed mechanisms supported by analogies to other fields but lacking direct AI-specific evidence
- **Low confidence**: Assertion that implementing protocols will significantly improve governance outcomes without empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic review of preregistered vs. non-preregistered AI studies to measure impact on postdiction bias and false positive rates
2. Implement pilot compute subsidy program for statistical verification and track whether allocated resources increase sample sizes and statistical rigor
3. Survey AI researchers and policymakers to quantify current impact of negative result suppression on capability assessments and risk perception
