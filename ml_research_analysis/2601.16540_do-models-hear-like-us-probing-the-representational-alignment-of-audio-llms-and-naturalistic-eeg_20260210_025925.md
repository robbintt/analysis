- Models hear like us: systematic comparison of Audio LLM representations and human EEG during naturalistic speech listening reveals metric-dependent alignment patterns

## Executive Summary
This study systematically compares internal representations of 12 open-source Audio LLMs with human EEG signals during naturalistic speech listening. The authors temporally align layer-wise model states with sentence-level EEG segments and quantify representational similarity using eight metrics, including Spearman-based RSA and covariance-based measures. Results reveal a strong rank-dependence split: rank-based geometry and dependence-based measures peak at different model depths, and their cross-model rankings are metric-dependent. Time-resolved scalp analyses show strongest alignment in the 250-500 ms window, consistent with N400-related neural dynamics. A prosody-aware tri-modal analysis further uncovers that negative prosody reduces rank-based similarity while increasing covariance-based dependence, indicating that affective modulation reshapes temporal neighborhood structure rather than uniformly scaling coupling.

## Method Summary
The study temporally aligns layer-wise model states with sentence-level EEG segments and quantifies representational similarity using eight metrics, including Spearman-based RSA and covariance-based measures. The analysis includes time-resolved scalp analyses and prosody-aware tri-modal examination to understand how affective modulation affects representational alignment.

## Key Results
- Rank-based geometry and dependence-based measures peak at different model depths
- Cross-model rankings are metric-dependent, showing no universal alignment pattern
- Strongest alignment occurs in the 250-500 ms window, consistent with N400-related neural dynamics
- Negative prosody reduces rank-based similarity while increasing covariance-based dependence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by assuming perfect temporal alignment between EEG timestamps and model layer activations, enabling direct comparison of representational geometry. The use of multiple similarity metrics captures different aspects of representational structure - rank-based measures capture ordinal relationships while covariance-based measures capture absolute similarity patterns. The tri-modal analysis isolates prosody effects by comparing conditions with different affective content.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)**: Why needed - quantifies how similarly two systems encode information; Quick check - verify that RSA values meaningfully differentiate between models with known architectural differences
2. **Temporal Alignment in Neuroimaging**: Why needed - enables comparison across different temporal resolutions; Quick check - validate alignment using known stimulus-onset markers
3. **Covariance vs Rank-based Measures**: Why needed - capture different geometric properties of representation spaces; Quick check - demonstrate that metrics produce divergent rankings on synthetic data with known properties
4. **N400 Component**: Why needed - provides neural benchmark for semantic processing; Quick check - verify N400 timing in pilot data matches literature
5. **Tri-modal Analysis**: Why needed - isolates affective modulation effects; Quick check - confirm prosody manipulation successfully alters emotional valence
6. **Layer-wise Representation Analysis**: Why needed - tracks how representations evolve through model depth; Quick check - verify that deeper layers show more abstract feature representations

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: EEG recording -> Preprocessing -> Temporal alignment -> Model layer extraction -> Representational similarity computation -> Metric aggregation -> Statistical analysis

Critical Path: Data collection (EEG + audio stimuli) -> Preprocessing (artifact removal, temporal alignment) -> Model forward pass -> Layer-wise representation extraction -> Similarity computation across 8 metrics -> Time-resolved and prosody-aware analyses

Design Tradeoffs: Temporal alignment precision vs computational efficiency; metric comprehensiveness vs interpretability; subject aggregation vs individual differences

Failure Signatures: Misalignment artifacts manifest as uniform similarity drops; metric instability indicates data quality issues; prosody effects confounded with other stimulus properties

First Experiments:
1. Test temporal alignment procedure using synthetic data with known delay patterns
2. Verify metric independence by correlating similarity scores across different measures
3. Validate prosody manipulation using behavioral ratings from separate participants

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Temporal alignment assumes perfect synchronization between EEG and model activations, which may not hold for naturalistic stimuli
- Aggregation across subjects at layer level may mask individual differences in neural encoding patterns
- Choice of eight metrics introduces complexity without clear theoretical justification for metric selection
- Rank-based versus covariance-based measures analysis does not explore alternative geometric interpretations

## Confidence
- High confidence: Rank-based and dependence-based measures peak at different depths
- Medium confidence: Time-resolved scalp analyses showing 250-500 ms window alignment
- Medium confidence: Prosody modulation effects on representational similarity

## Next Checks
1. Perform subject-level temporal alignment validation using cross-correlation between EEG and model activations
2. Conduct ablation studies testing metric-specific artifacts by varying input representations
3. Implement cross-validation by training a classifier to predict model layer identity from EEG patterns
