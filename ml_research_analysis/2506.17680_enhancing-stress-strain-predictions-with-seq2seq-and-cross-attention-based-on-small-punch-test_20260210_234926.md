# Enhancing Stress-Strain Predictions with Seq2Seq and Cross-Attention based on Small Punch Test

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.17680
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17680
- **Reference count**: 24
- **Primary result**: Proposed Seq2Seq-GAF model achieves minimum and maximum MAE of 0.15 MPa and 5.58 MPa respectively, outperforming ANN, GRU, Transformer, and 1D LSTM-based models.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a deep learning approach to predict true stress-strain curves of high-strength steels from small punch test (SPT) load-displacement data. The proposed method transforms SPT data into Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images, then uses a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture enhanced by multi-head cross-attention for improved prediction accuracy. Experiments show the model achieves superior performance with minimum and maximum mean absolute errors of 0.15 MPa and 5.58 MPa, respectively, outperforming ANN, GRU, Transformer, and 1D LSTM-based models.

## Method Summary
The approach transforms load-displacement sequences into GAF images using angular encoding, then extracts features through 2D convolution on GAF images and multi-scale 1D convolution (kernels 3, 5, 7) on raw sequences. These features are concatenated with original data and fed into a 5-layer LSTM encoder-decoder with multi-head cross-attention. The model is trained on 4,500 FEM-simulated samples and tested on 500 samples, achieving R² values ranging from 0.986 to 0.999. The GAF transformation preserves temporal information while enabling spatial feature extraction, and the cross-attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on relevant encoder states during sequence generation.

## Key Results
- Seq2Seq-GAF model achieves minimum MAE of 0.15 MPa and maximum MAE of 5.58 MPa
- Model outperforms ANN, GRU, Transformer, and 1D LSTM baselines across all error metrics
- R² values range from 0.986 to 0.999, indicating excellent predictive performance
- GAF transformation and cross-attention mechanisms significantly improve accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The combination of GAF transformation and cross-attention addresses the fundamental challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies and spatial patterns in SPT data. GAF converts sequential load-displacement data into images that preserve temporal ordering while enabling convolutional feature extraction. The multi-scale 1D convolution captures local patterns at different resolutions, while the 2D convolution on GAF images extracts spatial relationships. Cross-attention allows the decoder to selectively focus on relevant encoder states, improving the model's ability to generate accurate stress-strain sequences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gramian Angular Field (GAF)**: Encodes time series into images using angular representations; needed to convert temporal sequences into spatial format for CNN processing; quick check: verify GAF preserves temporal ordering through phase relationships
- **Multi-head Cross-Attention**: Enables decoder to attend to multiple relevant encoder states simultaneously; needed for capturing long-range dependencies in stress-strain prediction; quick check: visualize attention weight distributions across heads
- **Seq2Seq Architecture**: Maps input sequences to output sequences through encoder-decoder framework; needed for autoregressive stress-strain prediction; quick check: verify decoder generates sequences with correct temporal ordering
- **Multi-scale Convolution**: Applies different kernel sizes to capture patterns at various scales; needed to extract both local and global features from SPT data; quick check: compare feature maps from different kernel sizes
- **LSTM Encoder-Decoder**: Processes sequential data with memory cells; needed to capture temporal dependencies in load-displacement and stress-strain sequences; quick check: verify hidden state evolution across time steps

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: SPT Data -> GAF Transform -> 2D Conv -> 1D Conv (k=3,5,7) -> Feature Concat -> LSTM Encoder -> Cross-Attention -> LSTM Decoder -> Stress-Strain Output

**Critical Path**: SPT Data → GAF Transform → 2D Conv → Feature Concat → LSTM Encoder → Cross-Attention → LSTM Decoder → Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: GAF transformation enables CNN processing but adds computational overhead; cross-attention improves accuracy but increases model complexity; multi-scale convolution captures diverse patterns but requires more parameters.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Transformer baseline shows negative R² due to insufficient training data
- ANN predictions exhibit high fluctuation from lack of sequential inductive bias
- GAF transformation yields no improvement if temporal ordering is not preserved

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify GAF transformation correctly preserves temporal information by comparing feature distributions
2. Test cross-attention contribution through ablation studies against standard Seq2Seq
3. Validate multi-scale convolution effectiveness by comparing single vs. multi-scale feature extraction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Generalization to other materials**: Future research will extend the model to various material types and testing conditions to evaluate its generalizability. The current study only validated on high-strength steel samples with specific property ranges.
- **Transfer learning for unlabeled materials**: Incorporating transfer learning algorithms for unlabeled materials could further broaden applicability. No experiments demonstrated whether knowledge transfers across material systems.
- **Minimum dataset size for transformers**: The 5,000-sample dataset proved inadequate for transformers, but the threshold at which transformers become competitive remains undetermined.

## Limitations
- All data are FEM-simulated; no validation against experimental measurements performed
- Material parameter ranges limited to specific high-strength steel properties (Young's modulus 70,000 MPa, Poisson's ratio 0.35)
- Key hyperparameters including dropout rate, learning rate, batch size, and exact CNN architectures are unspecified
- No analysis of model behavior on out-of-distribution material properties

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Overall methodology combining GAF transformation, multi-scale feature extraction, and Seq2Seq with cross-attention is clearly specified
- **Medium confidence**: Performance improvements over baselines are well-defined but depend on unspecified implementation details
- **Low confidence**: Exact reproduction requires multiple assumptions about architecture and training setup

## Next Checks
1. Validate GAF transformation implementation by comparing feature distributions between transformed and original sequences
2. Test whether cross-attention mechanism improves performance over standard Seq2Seq with attention ablation studies
3. Verify whether material property ranges in FEM simulation cover realistic high-strength steel applications
