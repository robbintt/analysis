# Differentially Private and Federated Structure Learning in Bayesian Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.01708
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01708
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Federated Bayesian network structure learning with differential privacy and communication efficiency via sparse coordinate updates

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses federated learning of Bayesian network structures with privacy and communication constraints. The proposed method, Fed-Sparse-BNSL, uses sparse coordinate-wise updates to learn DAG structures while minimizing communication and preserving privacy. The approach combines ADMM optimization with Proximal Greedy Coordinate Descent, achieving strong utility while offering substantial improvements in privacy protection and communication efficiency compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
The method uses ADMM to solve a federated optimization problem where participants jointly learn a shared DAG structure while maintaining local data privacy. Each participant runs Proximal Greedy Coordinate Descent (PGCD) to update their local model using sparse coordinate updates, sending only non-zero entries to the server. The server aggregates these sparse updates and solves a constrained optimization problem to maintain acyclicity. For differential privacy, the method uses zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy (zCDP) with Gumbel noise for coordinate selection and Gaussian noise for gradient updates, with privacy budget scaling with the number of updated dependencies rather than full dimensionality.

## Key Results
- Fed-Sparse-BNSL recovers 12 of 18 ground-truth edges on the Sachs dataset versus 8 by Fed-BNSL
- DP-Fed-Sparse-BNSL maintains 11 correct edges under ε=5 while achieving O(d) communication vs O(d²)
- The method scales effectively to high-dimensional settings (d=200) where full covariance privatization fails

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Sparse coordinate updates reduce communication from O(d²) to O(k) per round where k is the number of active edges, while preserving DAG identifiability
- PGCD uses coordinate-wise smoothness constants to normalize updates without standardization, with soft-thresholding applied locally to propagate sparse solutions to global consensus
- Works because underlying DAGs are sparse (d edges for d nodes in Erdős-Rényi graphs) and noise variances are equal or known for identifiability

### Mechanism 2
- Privatizing coordinate selection and gradient updates via zCDP achieves (ε,δ)-DP with noise scaling as O(Δ/√(KTε)) rather than O(d²Δ/ε) for full covariance privatization
- Each DP-PGCD iteration uses Gumbel noise for coordinate selection (exponential mechanism) and Gaussian noise for selected gradient, both satisfying ρ-zCDP with additive composition
- Works because gradient sensitivity is bounded via clipping and coordinate-wise smoothness constants are known or privately estimable

### Mechanism 3
- ADMM reformulation with local ℓ₁ penalty enables participant-level personalization while learning shared DAG structure
- After federated learning converges to consensus W, each participant can refit edge weights via OLS on local data while keeping DAG structure fixed
- Works because participants share same underlying DAG structure but may have different edge weights (heterogeneous coefficients)

## Foundational Learning

- **DAG identifiability in linear Gaussian BNs**: The paper avoids standardization because it breaks identifiability conditions (equal/known noise variances). Without this understanding, the design choice seems arbitrary.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why scaling features to unit variance would prevent recovering the true DAG structure?

- **ADMM for federated optimization with consensus constraints**: The algorithm alternates between local B_p updates and global W updates via augmented Lagrangian. Understanding dual variables (α, β_p) is essential for debugging convergence.
  - Quick check: What would happen if the penalty coefficient ρ₂ is set too small?

- **Zero-concentrated differential privacy (zCDP) vs standard (ε,δ)-DP**: The privacy analysis relies on zCDP's additive composition, which is tighter than advanced composition. Converting ρ-zCDP to (ε,δ)-DP is the final step in Theorem 5.1.
  - Quick check: Why does zCDP composition yield less noise than composing (ε,δ)-DP directly?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Client runs DP-PGCD solver locally -> sends sparse updates to server -> server aggregates via Eq. 5-7 -> solves for W^{t+1} using L-BFGS with acyclicity constraint -> broadcasts sparse W^{t+1} and updated dual variables

- **Critical path**: 1) Initialize B_p=0, W=0, α=0, β_p=0 for all participants. 2) Per round: clients run K iterations of DP-PGCD locally (sensitivity clipping → noisy coordinate selection → noisy gradient update → soft thresholding). 3) Server aggregates sparse updates, solves constrained optimization for W. 4) Dual variable updates enforce consensus. 5) Repeat T rounds until convergence or privacy budget exhausted.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - K (local iterations) vs T (global rounds): More local work reduces communication but increases privacy cost per round
  - Clipping threshold C: Smaller C bounds sensitivity tighter but may clip informative gradients; larger C preserves utility but requires more noise
  - λ (ℓ₁ penalty): Controls sparsity; too small yields dense (non-DAG) solutions, too large misses true edges

- **Failure signatures**:
  - SHD not decreasing across rounds: Check if ρ₁, ρ₂ are properly tuned; acyclicity constraint may be too weak/strong
  - Reconstructed covariance matrix leakage: If using non-private Fed-BNSL baseline, server can invert Eq. 10 to recover Σ_p - this is the attack Fed-Sparse-BNSL avoids
  - Privacy budget exhausted before convergence: K×T too large; reduce iterations or accept looser ε

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce Figure 1 convergence: Run Fed-Sparse-BNSL vs Fed-BNSL on d=20 homogeneous synthetic data. Verify SHD gap and FDR reduction.
  2. Ablate local solver: Replace PGCD with standard coordinate descent (random selection, standardized data). Confirm that identifiability breaks (SHD degrades) and communication increases.
  3. Stress test dimensionality: Run DP-Fed-Sparse-BNSL vs DP-Fed-BNSL on d=200 with ε=10. Verify that full covariance privatization fails (SHD~2x higher) per Figure 4.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can Fed-Sparse-BNSL be extended to hybrid Bayesian networks that handle both continuous and discrete variables simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "In future work, we plan to extend our approach to hybrid Bayesian networks to handle data with both continuous and discrete features."
- Why unresolved: The current method relies on continuous optimization with differentiable acyclicity constraints designed for linear Gaussian BNs. Hybrid networks require fundamentally different treatment for discrete variables.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified algorithm that jointly handles continuous and discrete variables while preserving communication efficiency and DP guarantees, with empirical validation on hybrid datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the federated structure learning approach be generalized to non-linear structural equation models beyond the linear Gaussian assumption?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper restricts focus to "linear Gaussian Bayesian networks, where each variable is modeled as a linear function of its parents plus Gaussian noise," noting identifiability requires "equal error variances."
- Why unresolved: Non-linear SEMs require different identifiability conditions and optimization strategies. The current PGCD solver exploits the quadratic structure of the linear loss.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis of identifiability conditions in the federated non-linear setting, plus an algorithm achieving comparable privacy-utility trade-offs on non-linear synthetic data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does Fed-Sparse-BNSL perform under structural heterogeneity where participants have different underlying DAG structures, not just different edge weights?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The heterogeneous experiments only consider "participant-specific regression coefficients, while keeping the underlying DAG structure shared." The paper does not address scenarios where graph topology differs across participants.
- Why unresolved: The consensus formulation explicitly assumes a shared global W matrix. Structural heterogeneity would require either clustering participants, learning mixture models, or relaxing the consensus constraint.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on synthetic data with varying graph structures per participant, potentially with metrics measuring individual-level structure recovery.

## Limitations

- The privacy analysis relies on bounded gradient sensitivity via clipping, but lacks empirical validation of clipping's impact on gradient informativeness in high-dimensional settings
- The acyclicity constraint implementation via h(W) = tr(e^(W◦W)) − d is computationally intensive for large d, limiting scalability
- Real-data validation is limited to the Sachs dataset (P=3 participants, small graph), making generalization claims uncertain

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core algorithmic framework (ADMM + PGCD) is well-specified and theoretically grounded in optimization literature
- Medium confidence: The DP analysis via zCDP is rigorous, but practical impact of privacy budget allocation requires more empirical validation
- Low confidence: Limited real-data validation makes generalization claims uncertain

## Next Checks

1. **Gradient sensitivity validation**: Empirically measure gradient norms under clipping to verify privacy-utility tradeoff remains favorable as d increases
2. **Scalability test**: Run DP-Fed-Sparse-BNSL on d=100-200 with tight ε budgets (ε=1-5) to verify communication and privacy benefits persist in high-dimensional settings
3. **Heterogeneity stress test**: Generate participants with structurally different DAGs to evaluate whether consensus constraint produces meaningful compromises or fails catastrophically
