# Uncertainty quantification with approximate variational learning for wearable photoplethysmography prediction tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.11412
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11412
- Reference count: 40
- Compares MC Dropout and IVON for uncertainty quantification in PPG-based AF and BP prediction

## Executive Summary
This work evaluates two approximate variational learning methods—Monte Carlo Dropout and Improved Variational Online Newton—for quantifying uncertainty in deep learning models that predict atrial fibrillation and blood pressure from photoplethysmography signals. Both techniques capture epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to assess prediction trustworthiness in clinical applications. The study systematically examines how hyperparameter choices affect calibration quality and predictive performance, revealing important trade-offs between stochasticity and uncertainty estimation reliability.

## Method Summary
The paper implements and compares two approximate variational inference methods for uncertainty quantification in PPG-based prediction tasks. MC Dropout applies dropout during both training and inference to approximate Bayesian inference, while IVON uses an online Newton method with variational approximation. Both methods are trained on PPG data to predict atrial fibrillation presence and blood pressure values, with uncertainty decomposition into epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) components. The evaluation framework assesses global and class-specific calibration metrics, correlation between uncertainty components, and prediction reliability across different hyperparameter configurations.

## Key Results
- Hyperparameter choices significantly impact both calibration quality and predictive performance
- Higher stochasticity generally yields better calibrated probabilities but may overpredict uncertainty
- Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components show high correlation, limiting interpretability of disentanglement
- Systematic evaluation of global and class-specific calibration is essential for clinical applicability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methods work by approximating Bayesian inference in deep networks through stochastic regularization (MC Dropout) or variational optimization with Hessian approximation (IVON). During inference, multiple stochastic forward passes generate prediction distributions, from which uncertainty measures are extracted. Epistemic uncertainty captures model uncertainty through parameter posterior variance, while aleatoric uncertainty represents inherent data noise. The correlation between these components suggests overlapping sources of uncertainty that challenge simple disentanglement.

## Foundational Learning

**Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty**
*Why needed:* To distinguish between uncertainty from limited data (epistemic) and inherent noise (aleatoric)
*Quick check:* Verify decomposition captures distinct sources by testing on datasets with varying noise levels

**Variational Inference in Deep Networks**
*Why needed:* Enables approximate Bayesian inference for uncertainty quantification in complex models
*Quick check:* Confirm posterior approximation quality through calibration metrics and negative log-likelihood

**Dropout as Bayesian Approximation**
*Why needed:* Provides computationally efficient uncertainty estimation without modifying network architecture
*Quick check:* Test calibration stability across different dropout rates and inference sample sizes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
PPG Signal -> Deep Neural Network (MC Dropout or IVON) -> Multiple Stochastic Forward Passes -> Prediction Distribution -> Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty Estimates

**Critical Path**
PPG preprocessing → Model training with variational approximation → Inference with multiple stochastic passes → Uncertainty decomposition → Calibration evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Stochasticity level vs calibration quality: Higher dropout improves calibration but may overpredict uncertainty
- Computational cost vs uncertainty estimation: Multiple forward passes increase inference time but provide better uncertainty estimates
- Disentanglement vs correlation: Attempting to separate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty reveals high correlation, limiting interpretability

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor calibration indicated by reliability diagrams deviating from diagonal
- Overconfident predictions despite high uncertainty estimates
- Unstable epistemic-aleatoric decomposition across different datasets

**First Experiments**
1. Compare calibration metrics (ECE, MCE) across different dropout rates and Hessian initialization schemes
2. Test correlation stability between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty on independent PPG datasets
3. Evaluate performance on additional cardiovascular conditions beyond AF and BP

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights the need for systematic sensitivity analysis across multiple clinical scenarios to understand hyperparameter impacts, validation of uncertainty estimates on additional cardiovascular conditions, and investigation of epistemic-aleatoric disentanglement stability across diverse PPG datasets.

## Limitations
- Epistemic-aleatoric disentanglement may not be reliable due to high correlation between components
- Generalizability to cardiovascular conditions beyond atrial fibrillation and blood pressure is uncertain
- Trade-off between calibration quality and overpredicted uncertainty requires further validation

## Confidence

**High:** MC Dropout and IVON effectiveness for uncertainty quantification in PPG prediction
**Medium:** Correlation between stochasticity and calibration quality
**Low:** Disentanglement reliability and clinical interpretability

## Next Checks

1. Test epistemic-aleatoric disentanglement across multiple independent PPG datasets to assess correlation stability
2. Perform ablation studies systematically varying dropout rate, Hessian initialization, and stochasticity levels
3. Evaluate model performance on additional cardiovascular conditions and measurement scenarios to assess generalizability
