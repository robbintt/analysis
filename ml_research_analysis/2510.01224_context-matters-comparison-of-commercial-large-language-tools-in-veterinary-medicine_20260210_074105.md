# Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01224
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224
- Reference count: 1
- Primary result: Veterinary-specific LLM (Product 1/Hachiko) outperformed general-purpose LLMs in clinical summarization with median average score 4.61 vs 2.5-2.45.

## Executive Summary
This study compared three commercially available LLM-powered veterinary summarization tools using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework. Product 1 (Hachiko), a veterinary-specific model, achieved significantly higher performance with a median average score of 4.61 compared to 2.55 for Product 2 and 2.45 for Product 3. The LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility with standard deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3). These results validate both the importance of domain-specific training for clinical NLP applications and the scalability of automated evaluation frameworks in veterinary medicine.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated 42 veterinary oncology records using three commercial LLM summarization tools with a standardized prompt requesting detailed medical histories. A Google Gemini 2.5 Pro judge assessed outputs across five weighted criteria: Factual Accuracy (2.5), Completeness (1.2), Chronological Order (1.0), Clinical Relevance (1.5), and Organization (0.8). The framework used temperature=0.1, 16,384-token reasoning budget, JSON output with Pydantic schema validation, and three independent runs for reproducibility. The open-source evaluation framework is available at https://github.com/pooret-animl/vet-summary-eval-framework.

## Key Results
- Product 1 (Hachiko) achieved median average score of 4.61 (IQR: 0.73), significantly outperforming Product 2 (2.55, IQR: 0.78) and Product 3 (2.45, IQR: 0.92)
- Product 1 received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and Chronological Order
- LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility with standard deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Domain-Specific Training Advantage
Veterinary-specific models leverage training on domain-specific medical data, which improves factual accuracy, chronological ordering, and clinical relevance compared to general-purpose LLMs with prompt engineering alone. The performance difference observed is attributable to domain-specific training rather than other architectural differences between platforms. This is evidenced by Product 1's superior performance (median 4.61) versus general-purpose alternatives (medians 2.45-2.55).

### Mechanism 2: Rubric-Guided LLM-as-a-Judge Framework
The framework produces reproducible evaluations of clinical summarization quality through structured prompting and reasoning budgets. Google Gemini 2.5 Pro served as judge with temperature=0.1, JSON schema validation, and 16,384-token reasoning budget. The high reproducibility (low SDs across runs) validates this approach for scalable clinical NLP assessment.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept 1: Domain-Specific Training
**Why needed:** General-purpose LLMs lack specialized medical vocabulary and clinical reasoning patterns required for veterinary medicine.
**Quick check:** Compare performance of veterinary-specific vs general-purpose models on clinical accuracy metrics.

### Concept 2: LLM-as-a-Judge Framework
**Why needed:** Expert human evaluation is time-intensive and subjective; automated grading enables scalable assessment.
**Quick check:** Verify reproducibility across multiple evaluation runs with low standard deviation.

### Concept 3: Rubric-Guided Evaluation
**Why needed:** Structured criteria ensure consistent assessment across diverse outputs and domains.
**Quick check:** Confirm that weighted scoring system captures clinically relevant dimensions.

### Concept 4: Clinical NLP Evaluation
**Why needed:** Traditional NLP metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) poorly capture clinical accuracy and relevance.
**Quick check:** Validate that rubric domains align with clinical utility requirements.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Records -> Summarization Tools (3 Products) -> LLM Judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) -> Rubric Scoring -> Reproducibility Validation

### Critical Path
1. Veterinary record ingestion and preprocessing
2. LLM summarization generation
3. LLM judge evaluation with reasoning
4. JSON schema validation and scoring
5. Reproducibility assessment across runs

### Design Tradeoffs
- Domain-specific vs general-purpose models: Performance vs flexibility
- Automated vs human evaluation: Scalability vs ground-truth accuracy
- Fixed rubric vs adaptive assessment: Consistency vs nuanced evaluation

### Failure Signatures
- JSON schema validation errors indicate prompt formatting issues
- High standard deviation across runs suggests prompt instability
- Low scores across all products may indicate dataset incompatibility

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test LLM judge reproducibility with known-good summaries
2. Validate rubric scoring with synthetic test cases
3. Assess impact of reasoning budget size on evaluation consistency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1: Human Validation
How does the LLM-as-a-judge framework correlate with evaluations performed by expert veterinary clinicians? The authors note future work must validate automated assessments against expert evaluations to establish inter-rater reliability.

### Open Question 2: Specialty Generalization
Do performance advantages of veterinary-specific models persist across non-oncology specialties? The study's limitation to oncology records may not represent the broader spectrum of veterinary specialties.

### Open Question 3: Stylistic Bias
To what extent does the LLM evaluator exhibit stylistic biases independent of clinical accuracy? The judge may favor certain writing styles or organizational patterns regardless of clinical accuracy.

## Limitations
- Specific configurations of Commercial Products 2 and 3 remain unspecified
- Study relies on single veterinary oncology dataset (n=42 records)
- LLM-as-a-judge framework generalizability to other domains untested

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Product 1 (Hachiko) outperformed other tools based on clear statistical differences in median scores and reproducibility metrics.

**Medium confidence:** Performance differences primarily attributable to domain-specific training, given lack of detailed architectural comparisons.

**Medium confidence:** Scalability and reproducibility of LLM-as-a-judge framework within controlled veterinary oncology context.

## Next Checks

1. Obtain and test evaluation framework on additional veterinary specialties (cardiology, dermatology) to assess generalizability
2. Request or simulate access to exact configurations of Products 2 and 3 to verify reproducibility
3. Conduct controlled ablation study where Products 2 and 3 are fine-tuned on veterinary data to isolate impact of domain-specific training
