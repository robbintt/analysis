# Secure & Personalized Music-to-Video Generation via CHARCHA

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.02610
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02610
- Reference count: 40
- Creates personalized music videos with facial identity verification and user-controlled authentication

## Executive Summary
This paper presents MVP, a secure and personalized music video generation system that combines multimodal translation techniques with a novel authentication protocol called CHARCHA. The system extracts lyrics, rhythm, and emotion from music audio using Whisper ASR, music emotion recognition, and onset strength analysis. These modalities drive text-to-image generation via Stable Diffusion, with spherical interpolation ensuring smooth transitions synchronized to musical beats. CHARCHA implements facial identity verification through a 60-90 second protocol requiring users to perform specific actions on camera, achieving 81% face recognition accuracy in generated videos with 92% accuracy for identified faces.

## Method Summary
The MVP system uses a three-stage pipeline: audio analysis, image generation, and authentication. Audio features are extracted using Whisper for lyrics, onset strength detection for rhythm, and music emotion recognition models for emotional content. These features generate text prompts for Stable Diffusion, with spherical interpolation between keyframes ensuring temporal coherence. The CHARCHA protocol requires users to perform 6-9 facial actions during a 60-90 second video session, simultaneously verifying identity and collecting training data for personalized LoRA adapters. The system generates stylistically diverse videos (sketch, cartoon, realistic) that maintain lyrical coherence while incorporating user likenesses.

## Key Results
- Achieves 81% face recognition accuracy in generated videos with 92% accuracy for identified faces
- Successfully generates stylistically diverse music videos (sketch, cartoon, realistic) synchronized to musical beats
- Implements user-controlled personalization while preventing unauthorized use of facial identities through CHARCHA protocol

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages multimodal synchronization between music features and visual generation, using audio-derived prompts to guide Stable Diffusion output. The spherical interpolation technique ensures smooth temporal transitions between generated frames, maintaining visual coherence while following musical rhythm. CHARCHA's dual-purpose design both authenticates users and collects personalized training data, creating a closed-loop system where verification directly enables personalization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Translation**: Converting music features (lyrics, rhythm, emotion) into visual prompts requires understanding cross-modal semantic relationships. Why needed: Music lacks inherent visual meaning. Quick check: Verify that generated visuals correspond to musical features.
- **Spherical Interpolation**: Smooth transitions between Stable Diffusion outputs using spherical interpolation in latent space. Why needed: Linear interpolation creates visual artifacts. Quick check: Compare visual smoothness between interpolation methods.
- **Facial Identity Verification**: Real-time facial action recognition for authentication. Why needed: Prevent unauthorized use of personal likeness. Quick check: Measure false acceptance/rejection rates across diverse populations.
- **LoRA Personalization**: Low-rank adaptation for efficient user-specific model fine-tuning. Why needed: Enable personalization without full model retraining. Quick check: Test recognition accuracy with varying amounts of training data.
- **Music Emotion Recognition**: Mapping audio features to emotional descriptors. Why needed: Generate emotionally coherent visuals. Quick check: Validate emotion predictions against human annotations.
- **Onset Strength Analysis**: Detecting musical beats for temporal synchronization. Why needed: Align visual transitions with musical rhythm. Quick check: Measure synchronization accuracy across different genres.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Audio Processing -> Feature Extraction -> Prompt Generation -> Stable Diffusion -> Spherical Interpolation -> Video Output
User Video Input -> CHARCHA Verification -> LoRA Training -> Personalization

**Critical Path**
The most critical path is Audio Processing -> Feature Extraction -> Prompt Generation -> Stable Diffusion, as errors in any stage propagate through the entire system. CHARCHA verification must succeed before personalization can occur.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Verification duration (60-90 seconds) balances security vs. user convenience
- LoRA adapters provide personalization without full model retraining but may limit adaptation capacity
- Multiple artistic styles increase user choice but require separate model configurations
- Real-time processing vs. batch processing affects latency and resource requirements

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor facial recognition: blurry or incorrect faces in generated videos
- Misaligned visuals: visual transitions not synchronized with musical beats
- Inconsistent style: jarring transitions between generated frames
- Authentication failures: repeated verification requests or blocked personalization

**3 First Experiments**
1. Test CHARCHA protocol robustness against video replay attacks using pre-recorded user videos
2. Measure personalization accuracy degradation with limited training data (10-100 samples)
3. Evaluate cross-genre performance by testing the system with classical, jazz, and non-Western music

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in source material.

## Limitations
- 81% overall face recognition accuracy represents significant false acceptance risk
- 60-90 second verification duration may create user friction and scalability issues
- Performance across diverse musical genres and languages remains unproven

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Multimodal translation pipeline using Stable Diffusion with spherical interpolation follows established approaches. Music feature extraction methods are well-documented.

**Medium confidence**: CHARCHA authentication protocol demonstrates reasonable performance metrics, but security against sophisticated attacks remains unproven. 92% accuracy for identified faces shows good but imperfect performance.

**Low confidence**: Scalability and deployment readiness claims lack substantiation. System behavior with edge cases (long songs, complex rhythms, multiple vocalists) not thoroughly evaluated.

## Next Checks
1. **Security penetration testing**: Test CHARCHA protocol against video replay, deepfake impersonation, and social engineering attacks to quantify actual security robustness.

2. **Cross-cultural validation**: Evaluate system performance across diverse musical traditions, languages, and cultural contexts to assess generalization beyond Western pop music.

3. **Long-term personalization stability**: Test degradation of LoRA adapter performance over time with limited retraining data across multiple video generations spanning extended periods.
