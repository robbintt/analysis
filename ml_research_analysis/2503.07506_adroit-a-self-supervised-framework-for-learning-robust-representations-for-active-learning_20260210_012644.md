# ADROIT: A Self-Supervised Framework for Learning Robust Representations for Active Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.07506
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07506
- Authors: Soumya Banerjee; Vinay Kumar Verma
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: ADROIT achieves 1.79% to 8.13% absolute mean accuracy improvements over recent active learning baselines on CIFAR10/100, TinyImageNet-200, ImageNet-100, and Caltech101

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ADROIT, a unified self-supervised framework for active learning that integrates reconstruction, adversarial, self-supervised, knowledge-distillation, and classification losses into a VAE-based approach. The method comprises three key components: a VAE representation generator, a state discriminator, and a proxy task-learner/classifier. ADROIT learns a latent code using both labeled and unlabeled data, incorporating task-awareness through the proxy classifier that employs self-supervised loss on unlabeled data and knowledge distillation to align with the target task-learner. The state discriminator distinguishes between labeled and unlabeled data to facilitate selection of informative samples. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate ADROIT's superior performance over recent active learning baselines.

## Method Summary
ADROIT combines a β-VAE with adversarial training, self-supervised learning, and knowledge distillation to select informative samples for active learning. The framework trains a target task-learner (ResNet-18) on the current labeled pool, then jointly trains a VAE (encoder E, generator G), a state discriminator D, and a proxy classifier C. The proxy classifier has dual heads for label prediction and rotation prediction (self-supervised task) and is aligned with the target learner through knowledge distillation. The state discriminator distinguishes between labeled and unlabeled latent codes, with the VAE learning to make them indistinguishable. Samples with low discriminator scores (appearing unlabeled-like) are selected for annotation. The combined loss includes reconstruction, KL divergence, classification, self-supervised rotation prediction, knowledge distillation, and adversarial components.

## Key Results
- ADROIT achieves absolute mean accuracy improvements of 1.79% to 8.13% over best-performing baselines across multiple datasets
- Ablation studies confirm the importance of self-supervised rotation prediction and knowledge distillation components
- ADROIT demonstrates robust performance on both balanced (CIFAR10/100, TinyImageNet-200, ImageNet-100) and imbalanced datasets (Modified CIFAR10, Caltech101)
- The framework shows consistent improvement over multiple active learning baselines including VAAL, Core-Set, and SRAAL

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adversarial discrimination between labeled/unlabeled latent codes enables informative sample selection
- Mechanism: The state discriminator D learns to classify latent codes as "labeled" (class 1) or "unlabeled" (class 0). The VAE encoder learns to make both types indistinguishable to D. Unlabeled samples that D confidently classifies as "labeled" are similar to already-annotated data (less informative); samples with low D scores are selected for annotation.
- Core assumption: Unlabeled samples most dissimilar to the current labeled pool in latent space are more informative for the task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The state discriminator distinguishes between labeled and unlabeled data, facilitating the selection of informative unlabeled samples."
  - [section 2.5] "unlabeled inputs that 'look like' labeled inputs, i.e., high probability of belonging to class 1, are discarded"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support; neighboring papers focus on SSL for robustness rather than adversarial AL sampling.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-supervised rotation prediction on unlabeled data enriches task-relevant latent representations
- Mechanism: The proxy classifier C predicts one of six transformations (0°/90°/180°/270° rotation, horizontal/vertical flip) applied to unlabeled inputs using their latent codes. This forces the encoder E to capture spatial/structural features useful for downstream classification.
- Core assumption: Features learned through rotation prediction transfer positively to the target classification task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the proxy classifier additionally employs a self-supervised loss on unlabeled data"
  - [section 2.3] "This approach explicitly integrates conditional dependence between the inputs and annotations into the latent space while refining the latent representation through SSL"
  - [section 5, ablation] ADROIT without SSL underperforms baselines, confirming SSL's contribution.
  - [corpus] SSL-SE-EEG and SS-DPPN papers demonstrate SSL improving representation quality in data-scarce medical domains, supporting transferability assumption.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge distillation aligns proxy classifier behavior with target task-learner for coherent sample selection
- Mechanism: The trained target task-learner T acts as a frozen teacher; proxy classifier C minimizes MSE between its logits and T's logits on both labeled and unlabeled data. This ensures C's latent-space decisions reflect T's actual classification behavior.
- Core assumption: Aligning proxy and target learner representations improves acquisition function relevance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "utilizes knowledge distillation to align with the target task-learner"
  - [section 2.4] "To align their behavior, we establish teacher-student learning between the target and proxy task-learners"
  - [section 5, ablation] Figure 6 shows ADROIT without knowledge distillation underperforms full ADROIT.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on distillation in AL; assumption supported by general knowledge distillation literature (Hinton et al., 2015 cited in paper).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and the ELBO objective
  - Why needed here: ADROIT uses a β-VAE to learn unified latent representations; understanding reconstruction vs. KL trade-off is essential for tuning β and diagnosing latent space collapse.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why increasing β encourages more disentangled but potentially less reconstructive latent codes?

- Concept: Adversarial training dynamics (GAN-style min-max optimization)
  - Why needed here: The VAE-discriminator interaction follows GAN dynamics; understanding mode collapse, training instability, and alternating optimization is critical.
  - Quick check question: What happens if the discriminator becomes too strong relative to the VAE encoder?

- Concept: Self-supervised pretext tasks (rotation prediction)
  - Why needed here: The SSL component uses rotation prediction; understanding why this task encourages useful visual features helps assess suitability for non-image domains.
  - Quick check question: Would rotation prediction be appropriate for time-series EEG data? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Encoder E (ϕ)**: Maps input images → latent code z
  - **Generator/Decoder G (ξ)**: Reconstructs x from z
  - **Proxy Classifier C (Ψ)**: Has two heads—label prediction (C^L) and rotation prediction (C^R); uses z from E
  - **State Discriminator D (θ)**: Binary classifier on latent codes (labeled=1, unlabeled=0)
  - **Target Task-Learner T (ζ)**: Separate ResNet-18 trained on labeled data; frozen during ADROIT training; acts as teacher for C

- Critical path:
  1. Train target task-learner T on current labeled pool (Algorithm 3)
  2. Freeze T; train VAE (E+G), C, and D jointly (Algorithm 1)
  3. Use trained D scores to select low-scoring unlabeled samples (Algorithm 2)
  4. Annotate selected samples; update pools; repeat

- Design tradeoffs:
  - λ_2 (SSL weight): Higher values improve representation quality but may overwhelm classification loss
  - λ_3 (distillation weight): Too high → proxy mimics undertrained teacher; too low → proxy diverges from task relevance
  - Latent dimension d: Paper uses d=32 for CIFAR, d=128 for ImageNet-scale; larger d captures more detail but increases discriminator difficulty

- Failure signatures:
  - Discriminator accuracy stuck near 50%: VAE successfully fooling D; expected good behavior
  - Discriminator accuracy near 100%: VAE not learning; check learning rates or increase VAE update frequency
  - Proxy classifier outperforming target learner significantly: Distillation weight too low; proxy learning different features

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline reproduction on CIFAR-10**: Reproduce Figure 2a results; validate VAAL and Random baselines first, then ADROIT. Confirm ~8% improvement over SRAAL.
  2. **Ablation on SSL**: Remove rotation prediction loss (set λ_2=0); confirm performance drops as shown in Figure 6. Identify which transformations contribute most.
  3. **Discriminator dynamics analysis**: Log D accuracy and selected sample scores per iteration. Verify that selected samples have D scores near 0 (confidently unlabeled-like) rather than random selection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Architecture specifics for VAE and proxy classifier are underspecified, particularly encoder/decoder layer configurations and head architectures
- Training schedule details (fine-tuning vs. retraining per AL cycle) are unclear
- Hyperparameter sensitivity (particularly β for VAE, λ weights) may significantly impact performance

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Mechanism 1 (adversarial discrimination for sample selection) - well-grounded in GAN literature and directly supported by paper claims
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanism 2 (SSL rotation prediction benefits) - supported by ablation studies but relies on assumption of positive transfer to target task
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanism 3 (knowledge distillation alignment) - ablation confirms importance but lacks direct corpus support specific to AL

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture fidelity check**: Implement baseline VAE and proxy classifier architectures from VAAL paper (cited as similar) and compare performance on CIFAR-10 before adding ADROIT-specific components
2. **Discriminator dynamics validation**: Log and plot discriminator accuracy and selected sample scores across AL cycles; confirm that informative samples consistently have low D scores (<0.3) while unselected samples have higher scores
3. **SSL contribution isolation**: Run controlled ablation comparing ADROIT with and without rotation prediction SSL on CIFAR-100; measure whether the ~2-3% performance gap reported in Figure 6 replicates under identical conditions
