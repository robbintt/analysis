# Conversational Text Extraction with Large Language Models Using Retrieval-Augmented Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.09801
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09801
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: ROUGE-1: 0.4604, ROUGE-2: 0.3576, ROUGE-L: 0.4283 on PDF QA task

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a conversational system that leverages large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract text from PDF documents through an interactive interface. The system processes uploaded PDFs, generates sentence embeddings to build a document-specific vector store, and uses efficient retrieval to identify relevant sections for user queries. An LLM then generates comprehensive, contextually aware responses while highlighting pertinent passages. The system offers a valuable tool for researchers and students to efficiently extract knowledge from documents through an intuitive question-answering interface.

## Method Summary
The system employs a RAG framework that first parses PDFs using PyPDF2, then converts text into overlapping chunks. These chunks are transformed into vector embeddings using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model and stored in a FAISS vector store. When users ask questions, the system retrieves relevant chunks via cosine similarity search and feeds them into a Groq LLM through a conversational retrieval chain, maintaining dialogue history with ConversationBufferMemory. The system generates answers while highlighting source passages, achieving competitive performance on ROUGE metrics for text extraction and summarization.

## Key Results
- ROUGE-1 score: 0.4604
- ROUGE-2 score: 0.3576
- ROUGE-L score: 0.4283
- Demonstrates competitive effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art techniques for text extraction and summarization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables contextually relevant responses from specific PDF documents by grounding LLM outputs in retrieved text passages.
- **Mechanism:** The system parses PDFs into text chunks, converts them into vector embeddings, and stores them in a vector store (FAISS). When a user queries, the system performs a similarity search to retrieve relevant chunks, which are fed into the LLM prompt to generate an answer anchored in the document's specific content.
- **Core assumption:** The semantic meaning of user queries and document chunks can be effectively captured in vector space such that cosine similarity correlates with information relevance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system provides informative responses... highlighting relevant passages."
  - [section IV.C]: "The retriever searches for document sections that are semantically similar to the user's query, using cosine similarity..."
  - [corpus]: The paper "PDF Retrieval Augmented Question Answering" further supports the efficacy of RAG frameworks for extracting rich data from PDF files.
- **Break condition:** If the semantic embedding space distorts the relationship between specific technical terms and their context (e.g., polysemy in specialized domains), retrieval fails to provide relevant context, leading to hallucinated or generic LLM responses.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Overlapping text chunks preserves semantic continuity across document boundaries, mitigating information loss during the chunking process.
- **Mechanism:** The system divides raw text into segments where the end of one chunk overlaps with the beginning of the next (defined by `chunk_overlap` in Eq. 1). This ensures that concepts spanning across arbitrary split points remain intact within at least one chunk.
- **Core assumption:** Critical information is not exclusively located in the center of paragraphs; context often bleeds across sentence boundaries.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section IV.A]: "Equation (1) calculates the starting index for each chunk... ensuring that each chunk overlaps with the previous ones by a specified number of characters."
  - [corpus]: "Vision-Guided Chunking Is All You Need" highlights that traditional text-based chunking often struggles with contextual dependencies, validating the need for careful chunking strategies (though this paper uses a simpler overlap method).
- **Break condition:** If the `chunk_size` is too small relative to the document's syntactic complexity, the overlap may fail to capture the full logical scope of an argument, resulting in fragmented retrieval.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** ConversationBufferMemory allows the system to resolve ambiguous follow-up questions by maintaining a history of the dialogue.
- **Mechanism:** The system stores previous user queries and model responses in a memory buffer. For every new input, this history is passed to the LLM alongside the new query and retrieved context, allowing the model to interpret pronouns or references to prior turns.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM possesses sufficient attention window capacity to process both the retrieved documents and the growing conversation history simultaneously without losing focus.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section IV.C]: "The model employs the ConversationBufferMemory class... to store past user queries and LLM responses. This history is crucial for the LLM to reference prior interactions."
  - [section IV.D]: "...chain first accesses the conversation history via the ConversationBufferMemory... ensuring that the current interaction benefits from previous exchanges."
  - [corpus]: "RAC: Retrieval-Augmented Clarification" emphasizes the importance of grounding conversations in the corpus, a task facilitated by memory mechanisms.
- **Break condition:** In prolonged interactions, the conversation history may exceed the model's context window or dilute the signal from the retrieved documents, causing the model to "forget" earlier specific details or drift from the source text.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Vector Embeddings and Cosine Similarity**
  - **Why needed here:** The system does not search for keywords; it searches for meaning. Understanding that text is converted into high-dimensional vectors (via `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and compared via angles (cosine similarity) is essential to debug why specific chunks are retrieved for a query.
  - **Quick check question:** If a user asks about "financial liability" and the document contains "fiscal responsibility," would a high cosine similarity score be expected? (Answer: Yes, if the embedding model captures semantic equivalence.)

- **Concept: ROUGE Metrics (N-gram Overlap)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper claims success based on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores. One must understand that these metrics measure lexical overlap (shared words/phrases) between the generated answer and a reference text, not semantic truth or factual accuracy.
  - **Quick check question:** If the system generates a factually correct summary using entirely different vocabulary than the source text, would the ROUGE score be high or low? (Answer: Low, because ROUGE relies on word overlap, not semantic equivalence.)

- **Concept: Prompt Stuffing (Chain Type)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper specifies the use of the "stuff" chain type. This is the simplest method where all retrieved chunks are "stuffed" into the prompt at once. Understanding this helps explain why the system might fail on very large documents or why it is sensitive to the context window limit of the Groq LLM.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to the context window usage if the retriever fetches 10 large chunks of text using the "stuff" chain type? (Answer: It consumes the context window rapidly, potentially truncating the input or exceeding limits.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Ingestion: PyPDF2 (Text Extraction) -> Chunking (Eq. 1 & 2)
  - Indexing: HuggingFaceEmbeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) -> FAISS Vector Store
  - Runtime: Streamlit (UI) -> ConversationBufferMemory + User Query
  - Retrieval: FAISS Retriever (Cosine Similarity)
  - Generation: Groq LLM (via ConversationalRetrievalChain)
  - Output: Answer + Source Documents (Expander UI)

- **Critical path:**
  The vectorization quality determines system success. If the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model creates embeddings that do not align well with the specific jargon of the PDF (e.g., medical or legal texts), the retriever will pass irrelevant context to the Groq LLM. The LLM then either hallucinates or refuses to answer, regardless of the quality of the generative model.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Chunk Size vs. Context: The paper uses overlap to maintain context, but this increases storage and retrieval time.
  - Lexical vs. Semantic Evaluation: The authors admit ROUGE scores are "relatively moderate" because the system prioritizes concise answers over word-for-word overlap. Optimizing strictly for higher ROUGE scores might make the system less conversational and more extractive.
  - "Stuff" Chain vs. Complexity: The "stuff" chain is simple but context-window limited. More complex chains (like Map-Reduce) are not used here, limiting the scale of documents that can be processed in a single query.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low ROUGE-L with High ROUGE-1: Indicates the system captures keywords but fails to capture sentence structure or flow.
  - "I don't know" responses: Often implies the retriever failed to find chunks with high cosine similarity, leaving the LLM without context.
  - Repetitive answers: Can occur if overlapping chunks introduce redundancy that the LLM fails to consolidate.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Vary Chunk Overlap: Run ablations setting `chunk_overlap` to 0 vs. the paper's setting to quantify the degradation in retrieval accuracy on multi-sentence reasoning questions.
  2. Embedding Model Swap: Replace `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` with a domain-specific embedding model (e.g., legal or biomedical if processing such PDFs) and measure the change in ROUGE-2 scores (bigram coherence).
  3. Noise Stress Test: Upload a PDF with significant non-text elements (tables/images) to test the limits of the PyPDF2 text extraction pipeline and observe how retrieval quality degrades.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies solely on ROUGE metrics, which measure lexical overlap rather than semantic accuracy or factual correctness.
- Chunking strategy with fixed overlap may not scale effectively to highly structured documents with complex tables and figures.
- The "stuff" chain approach limits document processing to the LLM's context window, potentially excluding relevant information in longer documents.

## Confidence
- **High**: The RAG mechanism fundamentally works for extracting text from well-structured PDFs and generating conversational responses, as evidenced by the measured ROUGE scores and the system's ability to highlight relevant passages.
- **Medium**: The claim that the system is "competitive with state-of-the-art techniques" is supported by ROUGE scores but lacks direct comparison to specific baseline systems in the paper.
- **Low**: The assertion that the system is "valuable for researchers and students" remains largely anecdotal without user studies demonstrating actual efficiency gains or satisfaction.

## Next Checks
1. **User Study Validation**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing task completion time and accuracy between the conversational system and traditional keyword-based PDF search methods with actual researchers or students.
2. **Cross-Domain Embedding Evaluation**: Test the system on PDFs from different domains (legal, medical, technical) to measure degradation in ROUGE scores and qualitatively assess retrieval relevance when using the general-purpose all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model.
3. **Context Window Stress Test**: Systematically vary document length and measure the point at which ROUGE scores drop significantly, documenting the maximum effective document size before the "stuff" chain approach fails.
