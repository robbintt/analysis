# LangMamba: A Language-driven Mamba Framework for Low-dose CT Denoising with Vision-language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.06140
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06140
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposes a language-driven Mamba framework that leverages vision-language models for semantic guidance in low-dose CT denoising, achieving superior detail preservation and visual fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LangMamba, an innovative framework for low-dose CT denoising that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) to provide semantic guidance during the denoising process. The method employs a two-stage learning strategy, combining a language-guided autoencoder (LangAE) pre-trained with VLMs and a denoising model featuring semantic-enhanced efficient denoiser (SEED) and language-engaged dual-space alignment (LangDA) loss. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba outperforms conventional methods in detail preservation and visual fidelity, while also exhibiting strong generalizability to unseen datasets and providing language-guided explainability during the denoising process.

## Method Summary
LangMamba is a two-stage framework that leverages vision-language models for low-dose CT denoising. The first stage involves pre-training a language-guided autoencoder (LangAE) using VLMs to map normal-dose CT images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. The second stage employs a denoising model that incorporates a semantic-enhanced efficient denoiser (SEED) and a language-engaged dual-space alignment (LangDA) loss. The SEED enhances local semantic information while capturing global features with an efficient Mamba mechanism, and the LangDA loss ensures alignment between denoised images and normal-dose CT in both perceptual and semantic spaces. This approach enhances detail preservation and visual fidelity while providing language-guided explainability during the denoising process.

## Key Results
- LangMamba outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods in detail preservation and visual fidelity for low-dose CT denoising.
- The LangAE demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen datasets, reducing training costs.
- The LangDA loss provides language-guided explainability during the denoising process.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LangMamba leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to provide semantic guidance during the denoising process, enhancing both detail preservation and visual fidelity. By pre-training a language-guided autoencoder (LangAE) with VLMs, the framework maps normal-dose CT images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. The denoising model then incorporates a semantic-enhanced efficient denoiser (SEED) that captures global features with an efficient Mamba mechanism and enhances local semantic information. The language-engaged dual-space alignment (LangDA) loss ensures alignment between denoised images and normal-dose CT in both perceptual and semantic spaces, providing language-guided explainability during the denoising process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-language models (VLMs):** Pre-trained models that bridge vision and language understanding, enabling semantic guidance in the denoising process.
- **Mamba mechanism:** An efficient sequence modeling approach that captures long-range dependencies in data, enhancing global feature extraction in the denoising model.
- **Dual-space alignment (LangDA loss):** A loss function that aligns denoised images with normal-dose CT in both perceptual and semantic spaces, ensuring high-quality denoising with explainable results.
- **Semantic-enhanced efficient denoiser (SEED):** A component that enhances local semantic information while capturing global features, improving detail preservation in low-dose CT denoising.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
LangAE (pre-trained with VLMs) -> SEED (with Mamba mechanism) -> LangDA loss (perceptual and semantic alignment)

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves the pre-training of LangAE using VLMs, followed by the denoising process with SEED and LangDA loss. The LangAE maps normal-dose CT images into a semantic space, which guides the SEED in enhancing local semantic information and capturing global features. The LangDA loss ensures alignment between denoised images and normal-dose CT in both perceptual and semantic spaces, providing language-guided explainability.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- The use of VLMs for semantic guidance introduces dependencies on the quality and domain specificity of these models, which may not fully capture nuanced medical imaging contexts.
- The two-stage learning strategy, while effective, may increase computational complexity and training time compared to end-to-end methods.
- The LangDA loss, though promising for explainability, may face challenges in balancing perceptual and semantic alignment without introducing artifacts.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Over-reliance on VLMs may lead to suboptimal performance if the models do not capture specific medical imaging nuances.
- The two-stage learning strategy may result in increased computational demands, potentially limiting real-time clinical deployment.
- The LangDA loss may introduce artifacts if the balance between perceptual and semantic alignment is not carefully managed.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate the LangAE's performance on diverse, multi-institutional CT datasets with varying pathologies and imaging protocols to assess generalizability.
2. Test the computational efficiency of LangMamba for real-time clinical deployment, including inference speed and resource requirements.
3. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of the LangDA loss on denoising quality and identify potential trade-offs between perceptual and semantic alignment.

## Limitations
- The reliance on external VLMs for semantic guidance introduces potential dependencies on the quality and domain specificity of these models, which may not fully capture nuanced medical imaging contexts.
- The two-stage learning strategy, while effective, may increase computational complexity and training time compared to end-to-end methods.
- The generalizability of the LangAE to diverse clinical datasets beyond the tested public datasets remains uncertain, particularly for rare pathologies or varying imaging protocols.

## Confidence
- **High:** Overall framework's effectiveness in detail preservation and visual fidelity, as demonstrated by experimental results.
- **Medium:** Generalizability of LangAE and robustness of LangDA across diverse clinical scenarios.
- **Low:** Scalability of the method to real-time clinical applications due to computational demands.
