# UbiQVision: Quantifying Uncertainty in XAI for Image Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.20288
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20288
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: UbiQVision integrates Bayesian meta-learning, SHAP, and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify uncertainty in deep learning explanations for medical imaging, producing belief maps that align with pathological biomarkers while uncertainty maps distinguish diagnostic regions from uninformative background.

## Executive Summary
UbiQVision addresses the critical need for uncertainty quantification in explainable AI (XAI) for medical image diagnosis. The framework combines Bayesian meta-learning with SHAP explanations and Dempster-Shafer theory to produce belief and plausibility maps that not only highlight important diagnostic regions but also explicitly quantify uncertainty. By treating model reliability as a Dirichlet random variable and using evidential mass functions, UbiQVision can differentiate between confident diagnoses and cases requiring expert review. The system was validated across three medical imaging domains - malaria cell detection, Alzheimer's MRI classification, and diabetic retinopathy assessment - demonstrating its ability to produce anatomically consistent explanations while providing uncertainty estimates that could support clinical decision-making.

## Method Summary
UbiQVision employs a multi-stage approach to uncertainty quantification in XAI. First, it uses Bayesian meta-learning to generate an ensemble of models, treating each model's reliability as a Dirichlet-distributed random variable that dynamically weights ensemble members based on validation performance. SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) is then applied to each model to derive pixel-level contribution scores for the final prediction. These SHAP-derived scores are mapped into evidential mass functions that represent different levels of belief, disbelief, and uncertainty. Finally, Dempster-Shafer theory fuses these evidential masses across the ensemble, explicitly modeling both epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (data noise) to produce final belief and plausibility maps. The framework also generates an uncertainty map that highlights regions where the model is confident versus uncertain, enabling clinicians to identify cases requiring additional review.

## Key Results
- Produced belief maps that precisely localized pathological biomarkers (parasites, hemorrhages) across malaria, Alzheimer's, and diabetic retinopathy datasets
- Uncertainty maps clearly separated diagnostic regions from uninformative background, enabling distinction between confident and uncertain predictions
- Bayesian weighting consistently identified the most robust model per dataset, reducing spurious attributions from weaker models
- Framework aligned predictions with anatomical evidence, enhancing interpretability in safety-critical AI diagnostics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian meta-learning**: Treats model reliability as a random variable to dynamically weight ensemble members based on validation performance. Needed to adapt to different medical imaging contexts and identify the most reliable model for each dataset.
- **SHAP explanations**: Provides pixel-level attribution scores that quantify each pixel's contribution to the final prediction. Essential for generating interpretable explanations that clinicians can verify against known pathology.
- **Dempster-Shafer theory**: Combines evidence from multiple sources while explicitly modeling uncertainty through belief and plausibility measures. Required to fuse SHAP-derived evidence while accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.
- **Dirichlet distribution for reliability**: Models the uncertainty in model performance estimates, allowing for more nuanced ensemble weighting. Needed to capture the inherent uncertainty in model reliability assessments.
- **Evidential mass functions**: Maps attribution scores into belief structures that can be combined using Dempster-Shafer fusion. Critical for representing uncertainty at the pixel level before aggregation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image -> Ensemble Models (Bayesian-weighted) -> SHAP Attribution -> Evidential Mass Functions -> Dempster-Shafer Fusion -> Belief/Plausibility Maps

**Critical Path**: Input image → Bayesian ensemble selection → SHAP computation → Evidential mapping → Dempster-Shafer fusion → Output belief maps and uncertainty map

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses computationally expensive SHAP and Dempster-Shafer methods for improved uncertainty quantification versus faster but less interpretable methods; ensemble approach increases robustness but adds complexity; explicit uncertainty modeling may slow deployment but improves clinical trust.

**Failure Signatures**: Uncertainty maps showing high values in regions that should be diagnostic; belief maps failing to align with known pathology; inconsistent model weighting across similar cases; computational bottlenecks during real-time inference.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify Bayesian weighting correctly identifies the most reliable model on held-out validation data; 2) Test SHAP attribution stability across similar images; 3) Validate Dempster-Shafer fusion handles conflicting evidence appropriately.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dirichlet-distributed reliability scores assumption may not accurately capture ensemble member quality across diverse clinical contexts beyond tested datasets
- Computational complexity may limit real-time clinical deployment, though not thoroughly explored
- Effectiveness of Dempster-Shafer fusion with conflicting evidence during clinical decision-making remains uncertain, especially for rare pathologies

## Confidence
- **High**: Framework's ability to produce interpretable belief maps aligning with pathological features across multiple imaging modalities
- **Medium**: Uncertainty maps meaningfully distinguishing between confident and uncertain regions (requires prospective clinical validation)
- **Low**: Claims about real-world clinical impact and decision-making support (not directly tested in study)

## Next Checks
1. Prospective clinical trial validation with diverse patient populations and pathologies
2. Comparative analysis of computational efficiency and runtime performance against existing XAI uncertainty methods
3. Investigation of framework robustness with multi-modal imaging data and significant noise/artifacts
