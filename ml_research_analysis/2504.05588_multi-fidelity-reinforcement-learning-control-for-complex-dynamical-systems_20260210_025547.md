# Multi-fidelity Reinforcement Learning Control for Complex Dynamical Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.05588
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05588
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** A multi-fidelity reinforcement learning framework that leverages differentiable hybrid models and spectrum-based rewards to effectively control complex dynamical systems while reducing computational cost.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a multi-fidelity reinforcement learning (MFRL) framework for controlling complex dynamical systems. The core innovation is a differentiable hybrid model that combines low-fidelity physics-based solvers with neural network correction terms, trained on limited high-fidelity data. This surrogate environment enables efficient RL training while maintaining alignment with true physics. A spectrum-based reward function is introduced to better capture the statistical behavior of chaotic systems. The framework is validated on two physics problems—laser-plasma instabilities and fluid turbulence—demonstrating effective control while reducing computational cost compared to high-fidelity-only approaches.

## Method Summary
The MFRL framework constructs a hybrid environment by combining a low-fidelity physics solver with a learnable neural network correction term, trained offline on limited high-fidelity data pairs. This differentiable surrogate enables efficient reinforcement learning training using a spectrum-based reward function that captures statistical properties of chaotic dynamics. The RL agent (TD3) is trained online within this hybrid environment, with Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) applied to improve policy stability and generalization. The learned policy is then evaluated on the true high-fidelity system.

## Key Results
- The MFRL approach achieves control performance matching high-fidelity environments while reducing computational cost
- Spectrum-based rewards outperform pointwise state-matching rewards for chaotic system control
- The hybrid surrogate model generalizes effectively from limited high-fidelity training data
- Results demonstrate successful instability mitigation in both laser-plasma systems and fluid turbulence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A differentiable hybrid model serves as a computationally efficient surrogate environment, enabling feasible RL training while maintaining alignment with high-fidelity physics. The framework combines a low-fidelity physics solver with a learnable neural network correction term, pre-trained offline on limited high-fidelity data. This hybrid model acts as the fast, differentiable environment for the RL agent, assuming the MDP framework holds for effective policy transfer.

### Mechanism 2
A spectrum-based reward function provides a more stable and physically meaningful learning signal for controlling chaotic systems than pointwise state-matching rewards. By optimizing in the spectral domain using metrics like energy peaks and bandwidth, the agent matches statistical energy distribution rather than exact trajectories, which is more tractable for chaotic systems with sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

### Mechanism 3
Stochastic weight averaging (SWA) during training improves the stability and generalization of the learned control policy. By averaging model weights collected over multiple training epochs, the framework smooths the optimization trajectory, promotes convergence to flatter optima, and reduces the risk of overfitting to specific quirks of the hybrid environment.

## Foundational Learning

**Deep Reinforcement Learning (Actor-Critic, TD3)**
- Why needed: The core control agent is a DRL agent. Understanding actor-critic updates via policy gradients and TD error is essential for debugging.
- Quick check: How does the critic's TD error guide the update of the actor's policy network?

**Surrogate & Reduced-Order Modeling**
- Why needed: The method's efficiency hinges on replacing expensive high-fidelity solvers with fast hybrid surrogates. Understanding trade-offs between fidelity and cost is critical.
- Quick check: Why does a purely data-driven surrogate struggle with long-term rollouts in chaotic systems compared to the proposed hybrid model?

**Spectral Analysis for Chaotic Systems**
- Why needed: The reward signal is defined on the energy spectrum. Interpreting results requires understanding power spectral density computation and its characterization of turbulence.
- Quick check: What does a shift in the energy spectrum's peak frequency or amplitude indicate about the state of a dynamical system?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Multi-Fidelity Simulators -> Hybrid Environment -> RL Agent -> Reward Module

**Critical path:**
1. Data Generation: Run HF and LF simulations for initial conditions
2. Offline Training: Train the Hybrid Environment model using multi-fidelity data
3. Online RL: Train the RL agent inside the differentiable Hybrid Environment
4. Evaluation: Execute the learned policy on the true HF environment

**Design tradeoffs:**
- NN Capacity vs. Data Scarcity: Larger SIREN models capture more complex corrections but risk overfitting limited HF data
- Observation Window: Full time history improves context but increases state dimensionality
- Accuracy vs. Cost: Hybrid model aims for statistical accuracy, not pointwise perfection, to enable fast RL training

**Failure signatures:**
- Hybrid Model Divergence: Training loss plateaus or explodes, indicating poor generalization
- Policy Overfitting: High reward in hybrid environment but complete failure on HF environment
- RL Instability: Reward curves oscillate wildly due to poorly scaled reward or aggressive learning rate

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Hybrid Model Validation: Compare surrogate rollouts against HF ground truth on held-out test set
2. Reward Function Ablation: Compare policy performance with spectrum-based vs. pointwise MSE reward
3. Baseline Comparison: Benchmark against LF-only and pure data-driven surrogate RL baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
How can the proposed framework be adapted for 3D environments where direct training on high-dimensional data becomes computationally prohibitive? The current method relies on backpropagation through time, which faces memory constraints as state dimensionality increases.

**Open Question 2**
What is the sensitivity of the hybrid model's stability and control performance to the specific quantity and distribution of high-fidelity training data? The method relies on "limited high-fidelity data" but lacks ablation studies on lower bounds of this data.

**Open Question 3**
Can the spectrum-based reward function effectively guide control in systems where success depends on suppressing localized, non-spectral transient events? The spectral formulation may smooth over critical localized phenomena visible in the time domain but not the spectrum.

## Limitations
- The framework's transferability from hybrid to true high-fidelity environments for highly chaotic systems remains uncertain
- Key hyperparameters including reward weights and exact data generation parameters are unspecified
- Validation is limited to two specific physics problems without broader ablation studies across diverse dynamical systems

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The hybrid model architecture and its training procedure are clearly defined and theoretically sound for differentiable surrogate learning.

**Medium Confidence:** The spectrum-based reward function is a reasonable approach for chaotic systems, but its optimality is not rigorously established across different control objectives.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim of outperforming baselines is supported, but the comparison lacks a pure data-driven surrogate baseline for direct multi-fidelity benefit demonstration.

## Next Checks

1. **Hybrid Model Generalization Test:** Quantify the surrogate's accuracy on a held-out test set with unseen initial conditions and control actions, comparing pointwise and spectral predictions against the HF ground truth.

2. **Reward Function Ablation Study:** Compare the final policy performance when trained with the spectrum-based reward versus a standard pointwise MSE reward to isolate the benefit of the spectral formulation.

3. **Sim-to-Real Gap Analysis:** During RL training, periodically evaluate the policy on the true HF solver (if computationally feasible) to directly measure and minimize the performance gap between the hybrid environment and the real system.
