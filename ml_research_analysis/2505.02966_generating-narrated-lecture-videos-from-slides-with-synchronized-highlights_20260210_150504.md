# Generating Narrated Lecture Videos from Slides with Synchronized Highlights

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.02966
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02966
- Reference count: 17
- AutoLectures generates narrated lecture videos with synchronized highlights at under $1 per hour

## Executive Summary
AutoLectures addresses the challenge of transforming static presentation slides into engaging, narrated video lectures with synchronized visual highlights. The system automates this process using a multi-stage pipeline that integrates AI-generated narration, OCR for layout analysis, and timestamp-providing TTS for precise timing. Its core innovation is a configurable highlight alignment module that maps spoken phrases to corresponding locations on slides using diverse strategies like semantic matching (LLM-based) or surface-level similarity (Levenshtein distance), at selectable granularities (word or line level). This enables accurate synchronization of visual highlights with narration, mimicking effective human presenters. Evaluated on a manually annotated dataset of 1000 highlights, the LLM-based alignment achieves high location accuracy (F1 > 92%), significantly outperforming simpler methods, especially on complex, math-heavy content. The system is highly cost-efficient, generating an hour-long lecture for under $1, representing potential savings of two orders of magnitude compared to manual production. This combination of accuracy, efficiency, and pedagogical enhancement makes AutoLectures a practical tool for scalable video lecture generation.

## Method Summary
AutoLectures employs a multi-stage pipeline to convert presentation slides into narrated videos with synchronized visual highlights. The system begins by generating narration text using GPT-4, which then serves as input for a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to create the audio track. For timing information, a second TTS run with an integrated speech recognition model provides word-level timestamps. Simultaneously, OCR extracts slide text and bounding boxes for layout analysis. The highlight alignment module matches each spoken phrase to its corresponding slide location using configurable strategies: semantic matching via LLM embeddings, Levenshtein distance for surface similarity, or substring matching for exact matches. The alignment granularity can be set to word or line level. Finally, the system renders the video with synchronized highlights using Python's moviepy library. The approach is designed to be domain-agnostic, requiring no specialized hardware or software, and focuses on visual highlighting without incorporating other dynamic elements like animations.

## Key Results
- LLM-based alignment achieves F1 > 92% location accuracy on manually annotated dataset
- System generates hour-long lectures for under $1, representing 2+ orders of magnitude cost reduction
- Semantic matching outperforms simpler methods, particularly on complex, math-heavy content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by breaking down the complex task of creating narrated lecture videos into specialized, automatable components. GPT-4 generates coherent narration that flows naturally from the slide content. The dual TTS approach provides both audio and precise word-level timing data. OCR enables text-based alignment by extracting both content and spatial information from slides. The configurable highlight alignment module is the critical innovation - it can operate at different granularities (word vs line) and use different matching strategies (semantic vs surface similarity) depending on content complexity. This flexibility allows the system to adapt to various presentation styles and content types. The rendering pipeline then combines all these elements into a cohesive video with synchronized visual highlights, mimicking the pedagogical technique of human presenters who guide viewers' attention to relevant content.

## Foundational Learning
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Extracts text and layout information from slides; needed for text-based alignment; quick check: verify OCR accuracy on slides with complex formatting
- **Text-to-Speech with Timestamps**: Generates both audio and word-level timing data; needed for precise phrase-to-time mapping; quick check: compare TTS timing accuracy across different voice models
- **LLM Embeddings**: Represents phrases as high-dimensional vectors for semantic similarity; needed for matching spoken content to slide content beyond exact text matches; quick check: validate embedding quality on domain-specific terminology
- **Levenshtein Distance**: Measures edit distance between strings for surface similarity matching; needed as computationally efficient fallback when semantic matching is unnecessary; quick check: test performance on slides with minor textual variations
- **Highlight Alignment Strategies**: Configurable approaches (semantic, surface similarity, substring) for matching phrases to locations; needed to handle diverse content types and presentation styles; quick check: compare alignment accuracy across different strategies on same dataset
- **Granularity Control**: Word vs line level matching; needed to balance precision with computational efficiency; quick check: evaluate impact on alignment accuracy for different content types

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Slides -> GPT-4 Narration -> TTS (Audio) + TTS (Timestamps) -> OCR (Text + Layout) -> Highlight Alignment -> MoviePy Rendering -> Output Video

### Critical Path
The most time-critical sequence is OCR extraction followed by highlight alignment, as these must complete before rendering can begin. The dual TTS process (audio generation and timestamp extraction) can occur in parallel with OCR processing.

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Alignment Strategy**: Semantic matching (LLM) offers higher accuracy but increases cost; surface similarity (Levenshtein) is faster but less accurate on complex content
- **Granularity Level**: Word-level provides precise highlighting but may be computationally expensive; line-level is more efficient but less specific
- **OCR Dependency**: Enables text-based alignment but fails on non-textual content like graphs without labels
- **Fixed Video Format**: Ensures consistency but limits customization options for different pedagogical needs

### Failure Signatures
- **Poor OCR Quality**: Results in missing or incorrect text extraction, leading to failed alignments
- **Ambiguous Semantic Matches**: LLM-based matching may select incorrect locations when multiple slide elements are semantically similar
- **Timing Drift**: TTS timing inaccuracies cause highlights to appear out of sync with narration
- **Complex Mathematical Notation**: OCR struggles with equations, reducing alignment accuracy on technical content

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test alignment accuracy on slides with varying complexity (simple bullet points vs complex mathematical equations)
2. Compare processing time and cost between semantic matching and Levenshtein distance approaches
3. Evaluate the impact of granularity settings (word vs line level) on both accuracy and rendering efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do synchronized highlights generated by AutoLectures improve learner retention and transfer performance compared to non-highlighted videos?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge they did not conduct user studies to empirically evaluate the actual impact on learner outcomes (Section 6.1).
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focused strictly on technical feasibility (alignment accuracy) and cost-efficiency rather than pedagogical efficacy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments measuring student test scores (retention/transfer) comparing groups watching videos with AutoLectures highlights vs. identical videos without them.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can a unified multimodal LLM architecture accurately ground spoken phrases to non-textual visual regions (e.g., graph quadrants) without relying on OCR?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose exploring multimodal LLMs to bypass the current OCR-dependent pipeline and handle references to non-textual content (Section 6.2).
- Why unresolved: The current alignment module depends entirely on matching text to OCR elements, rendering it unable to process references to visual data without labels.
- What evidence would resolve it: A system implementation using a multimodal model to output direct coordinates for non-textual references, evaluated on a dataset of image-heavy slides.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would adding diverse visual cues like arrows or dynamic annotations significantly improve learning outcomes over simple rectangular bounding boxes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list the inability to generate arrows or free-form annotations as a limitation, noting these might be more effective for illustrating relationships (Section 6.1).
- Why unresolved: The current system only supports rectangular bounding boxes derived from OCR layout data.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of the system capable of generating arrow/annotation parameters, tested against the bounding box method in a user study.

## Limitations
- Evaluation results may not generalize beyond the manually annotated dataset used for testing
- System performance degrades on slides with complex mathematical notation or non-standard fonts
- Pedagogical effectiveness of synchronized highlights remains empirically unverified
- OCR dependency prevents handling of non-textual visual content like unlabeled graphs

## Confidence
- Highlight alignment accuracy claim: High (validated on annotated dataset with F1 > 92%)
- Cost-efficiency claim: Medium (assumes stable API pricing, not tested at scale)
- Real-world applicability: Medium (tested on controlled dataset, unknown performance on diverse content)
- Pedagogical benefits: Low (no user studies conducted to measure learning outcomes)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the system on a diverse corpus of real-world lecture videos spanning multiple disciplines, presentation styles, and audio qualities to assess robustness beyond the controlled dataset
2. Conduct a controlled study comparing student learning outcomes and engagement between AutoLectures-generated content and manually produced lecture videos
3. Test the system's performance at scale by generating hundreds of hours of content to identify potential bottlenecks, error accumulation patterns, and actual per-hour costs under realistic production loads
