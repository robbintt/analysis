# Reasoning About Intent for Ambiguous Requests

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10453
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10453
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: Structured approach generates multiple interpretation-answer pairs for ambiguous queries, achieving 78.1% recall and 61.0% full coverage on Abg-CoQA, with high human evaluation alignment (>90%)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of ambiguous natural language queries where users omit details and large language models implicitly commit to one interpretation. The authors propose a novel approach that generates multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single response, with each interpretation explicitly disambiguating the question. Using reinforcement learning with customized reward functions, the method optimizes for recall on ambiguous questions while maintaining precision on unambiguous ones. The approach promotes transparency, efficiency, and structured outputs suitable for downstream applications.

## Method Summary
The proposed method tackles ambiguity by generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single response. The core innovation is a reinforcement learning framework with customized rewards that optimize for recall on ambiguous questions and precision on unambiguous ones. The model produces structured outputs where each interpretation explicitly disambiguates the original question. This is trained on conversational QA and text-to-SQL parsing tasks, with experiments showing superior coverage of valid answers compared to baseline methods. The approach requires only one generation step while providing transparency through explicit interpretations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 78.1% recall and 61.0% full coverage on ambiguous questions in Abg-CoQA dataset
- Demonstrates 82.4% recall with 74.1% full coverage on Ambrosia dataset
- Shows over 90% alignment accuracy between interpretations and answers in human evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by explicitly modeling ambiguity rather than implicitly resolving it. By generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs, the system captures different valid readings of ambiguous queries. The reinforcement learning framework with customized rewards allows the model to optimize differently for ambiguous versus unambiguous questions. The structured output format ensures each interpretation is clearly linked to its corresponding answer, promoting transparency and enabling downstream applications to leverage the disambiguated interpretations.

## Foundational Learning
- Reinforcement Learning with Custom Rewards: Training approach that optimizes for different objectives based on question type (ambiguous vs. unambiguous). Why needed: Standard RL approaches don't account for the dual nature of ambiguous vs. unambiguous queries. Quick check: Verify reward functions correctly distinguish between query types during training.
- Structured Output Generation: Producing multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single generation step. Why needed: Single-answer approaches miss valid interpretations of ambiguous queries. Quick check: Ensure output format consistently links interpretations to answers.
- Disambiguation as Explicit Generation: Creating explicit interpretations rather than implicit resolution. Why needed: Implicit resolution can lead to user frustration or safety risks when the model commits to the wrong interpretation. Quick check: Validate that interpretations cover all reasonable readings of ambiguous queries.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: User Query -> Ambiguity Detector -> Multiple Interpretation Generator -> Structured Output Formatter -> Reinforcement Learning Reward System

Critical Path: User Query → Ambiguity Detector → Multiple Interpretation Generator → Structured Output Formatter

Design Tradeoffs: The approach trades increased output complexity (multiple interpretation-answer pairs) for improved coverage and transparency. This adds minimal computational overhead since only one generation step is required, but may increase response length. The reinforcement learning framework adds training complexity but enables optimized performance on both ambiguous and unambiguous queries.

Failure Signatures: The system may struggle with subtle or context-dependent ambiguity not captured in training data. It may also produce redundant interpretations or miss rare but valid interpretations. The ambiguity detector might incorrectly classify unambiguous questions as ambiguous, leading to unnecessary multiple interpretations.

First Experiments:
1. Test ambiguity detection accuracy on held-out unambiguous questions to ensure correct classification
2. Evaluate coverage of interpretations on ambiguous queries with known ground truth interpretations
3. Benchmark inference time and resource requirements against baseline single-answer generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is confined to two specific datasets, leaving uncertainty about generalizability to other domains or query types
- Does not address computational overhead compared to standard single-answer generation, which could impact real-world deployment
- May struggle with subtle or context-dependent ambiguity not captured in training data

## Confidence
- High: Reported recall and full coverage metrics on Abg-CoQA and Ambrosia datasets are well-supported
- High: Human evaluation results showing over 90% alignment accuracy between interpretations and answers
- Medium: Uncertainty about generalizability to other domains or query types beyond the two evaluated datasets

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate performance on out-of-distribution queries and real-world user interactions to assess robustness beyond curated datasets
2. Benchmark inference time and resource requirements against baseline methods to quantify practical deployment costs
3. Conduct longitudinal studies to verify that explicit disambiguation actually reduces user frustration and safety incidents in production systems
