# Beyond Sequential Reranking: Reranker-Guided Search Improves Reasoning Intensive Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.07163
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07163
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9 on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR when reranking at most 100 documents

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Reranker-Guided Search (RGS), a method that improves retrieval accuracy under fixed reranker budgets by strategically selecting documents based on document-document similarity rather than sequential reranking. RGS uses greedy search on proximity graphs built from document embeddings, prioritizing reranking of documents whose similar neighbors have been highly ranked. The approach demonstrates significant improvements on reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks while being robust to query embedding perturbations.

## Method Summary
Reranker-Guided Search (RGS) operates by building proximity graphs from document embeddings and using these graphs to guide the reranking process. Instead of sequentially reranking top-k documents, RGS identifies which documents to rerank based on the reranking outcomes of their similar neighbors in the proximity graph. This greedy search approach prioritizes documents that are likely to be relevant based on the relevance signals from similar documents that have already been reranked. The method claims to achieve better accuracy than traditional sequential reranking while maintaining robustness to query embedding quality.

## Key Results
- RGS achieves 3.5 points improvement on BRIGHT dataset
- 2.9 points improvement on FollowIR dataset
- 5.1 points improvement on M-BEIR dataset when reranking at most 100 documents

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RGS improves retrieval accuracy by leveraging document-document similarity relationships rather than relying solely on initial ranking scores. The proximity graph structure allows the system to propagate relevance signals between similar documents, enabling more informed reranking decisions. By prioritizing documents whose similar neighbors have been highly ranked, RGS can identify relevant documents that might be missed by sequential reranking approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Document embeddings**: Vector representations that capture semantic meaning of documents, needed for building proximity graphs; quick check: verify embeddings capture semantic similarity.

**Proximity graphs**: Graph structures where nodes represent documents and edges connect similar documents, used to guide reranking decisions; quick check: ensure graph connectivity reflects document relationships.

**Greedy search algorithms**: Search strategies that make locally optimal choices at each step, used to prioritize which documents to rerank; quick check: validate greedy choices lead to global improvement.

**Reranker-groundtruth alignment**: The degree to which reranker predictions match actual relevance judgments, which becomes more important than embedding quality at high reranker budgets; quick check: measure correlation between reranker scores and ground truth.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Document embeddings -> Proximity graph construction -> Greedy search prioritization -> Reranking selection -> Final ranking

**Critical path**: Initial document retrieval → Proximity graph building → Document similarity computation → Greedy prioritization → Reranker application → Final ranking

**Design tradeoffs**: RGS trades computational overhead of building and maintaining proximity graphs for improved retrieval accuracy. The method prioritizes accuracy over speed, making it suitable for applications where retrieval quality is paramount.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance when document embeddings fail to capture semantic similarity, when proximity graphs are poorly constructed, or when greedy search makes suboptimal prioritization decisions. Also fails when reranker-groundtruth alignment is low.

**Three first experiments**:
1. Compare RGS against sequential reranking on reasoning-intensive datasets with varying reranker budgets
2. Test robustness by introducing controlled perturbations to query embeddings
3. Measure computational overhead of proximity graph construction and maintenance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, though it leaves several implicit research directions unexplored, particularly regarding generalization to non-reasoning-intensive tasks and the computational efficiency of the approach.

## Limitations
- Reliance on initial document embedding quality, though claims robustness to perturbations
- Performance may degrade on non-reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks
- Computational overhead of building and maintaining proximity graphs not fully addressed
- Limited analysis of generalization beyond reasoning-intensive tasks
- No explicit discussion of scalability to very large document collections

## Confidence

**High**: Experimental results on reasoning-intensive datasets, core methodology of RGS

**Medium**: Claims about robustness to query embedding perturbations, superiority over sequential reranking in all cases

**Low**: Generalization to non-reasoning-intensive tasks, computational efficiency claims, scalability to large document collections

## Next Checks

1. Test RGS on non-reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks to assess generalizability
2. Measure and report the computational overhead of building and maintaining proximity graphs
3. Conduct ablation studies varying the quality of initial document embeddings to quantify impact on RGS performance
4. Evaluate scalability to large document collections with millions of documents
