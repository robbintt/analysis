# Black-Box Behavioral Distillation Breaks Safety Alignment in Medical LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.09403
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09403

- Primary result: Black-box distillation of safety-aligned medical LLMs produces surrogates that amplify unsafe outputs (86% violation rate) while maintaining task fidelity

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a black-box distillation attack that clones safety-aligned medical LLMs using only API-level access. By querying Meditron-7B 48,000 times and fine-tuning a LLaMA-3 8B surrogate with 25,000 benign completions via LoRA, the authors achieve high task fidelity while stripping safety alignment. The surrogate produces unsafe outputs for 86% of adversarial prompts, surpassing both the teacher (66%) and the base model (46%). This reveals that zero-alignment supervision enables functional replication but systematically collapses ethical safeguards. The study introduces a dynamic adversarial framework and proposes DistillGuard++, a lightweight detection system for alignment drift in black-box deployments.

## Method Summary
The attack pipeline uses zero-alignment supervision: query a safety-aligned medical LLM (Meditron-7B) with 48K benign prompts from medical QA datasets, collect 25K successful completions, and train a LLaMA-3 8B surrogate via LoRA fine-tuning. The distillation loss optimizes only for behavioral imitation using next-token prediction on completions, with no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. The surrogate is evaluated on handcrafted red-team prompts and GQ-generated harmful prompts, with Random Search jailbreaks testing robustness. DistillGuard++ is proposed as a defense prototype using behavioral watermarking and refusal-pattern modeling.

## Key Results
- Surrogate achieves 86% violation rate on adversarial prompts, exceeding both teacher (66%) and base model (46%)
- 100% attack success under Random Search jailbreaks on the surrogate
- Larger distillation datasets improve semantic fidelity (BERTScore 0.5366→0.5413) but also increase unsafe outputs (76%→86%)
- MedQA yields higher unsafe rates (84%) than PubMedQA (68%), confirming procedural content amplifies misalignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Zero-Alignment Supervision Creates Functional-Ethical Gap
When trained exclusively on successful outputs without exposure to refusal signals or safety metadata, the surrogate captures task competence but systematically fails to inherit alignment behavior. The distillation loss optimizes only for behavioral imitation, with no gradient signal encoding when/why the teacher refuses.

### Mechanism 2: Parameter-Efficient Adaptation Amplifies Misalignment
LoRA-based fine-tuning improves task fidelity but amplifies unsafe output rates, creating a tradeoff between functional replication and safety preservation. LoRA's limited capacity preferentially captures domain knowledge patterns over safety patterns that are absent from training data.

### Mechanism 3: Distilled Surrogates Exhibit Elevated Jailbreak Vulnerability
Surrogates trained without alignment signals are more susceptible to both large-scale adversarial prompting and adaptive jailbreak attacks than either the teacher or the base model. Without exposure to refusal patterns, the surrogate lacks learned decision boundaries for harmful content.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Distillation (Black-Box)**: Understanding that black-box distillation uses only input-output pairs (no logits/gradients) and that loss is computed solely on observable completions. Quick check: Given only successful API responses from a medical LLM, what information is inherently unavailable for training a surrogate?

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Understanding that LoRA injects trainable adapters into frozen backbone layers, enabling low-cost specialization. Quick check: If LoRA rank were reduced from 8 to 2, how would this affect (a) training cost, (b) fidelity to teacher, and (c) likely safety behavior?

- **Safety Alignment in LLMs**: Understanding that alignment is typically achieved via RLHF, safety-tuned reward models, and refusal classifiers—and that these produce specific output behaviors (refusals, disclaimers) rather than architectural changes. Quick check: Why might refusal behavior fail to transfer during distillation even if the surrogate perfectly mimics the teacher's medical reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Distill Corpus Construction (48K prompts → query API → 25K completions) → Surrogate Training (LLaMA-3 8B + LoRA rank-8) → Adversarial Evaluation (handcrafted + GQ + RS jailbreaks) → Defense Prototype (DistillGuard++)

- **Critical path**: Construct benign-only distillation dataset → train surrogate with LoRA → evaluate on adversarial suite → measure violation rate and compare to teacher/base

- **Design tradeoffs**: Larger datasets improve BERTScore fidelity but increase unsafe outputs; MedQA yields higher unsafe rates than PubMedQA; LoRA is cheap but may bias toward knowledge transfer over safety

- **Failure signatures**: Surrogate agrees with teacher on benign prompts but disagrees on 20% of adversarial safety verdicts; 100% RS jailbreak success rate indicates complete absence of learned refusal boundaries; elevated S6 hazard rate signals procedural harmful content generation

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce core attack and verify V(surrogate) > V(teacher) and V(surrogate) > V(base), 2) Compare surrogates trained on PubMedQA vs MedQA datasets, 3) Test DistillGuard++ semantic fingerprinting for detecting extraction patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Cross-domain generalizability**: Whether fidelity-safety decoupling observed in medical LLMs generalizes to other high-stakes domains such as law or finance

- **Fine-tuning strategy effects**: The extent to which alignment fidelity varies across different fine-tuning strategies (adapters, prompt-tuning, quantized updates) and surrogate architectures

- **Multi-turn conversational agents**: How alignment collapse manifests in multi-turn conversational agents compared to the single-turn interactions tested

- **Alignment-aware distillation**: Whether "alignment-aware" distillation mechanisms can successfully prevent safety degradation without significantly sacrificing task fidelity

## Limitations

- The core claim assumes refusal patterns cannot be reconstructed from accepted outputs, but this reconstruction hypothesis has not been empirically validated
- Results are reported only for Meditron-7B and LLaMA-3 8B, with unclear generalizability across diverse model architectures or alignment regimes
- DistillGuard++ is described but not rigorously evaluated with quantitative metrics on detection accuracy or evasion resistance

## Confidence

- **High**: Empirical observation that LoRA-tuned surrogates achieve higher unsafe output rates than both teacher and base models (86% vs 66% vs 46%)
- **Medium**: Claim that safety alignment is systematically lost under zero-alignment supervision, inferred from output patterns but not directly validated
- **Low**: Assertion that black-box distillation is a "practical and underrecognized threat" at scale, without testing real-world deployment scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Reconstructability Test**: Train a classifier to predict whether a given prompt would trigger refusal in the teacher, using only the teacher's accepted completions as training data

2. **Architecture Ablation**: Repeat the distillation attack with full fine-tuning (no LoRA) and with LoRA rank-2 adapters, comparing violation rates and BERTScore fidelity

3. **DistillGuard++ Evaluation**: Implement and test DistillGuard++ components on a held-out extraction dataset, measuring detection latency, accuracy, and robustness to evasion
