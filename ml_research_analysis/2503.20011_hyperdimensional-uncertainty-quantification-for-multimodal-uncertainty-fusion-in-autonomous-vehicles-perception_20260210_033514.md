# Hyperdimensional Uncertainty Quantification for Multimodal Uncertainty Fusion in Autonomous Vehicles Perception

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.20011
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20011
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** HyperDUM achieves up to 2.01%/1.27% improvement in AP/mIoU over state-of-the-art methods under diverse weather conditions while requiring 2.36× less FLOPs and up to 38.30× fewer parameters.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HyperDUM, a deterministic uncertainty quantification method for multimodal autonomous driving perception. The method leverages hyperdimensional computing to capture epistemic uncertainty at the feature fusion level through channel-wise and patch-wise projection and bundling techniques. HyperDUM quantifies uncertainty by measuring the similarity between projected hypervectors and learned prototypes, then uses this uncertainty to weight features before multimodal fusion. The approach is evaluated on 3D object detection (aiMotive) and semantic segmentation (DeLiVer) tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to existing uncertainty-aware fusion methods.

## Method Summary
HyperDUM operates by projecting multimodal features into hyperdimensional space using Random Fourier Features, then computing uncertainty through similarity to learned prototypes representing different environmental contexts. The method employs two projection strategies: Channel-wise Projection & Bundling (CPB) and Patch-wise Projection & Bundling (PPB) to preserve spatial and channel-specific uncertainty information. Uncertainty scores are generated through cosine similarity between projected features and prototype hypervectors, then converted to weights that modulate features before fusion. The system is trained by freezing backbone feature extractors and optimizing only the uncertainty weighting and post-fusion layers.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 2.01% improvement in average precision (AP) and 1.27% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) over state-of-the-art methods
- Requires 2.36× fewer floating point operations (FLOPs) compared to competing uncertainty-aware fusion methods
- Uses up to 38.30× fewer parameters while maintaining or improving accuracy
- Demonstrates superior performance under diverse weather conditions and corner cases
- Shows robustness to sensor degradation through uncertainty-weighted feature modulation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hyperdimensional Similarity as Uncertainty Proxy
The method approximates epistemic uncertainty by measuring cosine similarity between a sample's projected hypervector and learned prototypes representing known contexts. When similarity is low, the input is flagged as high uncertainty (out-of-distribution). This works because high-dimensional spaces preserve semantic structure, making dissimilar inputs nearly orthogonal. The core assumption is that random projection preserves the distance relationships needed for uncertainty estimation. Break conditions include non-orthonormal projection matrices causing "cross-talk" interference that corrupts the similarity signal.

### Mechanism 2: Granular Projection (CPB & PPB)
Channel-wise and Patch-wise Projection & Bundling preserve spatial and channel independence during projection, preventing averaging-out of localized noise features. CPB treats channels independently to weigh feature maps differently, while PPB slices features into patches to localize spatial uncertainty. The core assumption is that different feature channels and spatial regions have heterogeneous uncertainty distributions that global averaging would obscure. Break conditions include patch sizes that are too small or hyperdimensions that are too low, causing sparsity and overfitting to noise.

### Mechanism 3: Pre-Fusion Uncertainty-Weighting
Modulating sensor features based on uncertainty before fusion prevents propagation of corrupt modalities into shared representations. The uncertainty score acts as a gate that scales feature vectors, reducing the weight of highly uncertain modalities. The core assumption is that multimodal fusion networks are vulnerable to "poisoning" by single noisy modalities if features are fused uniformly. Break conditions include scenarios where all modalities report high uncertainty simultaneously, potentially suppressing all inputs and leading to null predictions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) / Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)**
  - *Why needed:* This is the mathematical engine of the paper, representing data using large, near-orthogonal vectors with operations like bundling (superposition) and binding (association).
  - *Quick check:* If you bundle two hypervectors $A$ and $B$, how can you check if the resulting vector $C$ is more similar to $A$ than to a random vector $X$?

- **Concept: Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty**
  - *Why needed:* The paper explicitly targets epistemic uncertainty (model ignorance/lack of data) rather than aleatoric (noise inherent in data). Confusing the two leads to misinterpretation.
  - *Quick check:* Does a deterministic method like HyperDUM capture the noise in sensor data (aleatoric) or the model's lack of training examples for specific corner cases (epistemic)?

- **Concept: Multimodal Fusion Architectures (BEVFusion / CMNeXt)**
  - *Why needed:* HyperDUM is a plug-in module that needs to be inserted at the "pre-fusion" point in these architectures.
  - *Quick check:* In a BEVFusion model, why is feature concatenation considered a "pre-fusion" point suitable for uncertainty weighting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Backbone encoders -> HyperDUM Module (Projection, Prototypes, Similarity) -> Weighting Layer -> Fusion Head
- **Critical path:** Initialization of Projection Matrix ($\Phi$) and definition of Context Labels for prototypes. Poor prototype definition or non-orthogonal projections break uncertainty estimation.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Higher hyperdimension ($d$) improves accuracy but increases FLOPs linearly; more patches ($P$) allow finer spatial uncertainty but require lower per-patch dimensions for efficiency.
- **Failure signatures:** Over-confidence in OOD scenarios, dimensionality collapse with low $d$, and uniform uncertainty scores from prototype incoherence.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Prototype Validity Check: Remove prototypes for one weather type and verify uncertainty scores spike for that type.
  2. Ablation on Projection: Compare standard random projection vs. Random Fourier Features to confirm expressivity claims.
  3. Visualization: Generate uncertainty heatmaps to confirm high uncertainty correlates with corrupted regions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can HyperDUM be adapted to utilize semi-supervised or unsupervised prototype formation to eliminate dependency on labeled scenarios? The authors note that needing labels is the "primary limitation" and leave this for future work.
- **Open Question 2:** What specific latency reductions can be achieved by implementing HyperDUM on hardware accelerators designed for massively parallel operations? The paper notes FLOPs may be further reduced due to parallel operations but doesn't provide hardware-specific benchmarks.
- **Open Question 3:** How does the method's uncertainty estimation robustness hold when input data distribution drifts significantly from pre-defined labeled prototypes? The method's reliance on scenario-specific prototypes raises questions about generalization to truly unseen environmental conditions.

## Limitations

- **Labeled prototypes dependency:** The method requires scenario labels for prototype formation, limiting scalability to datasets without granular metadata.
- **OOD generalization uncertainty:** Performance in completely unseen environmental conditions (e.g., snow, sandstorm) remains unverified and could reveal limitations in the uncertainty estimation mechanism.
- **Prototype completeness assumption:** The method assumes the prototype bank captures all relevant scenarios, but real-world driving may present novel combinations not represented in training.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Computational efficiency claims (2.36× fewer FLOPs, 38.30× fewer parameters) are well-supported by ablation studies and theoretical analysis.
- **Medium Confidence:** Accuracy improvements (2.01% AP, 1.29% mIoU) are credible given ablation results and intuitive pre-fusion weighting mechanism.
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization of uncertainty estimation to OOD scenarios is the weakest claim, as the paper doesn't test on truly unseen environmental classes.

## Next Checks

1. **OOD Robustness Test:** Hold out one weather condition (e.g., "Snow") from prototype formation and verify uncertainty scores spike for that class.
2. **Hyperdimension Sensitivity Analysis:** Re-run experiments with $d = 5,000$ and $d = 20,000$ to confirm the 10k optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.
3. **Visualization of Uncertainty Maps:** Generate spatial uncertainty heatmaps for Patch-wise method on validation images with known degradation to confirm high uncertainty correlates with corrupted patches.
