# Lessons from Neuroscience for AI: How integrating Actions, Compositional Structure and Episodic Memory could enable Safe, Interpretable and Human-Like AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.22568
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22568
- Authors: Rajesh P. N. Rao; Vishwas Sathish; Linxing Preston Jiang; Matthew Bryan; Prashant Rangarajan
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: The paper identifies three missing components in current transformer-based foundation models—actions, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory—arguing their absence limits grounding, interpretability, and energy efficiency.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes augmenting transformer-based foundation models with three brain-inspired components to address critical limitations in grounding, interpretability, hallucinations, and energy efficiency. Drawing from predictive coding and active inference frameworks in neuroscience, the authors argue that current models lack integrated actions, compositional hierarchical structure, and episodic memory. They propose a modular architecture combining hierarchical state-prediction networks, explicit policy networks for control and grounded learning, and episodic memory systems for long-term context and continual learning.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a theoretical framework for integrating neuroscience principles into foundation models through three key mechanisms: hierarchical Active Predictive Coding with separate policy networks, compositional structure via hypernetworks, and writable episodic memory with prediction-error-driven storage. The architecture consists of state-prediction networks organized hierarchically across multiple timescales, explicit policy networks generating external and internal actions, efference copy connections between world models and policies, and an episodic memory module for storing salient experiences. The proposed system aims to enable grounded learning, compositional generalization, and continual learning through offline replay phases.

## Key Results
- Current transformer models lack three critical components: integrated actions, compositional structure, and episodic memory
- Separating policy networks from state-prediction networks could improve transfer and grounding compared to monolithic approaches
- Hierarchical composition with multi-timescale processing enables reusable sub-task abstractions
- Episodic memory with prediction-error-driven storage enables continual learning through replay-based consolidation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Active Predictive Coding with Separate Policy Networks
- Claim: Integrating dedicated policy networks with state-prediction networks enables grounded learning and agency.
- Mechanism: Policy networks output actions that are fed to world model networks as "efference copies." The world model predicts next sensory states given current states and actions. Prediction errors signal mismatches between expected and actual outcomes, enabling grounded error detection.
- Core assumption: Separating action generation from state prediction improves transfer across tasks compared to mixing them in a single generative model.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Compositional Structure via Hypernetworks
- Claim: Hierarchical state-action representations with multi-timescale processing enable compositional generalization and efficient planning.
- Mechanism: Higher-level state/action vectors generate lower-level transition functions and policy functions through hypernetworks. Lower levels execute faster timescales; higher levels modulate at slower timescales. This creates reusable sub-task abstractions ("options" in RL terms).
- Core assumption: Complex tasks decompose into reusable compositional elements whose transition dynamics can be learned separately.

### Mechanism 3: Writable Episodic Memory with Prediction-Error-Driven Storage
- Claim: Augmenting models with writable episodic memory enables long-term context, replay-based consolidation, and continual learning.
- Mechanism: Salient episodes (flagged by prediction errors/surprise) are stored in external memory. During offline "sleep" phases, compositional playback of memory snippets trains the model on novel combinations, enabling generalization to unseen scenarios.
- Core assumption: Prediction error signals identify which experiences are worth storing; replay with compositional mixing improves generalization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Predictive Coding / Free Energy Minimization
  - Why needed here: The entire proposal builds on predictive coding theory—the brain minimizes prediction errors for both inference (fast state updates) and learning (slow weight updates). Without this, the motivation for hierarchical error signals and surprise-driven memory storage is unclear.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how prediction errors differ from simple loss gradients, and why they're computed at each hierarchical level?

- Concept: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Options Framework)
  - Why needed here: The paper's hierarchical action decomposition directly maps to HRL concepts—temporally extended actions ("options"), sub-goal policies, and multi-timescale credit assignment.
  - Quick check question: How does an "option" in HRL differ from a primitive action, and what advantage does this provide for long-horizon tasks?

- Concept: World Models and Model-Based RL
  - Why needed here: The state-prediction networks are explicitly world models that learn transition dynamics. Understanding model-based vs model-free RL clarifies why the authors advocate separating world models from policy networks.
  - Quick check question: In model-based RL, how does a learned transition model enable planning, and what failure mode occurs if the model is inaccurate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Inputs → Hierarchical State Prediction Networks (process across timescales) ↔ Policy Networks (generate actions) → Efference copies update predictions → Episodic Memory stores prediction-error-flagged episodes → Offline replay updates model weights

- Critical path: Inputs flow through hierarchical state-prediction networks, which exchange information with policy networks via efference copies. Policy outputs drive actions, while prediction errors guide learning. Episodic memory stores salient episodes for later replay during offline consolidation phases.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Separating LLM from world model vs. integrating LLM as one hierarchical level: Separation allows modular upgrades but adds interface complexity
  - Memory capacity vs. retrieval precision: Larger memory stores more episodes but increases retrieval noise
  - Hierarchical depth vs. optimization difficulty: More levels enable finer temporal abstraction but complicate credit assignment

- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucinations persist: Prediction errors not properly signaling implausible inferences; check efference copy routing
  - Poor generalization on compositional tasks: Hierarchical decomposition failing; verify hypernetwork function generation
  - Catastrophic forgetting: Episodic memory not triggering replay; check prediction-error thresholds for storage
  - "Lost in the middle" retrieval: Memory retrieval not content-structured; implement event boundary detection

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate state-prediction + policy separation: Train on simple control tasks (e.g., 2D navigation) comparing joint generative model vs. separated APC architecture; measure transfer to new maze configurations
  2. Test hierarchical composition: Verify that rooms/corridors learned in one building transfer to novel buildings; measure zero-shot navigation success rates
  3. Evaluate episodic memory replay: After training on task sequence A→B→C, test performance on A after "sleep" phase with compositional replay; compare against no-replay baseline for forgetting metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does explicitly separating policy networks from hierarchical state-prediction networks in foundation models improve grounding and reduce hallucinations more effectively than monolithic reinforcement learning (RLHF) approaches?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors critique current models for mixing sensory states and actions, and propose a modular architecture (Figure 4) that segregates world models from policy networks to facilitate transfer and grounding.
- **Why unresolved:** While the authors provide a theoretical framework (Active Predictive Coding), empirical validation of this specific modular separation at the scale of foundation models is lacking.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative benchmarks showing that modular architectures outperform monolithic RLHF agents on tasks requiring physical reasoning and causal intervention.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can a "sleep" phase utilizing episodic memory replay enable continual learning in foundation models without inducing catastrophic forgetting?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors suggest that models could emulate biological sleep consolidation by using stored episodic memories for "compositional playback" to update knowledge during offline periods.
- **Why unresolved:** Transformers are generally static after training; effective mechanisms for dynamically integrating new information from episodic buffers without destabilizing pre-trained weights remain undefined.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A model that successfully integrates new data post-deployment via memory replay while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Do hierarchical predictive coding mechanisms provide superior out-of-distribution generalization compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors hypothesize that hierarchical predictive coding will be "significantly more robust to compositional generalization" than monolithic architectures relying on CoT, which they note fails on tasks like ARC-AGI-2.
- **Why unresolved:** It is currently unclear if explicit hierarchical structure offers generalization advantages over the implicit reasoning elicited by CoT in large-scale models.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Head-to-head evaluations on compositional generalization benchmarks (e.g., ARC-AGI-2) showing hierarchical models solving tasks where CoT methods fail.

## Limitations

- The proposal lacks concrete implementation details for critical components including specific network architectures, loss formulations, and memory selection mechanisms
- No quantitative metrics or benchmarks are formally defined for evaluating the proposed improvements
- The theoretical framework assumes benefits will emerge without empirical validation of the specific combination
- The paper does not specify how to interface with or replace existing LLMs

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The identification of current transformer limitations (hallucinations, poor grounding, energy inefficiency) is well-supported by existing literature and practical observations. The neuroscience grounding in predictive coding theory is sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: The conceptual architecture combining hierarchical predictive coding, explicit policy networks, and episodic memory is plausible based on neuroscience and RL literature, but specific implementation details are underspecified.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that this specific combination will dramatically improve safety, interpretability, and human-like reasoning without introducing new failure modes or computational overhead is speculative without empirical validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation of mechanism separation**: Implement a controlled comparison between joint generative models and separated state-prediction + policy networks on simple transfer tasks. Measure whether separation improves zero-shot generalization to new task configurations.

2. **Hierarchical composition testing**: Design experiments to verify that learned compositional abstractions (rooms/corridors, object parts) actually transfer to novel configurations. Track both success rates and learning efficiency across compositional splits.

3. **Episodic memory consolidation evaluation**: Test whether prediction-error-driven storage and offline replay actually prevent catastrophic forgetting on sequential task learning. Compare retention after "sleep" phases with and without compositional replay against parametric learning baselines.
