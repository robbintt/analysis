# Automated Boilerplate: Prevalence and Quality of Contract Generators in the Context of Swiss Privacy Policies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05860
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05860
- Reference count: 40
- 18% of Swiss websites explicitly reference automated contract generators, with generator-generated policies showing 10-15 percentage point higher compliance gains post-2023 Swiss privacy law revision

## Executive Summary
This study examines the role of automated contract generators in Swiss privacy policy compliance, finding that 18% of local websites explicitly reference such tools. A novel multilingual LLM-based compliance assessment method is developed and validated against human annotations, achieving F1 scores above 0.93 for most dimensions. Analysis of 150,000 websites reveals that generator-generated policies experienced compliance increases of up to 15 percentage points compared to manually drafted ones following the 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. The findings suggest automated tools can improve access to justice for small businesses, though risks related to default settings and standardization remain.

## Method Summary
The study employs a novel multilingual LLM-based approach for compliance assessment, validated against a human-annotated dataset of 120 privacy policies across four languages. The methodology involves detecting explicit generator references, analyzing compliance patterns before and after the 2023 Swiss privacy law revision, and comparing generator-generated policies with manually drafted ones across 150,000 websites. The LLM model achieves high F1 scores (>0.93) for most compliance dimensions, enabling large-scale analysis of privacy policy quality and the impact of automated tools on regulatory compliance.

## Key Results
- 18% of Swiss websites explicitly reference contract generators, predominantly smaller sites and those in German
- Generator-generated policies show 10-15 percentage point higher compliance gains compared to manually drafted policies post-2023 Swiss privacy law revision
- The 2023 Swiss privacy law revision led to higher compliance levels, particularly among websites without prior GDPR exposure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's mechanism relies on the systematic detection of generator references combined with automated compliance assessment to quantify the relationship between tool usage and regulatory outcomes. By validating the LLM approach against human annotations, the research establishes a scalable method for measuring compliance across large populations of privacy policies. The longitudinal analysis before and after the Swiss privacy law revision provides causal evidence for how automated tools facilitate regulatory compliance, particularly among smaller websites that may lack legal resources.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multilingual LLM compliance detection**: Why needed - enables large-scale assessment across language barriers; Quick check - validate F1 scores against human annotations
- **Generator attribution detection**: Why needed - distinguishes automated from manual policy creation; Quick check - verify detection accuracy on known generator outputs
- **Longitudinal compliance analysis**: Why needed - captures regulatory impact over time; Quick check - compare pre/post revision compliance patterns
- **Cross-jurisdictional comparison**: Why needed - isolates effects of specific regulatory changes; Quick check - contrast Swiss versus EU compliance trajectories
- **Small business compliance assessment**: Why needed - evaluates access to justice implications; Quick check - correlate generator usage with website size metrics
- **Default setting analysis**: Why needed - identifies standardization risks; Quick check - compare compliance across different generator tools

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Website crawling -> Generator reference detection -> Privacy policy extraction -> LLM compliance assessment -> Longitudinal analysis -> Compliance comparison

**Critical path**: Generator reference detection → Privacy policy extraction → LLM compliance assessment → Compliance comparison

**Design tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes scalability through automated detection over comprehensive legal verification, enabling analysis of 150,000 websites but potentially missing nuanced compliance issues that human review would catch.

**Failure signatures**: Undercounting generator usage due to missing attribution, overestimation of compliance improvements due to selection bias among generator users, confounding factors from concurrent market changes affecting both generator adoption and compliance.

**First experiments**: 1) Validate generator detection accuracy on a stratified sample of policies with known origins; 2) Test LLM compliance assessment on policies with varying quality levels to establish reliability bounds; 3) Conduct sensitivity analysis varying the threshold for generator attribution detection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The 18% figure may underestimate actual generator usage as many tools embed policies without visible attribution
- Compliance assessment relies on proxy indicators rather than full legal compliance verification
- Temporal analysis assumes observed changes directly result from the 2023 Swiss privacy law revision, though other concurrent factors may contribute

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Methodology for detecting generator usage and measuring compliance changes due to robust validation and large sample sizes
- **Medium confidence**: Finding that generator-generated policies show 10-15 percentage point higher compliance gains, potentially affected by selection effects
- **Low confidence**: Interpretation that generators improve access to justice for small businesses due to potential confounding factors and inability to establish causation

## Next Checks
1) Conduct qualitative interviews with website owners to verify the relationship between generator usage and observed compliance improvements
2) Expand compliance validation to include manual review of a stratified sample of policies across all dimensions assessed
3) Perform A/B testing comparing policies generated by different tools with identical input parameters to isolate tool-specific effects from user choices
