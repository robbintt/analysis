# Data Complexity Measures for Quantum Circuits Architecture Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15129
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15129
- Authors: Fernando M de Paula Neto
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieved 100% accuracy in identifying optimal quantum circuit architecture using data complexity measures

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel method for selecting optimal quantum circuit architectures for classification tasks by leveraging data complexity measures from classical machine learning. The approach uses database complexity metrics to recommend both the circuit layer type and the number of layer repetitions needed for effective quantum classification. Six quantum parametric circuit layers were evaluated across 14 datasets with varying dimensions and class counts, demonstrating strong performance in architecture selection.

The study found that individual complexity measures outperformed using all measures together, with T2 (data sparsity) being optimal for circuit selection and N2 (boundary complexity) for determining layer count. Sixteen classical classifiers and twelve regressors were employed in the recommendation processor, showing that data complexity measures can effectively guide quantum circuit design decisions.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses classical data complexity measures to recommend quantum circuit architectures for classification tasks. Six different quantum parametric circuit layers were evaluated, with the recommendation system using 16 classical classifiers to identify the optimal circuit layer type based on data complexity metrics. For determining the appropriate number of layer repetitions, 12 regressors were employed to predict the optimal count. The approach was tested across 14 datasets with varying dimensional characteristics, demonstrating that data complexity measures can effectively guide both circuit selection and parameter determination.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% accuracy in identifying the optimal quantum circuit for all tested problems
- Mean absolute error of 0.80 ± 2.17 in predicting the number of layer repetitions
- Individual complexity measures outperformed using all measures together (T2 optimal for circuit selection, N2 for layer count)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by translating classical data complexity characteristics into quantum circuit design requirements. Data complexity measures capture intrinsic properties of the classification problem such as class separability, boundary complexity, and data distribution characteristics. These properties directly influence the quantum circuit's need for expressiveness, depth, and parameter optimization. By mapping classical complexity metrics to quantum circuit requirements, the approach creates a bridge between problem characteristics and circuit architecture, enabling systematic design rather than trial-and-error approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- Data complexity measures (why needed: quantify problem difficulty; quick check: calculate F1, N1, T1, T2, L1, L2, N2, C1, C2 metrics)
- Quantum parametric circuit layers (why needed: building blocks for quantum classification; quick check: verify circuit depth and parameter count)
- Classification problem characterization (why needed: understand problem requirements; quick check: count features, classes, and instances)
- Classical-to-quantum mapping (why needed: translate problem properties to circuit design; quick check: validate mapping consistency)
- Layer repetition optimization (why needed: balance accuracy and resource efficiency; quick check: monitor error reduction per layer)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data Complexity Measures -> Classical Classifier/Regressor -> Quantum Circuit Recommendation
Critical path: Calculate complexity metrics → Select optimal classifier/regressor → Determine circuit architecture → Train and evaluate
Design tradeoffs: Individual vs. combined measures (individual performed better but may miss interactions); depth vs. accuracy (more layers increase expressivity but also noise sensitivity)
Failure signatures: Poor accuracy with high-complexity datasets; overfitting with excessive layer counts; inconsistent recommendations across similar problems
First experiments:
1. Calculate all eight complexity measures on a simple binary classification dataset
2. Test T2 measure alone for circuit selection on one dataset
3. Compare individual vs. combined measure performance on a 3-class problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize beyond tested dataset sizes and quantum circuit configurations
- 100% accuracy and low error predictions may not hold for larger, more complex datasets
- Focus on 14 specific datasets limits external validity of findings
- Performance on actual quantum hardware versus simulators remains untested

## Confidence
- Methodology effectiveness: High
- Practical applicability: Medium
- Scalability assessment: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the methodology on larger datasets (100+ features) and higher-dimensional problems to assess scalability and performance degradation
2. Implement the approach on actual quantum hardware rather than simulators to evaluate practical feasibility and noise effects
3. Validate the method across diverse problem domains (beyond classification) such as regression and clustering tasks to test generalizability
