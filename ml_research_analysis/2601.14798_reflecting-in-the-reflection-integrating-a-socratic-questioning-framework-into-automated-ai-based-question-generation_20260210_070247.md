# Reflecting in the Reflection: Integrating a Socratic Questioning Framework into Automated AI-Based Question Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14798
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14798
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: Two-agent Socratic dialogue improves reflection question quality over one-shot generation, with dynamic stopping and contextual inputs further boosting relevance and depth.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of generating high-quality reflection questions in educational settings, where time constraints and varying teacher expertise hinder consistent production of deep, pedagogically sound prompts. The authors propose a "reflection-in-reflection" framework using two role-specialized LLM agents: a Student-Teacher that generates and revises questions, and a Teacher-Educator that iteratively refines them through Socratic questioning. Evaluated on an authentic lower-secondary ICT topic using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4 as evaluator, the framework shows that iterative dialogue significantly improves question relevance, depth, and overall quality compared to one-shot baselines, with dynamic stopping and contextual information further enhancing outcomes.

## Method Summary
The framework employs two role-specialized LLM agents—Student-Teacher and Teacher-Educator—engaged in iterative Socratic dialogue to refine reflection questions. Given a topic, key concepts, and optional student level or materials, the Student-Teacher proposes an initial question and revises it based on the Teacher-Educator's Socratic prompts or approval ("Great question!"). Three regimes are tested: dynamic stopping (DYN), five iterations (F05), and ten iterations (F10). An external GPT-4-class model evaluates question pairs across clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality using pairwise comparisons and normalized preference scores. The study focuses on a lower-secondary ICT topic with 12 configurations and 3,300 total evaluations.

## Key Results
- Iterative refinement via two-agent Socratic dialogue produces questions rated significantly higher in relevance, depth, and overall quality than one-shot generation.
- Dynamic stopping (DYN) outperforms fixed iteration limits, balancing quality gains with efficiency.
- Contextual inputs (student level, instructional materials) improve question relevance and depth.
- Optimal stopping typically occurs earlier than fixed iteration endpoints; extended refinement risks over-complication.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages role-specialization and iterative dialogue to mimic effective teacher-student interactions. The Teacher-Educator's Socratic prompts guide the Student-Teacher to deepen, clarify, or broaden questions without overwhelming them, while the dynamic stopping condition prevents over-refinement. This mirrors authentic pedagogical practices where reflection questions are co-constructed and refined through dialogue, ensuring questions remain accessible yet conceptually rich.

## Foundational Learning
- **Socratic questioning**: Asking probing questions to stimulate critical thinking; needed to guide question refinement without giving answers; quick check: prompts include stems like "What do you mean by…?" or "How does this relate to…?"
- **Iterative dialogue**: Repeated exchanges between agents; needed to gradually improve question quality; quick check: each turn produces one revised question or approval signal.
- **Pairwise LLM evaluation**: Comparing two outputs at a time using a stronger model; needed to fairly assess subtle quality differences; quick check: normalized preference scores derived from {-2,-1,1,2} judgments.
- **Dynamic stopping**: Halting the process when quality is deemed sufficient; needed to balance quality and efficiency; quick check: Teacher-Educator outputs "Great question!" to terminate.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Topic+Concepts -> Student-Teacher (initial) -> Teacher-Educator (Socratic prompt) -> Student-Teacher (revise) -> ... -> Final Question -> GPT-4 Evaluator

**Critical Path**: Generate initial question → Iterative Socratic refinement → Dynamic stopping or fixed iterations → External pairwise evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Two specialized agents enable focused refinement but require careful prompt design; dynamic stopping optimizes quality/efficiency but depends on reliable stopping signals; external evaluator ensures objectivity but may not fully align with human judgments.

**Failure Signatures**: Relevance drops in F10 regime due to Teacher-Educator shifting to classroom orchestration; over-complication from extended refinement; unclear if results generalize beyond single ICT topic.

**First Experiments**: 1) Implement and test two-agent prompt templates with sample topics; 2) Run dialogue loop with DYN, F05, F10 regimes on sample questions; 3) Conduct pairwise evaluations using GPT-4 on small question sets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Does the framework produce questions teachers and students judge as superior in live classroom settings compared to one-shot baselines? Basis: Authors explicitly call for classroom studies with direct teacher/student assessment. Unresolved because all evaluations used LLM-based judges, not authentic instructional contexts. Evidence needed: Within-subjects classroom study with teacher/student ratings and qualitative feedback.

**Open Question 2**: How does the framework perform with advanced reasoning-oriented LLMs (e.g., o1-class) versus lightweight GPT-4o-mini? Basis: Authors identify comparing against reasoning-oriented LLMs as an important next step. Unresolved because only GPT-4o-mini was tested. Evidence needed: Pairwise evaluations using both backbones, measuring interaction vs. model capacity effects.

**Open Question 3**: Does the protocol generalize to domains beyond ICT, such as humanities or STEM disciplines with different reflective norms? Basis: Experiments limited to single ICT topic; no cross-disciplinary evidence. Unresolved because domain-specific conventions may require different Socratic moves. Evidence needed: Replication across at least 2–3 additional subjects using domain-appropriate materials.

**Open Question 4**: Can hybrid human–LLM evaluation setups validly capture classroom usefulness while retaining scalability? Basis: Authors propose mixed evaluation setups as future direction. Unresolved because pure LLM evaluation may misalign with human judgments, while pure human evaluation doesn't scale. Evidence needed: Correlation analysis between LLM and human ratings, followed by calibrated hybrid scoring.

## Limitations
- Exact prompt formulations for both agents are not specified in the paper and must be retrieved from the referenced code repository.
- Evaluation relies entirely on LLM-based pairwise comparisons, which may introduce bias or inconsistencies.
- Preprocessing of instructional materials (PDFs, slides) into LLM input format is unspecified.
- Single-topic evaluation limits generalizability to other domains or educational contexts.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Overall framework design and empirical finding that iterative refinement improves question quality.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that dynamic stopping outperforms fixed limits, and that contextual inputs improve relevance.
- **Low Confidence**: Assertions about broad applicability or scalability across diverse educational contexts.

## Next Checks
1. Retrieve and test exact prompt formulations from the code repository to confirm alignment with described methodology.
2. Re-run pairwise comparisons with multiple LLM evaluators to assess consistency and potential bias.
3. Clarify and test preprocessing pipeline for instructional materials to ensure faithful reproduction of study conditions.
