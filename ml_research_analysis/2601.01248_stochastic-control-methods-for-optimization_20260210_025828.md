core_contribution: This work develops stochastic control methods for global optimization
  over both finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces and the Wasserstein space of probability
  measures. The core idea is to reformulate the original minimization problem as the
  limit of regularized stochastic control problems, using dynamic programming to analyze
  the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.

# Stochastic Control Methods for Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01248
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01248
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Stochastic control reformulation achieves global optimization convergence rate O(ε ln(1/ε)) in Euclidean spaces

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a novel approach to global optimization using stochastic control theory, reformulating minimization problems as regularized stochastic control problems whose limits recover the original objectives. The method employs dynamic programming and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, with the Cole-Hopf transformation and Feynman-Kac formula providing tractable probabilistic representations. The approach is shown to work for both finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces and the Wasserstein space of probability measures, with convergence established as the regularization parameter approaches zero.

## Method Summary
The core methodology reformulates global optimization as the limit of regularized stochastic control problems. For Euclidean spaces, this involves solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation through the Cole-Hopf transformation, yielding a Feynman-Kac representation that enables Monte Carlo-based numerical schemes. For optimization over probability measures, the approach formulates a regularized mean-field control problem characterized by a master equation, approximated via controlled N-particle systems. The algorithms employ Euler-Maruyama discretization with Monte Carlo drift estimation, where the optimal drift is computed as an expectation involving the objective function.

## Key Results
- Convergence rate O(ε ln(1/ε)) established as regularization parameter ε → 0 for Euclidean optimization
- Additional O(1/N) particle approximation error for measure optimization, yielding total error O(ε/N + ε ln(1/ε))
- Numerical experiments validate theoretical findings on benchmark functions including Xin-She Yang 4, 20D Ackley, and Newtonian/Spring swarm problems
- Algorithms successfully recover global minima and uniform distributions on unit circle for measure optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by transforming the original non-convex optimization problem into a stochastic control framework where dynamic programming principles apply. The regularization term smooths the objective, making the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation well-posed and solvable. As regularization vanishes, the control problem's value converges to the global minimum. The Cole-Hopf transformation linearizes the HJB equation, while the Feynman-Kac formula provides a probabilistic representation amenable to Monte Carlo simulation. For measure optimization, the master equation captures the collective behavior of interacting particles, with the N-particle approximation providing a practical computational scheme.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Objective G → Regularized control problem → HJB equation → Cole-Hopf transform → Feynman-Kac representation → Monte Carlo estimator → Numerical solution
- Critical path: ε → control value V_ε → optimal drift β* → particle trajectory → Monte Carlo estimate → convergence to global minimum
- Design tradeoffs: Small ε improves accuracy but increases simulation variance and computational cost; larger N reduces particle approximation error but increases computational complexity
- Failure signatures: Numerical underflow when ε is very small; particles diverging or clustering incorrectly; slow convergence due to high variance in Monte Carlo estimates
- First experiments:
  1. Implement Algorithm 1 for Euclidean case with Xin-She Yang 4 function (d=1, N=20, M=4001, ε=10^{-300}, S=800, x_0=2)
  2. Test on 20D Ackley function with Algorithm 1 (N=1000, M=2001, ε=10^{-300}, S=1000, x_0=(5,...,5), λ=0.75, L=10)
  3. Implement Algorithm 2 for measure optimization on Newtonian Swarm problem (N=200, M=1000, ε=10^{-10}, S=100)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the stochastic control method compare systematically with established global optimization algorithms regarding parameter calibration and computational efficiency?
- Can the quantitative O(1/N) particle approximation rate be established under weaker regularity assumptions for the master equation?
- What specific variance-reduction techniques or Monte Carlo estimators can most effectively mitigate the simulation cost for small regularization parameters ε?

## Limitations
- Numerical stability concerns with extreme regularization parameters (ε = 10^{-300}) may require specialized computational techniques
- Limited experimental scope without comparison to established global optimization methods
- No systematic parameter calibration or efficiency benchmarking against alternative approaches

## Confidence
- Convergence theory (High): Mathematical framework and proofs appear rigorous and well-established
- Numerical implementation (Medium): Algorithms are specified but numerical stability for extreme parameters is uncertain
- Practical effectiveness (Low): Limited experimental validation without systematic comparison to existing methods

## Next Checks
1. Implement the algorithms with careful numerical stabilization (log-sum-exp trick) for small ε and verify basic functionality on simple test functions
2. Conduct systematic parameter sensitivity analysis for ε, N, S, and M to identify stability thresholds and optimal configurations
3. Benchmark against established global optimization methods (e.g., differential evolution, simulated annealing) on standard test suites to assess practical competitiveness
