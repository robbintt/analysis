# BUILDA: A Thermal Building Data Generation Framework for Transfer Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.12703
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12703
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** BuilDa enables transfer learning experiments for building thermal forecasting with LSTM models achieving RMSE 0.05-0.16 vs 1.03 baseline

## Executive Summary
BuilDa is a Python framework that generates synthetic thermal building data for transfer learning research. It uses a validated single-zone Modelica building model exported as an FMU, allowing flexible parameter variation without requiring deep building simulation expertise. The framework addresses the challenge of acquiring high-variance, high-quality building thermal data needed to explore transfer learning scenarios. Users can adjust building characteristics, weather, occupancy, and control settings through a configuration file, with support for parallelized data generation and customizable multivariate time-series outputs.

## Method Summary
BuilDa employs a validated single-zone Modelica building model exported as an FMU, which is simulated via Python for flexible parameter variation. Users configure building characteristics (U-value, heat capacity, floor area), weather, occupancy, and control settings through a configuration file. The framework supports parallelized data generation and outputs customizable multivariate time-series data suitable for transfer learning experiments. In the demonstration, BuilDa generated data for 27 source buildings with varying thermal parameters and one target building, enabling LSTM pretraining and fine-tuning experiments.

## Key Results
- Transfer learning models outperformed scratch training, with RMSE values ranging from 0.05 to 0.16 versus 1.03 for baseline
- U-values dominated the error trends in transfer learning performance, though heat capacity and floor area showed inconsistent influences
- BuilDa successfully demonstrated its utility in transfer learning studies by enabling systematic comparison of source building selection strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by generating synthetic building thermal data that captures the essential dynamics of building energy systems while allowing systematic variation of key parameters. This synthetic data enables researchers to explore transfer learning scenarios that would be difficult to study with limited real-world datasets. The Modelica-based approach ensures physical consistency while the Python interface provides flexibility for experimentation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Modelica and FMU basics**: Why needed - to understand the underlying building physics simulation; Quick check - verify the FMU can be simulated with FMPy
- **Building thermal dynamics**: Why needed - to comprehend parameter effects on temperature profiles; Quick check - validate generated data shows expected thermal inertia
- **Transfer learning concepts**: Why needed - to interpret the LSTM pretraining and fine-tuning experiments; Quick check - confirm knowledge transfer reduces prediction error

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
BuilDa configuration -> FMU parameter generation -> Python simulation orchestration -> CSV time-series output

**Critical Path:**
Configuration file → Modelica FMU parameter mapping → FMPy simulation execution → Data export and formatting

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Single-zone simplification vs. computational efficiency
- Synthetic data physical accuracy vs. parameter space coverage
- Python flexibility vs. Modelica simulation complexity

**Failure Signatures:**
- NaN values in CSV output indicating simulation instability
- Uniform temperature profiles suggesting parameter conflicts
- Missing timesteps revealing synchronization issues

**First Experiments:**
1. Run a single FMU simulation with default parameters and verify output CSV structure
2. Generate a small dataset with varied U-values and check for expected thermal response differences
3. Attempt parallel execution with 2-3 buildings to validate multiprocessing setup

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Critical parameters for source selection:** Which specific building parameters and value combinations are most important for selecting optimal source buildings for transfer learning? The demonstration showed U-values dominated error trends but other parameters showed inconsistent influence.
- **Transformer architecture potential:** Can generalized Transformer architectures pretrained on BuilDa synthetic data serve as robust base models for Model Predictive Control in real-world scenarios? The paper suggests this as a key opportunity but only demonstrated LSTMs.
- **Multi-zone limitations:** Does the single-zone uniform air temperature assumption limit transferability to complex real-world buildings with inter-zone thermal interactions? The paper acknowledges this simplification while noting multi-zone incorporation as necessary future work.

## Limitations
- Underspecified LSTM architecture details and training hyperparameters prevent exact numerical replication
- Single-zone assumption may not capture complex thermal dynamics of multi-zone buildings
- Comparison fairness between transfer and baseline models is unclear due to unspecified hyperparameter tuning strategies

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** BuilDa framework data generation methodology and Modelica FMU setup
- **Medium Confidence:** Experimental design showing transfer learning outperforming training from scratch
- **Low Confidence:** Precise reproduction of reported RMSE values without specific LSTM architecture details

## Next Checks
1. Implement the BuilDa framework and verify successful generation of 27 source buildings and 1 target building with specified parameter combinations
2. Reconstruct the LSTM architecture and training pipeline based on reasonable assumptions to validate framework suitability for transfer learning
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on data generation parameters to determine their impact on transfer learning performance and identify optimal parameter combinations
