# Benefiting from Negative yet Informative Feedback by Contrasting Opposing Sequential Patterns

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.14786
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14786
- Reference count: 33
- Key result: Proposed method improves Hit Rate and NDCG while reducing wrongly promoted negative items by contrasting positive and negative feedback patterns

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating negative feedback into sequential recommendation systems. The authors propose a novel approach that processes positive and negative user interaction sequences separately using two transformer encoders. A composite loss function, combining positive and negative cross-entropy with a contrastive term, is introduced to better model opposing sequential patterns. Experiments on four datasets from different domains demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of increasing true-positive metrics (Hit Rate and NDCG) while reducing the number of wrongly promoted negative items.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach leverages negative feedback by processing positive and negative user interaction sequences through separate transformer encoders. These encoders learn distinct representations for each feedback type, which are then combined using a composite loss function. The loss incorporates positive and negative cross-entropy terms along with a contrastive component that explicitly models the opposition between positive and negative sequential patterns. This dual-encoder architecture with contrastive learning enables the model to better distinguish between items users liked versus those they explicitly rejected or ignored.

## Key Results
- The proposed method shows improvements in ΔNDCG@10 by up to 33% compared to baselines
- The approach increases true-positive metrics (Hit Rate and NDCG) while reducing wrongly promoted negative items
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across four datasets from different domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly modeling the opposition between positive and negative feedback patterns through separate processing paths and contrastive learning. By training two transformer encoders—one for positive interactions and one for negative interactions—the model can capture the distinct sequential patterns associated with each feedback type. The contrastive loss term then reinforces the separation between these learned representations, making the model more sensitive to the differences in user preferences. This architecture prevents the model from conflating positive and negative feedback, which is a common limitation in traditional sequential recommendation approaches that only consider positive interactions.

## Foundational Learning
- Transformer Encoder Architecture: Needed for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data; quick check: verify positional encoding implementation
- Contrastive Learning: Required to explicitly model opposition between positive and negative patterns; quick check: validate temperature parameter in contrastive loss
- Cross-Entropy Loss: Fundamental for classification in recommendation; quick check: confirm label smoothing is applied appropriately
- Sequence Processing: Essential for handling temporal user interaction patterns; quick check: ensure proper masking of future items
- Dual-Encoder Architecture: Necessary for separate representation learning; quick check: validate weight sharing (or lack thereof) between encoders
- Composite Loss Functions: Critical for balancing multiple objectives; quick check: verify loss weighting coefficients

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
User Interaction Sequences -> Positive Encoder -> Positive Representation
User Interaction Sequences -> Negative Encoder -> Negative Representation
Positive Representation + Negative Representation -> Composite Loss -> Model Parameters

Critical Path:
1. Input sequences are split into positive and negative feedback
2. Separate transformer encoders process each sequence type
3. Outputs are combined through composite loss function
4. Backpropagation updates both encoder parameters simultaneously

Design Tradeoffs:
- Separate encoders provide better pattern discrimination but increase parameter count and computational cost
- Composite loss balances multiple objectives but requires careful hyperparameter tuning
- Contrastive term improves negative feedback utilization but adds training complexity

Failure Signatures:
- Performance degradation when positive and negative patterns are too similar
- Overfitting to specific domains if datasets lack diversity
- Computational bottleneck during training due to dual-encoder architecture

First Experiments:
1. Baseline comparison with single-encoder models using only positive feedback
2. Ablation study removing contrastive loss term to measure its contribution
3. Cross-domain evaluation to test generalizability across different recommendation scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The use of two separate transformer encoders may increase computational complexity and resource requirements
- Limited evaluation metrics may not fully capture the model's effectiveness in all scenarios
- The selection of baselines and datasets may not represent the full diversity of real-world applications

## Confidence
- Claim: Method significantly reduces "wrongly promoted negative items" - Medium confidence
- Claim: Proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines - Medium confidence
- Claim: Contrastive loss effectively captures opposing sequential patterns - Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comprehensive ablation study to quantify the individual contributions of the positive cross-entropy, negative cross-entropy, and contrastive loss terms to the overall performance.
2. Evaluate the model's performance on a larger and more diverse set of datasets, including those with varying levels of sparsity and noise, to assess its generalizability and robustness.
3. Investigate the computational efficiency of the proposed approach by comparing its training time, memory usage, and inference speed against baseline methods, particularly for large-scale applications.
