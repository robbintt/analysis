# Generative Kernel Spectral Clustering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.02185
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02185
- **Authors:** David Winant; Sonny Achten; Johan A. K. Suykens
- **Reference count:** 10
- **Key outcome:** Combines kernel spectral clustering with generative modeling to create explorable latent spaces where cluster characteristics can be visualized through traversals, bridging clustering performance and interpretability.

## Executive Summary
Generative Kernel Spectral Clustering (GenKSC) introduces a novel approach that augments weighted variance maximization with reconstruction and clustering losses to create an explorable latent space. The method learns both feature representations and spectral embeddings end-to-end, producing interpretable cluster structures that can be visualized through latent space traversals. Experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate the model's ability to reveal distinguishing features of clusters through generated samples along cluster directions, offering a valuable tool for applications where understanding clustering results is critical.

## Method Summary
GenKSC combines kernel spectral clustering with generative modeling by jointly learning a feature map φ and projection matrix U within a Stiefel manifold constraint. The model optimizes a weighted variance maximization objective augmented with reconstruction and cosine cluster losses. The encoder maps inputs to feature space, U projects to score space where spectral clustering occurs, and the decoder reconstructs inputs from projected features. Cluster codes are placed at vertices of a regular simplex to enforce interpretable rotations, enabling traversal-based feature discovery where generated points along cluster directions reveal distinguishing cluster characteristics.

## Key Results
- MNIST012 experiments show line structures in eigenspace where cluster prototypes align at line endpoints
- Traversals along cluster directions reveal that thinner digits are harder to cluster on MNIST012
- FashionMNIST experiments demonstrate generated points showing distinctive features like pant legs becoming more distinct or shoulder straps becoming more prominent

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Weighted variance maximization in a learnable feature space produces spectral embeddings with interpretable linear cluster structure. The optimization maximizes projected variance weighted by inverse kernel degrees, equivalent to kernel spectral clustering eigendecomposition. When data naturally clusters into k groups, the top k-1 eigenspace dimensions exhibit distinct "line structures" where cluster prototypes align at line endpoints.

### Mechanism 2
Jointly learning the feature map φ with the spectral projection U enables end-to-end representation learning while preserving cluster structure. Unlike traditional KSC with fixed kernels, GenKSC uses neural network feature maps trained alongside the projection matrix U. The Stiefel manifold constraint UᵀU = Iₛ is maintained via Cayley ADAM optimization, ensuring orthonormal projections throughout training.

### Mechanism 3
The cluster loss with simplex-anchored cluster codes enforces interpretable rotation and enables traversal-based feature discovery. Predefined cluster codes placed at vertices of a regular (k-1)-simplex maximize angular separation. Minimizing cosine distance to nearest cluster code encourages optimal rotation of the first k-1 components, enhances linearity in this subspace, and allows extrapolation beyond training points to exaggerate cluster features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Spectral Clustering via Eigendecomposition**
  - Why needed here: GenKSC builds directly on KSC formulation where cluster structure emerges from eigenvectors of normalized kernel matrix
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the top k-1 eigenvectors (not k) encode k-cluster structure?

- **Concept: Stiefel Manifold and Orthonormal Constraints**
  - Why needed here: Projection matrix U must satisfy UᵀU = Iₛ throughout optimization; standard gradient descent violates this constraint
  - Quick check question: Why does Cayley transform preserve orthonormality while allowing gradient-based updates?

- **Concept: Encoder-Decoder Reconstruction for Generative Models**
  - Why needed here: Inverse mapping ψ enables generation from latent points; reconstruction loss ensures latent space remains meaningful
  - Quick check question: What happens to the latent space if reconstruction loss is removed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** x → φ(x) → Uᵀφ(x) = e → Ue → ψ(Ue) = x̂
- **Critical path:** 1) Forward: x → φ(x) → Uᵀφ(x) = e (score vector) → Ue → ψ(Ue) = x̂; 2) Loss computation: L_var + L_reg + η_rec·L_rec + η_cl·L_cl; 3) Backward: Update θ_φ, θ_ψ via standard gradients; update U via Cayley ADAM
- **Design tradeoffs:** Latent dimension s vs. k: s > k-1 provides richer representation but dilutes cluster information; η_rec vs. η_cl: High η_cl improves cluster separation but may sacrifice reconstruction quality; Warmup epochs: Delaying cluster loss allows representation learning but extends training
- **Failure signatures:** Collapsed clusters: all points assigned to one cluster → check if η_cl is too low or warmup too long; No line structure: eigenspace appears isotropic → feature map may not be learning cluster-relevant features; Poor reconstruction: generated images are blurry/artifacts → increase η_rec or encoder capacity
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Replicate MNIST012 with s=10, k=3, η_rec=η_cl=1, 10-epoch warmup; verify line structure in first 2 components and coherent traversals along cluster directions; 2) Ablate cluster loss (η_cl=0 from start) to confirm simplex-anchored codes are necessary for interpretable rotation; expect arbitrary rotation without line structure; 3) Test out-of-cluster extrapolation by generating points beyond cluster prototypes along cluster directions; verify that exaggerated features reveal clustering criteria

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can GenKSC be generalized to semi-supervised and fully supervised settings where cluster labels are provided by external clustering models? The conclusion states future work includes generalizing to settings where cluster labels could be given by another clustering model, potentially creating an interpretable clustering latent space from any clustering model.

### Open Question 2
How does GenKSC scale to more complex, higher-dimensional datasets beyond MNIST and FashionMNIST? Experiments are limited to relatively simple image datasets (MNIST012 with 3 classes, FashionMNIST), with no evaluation on complex natural images, multi-modal data, or high-dimensional tabular data.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is GenKSC to hyperparameter choices (η_rec, η_cl, latent dimension s, and the delayed clustering schedule)? Different hyperparameters were used for MNIST012 versus FashionMNIST, and cluster loss was excluded for initial epochs, but no systematic sensitivity analysis is provided.

### Open Question 4
How does GenKSC compare to state-of-the-art deep clustering methods on quantitative clustering metrics? The paper emphasizes interpretability and qualitative traversal visualizations but does not report standard clustering evaluation metrics against contemporary deep clustering baselines.

## Limitations
- Architectural details such as exact encoder/decoder configuration and training hyperparameters are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Claims about cluster traversals revealing interpretable features rely on subjective visual assessment without quantitative validation
- Generalization to FashionMNIST is based on only 5 of 10 classes without comprehensive evaluation across the full dataset

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Mathematical formulation connecting weighted variance maximization to kernel spectral clustering is well-established and correctly derived
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that simplex-anchored cluster codes enable interpretable latent traversals is supported by qualitative results but lacks quantitative metrics
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization claim to FashionMNIST is based on limited evaluation without comparison to state-of-the-art methods

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on Cluster Loss Timing:** Systematically vary the warmup period for cluster loss (0, 5, 10, 15 epochs) on MNIST012 to quantify trade-off between representation quality and cluster interpretability, measuring both reconstruction error and clustering purity
2. **Quantitative Interpretability Metrics:** Implement metrics such as cluster purity, normalized mutual information, and feature importance scores to objectively measure whether traversals along cluster directions reveal semantically meaningful variations compared to random directions
3. **Baseline Comparison:** Compare GenKSC against established clustering methods (DEC, DCN, K-Means) on FashionMNIST using the same 5-class subset, evaluating both clustering performance and interpretability through generated samples along cluster directions
