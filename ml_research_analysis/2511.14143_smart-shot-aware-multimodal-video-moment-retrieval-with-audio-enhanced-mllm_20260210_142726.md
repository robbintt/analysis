# SMART: Shot-Aware Multimodal Video Moment Retrieval with Audio-Enhanced MLLM

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.14143
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14143
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Shot-aware token compression framework achieving +1.61% R1@0.5 and +2.59% R1@0.7 on Charades-STA, +1.56% R1@0.5 on QVHighlights

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SMART, a shot-aware multimodal video moment retrieval framework that integrates audio-visual features with shot-coherent token compression. The core innovation is the Shot-aware Token Compression (STC) module, which identifies keyframes within each shot and selectively retains high-variance tokens while discarding redundant ones. This approach preserves temporal fidelity while reducing computational load. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with robust performance across both short- and long-duration video scenarios.

## Method Summary
SMART combines audio-visual features with a novel Shot-aware Token Compression (STC) module to enhance video moment retrieval. The framework processes videos by first segmenting them into shots, then identifying keyframes within each shot based on variance analysis. High-variance tokens are retained while redundant ones are discarded, preserving temporal information while reducing computational complexity. The compressed tokens are then fused with audio features and processed by a multimodal large language model for moment retrieval. This shot-aware approach specifically targets the temporal coherence within video segments to improve retrieval accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieved +1.61% R1@0.5 and +2.59% R1@0.7 improvements on Charades-STA dataset
- Demonstrated +1.56% R1@0.5 improvement on QVHighlights dataset
- Showed consistent performance gains across both short- and long-duration video scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its shot-aware token compression strategy that leverages temporal coherence within video segments. By identifying keyframes based on variance analysis, the system preserves semantically important visual information while eliminating redundant tokens that don't contribute to moment retrieval accuracy. The integration of audio features with visual tokens provides complementary temporal cues that enhance the multimodal understanding of video content. The selective compression maintains the essential temporal structure needed for accurate moment localization while reducing computational overhead.

## Foundational Learning

**Video Shot Detection**
- Why needed: Enables temporal segmentation of videos into coherent segments for more precise moment retrieval
- Quick check: Verify shot boundary detection accuracy on benchmark datasets

**Variance-based Token Selection**
- Why needed: Identifies visually significant frames within shots while discarding redundant information
- Quick check: Measure token variance distribution across different video types

**Multimodal Feature Fusion**
- Why needed: Combines audio and visual modalities to capture complementary temporal and semantic information
- Quick check: Validate cross-modal attention weights for alignment quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
MLLM Input -> STC Module -> Shot-Aware Compression -> Audio-Visual Fusion -> Moment Retrieval

**Critical Path**
Video frames -> Shot detection -> STC keyframe selection -> Token compression -> Audio feature extraction -> Multimodal fusion -> Query matching

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Temporal fidelity vs. computational efficiency through selective token compression
- Shot granularity vs. processing overhead in shot detection
- Audio-visual feature balance vs. modality-specific noise handling

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor shot boundary detection leading to incorrect temporal segmentation
- Over-aggressive token compression removing semantically relevant frames
- Audio-visual misalignment causing modality fusion errors
- MLLM attention collapse during multimodal reasoning

**3 First Experiments**
1. Baseline evaluation without STC to measure compression impact
2. Ablation study removing audio features to assess multimodal contribution
3. Shot boundary detection accuracy test across different video genres

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to only two datasets (Charades-STA and QVHighlights), raising generalizability concerns
- No ablation studies quantifying computational savings from token compression
- Unclear whether improvements stem from shot-awareness or audio-visual integration
- Scalability to longer videos beyond tested benchmarks not addressed

## Confidence
- **Performance claims**: Medium - supported by metrics but limited to two datasets
- **Computational efficiency**: Low - claimed without ablation studies or quantitative analysis
- **Shot-awareness benefits**: Medium - no independent validation of shot-aware contribution

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing STC performance with and without shot-awareness to isolate its specific contribution to improvements
2. Test the framework on additional video moment retrieval datasets (e.g., ActivityNet Captions, DiDeMo) to assess generalizability across domains and video durations
3. Perform computational analysis quantifying inference time and memory usage with and without STC to empirically validate claimed efficiency gains
