# Resolution-Aware Retrieval Augmented Zero-Shot Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16695
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16695
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34% lower MSE than Chronos on ERA5 microclimate forecasting dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to zero-shot forecasting that leverages resolution-aware retrieval augmentation. The method addresses the challenge of predicting outcomes for previously unseen conditions without direct historical data by decomposing signals into frequency components and applying spatially-aware retrieval strategies. Lower-frequency components utilize broader spatial context while higher-frequency components focus on local influences, enabling dynamic retrieval of relevant data and adaptation to new locations with minimal historical context.

The proposed model demonstrates significant performance improvements over traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and modern foundation time series models in microclimate forecasting applications. A probabilistic extension provides both central estimates and confidence measures, showing strong calibration and outperforming Chronos Bolt in uncertainty-aware metrics. The approach shows particular promise for applications requiring generalization to unseen locations while maintaining prediction accuracy.

## Method Summary
The Resolution-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model operates by first decomposing input signals into different frequency components, recognizing that various temporal frequencies exhibit distinct spatial correlation patterns. For each frequency component, the model applies a tailored retrieval strategy: lower frequencies leverage broader spatial context to capture large-scale patterns and trends, while higher frequencies focus on local spatial relationships to preserve fine-grained details. This frequency-specific retrieval is then integrated into the forecasting process, allowing the model to dynamically access relevant historical or contextual data during prediction. The architecture combines these resolution-aware retrievals through a unified forecasting framework that can operate in zero-shot settings where no direct historical data exists for the target location or condition.

## Key Results
- Achieves 71% lower MSE than HRRR on ERA5 microclimate dataset
- Outperforms Chronos by 34% lower MSE in zero-shot forecasting scenarios
- Probabilistic extension shows superior calibration with improved NLL and CRPS compared to Chronos Bolt

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model exploits the fundamental property that different temporal frequencies in spatial-temporal data exhibit distinct correlation structures. Lower frequencies typically show stronger spatial correlation, making them amenable to broad contextual retrieval from distant locations, while higher frequencies are more locally dependent, requiring finer-grained spatial attention. By decomposing signals and applying frequency-specific retrieval strategies, the model can more effectively leverage available data for each component type, leading to improved overall forecasting accuracy, especially in zero-shot scenarios where traditional location-specific models would fail due to lack of direct historical data.

## Foundational Learning

**Frequency decomposition**: Separates signals into distinct temporal components with different spatial correlation properties. Why needed: Enables targeted retrieval strategies for each frequency type. Quick check: Verify frequency components capture distinct patterns in validation data.

**Spatial correlation patterns**: Different temporal frequencies exhibit varying degrees of spatial dependence. Why needed: Informs which retrieval strategy to apply at each resolution. Quick check: Analyze correlation decay rates across frequencies.

**Retrieval-augmented forecasting**: Dynamically incorporates relevant historical or contextual data during prediction. Why needed: Enables zero-shot forecasting without direct historical data for target location. Quick check: Compare performance with and without retrieval augmentation.

**Zero-shot forecasting**: Predicting for unseen conditions or locations without direct historical examples. Why needed: Critical for applications where data collection is expensive or impossible. Quick check: Test on truly unseen locations in validation set.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input signal -> Frequency decomposition -> Resolution-specific retrieval -> Integrated forecasting -> Output prediction

Critical path: Signal decomposition → Frequency-specific retrieval modules → Integration layer → Forecast generation

Design tradeoffs: Frequency decomposition adds complexity but enables more effective data utilization; broader spatial retrieval for low frequencies trades specificity for coverage; local retrieval for high frequencies trades coverage for precision.

Failure signatures: Poor frequency decomposition leads to inappropriate retrieval strategies; inadequate spatial correlation modeling causes retrieval errors; integration layer failures result in inconsistent predictions across frequencies.

First experiments:
1. Test frequency decomposition quality on validation data to ensure components capture distinct patterns
2. Validate spatial correlation assumptions for each frequency band through correlation analysis
3. Verify retrieval module effectiveness by comparing performance with random versus learned retrieval

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions, suggesting either a limitation in the reporting or that the authors consider the work sufficiently complete. Assumption: The authors may view their resolution-aware approach as addressing a fundamental gap in zero-shot forecasting capabilities. Unknown: Whether the authors have identified potential extensions or remaining challenges beyond what's presented.

## Limitations
- Generalizability to non-spatial time series domains remains untested
- Real-world decision-making utility of uncertainty estimates not demonstrated
- Comparison limited to Chronos Bolt without broader probabilistic forecasting baselines
- Performance on extreme weather events or rare conditions not evaluated
- Computational efficiency compared to simpler baselines not discussed

- High: Core model architecture and demonstrated microclimate performance
- Medium: Resolution-aware approach applicability across different forecasting domains
- Low: Practical implications of probabilistic predictions in operational settings

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on non-spatial time series datasets (e.g., financial or energy demand forecasting) to assess cross-domain generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of the resolution-aware decomposition versus standard retrieval-augmented approaches
3. Implement a real-world decision-making scenario (e.g., resource allocation based on probabilistic forecasts) to evaluate practical utility of uncertainty estimates
4. Evaluate model performance on extreme weather events and rare conditions to assess robustness
5. Benchmark computational efficiency against simpler baseline models for practical deployment considerations
