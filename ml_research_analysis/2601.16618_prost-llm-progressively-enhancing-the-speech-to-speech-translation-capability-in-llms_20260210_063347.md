# PROST-LLM: Progressively Enhancing the Speech-to-Speech Translation Capability in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.16618
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16618
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Reduces BLEU score gap between end-to-end and cascaded S2ST systems from 14.38 to 3.15 (English-to-French) and from 8.83 to 1.04 (French-to-English)

## Executive Summary
PROST-LLM addresses the challenge of enhancing Large Language Models' speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) capabilities despite data scarcity. The proposed framework employs a three-step approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning using tri-task learning and chain-of-modality strategies on the CVSS corpus to strengthen initial S2ST performance, (2) automated preference pair construction through self-sampling and back-translation without human evaluation, and (3) preference optimization using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) to further improve translation quality. The method successfully reduces the BLEU score gap between end-to-end and cascaded S2ST systems from 14.38 to 3.15 (English-to-French) and from 8.83 to 1.04 (French-to-English), demonstrating that PROST-LLM significantly enhances S2ST performance while reducing reliance on paired S2ST data and maintaining robustness across different evaluation metrics and optimization algorithms.

## Method Summary
PROST-LLM proposes a progressive framework to enhance LLM-based speech-to-speech translation capabilities. The approach consists of three key stages: first, supervised fine-tuning using tri-task learning that combines speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis objectives; second, automated construction of preference pairs through self-sampling and back-translation techniques that eliminate the need for human evaluation; and third, preference optimization using either Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) algorithms. The framework is trained on the CVSS corpus and demonstrates improved performance across multiple evaluation metrics while reducing the performance gap between end-to-end and cascaded S2ST systems.

## Key Results
- Reduces BLEU score gap between end-to-end and cascaded S2ST systems from 14.38 to 3.15 (English-to-French)
- Reduces BLEU score gap between end-to-end and cascaded S2ST systems from 8.83 to 1.04 (French-to-English)
- Demonstrates improved performance across multiple evaluation metrics while reducing reliance on paired S2ST data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PROST-LLM's effectiveness stems from its progressive enhancement approach that addresses data scarcity through automated preference pair construction and multi-stage optimization. The tri-task learning framework during supervised fine-tuning helps the model learn robust cross-modal representations by leveraging related tasks. The automated preference pair construction through self-sampling and back-translation creates a large-scale training corpus without human annotation costs, while the preference optimization stage fine-tunes the model to align with human preferences in translation quality. This staged approach allows the model to first establish basic S2ST capabilities, then refine them through preference learning, effectively bridging the performance gap with cascaded systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST)**: Why needed: The core task of converting speech from one language to speech in another language. Quick check: Can the model handle continuous speech input and produce natural-sounding output speech?
- **Tri-task Learning**: Why needed: Combines speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis to build robust cross-modal representations. Quick check: Does the model show improved performance when all three tasks are trained together versus separately?
- **Preference Optimization (DPO/SimPO)**: Why needed: Fine-tunes the model to align with human preferences without requiring human-labeled preference data. Quick check: Does the model generate translations that better match human evaluation criteria after optimization?
- **Automated Preference Pair Construction**: Why needed: Creates large-scale training data without human annotation costs through self-sampling and back-translation. Quick check: Are the automatically generated preference pairs of sufficient quality to improve model performance?
- **Chain-of-Modality Strategy**: Why needed: Helps the model learn the progression from speech to text to translation to speech. Quick check: Does the model show improved modality transition capabilities compared to direct S2ST approaches?
- **CVSS Corpus**: Why needed: The primary dataset used for training and evaluation, providing paired speech-to-speech translation examples. Quick check: Is the corpus diverse enough to ensure generalizability across different speech patterns and content?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Speech Input -> Tri-task Learning -> Automated Preference Pair Construction -> Preference Optimization -> Speech Output

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves the progression from speech input through the tri-task learning phase, where the model learns basic cross-modal representations, followed by automated preference pair construction to generate training data, and finally preference optimization to refine the model's alignment with human preferences. This staged approach ensures that each component builds upon the previous one's learning.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for improved performance by implementing a multi-stage training process. While this increases training time and resource requirements, it enables the model to achieve end-to-end S2ST performance that approaches cascaded systems without requiring paired S2ST data. The automated preference pair construction eliminates human annotation costs but introduces uncertainty about the quality of generated pairs compared to human-annotated data.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include: (1) degraded performance on languages with significantly different phonological structures than those in the CVSS corpus, (2) reduced translation quality for domain-specific or technical content not well-represented in the training data, (3) computational bottlenecks during the preference optimization stage that limit practical deployment, and (4) overfitting to the specific characteristics of the CVSS corpus that may not generalize to real-world scenarios.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate PROST-LLM on a held-out test set from the CVSS corpus to measure baseline performance improvements over existing end-to-end S2ST models.
2. Compare BLEU scores between PROST-LLM and cascaded S2ST systems on the same test set to quantify the reduction in performance gap.
3. Test the model's robustness by evaluating translation quality across different speech characteristics (accent, speaking rate, background noise) within the CVSS corpus.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond the CVSS corpus remains uncertain, as evaluation is primarily conducted on this specific dataset
- Automated preference pair quality compared to human-annotated pairs raises questions about optimal training data diversity
- Computational costs of the multi-stage training process, particularly preference optimization, are not fully characterized
- Performance on languages with different phonological structures or less available monolingual data remains untested
- Reliance on specific model architectures (LLaMA-2) may constrain broader applicability across different LLM variants

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The framework's effectiveness in reducing the BLEU gap between end-to-end and cascaded systems on the tested language pairs and corpus
- **Medium confidence**: The generalizability of the approach to other language pairs, domains, and different LLM architectures
- **Low confidence**: The quality of automated preference pairs compared to human-annotated data and the long-term robustness of the model across diverse real-world scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate PROST-LLM performance on multiple diverse corpora beyond CVSS, including low-resource language pairs and domain-specific speech content.
2. Conduct human evaluation studies to compare the quality of automated preference pairs versus human-annotated pairs and assess translation quality across multiple dimensions.
3. Benchmark computational requirements and inference latency against existing cascaded S2ST systems to quantify practical deployment trade-offs.
