# A Dynamical Systems Framework for Reinforcement Learning Safety and Robustness Verification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.15588
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15588
- **Reference count:** 38
- **Primary result:** Introduces FTLE-based metrics (MBR, ASAS, TASAS) to verify safety barriers and spurious attractors in RL policies

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a dynamical systems framework for verifying safety and robustness in reinforcement learning policies by analyzing the combined agent-environment system as a discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. The key idea is to use Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) to identify Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as safety barriers (repelling LCS) and attractor regions (attracting LCS). The authors develop quantitative metrics including Mean Boundary Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spoofed Attractor Strength (ASAS), and Temporally-Aware Spoofed Attractor Strength (TASAS) to measure policy safety margins and robustness. Experimental results across discrete and continuous control environments demonstrate that the framework successfully identifies critical flaws in policies that appear successful based on reward alone.

## Method Summary
The framework re-frames the RL interaction as a deterministic flow $s_{t+1} = f(s_t)$ and analyzes it using dynamical systems theory. It computes the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) field by approximating the Jacobian of the flow map via finite differences on a state-space grid. Repelling LCS (high FTLE ridges) are identified as safety barriers, while attracting LCS are detected through final-state density histograms. Three metrics are derived: MBR measures average FTLE near obstacles, ASAS quantifies spurious attractor strength relative to the goal, and TASAS adds temporal awareness by weighting with escape probability. The method is applied to both discrete grid-worlds (DQN) and continuous control environments (SAC/TQC/TD3).

## Key Results
- LunarLanderContinuous-v2 policy showed ASAS=3.9038 and TASAS=3.9038, indicating extremely poor robustness with dominant spurious attractors
- Pendulum-v1 achieved ideal scores of 0.0000 for both metrics, confirming perfect robustness
- MBR successfully identified safety barriers in grid-world environments as policies learned obstacle avoidance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Repelling LCS as Safety Barriers
High ridges in the FTLE field act as barriers preventing trajectories from entering unsafe regions. The framework identifies these barriers by calculating trajectory separation rates through the FTLE field. A robust policy creates high separation rates around obstacles, turning them into effective "keep-out" zones.

### Mechanism 2: Spurious Attractors as Failure Modes
Unintended trap states are detected by identifying high-density regions in final-state trajectory distributions that lie outside the goal region. The TASAS metric distinguishes transient highways from terminal traps by measuring escape probability from these peaks.

### Mechanism 3: Local Stability via Bounded Divergence
The FTLE field provides formal stability guarantees: in regions of low FTLE, small perturbations don't lead to large deviations. The framework derives exponential bounds on divergence based on maximum FTLE in convex regions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Discrete-Time Autonomous Dynamical Systems:** Needed to map RL interactions to deterministic flows for analysis. Quick check: Given policy π and transition T, can you write the closed-loop dynamics function f(s)?
- **The Deformation Gradient (Jacobian):** Essential for understanding how infinitesimal neighborhoods deform through state space. Quick check: If largest eigenvalue of Cauchy-Green tensor C = J^T J is 1, what does that imply about trajectory stretching?
- **Finite-Difference Derivative Approximation:** Required since flow maps are simulated, not analytical. Quick check: How does grid spacing h affect FTLE noise for non-smooth neural network policies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Policy Wrapper -> Flow Integrator -> Grid Engine -> Metric Calculator
- **Critical path:** Flow Map calculation is most computationally intensive (O(|S| · T_int))
- **Design tradeoffs:** Integration time balances structure revelation vs. computation; grid resolution affects LCS sharpness vs. scalability; histogram-based attractors are cheaper but less rigorous
- **Failure signatures:** Noisy FTLE indicates policy hasn't learned stable structure; high ASAS flags wrong convergence; low MBR indicates dangerous navigation
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Simple Wall Baseline: Train DQN on 2D grid with wall, verify MBR increases as policy learns avoidance
  2. Continuous Control Slice: Apply analysis to pre-trained Pendulum policy, fix velocity=0 and analyze angle subspace
  3. Trap Discovery: Run analysis on LunarLander policy to verify high TASAS identifies spurious looping behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can FTLE-based verification extend to stochastic policies/environments where separation is driven by noise rather than deterministic chaos? The conclusion explicitly states future work could extend to stochastic systems.
- **Open Question 2:** How can proposed metrics guide policy training directly rather than just verify post-hoc? The conclusion identifies need to explore use in guiding training.
- **Open Question 3:** What approximation techniques scale LCS identification to high-dimensional state spaces without 2D slices? The conclusion highlights need for efficient methods for high-dimensional spaces.

## Limitations
- Framework requires deterministic, low-dimensional dynamics; becomes intractable in high dimensions due to curse of dimensionality
- Trajectory simulation may miss rare but critical failure modes
- Attractor identification via histograms lacks mathematical rigor of true LCS computation

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** Repelling LCS act as safety barriers; spurious attractors indicate failure modes; local stability bounds are mathematically sound
**Medium Confidence:** MBR effectively quantifies safety margins; ASAS/TASAS comprehensively capture robustness; framework generalizes across domains
**Low Confidence:** Specific threshold values are universally optimal; framework scales to real-world robotics; all safety-critical behaviors are captured

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability Test:** Apply framework to 4-6 dimensional continuous control task and document computational scaling and metric degradation
2. **Adversarial Robustness:** Introduce small perturbations to pre-trained policies and measure changes in MBR/ASAS/TASAS
3. **Temporal Dynamics Validation:** Extend analysis to time-varying environments and assess framework's handling of non-autonomous systems
