# NOVA: An Agentic Framework for Automated Histopathology Analysis and Discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11324
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11324
- Reference count: 40
- NOVA achieves 0.777 on DataQA, 0.323 on CellularQA in SlideQuest benchmark

## Executive Summary
NOVA is an agentic framework that translates scientific queries into executable histopathology analysis pipelines through iterative code generation and execution. The system integrates 49 domain-specific tools for tasks ranging from nuclei segmentation to whole-slide encoding, and can also create new tools ad hoc when needed. The authors introduce SlideQuest, a 90-question benchmark verified by pathologists, spanning data processing, quantitative analysis, and hypothesis testing. Quantitative evaluation shows NOVA outperforms coding-agent baselines, with a pathologist-verified case study linking morphology to PAM50 subtypes demonstrating its scalable discovery potential.

## Method Summary
NOVA uses an LLM (GPT-4.1/GPT-5 via Azure OpenAI) to generate Python code in structured JSON blocks containing both thought and code fields. The code executes via a Python interpreter with operation limits and library allowlists, with results feeding back into the LLM context window for iterative refinement up to 20 times. The framework integrates 49 domain-specific tools implemented as single-purpose Python functions with standardized docstrings, covering nuclei segmentation, tissue detection, feature extraction, and supervised experiments. SlideQuest benchmark spans four categories requiring different capabilities: DataQA (metadata retrieval), CellularQA (nucleus-level quantification), PatchQA (region interpretation), and SlideQA (gigapixel experimentation).

## Key Results
- NOVA achieves 0.777 on DataQA, 0.323 on CellularQA, outperforming coding-agent baselines
- Custom tools provide +0.240 improvement on DataQA and +0.171 on CellularQA over no-custom-tool versions
- Case study successfully links morphology to PAM50 subtypes with pathologist verification
- Operation limit (10^7) and 20-iteration cap frequently truncate complex analyses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Iterative code generation with execution feedback enables multi-step workflows that single-shot prompting cannot achieve
- Core assumption: LLM can parse execution results, identify errors, and refine subsequent code generation without human intervention
- Evidence: Abstract states system "translates scientific queries into executable analysis pipelines by iteratively generating and running Python code"; Section 3.1 describes code execution loop with running memory
- Break condition: Tool outputs are consistently incorrect (e.g., HoverNet segmentation errors propagate), iterative refinement cannot recover

### Mechanism 2
- Domain-specific atomic tools outperform LLM-generated tools because manually designed tools encode validated computational pathology operations
- Core assumption: Tool atomicity and clear docstrings enable LLM to correctly sequence operations without understanding underlying pathology algorithms
- Evidence: Section 6.1 shows custom tools outperform no-custom-tools across all categories (+0.240 on DataQA, +0.171 on CellularQA)
- Break condition: Tools return plausible but incorrect outputs, LLM lacks grounding to detect errors

### Mechanism 3
- Task diversity across spatial scales forces system to demonstrate compositional generalization rather than pattern matching
- Core assumption: Performance across all four categories indicates genuine multi-scale reasoning rather than overfitting
- Evidence: SlideQuest spans four categories from patch to whole-slide; performance varies substantially by category (0.777 on DataQA, 0.323 on CellularQA)
- Break condition: High DataQA scores primarily reflect LLM parametric knowledge rather than tool use

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Whole-slide image (WSI) pyramidal structure
  - Why needed: WSIs are multi-resolution gigapixel images stored as tiled pyramids; understanding level indexing, magnification mapping, and patch extraction is prerequisite for all DataQA and SlideQA tasks
  - Quick check: Given a WSI with base magnification 40× and 4 pyramid levels, what magnification does level 2 represent?

- Concept: Nuclei segmentation and classification pipelines
  - Why needed: CellularQA requires understanding how models like HoverNet produce instance segmentation masks and cell-type classifications, including failure modes
  - Quick check: If HoverNet outputs 6 nuclear classes but task requires only neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic, what post-processing is needed?

- Concept: Multiple instance learning (MIL) for slide-level prediction
  - Why needed: SlideQA involves training attention-based MIL models on patch embeddings to predict slide-level labels
  - Quick check: In ABMIL, what does a high attention weight for a specific patch indicate about that patch's contribution to slide-level prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Core LLM -> Python interpreter -> Tool library -> System prompt assembler
- Critical path: Query parsing → system prompt construction → LLM inference → code extraction → execution → result logging → result → LLM context → next iteration or termination → final answer
- Design tradeoffs: Atomic tools maximize reusability but increase orchestration complexity; 20-iteration limit prevents infinite loops but may truncate complex analyses; no instruction fine-tuning lowers barrier to adding tools but may underperform on niche tasks
- Failure signatures: Tool limitation failures (correct tool usage, incorrect output), framework limitation failures (operation limit exceeded), recomputation failures (agent ignores tool outputs), fabrication failures (agent invents data)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Reproduce DataQA baseline comparison on 5 questions, 2) Ablate custom tools on 5 CellularQA questions, 3) Test operation limit sensitivity by increasing limit on 3 PatchQA questions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- How much time does NOVA actually save computational scientists compared to manual workflow implementation for histopathology analysis?
- Basis: Future Work section states "We hope to quantify the time savings with Nova for computational scientists"
- Why unresolved: Paper reports runtime (40 hours for 90 questions) but doesn't compare against human expert implementation time or measure real-world productivity gains
- What evidence would resolve it: User study comparing task completion time, code quality, and analysis accuracy between scientists using NOVA versus manual implementation

### Open Question 2
- How can agentic systems like NOVA guarantee reproducibility when pipeline generation varies between executions?
- Basis: Limitations section notes "Reproducibility of agentic behaviour is an open challenge" with high variance across runs
- Why unresolved: Paper reports variability across three trials but doesn't propose mechanisms to ensure deterministic or verifiable outputs for critical biomedical analyses
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of techniques that reduce output variance while maintaining performance

### Open Question 3
- Can automated tool creation methods match or exceed performance of handcrafted domain-specific tools for histopathology agents?
- Basis: Discussion section mentions "Advances in automated tool creation and verification would further strengthen such systems"; ablation shows RAG-based tool creation underperforms custom tools
- Why unresolved: RAG-based tool creation proved insufficient; paper doesn't explore more sophisticated automated tool synthesis or verification approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of methods that can automatically generate, test, and verify tools matching handcrafted tool quality

### Open Question 4
- How should agentic systems be evaluated when only final outputs are checked but intermediate reasoning may be flawed?
- Basis: Limitations section notes "evaluation mechanism in SlideQuest only checks final outputs" and doesn't penalize incorrect intermediate reasoning
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation cannot distinguish between correct reasoning and coincidentally correct answers, masking potential safety concerns
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark or metric that evaluates reasoning traces, penalizes fabrications, and distinguishes tool implementation errors from agent misuse

## Limitations
- Tool reliability is critical - NOVA cannot detect when domain-specific tools produce incorrect outputs, leading to confident but wrong answers
- 20-iteration limit and 10^7 operation cap frequently truncate complex analyses, particularly in CellularQA and PatchQA categories
- Discovery claims lack statistical validation - PAM50 correlation analysis appears exploratory without rigorous significance testing

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core iterative code-generation mechanism and ability to integrate 49 domain-specific tools are well-demonstrated
- **Medium confidence**: 0.240-0.171 performance gains over baseline agents are reproducible, but absolute scores suggest room for improvement
- **Low confidence**: Claims about "scalable discovery potential" lack statistical validation and proper significance testing

## Next Checks
1. **Tool reliability audit**: Systematically evaluate each of the 49 tools on held-out validation sets to quantify false positive/negative rates
2. **Statistical validation of discovery claims**: Replicate PAM50 correlation analysis on independent breast cancer cohort with proper multiple hypothesis correction
3. **Operation limit stress test**: Design battery of increasingly complex SlideQA questions approaching 10^7 operation limit to characterize failure threshold
