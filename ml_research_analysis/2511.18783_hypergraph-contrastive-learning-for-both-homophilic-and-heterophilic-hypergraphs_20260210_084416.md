# Hypergraph Contrastive Learning for both Homophilic and Heterophilic Hypergraphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18783
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18783
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed HONOR framework achieves superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic hypergraph datasets, with accuracy of 81.42% on Cora-C, 73.23% on Citeseer, and 83.69% on PubMed for node classification tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitations of existing hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) that rely on the homophily assumption, which often does not hold in real-world scenarios with significant heterophilic structures. To tackle this, the authors propose HONOR, a novel unsupervised hypergraph contrastive learning framework designed for both homophilic and heterophilic hypergraphs. The core idea involves explicitly modeling heterophilic relationships between hyperedges and nodes through two complementary mechanisms: a prompt-based hyperedge feature construction strategy that maintains global semantic consistency while suppressing local noise, and an adaptive attention aggregation module that dynamically captures diverse local contributions of nodes to hyperedges. Combined with high-pass filtering, these designs enable HONOR to fully exploit heterophilic connection patterns, yielding more discriminative and robust node and hyperedge representations. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the superior generalization and robustness of HONOR, while extensive experiments on multiple homophilic and heterophilic hypergraph datasets show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
HONOR introduces a novel unsupervised hypergraph contrastive learning framework that explicitly models heterophilic relationships through two key mechanisms: prompt-based hyperedge feature construction and adaptive attention aggregation. The framework employs high-pass filtering to suppress homophilic noise and enhance heterophilic signal patterns. The method operates in a contrastive learning paradigm, where positive pairs are constructed through augmented views of the hypergraph, while negative pairs are sampled from different hyperedges. The prompt-based construction maintains global semantic consistency while reducing local noise interference, and the adaptive attention module dynamically weights node contributions based on their heterophilic relevance to each hyperedge.

## Key Results
- HONOR achieves 81.42% accuracy on Cora-C, 73.23% on Citeseer, and 83.69% on PubMed for node classification tasks
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple homophilic and heterophilic hypergraph datasets
- Demonstrates superior generalization and robustness through theoretical analysis
- Successfully captures both homophilic and heterophilic structural patterns in hypergraphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HONOR works by explicitly modeling the heterophilic relationships that traditional HNNs ignore or suppress. The prompt-based hyperedge feature construction creates a global semantic context that helps distinguish between homophilic and heterophilic connections, while the adaptive attention aggregation dynamically weights node contributions based on their relevance to heterophilic patterns. The high-pass filtering component removes low-frequency homophilic signals that could interfere with heterophilic relationship learning. This multi-pronged approach allows HONOR to simultaneously preserve homophilic patterns when beneficial while explicitly exploiting heterophilic structures for improved representation learning.

## Foundational Learning
- Hypergraph Neural Networks: Needed to understand the limitations of existing methods; quick check - review basic HNN architecture and homophily assumption
- Contrastive Learning: Essential for grasping HONOR's self-supervised approach; quick check - understand positive/negative pair construction in contrastive frameworks
- Heterophilic vs Homophilic Structures: Critical for appreciating the problem HONOR solves; quick check - identify examples of each in real-world networks
- Attention Mechanisms: Important for understanding adaptive weighting; quick check - review attention-based feature aggregation methods
- High-pass Filtering: Key to signal separation; quick check - understand frequency domain analysis in graph signals

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Hypergraph -> Prompt-based Feature Construction -> Adaptive Attention Aggregation -> High-pass Filtering -> Contrastive Loss -> Node/Hyperedge Embeddings

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is Feature Construction → Attention Aggregation → High-pass Filtering, as these three components work together to extract and enhance heterophilic patterns before contrastive learning.

**Design Tradeoffs**: HONOR trades computational complexity for representation quality, using sophisticated feature construction and attention mechanisms that may increase runtime but yield more discriminative embeddings. The high-pass filtering adds an additional processing step but enables better separation of heterophilic signals.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on datasets with predominantly homophilic structures, excessive computational overhead on large hypergraphs, and potential instability in attention weight learning during training.

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare HONOR against standard HNNs on a synthetic heterophilic hypergraph to verify heterophilic pattern capture; 2) Ablate the high-pass filtering component to quantify its contribution; 3) Test HONOR on a small homophilic hypergraph to ensure it doesn't degrade performance when heterophilic patterns are absent.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation scope, focusing primarily on specific benchmark datasets without extensive testing on diverse hypergraph structures
- Theoretical analysis of generalization and robustness lacks detailed mathematical proofs and assumptions
- Computational complexity and scalability of the prompt-based construction and adaptive attention modules are not thoroughly evaluated

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core methodology of HONOR, including the prompt-based hyperedge feature construction and adaptive attention aggregation, is well-defined and logically sound for addressing heterophilic hypergraph structures. The experimental results showing improved accuracy on benchmark datasets are reproducible and significant.
- **Medium Confidence**: The theoretical claims regarding generalization and robustness are supported by the framework's design but lack detailed mathematical proofs. The computational complexity and scalability of HONOR are not thoroughly evaluated.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of HONOR to diverse hypergraph structures beyond the tested benchmarks is uncertain without further validation.

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization to Diverse Datasets**: Test HONOR on additional heterophilic hypergraph datasets with varying properties (e.g., different node and hyperedge distributions) to assess its robustness and adaptability.
2. **Scalability Analysis**: Evaluate the computational efficiency and scalability of HONOR on large-scale hypergraph datasets to understand its practical applicability.
3. **Theoretical Validation**: Provide detailed mathematical proofs and assumptions for the theoretical claims of generalization and robustness to strengthen the theoretical foundation of HONOR.
