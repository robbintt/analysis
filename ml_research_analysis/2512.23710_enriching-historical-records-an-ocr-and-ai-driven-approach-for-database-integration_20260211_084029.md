# Enriching Historical Records: An OCR and AI-Driven Approach for Database Integration

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.23710
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23710
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Primary result**: AI-driven pipeline achieves 94% accuracy in linking historical records, demonstrating effective integration of OCR and generative AI for database enrichment

## Executive Summary
This study presents an automated pipeline that combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR), generative AI, and database linking to digitize and integrate historical records from the "Leidse hoogleraren en lectoren 1575-1815" books. The system addresses the challenge of preserving and enriching historical information by transforming unstructured textual data into structured database entries. The pipeline demonstrates significant potential for automating the processing of historical documents, reducing manual labor while maintaining high accuracy levels.

## Method Summary
The research team developed a three-stage automated pipeline: first, Tesseract OCR processed scanned images of historical pages with 1.08% Character Error Rate and 5.06% Word Error Rate. Second, GPT-3.5 Turbo extracted structured JSON data from the OCR text, achieving 63% accuracy from raw OCR and 65% from corrected text. Finally, a record linkage algorithm connected the extracted JSON data with existing database entries, demonstrating 94% accuracy for manually annotated files and 81% for OCR-derived files. The system was specifically designed to handle the unique challenges of historical documents, including layout variations and archaic terminology.

## Key Results
- Achieved 1.08% Character Error Rate and 5.06% Word Error Rate using Tesseract OCR
- GPT-3.5 Turbo extracted structured JSON data with 63% accuracy from OCR text and 65% from corrected text
- Record linkage algorithm successfully linked annotated JSON files with 94% accuracy and OCR-derived JSON files with 81%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline's effectiveness stems from the complementary strengths of OCR for text extraction, generative AI for structure recognition and data organization, and database linking algorithms for connecting extracted information to existing knowledge bases. The system leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo's ability to understand context and extract meaningful patterns from imperfect OCR output, while the record linkage component uses similarity metrics to match extracted data with database entries despite potential errors or variations in terminology.

## Foundational Learning
- **OCR fundamentals**: Understanding how OCR engines convert images to text is crucial for interpreting accuracy metrics and limitations. Quick check: Compare CER/WER values across different document types.
- **Generative AI for structured extraction**: GPT models can transform unstructured text into organized JSON by recognizing patterns and relationships. Quick check: Test extraction accuracy on varied document layouts.
- **Record linkage algorithms**: These match records across datasets using similarity metrics, essential for database integration. Quick check: Evaluate linkage accuracy with different similarity thresholds.
- **Error propagation in multi-stage pipelines**: Understanding how errors compound through OCR, extraction, and linking stages helps identify optimization opportunities. Quick check: Trace error sources through each pipeline stage.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image Scanner -> Tesseract OCR -> GPT-3.5 Turbo -> Record Linkage -> Database

**Critical Path**: The most critical path is OCR → AI extraction → Database linking, where errors at any stage propagate downstream and affect final accuracy.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The pipeline prioritizes automation over perfect accuracy, accepting moderate error rates in exchange for scalability. Using GPT-3.5 Turbo provides flexibility but introduces computational costs and potential variability in extraction quality.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failures include OCR misreading of historical fonts, AI misinterpreting context-specific terminology, and linkage mismatches due to database incompleteness or naming variations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test OCR accuracy on a small sample of diverse historical pages to establish baseline performance
2. Validate AI extraction accuracy on corrected vs. uncorrected OCR output to measure quality improvement
3. Run record linkage on a controlled test set with known matches to benchmark algorithm performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Pipeline validated only on a single historical corpus, limiting generalizability to other document types
- Moderate AI extraction accuracy (63-65%) suggests potential struggles with complex or varied document structures
- Performance degradation from 94% to 81% accuracy when moving from annotated to OCR-derived data indicates automation limitations

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| OCR performance metrics | High confidence |
| AI-driven data extraction accuracy | Medium confidence |
| Record linkage effectiveness | Medium confidence |
| Generalizability to other historical corpora | Low confidence |

## Next Checks
1. Test the pipeline on multiple historical document collections with varying layouts, languages, and time periods to assess generalizability
2. Conduct blind validation studies with domain experts to verify the accuracy of extracted and linked data
3. Implement cross-validation testing with different OCR engines and AI models to compare performance baselines
