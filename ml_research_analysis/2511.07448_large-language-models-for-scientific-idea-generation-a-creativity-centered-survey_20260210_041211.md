# Large Language Models for Scientific Idea Generation: A Creativity-Centered Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07448
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07448
- Reference count: 40
- Synthesizes methods for using LLMs in scientific idea generation, emphasizing novelty-soundness balance

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines how large language models can be applied to scientific idea generation, focusing on the critical balance between novelty and scientific validity. The authors categorize existing approaches into five distinct methodological families: external knowledge augmentation, prompt-based steering, inference-time scaling, multi-agent collaboration, and parameter adaptation. Through analysis using established creativity frameworks, they demonstrate how these methods differentially impact the novelty and value of generated ideas, revealing that while current techniques significantly improve ideation quality, achieving transformational creativity remains beyond current capabilities.

The work provides a comprehensive overview of the field's current state while identifying critical gaps and future directions. Key challenges highlighted include the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks, the need for robust human-LLM hybrid review systems, and the potential for architectural innovations beyond traditional next-token prediction paradigms. The survey serves as both a practical guide for researchers implementing LLM-based ideation systems and a roadmap for addressing fundamental limitations in computational creativity.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology, identifying and categorizing 25 relevant papers on LLM-based scientific idea generation. Methods are organized into five families based on their primary mechanisms: external knowledge augmentation (incorporating domain-specific data), prompt-based steering (using carefully crafted prompts), inference-time scaling (adjusting parameters during generation), multi-agent collaboration (using multiple specialized agents), and parameter adaptation (fine-tuning or adapting model weights). Each method is analyzed through established creativity frameworks to understand its impact on novelty and value dimensions of generated ideas.

## Key Results
- Current methods improve ideation quality but fully transformational creativity remains elusive
- Five-method categorization provides useful framework for understanding LLM creativity approaches
- Standardized benchmarks and human-LLM hybrid review systems are critical for advancing the field
- Future directions include open-ended discovery paradigms and domain-rich simulators

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's approach works by providing a structured framework for understanding how different LLM enhancement methods affect creativity dimensions. By mapping specific techniques to their impacts on novelty and value, researchers can better select and combine methods for their specific scientific domains. The categorization reveals that no single approach dominates, suggesting that hybrid methods combining multiple families may yield optimal results.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Creativity frameworks** (why needed: To evaluate and compare ideation methods; quick check: Can you map a method to novelty/value dimensions?)
2. **Domain-specific knowledge integration** (why needed: Scientific validity requires accurate domain knowledge; quick check: Does the method incorporate relevant scientific literature?)
3. **Evaluation metrics for scientific ideas** (why needed: Objective assessment of ideation quality; quick check: Are metrics standardized across studies?)
4. **Human-AI collaboration in scientific discovery** (why needed: Human oversight ensures validity of novel ideas; quick check: How does the system balance autonomy with expert review?)
5. **Next-token prediction limitations** (why needed: Understanding architectural constraints; quick check: What fundamental limitations does the architecture impose?)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Knowledge Base -> Prompt Engineering -> LLM Core -> Output Filter -> Human Review -> Final Ideas

**Critical Path:** Domain knowledge augmentation → Prompt engineering → LLM generation → Novelty-value assessment → Human validation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Precision vs. creativity (stricter constraints yield more valid but less novel ideas); computational cost vs. quality (more agents/resource-intensive methods yield better results); autonomy vs. control (more human oversight reduces risk but limits scale)

**Failure Signatures:** Hallucination of non-existent scientific concepts; overly conservative outputs lacking novelty; domain-inappropriate suggestions; failure to recognize established scientific constraints

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement prompt-based steering with different creativity templates across two scientific domains
2. Compare external knowledge augmentation using domain-specific vs. general corpora
3. Test multi-agent collaboration with varying numbers of specialized agents on a benchmark ideation task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can we develop standardized benchmarks for evaluating scientific idea generation quality?
- What architectural innovations beyond next-token prediction could enable transformational creativity?
- How can open-ended discovery paradigms be implemented effectively with LLMs?
- What are optimal configurations for human-LLM hybrid review systems?

## Limitations
- Analysis based on a relatively small sample of 25 papers, potentially missing emerging approaches
- Lack of quantitative benchmarks makes claims about transformational creativity difficult to verify
- Future directions remain largely speculative without concrete technical proposals or validation

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Identification of key challenges in evaluation and human-LLM collaboration

**Medium confidence:**
- Proposed five-method categorization framework for LLM creativity enhancement

**Low confidence:**
- Claims about future architectural innovations beyond next-token prediction

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comprehensive literature review beyond 25 identified papers to validate completeness of five-method categorization
2. Develop and apply standardized creativity metrics to evaluate same set of LLM-based scientific ideation methods across multiple domains
3. Implement and test human-LLM hybrid review systems with different weighting schemes to determine optimal configurations
