# Neuromorphic Online Clustering and Its Application to Spike Sorting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12555
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12555
- Authors: James E. Smith
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: nD achieves 0.82-0.93 accuracy on synthetic spike sorting, outperforming k-means for small variations (instance deviations < 0.1875)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a neuromorphic dendrite (nD) model for online clustering that uses active dendrites as fundamental building blocks. The method models clusters using templates with 3D weight arrays and updates weights via capture, backoff, and search operations during inference. Applied to spike sorting, nD demonstrates superior performance to offline k-means, especially for small instance deviations, while requiring only 287 low-precision additions per feature vector compared to k-means' 4-20 passes through data.

## Method Summary
The nD method uses p templates with 3D weight arrays w[p][m][n] to cluster feature vectors representing spike shapes. During inference, it computes similarity using a ±r range (r=3) around input features, selects the winning template, and updates weights through capture (increasing winner's weights), backoff (decreasing other templates' weights), and search (allowing non-winning templates to gradually increase weights). The method operates in a single-pass online fashion, requiring only 5-bit precision weights and achieving near-ideal accuracy levels.

## Key Results
- nD achieves 0.82-0.93 accuracy on synthetic spike sorting tasks with 6-feature vectors
- Superior performance to k-means for small variations (instance deviations < 0.1875)
- Requires only 287 low-precision additions per feature vector versus k-means' 4-20 passes
- Dynamically adapts to changing input streams and maintains accuracy with non-uniform spike rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The nD method succeeds by combining the biological inspiration of active dendrites with online learning dynamics. The capture/backoff mechanism allows templates to specialize while preventing weight saturation, while the search operation enables recovery from initial misassignments. The similarity coding range (±r) provides robustness to feature variations without requiring normalization. The single-pass operation with minimal arithmetic operations makes it computationally efficient while maintaining accuracy comparable to offline methods.

## Foundational Learning
- **Active dendrites as computational units**: Why needed - provides biological inspiration for distributed computation; Quick check - verify template updates follow dendritic integration rules
- **Capture/backoff dynamics**: Why needed - enables template specialization and prevents collapse; Quick check - monitor weight distributions for convergence patterns
- **Similarity coding with range r**: Why needed - robust matching without feature scaling; Quick check - test performance sensitivity to r parameter
- **Online single-pass learning**: Why needed - real-time adaptation to streaming data; Quick check - validate accuracy on temporally ordered spike streams
- **Template weight saturation limits**: Why needed - prevents runaway growth and maintains dynamic range; Quick check - verify weight clipping at wmax=32 and wbase=28
- **Search operation probability**: Why needed - enables recovery from poor initial assignments; Quick check - compare performance with and without search enabled

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data Generator -> nD Core -> Template Update -> Accuracy Evaluator -> Munkres Assigner

**Critical Path:**
Feature vector input → Similarity coding (argmax over templates) → Template update (capture/backoff/search) → Weight array modification

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Capture vs. backoff ratio: Higher capture improves winner specialization but risks template collapse
- Search probability: Enables recovery from misassignments but slows convergence
- Weight precision (5-bit): Minimizes hardware cost but limits dynamic range
- Template count vs. overlap: More templates improve accuracy but increase computational load

**Failure Signatures:**
- Templates collapsing to single cluster → Check capture/backoff ratio
- Poor accuracy on small deviations → Verify search operation enabled
- Accuracy drop with neuron count >8 → Expected behavior due to cluster overlap
- Random weight fluctuations → Check weight update bounds (wmax=32, wbase=28)

**First Experiments:**
1. Run nD with search=0 to verify it matches k-means poor performance on small instance deviations
2. Test capture/backoff ratio sensitivity by varying the capture/backoff proportion
3. Implement template initialization using discretized k-means centroids and compare to random initialization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can cluster identifiers be merged algorithmically when the number of clusters exceeds the true number of neurons?
- How does nD performance compare to offline methods on real extracellular recordings with unknown ground truth?
- Can nD hyperparameters be adapted online rather than determined via offline sweeps?

## Limitations
- Performance on real neural recordings not demonstrated; all results use synthetic data
- Template initialization procedure underspecified, requiring inference from context
- Hyperparameter tuning requires manual sweeps rather than adaptive online adjustment

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core algorithm mechanics (capture/backoff/search, similarity coding with r=3)
- **Medium Confidence**: Comparison methodology and hardware cost claims
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance results internally consistent but synthetic vs. real data gap unaddressed

## Next Checks
1. Implement multiple template initialization approaches (random vs. discretized centroids) and compare convergence patterns
2. Validate similarity coding mechanism by comparing outputs with simplified argmax over raw template-dot-input similarity
3. Test search operation impact through ablations with search=0 versus search=1/16 and probabilistic variants
