# Physics-Informed Machine Learning in Biomedical Science and Engineering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05433
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05433
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Review of PINNs, NODEs, and NOs for biomedical modeling, with applications in biofluid mechanics, biomechanics, and medical imaging.

## Executive Summary
This review summarizes advances in physics-informed machine learning (PIML) for biomedical modeling, focusing on three core frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs). The paper highlights how these methods integrate physical laws with data-driven inference to address challenges in biomedical applications where data is sparse, noisy, or incomplete. Applications span biofluid mechanics (e.g., CSF flow reconstruction), biomechanics (e.g., cardiac fiber orientation), and medical imaging, demonstrating improved accuracy and interpretability compared to conventional black-box approaches.

## Method Summary
The review synthesizes three PIML frameworks without detailing a single reproducible method. PINNs embed PDEs into neural networks by minimizing a composite loss function that combines data misfit and physics residuals computed via automatic differentiation. NODEs model continuous dynamics from time-series data, handling irregular sampling through ODE solvers. Neural operators learn mappings between function spaces for real-time surrogate modeling. The most concrete example provided is CSF flow reconstruction using PINNs, where a neural network predicts velocity and pressure fields from sparse particle-tracking data, validated against derived hemodynamic quantities.

## Key Results
- PINNs effectively solve forward and inverse problems in biofluid mechanics and biomechanics by embedding PDEs as soft constraints
- NODEs enable continuous-time modeling of physiological systems with irregular sampling, particularly suited for pharmacokinetics
- Neural operators provide real-time surrogate modeling for multiscale biological domains, achieving orders-of-magnitude speedup over classical solvers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Embedding physical laws as soft constraints in the loss function regularizes the hypothesis space, enabling solution discovery from sparse, noisy biomedical data.
- **Mechanism:** The network minimizes a composite loss function $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{data} + \mathcal{L}_{physics}$. The $\mathcal{L}_{physics}$ term calculates the residual of governing PDEs/ODEs via automatic differentiation. This penalizes physically implausible predictions, effectively substituting missing training data with governing equations (e.g., Navier-Stokes for fluid mechanics).
- **Core assumption:** The prescribed governing equations are a sufficiently accurate approximation of the true biological dynamics, and the residuals are differentiable.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "integrate parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods... highlighting their growing role... where physical interpretability, data scarcity... make conventional black-box learning insufficient."
  - [Section 1]: "PINNs integrate physical laws... into the loss function... thereby reducing the need for expensive data assimilation."
  - [Corpus]: "Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) offers a systematic framework that integrates data-driven inference with physical constraints..." (Paper: *Learning Biomolecular Motion*).
- **Break condition:** The physics residuals are non-differentiable, or the "true" biology deviates significantly from the selected governing equations (model misspecification).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Continuous-time modeling via Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) handles irregular sampling and latent dynamics better than discrete recurrent architectures.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of discrete hidden state updates, NODEs parameterize the derivative of the hidden state $dh/dt = f(h(t), t)$. An ODE solver computes the output at any time $t$, naturally handling irregular time intervals common in clinical visits or physiological monitoring without imputation.
- **Core assumption:** The underlying system dynamics are smooth and can be approximated by a Lipschitz-continuous vector field learned by the network.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "NODEs... offer continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems... and pharmacokinetics."
  - [Section 3]: "NODEs learn continuous dynamics from time-series data... compatibility with adjoint sensitivity analysis... facilitates efficient training on irregularly sampled... datasets."
  - [Corpus]: Weak/missing specific corpus evidence for *irregular sampling superiority* in neighbors; relying on main text.
- **Break condition:** The system exhibits "stiff" dynamics (rapid changes relative to the time scale), causing standard ODE solvers to fail or become computationally prohibitive.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Neural Operators (NOs) achieve real-time inference for complex biological systems by learning mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces rather than discretized instances.
- **Mechanism:** NOs (e.g., DeepONet, FNO) learn an operator $G: u \to v$ (e.g., initial condition to solution trajectory). Once trained, they predict full-field solutions for new inputs instantly (surrogate modeling), bypassing the need to solve iterative numerical solvers at inference time.
- **Core assumption:** The training dataset (distribution of input functions) sufficiently covers the variation expected during inference (generalization).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "Neural operators... providing real-time surrogate modeling... enabling efficient simulations across multiscale... biological domains."
  - [Section 4]: "Neural operators are trained offline and enable real-time inference... orders-of-magnitude speedup over classical solvers."
  - [Corpus]: "Neural operators learn solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs)..." (Paper: *Uncertainty-Aware Diagnostics*).
- **Break condition:** The inference inputs fall outside the training distribution (extrapolation failure), or the geometry/topology changes fundamentally (though graph-based NOs mitigate this).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Automatic Differentiation (AD)**
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for PINNs to compute exact derivatives of the network output with respect to inputs (spatial/temporal coordinates) to evaluate PDE residuals ($\nabla \cdot u$, $\partial u / \partial t$) without numerical approximation errors.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain the difference between symbolic differentiation, numerical differentiation, and autodiff (reverse-mode)?

- **Concept:** **Inverse Problems vs. Forward Problems**
  - **Why needed here:** A major use case in the paper is inferring hidden physical parameters (e.g., tissue stiffness, reaction rates) from data. Understanding ill-posedness and regularization is critical.
  - **Quick check question:** In a PINN, how do you switch from solving a PDE (forward) to identifying a parameter $\lambda$ inside the PDE (inverse)?

- **Concept:** **Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Hybrid Models**
  - **Why needed here:** "Gray-box" models balance the bias of potentially wrong physics equations with the variance of data-driven neural networks.
  - **Quick check question:** If your physics-informed model fits data perfectly but has high PDE residuals, what does that imply about your governing equations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Inputs (Spatial coordinates $(x, y, z)$, Time $(t)$, Physical Parameters $(\nu, D)$) -> Network (MLP, ODE-Solver + NN, Branch + Trunk Net) -> Constraints (PDE Residuals ($f_{\theta}$), Boundary Conditions (BCs), Initial Conditions (ICs)) -> Outputs (State variables (Velocity $u$, Pressure $p$, Concentration $c$))

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Formulation:** Define the PDE/ODE and boundaries.
  2. **Architecture:** Initialize network (e.g., MLP with tanh activations).
  3. **Optimization:** Minimize composite loss using Adam (initial) $\to$ L-BFGS (refinement).
  4. **Diagnostics:** Monitor loss balance ($\lambda$ weighting) and spectral bias.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **PINNs:** High interpretability & inverse solving capability; slower training; sensitive to hyperparameters (weights).
  - **NOs:** Fastest inference (real-time); requires massive offline dataset generation; less flexible to equation changes (requires retraining).
  - **NODEs:** Excellent for time-series with irregular intervals; computationally expensive during training due to ODE solver steps.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Spectral Bias:** Model captures low-frequency (smooth) components but fails to learn high-frequency details (common in vanilla PINNs). *Fix:* Fourier feature embeddings.
  - **Stiffness Instability:** ODE solver fails to converge in NODEs with rapid dynamics. *Fix:* Stiff solvers or adaptive stepping.
  - **Causality Violation:** PINN minimizes error at later times before learning initial conditions, leading to convergence failure. *Fix:* Causal (time-window) training.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **1D Heat Equation (PINN):** Solve a simple diffusion equation to verify the pipeline (loss balancing and AD).
  2. **Parameter Inference (Gray-box):** Use a PINN to recover an unknown diffusion coefficient $D$ from synthetic noisy data.
  3. **Lotka-Volterra (NODE):** Train a NODE on predator-prey data to learn the interaction dynamics without explicit ODE terms.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can total uncertainty quantification (UQ) be rigorously implemented to disentangle epistemic, aleatoric, and structural uncertainties in safety-critical PIML applications?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that robust UQ is "critical" but current work is only "emerging" for PINNs, NODEs, and NOs, highlighting the difficulty of separating intrinsic biological variability from model limitations.
- **Why unresolved:** Biomedical data is often sparse and noisy, making it computationally difficult to distinguish measurement noise (aleatoric) from incomplete physics representations (structural uncertainty) using standard Bayesian or ensemble methods.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A unified framework that provides calibrated confidence intervals for patient-specific predictions, validated against ground-truth variability in clinical datasets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can neural operators be adapted to improve generalization and accuracy when predicting dynamics for geometries or pathologies outside the training distribution?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] In the Neural Operators outlook, the authors identify "predicting accurately outside the training distribution" as a "key current challenge" and a priority for future research.
- **Why unresolved:** Neural operators typically learn mappings from specific function spaces; they often fail to extrapolate to the heterogeneous, irregular geometries found in patient-specific biological structures not represented in the training set.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of an operator model trained on healthy tissue data that successfully predicts biomechanical responses in diseased or anomalous anatomies without retraining.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively function as autonomous orchestrators that translate natural language biomedical problems into valid physics-informed formulations?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper suggests a future direction where LLMs could translate natural language problems ("simulate oxygen diffusion...") into PINN formulations, but notes LLMs currently lack an understanding of PDE constraints.
- **Why unresolved:** There is a semantic gap between the qualitative reasoning of LLMs and the strict mathematical formalism required for physics-informed loss functions and boundary conditions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An automated pipeline where an LLM correctly selects collocation points, boundary conditions, and optimizers to solve a novel biomedical simulation described only by a text prompt.

## Limitations
- The evidence base relies heavily on recent literature with limited long-term validation studies, particularly for clinical deployment scenarios
- Computational costs associated with training complex PIML models could limit real-world implementation in resource-constrained settings
- Robustness of methods across diverse patient populations and disease states remains underexplored

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The fundamental mechanisms of PINNs, NODEs, and NOs are well-established through multiple independent implementations. The core claim that embedding physics constraints improves generalization from sparse biomedical data is supported by consistent experimental evidence across applications.
- **Medium Confidence:** Claims about specific biomedical applications (e.g., cardiac fiber orientation estimation, tumor growth prediction) are based on promising initial results but lack large-scale validation studies. The effectiveness of these methods may be problem-specific.
- **Low Confidence:** Predictions about integration with large language models and autonomous discovery are speculative, with limited concrete evidence presented in the review or supporting literature.

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization Testing:** Apply trained PIML models to out-of-distribution biomedical data (different patient demographics, disease severities) to assess robustness beyond training distributions.
2. **Uncertainty Quantification Validation:** Compare multiple uncertainty quantification methods (Bayesian PINNs, ensemble approaches) on benchmark biomedical problems to establish best practices for reliable inference.
3. **Computational Benchmarking:** Measure wall-clock time and resource requirements for training PIML models versus traditional numerical methods across different biomedical applications, including data preprocessing overhead.
