## Executive Summary
ClaritySpeech introduces a novel framework for dementia obfuscation in speech that addresses privacy concerns and improves accessibility for individuals with dementia. The system operates in low-data environments without fine-tuning by integrating automatic speech recognition, text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech technologies. The method processes dementia-affected speech by first transcribing it, then applying obfuscation techniques to reduce dementia markers, and finally synthesizing corrected speech while maintaining speaker identity. Experiments on ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets demonstrate significant improvements in word error rate and speech quality, with a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1 score across adversarial settings.

## Method Summary
ClaritySpeech employs a three-stage pipeline: automatic speech recognition converts dementia-affected speech to text, text obfuscation techniques reduce dementia markers while preserving meaning, and zero-shot text-to-speech synthesizes the corrected text back into natural-sounding speech that maintains speaker identity. The framework is designed to operate without fine-tuning, making it suitable for low-resource environments. The obfuscation process targets linguistic markers associated with dementia while maintaining the speaker's unique vocal characteristics through advanced TTS models that can adapt to unseen speakers.

## Key Results
- 16% and 10% drop in mean F1 score across adversarial settings on ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets
- Word error rate improvement from 0.73 to 0.08 (ADReSS) and 0.15 (ADReSSo)
- Speech quality enhancement from 1.65 to approximately 2.15 on standard evaluation scales
- Maintains 50% speaker similarity while effectively obfuscating dementia markers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system exploits the modularity of the speech processing pipeline, allowing each component to be optimized independently. By separating the dementia marker identification (via ASR) from the speech synthesis (via TTS), the framework can apply targeted interventions without requiring end-to-end training on sensitive dementia speech data. The zero-shot TTS component leverages large-scale pretraining to adapt to new speakers with minimal examples, enabling speaker preservation without exposing personal voice data to fine-tuning processes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Converts spoken language into text; needed for analyzing linguistic patterns associated with dementia
- **Text Obfuscation**: Modifies text to reduce identifiable markers while preserving meaning; quick check: measure information loss vs. obfuscation effectiveness
- **Zero-shot Text-to-Speech**: Generates speech from text without speaker-specific training; needed to maintain privacy by avoiding voice model fine-tuning
- **Dementia Markers**: Linguistic features (repetition, word-finding difficulties, syntactic simplification) that indicate cognitive decline; quick check: validate marker detection accuracy
- **Speaker Similarity Metrics**: Measures how closely synthetic speech matches original speaker identity; needed to ensure naturalness and acceptability
- **Mean F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall; used here to evaluate obfuscation effectiveness against adversarial detection

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: ASR -> Text Obfuscation -> Zero-shot TTS

**Critical Path**: The ASR accuracy directly impacts obfuscation quality, which in turn affects TTS naturalness. The pipeline is sequential, with each stage dependent on the previous one's output quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades some speaker similarity (50%) for effective dementia marker reduction, balancing privacy preservation with naturalness. The zero-shot approach avoids fine-tuning but may sacrifice some speaker-specific nuances compared to personalized models.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor ASR accuracy leads to incorrect dementia marker identification, resulting in ineffective or inappropriate obfuscation. Mismatched obfuscation intensity can either fail to mask dementia markers or make speech unnaturally altered. TTS quality degradation occurs when obfuscation produces syntactically complex or unusual constructions.

**First Experiments**: 1) Benchmark ASR accuracy on dementia-affected speech across different models; 2) Test obfuscation effectiveness with varying intensity levels while measuring information preservation; 3) Evaluate zero-shot TTS speaker adaptation across diverse demographic groups.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation metrics don't fully explore real-world usability implications or user experience
- Effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios remains unclear due to dataset-specific testing
- 50% speaker similarity may impact naturalness and acceptability of generated speech

## Confidence

**High confidence** in technical feasibility demonstrated by experimental results
**Medium confidence** in practical applicability due to limited real-world scenario exploration
**Low confidence** in generalizability across diverse populations and complex environments

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with individuals with dementia and caregivers to evaluate perceived naturalness and acceptability in real communication scenarios
2. Test method on diverse datasets representing various dialects, accents, and dementia stages to assess robustness
3. Investigate impact on downstream applications like automatic speech recognition systems and clinical assessments
