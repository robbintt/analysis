# X-Coder: Advancing Competitive Programming with Fully Synthetic Tasks, Solutions, and Tests

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.06953
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06953
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fully synthetic data can train competitive programming models to expert-level reasoning performance

## Executive Summary
This paper explores whether fully synthetic data can train competitive programming models to expert-level reasoning performance. The authors find that off-the-shelf synthesis methods are suboptimal for this domain and develop a domain-specific evolution approach with dual-verification strategy to generate high-quality synthetic tasks, solutions, and tests. Using this synthetic data, they train X-Coder under an SFT-then-RL paradigm. X-Coder-7B achieves 62.9% avg@8 on LiveCodeBench v5 and 55.8% on v6, outperforming larger models trained on real-world data. The study demonstrates that fully synthetic data is sufficient for competitive programming and provides insights into data scaling, feature evolution, and code-centric reinforcement learning.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a domain-specific evolution approach for generating high-quality synthetic competitive programming data. This approach includes a dual-verification strategy combining an LLM verifier and test generator to ensure data quality. The synthetic data is used to train X-Coder through a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase followed by reinforcement learning (RL). The evolution process involves iterative refinement of synthetic tasks, solutions, and test cases, with verification steps to maintain quality standards. The methodology specifically addresses the unique challenges of competitive programming, such as complex problem-solving requirements and the need for diverse, challenging test cases.

## Key Results
- X-Coder-7B achieves 62.9% avg@8 on LiveCodeBench v5
- X-Coder-7B achieves 55.8% on LiveCodeBench v6
- Outperforms larger models trained on real-world data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success stems from the domain-specific evolution approach that generates high-quality synthetic data tailored to competitive programming challenges. The dual-verification strategy (LLM verifier + test generator) ensures the synthetic data maintains high standards, addressing the limitations of off-the-shelf synthesis methods. The SFT-then-RL training paradigm allows the model to first learn from the synthetic corpus and then refine its reasoning through reinforcement learning, capturing the iterative problem-solving nature of competitive programming.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dual-verification strategy**: Why needed - ensures synthetic data quality by combining LLM verification with test generation; Quick check - verify false positive/negative rates of both components
- **Domain-specific evolution**: Why needed - off-the-shelf synthesis methods are suboptimal for competitive programming; Quick check - compare performance against generic synthetic data
- **SFT-then-RL paradigm**: Why needed - allows initial learning from synthetic data followed by reasoning refinement; Quick check - ablate RL phase to measure impact
- **Synthetic data scaling**: Why needed - demonstrates that fully synthetic data can achieve expert-level performance; Quick check - analyze performance vs. synthetic data volume
- **Code-centric reinforcement learning**: Why needed - competitive programming requires iterative problem-solving refinement; Quick check - compare against standard RL approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Evolution Process -> Dual-Verification -> Synthetic Data Corpus -> SFT Training -> RL Fine-tuning -> X-Coder Model

**Critical Path:** Evolution Process (generation) -> Dual-Verification (quality control) -> Synthetic Data Corpus (training data) -> SFT-then-RL (training pipeline) -> X-Coder (final model)

**Design Tradeoffs:** The use of proprietary LLMs (o1-preview, DeepSeek-Coder-V2) for generation and verification provides high-quality outputs but raises reproducibility concerns. The focus on fully synthetic data eliminates dependency on real-world competitive programming datasets but requires sophisticated generation and verification mechanisms.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor verification component performance leading to low-quality synthetic data, overfitting to specific verification methodologies, insufficient diversity in evolved synthetic tasks, or inadequate test case generation for edge cases.

**First Experiments:**
1. Ablation study removing LLM verifier to measure impact on synthetic data quality
2. Ablation study removing test generator to measure impact on synthetic data quality
3. Performance comparison on non-LiveCodeBench competitive programming benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations
- The study does not fully characterize the false positive/negative rates of the verification components
- Heavy reliance on proprietary LLMs raises questions about reproducibility and potential domain-specific overfitting
- Limited comparison against GPT-4-based AutoCode with incomplete transparency about training details

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The core finding that synthetic data can achieve expert-level competitive programming performance (62.9% avg@8 on LiveCodeBench v5).

**Medium confidence:** The claim that domain-specific evolution is necessary for high-quality synthetic competitive programming data, given the comparison to off-the-shelf synthesis methods.

**Low confidence:** The assertion that fully synthetic data is sufficient for competitive programming mastery, as the study does not test transfer to non-LiveCodeBench competitive programming tasks or real-world coding scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing either the LLM verifier or test generator to quantify their individual contributions to synthetic data quality and model performance.
2. Test X-Coder's performance on additional competitive programming benchmarks beyond LiveCodeBench (e.g., Codeforces, AtCoder) to assess generalization.
3. Evaluate whether models trained on synthetic data maintain performance when tested with different LLM-based verification systems to assess potential overfitting to specific verification methodologies.
