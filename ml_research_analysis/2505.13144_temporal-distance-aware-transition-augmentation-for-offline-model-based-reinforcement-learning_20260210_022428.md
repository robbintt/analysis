# Temporal Distance-aware Transition Augmentation for Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13144
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13144
- Authors: Dongsu Lee; Minhae Kwon
- Reference count: 21
- TempDATA outperforms previous offline MBRL methods and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art trajectory augmentation and goal-conditioned RL approaches

## Executive Summary
TempDATA addresses the challenge of sparse-reward, long-horizon goal-reaching in offline model-based RL by learning a temporally structured latent representation that encodes both trajectory-level and transition-level temporal distances. It augments transitions within this representation space using a learned latent dynamics model, then trains goal-conditioned policies with intrinsic rewards derived from the temporal distance. Experiments on D4RL AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, CALVIN, and pixel-based Kitchen show TempDATA achieves significant gains in success rates on sparse-reward navigation and manipulation tasks.

## Method Summary
TempDATA introduces a temporal distance-aware augmentation framework for offline model-based RL. The method learns a latent representation that encodes both trajectory-level and transition-level temporal distances, then uses this representation to augment transitions in latent space. A latent dynamics model generates augmented transitions, which are used to train a goal-conditioned policy with intrinsic rewards based on temporal distance. The approach is evaluated on multiple offline RL benchmarks including D4RL AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, CALVIN, and pixel-based Kitchen environments.

## Key Results
- TempDATA outperforms previous offline MBRL methods on D4RL AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, CALVIN, and pixel-based Kitchen
- Achieves significant gains in success rates on sparse-reward navigation and manipulation tasks
- Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art trajectory augmentation and goal-conditioned RL approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TempDATA addresses the fundamental challenge in offline RL where the dataset often lacks diverse and sufficient transitions for effective long-horizon planning. By learning a temporally structured latent representation, the method captures both trajectory-level and transition-level temporal distances that encode the sequential structure of tasks. The temporal augmentation in latent space allows the agent to explore trajectories that were not present in the original dataset, particularly important for sparse-reward tasks where successful trajectories are rare. The intrinsic rewards based on temporal distance guide the policy toward goals using the augmented transitions, effectively expanding the reachable state space beyond what's available in the offline dataset.

## Foundational Learning

**Temporal Distance Encoding**: Captures how far each transition is from the goal in terms of time steps. Needed to provide meaningful reward signals for long-horizon planning. Quick check: Verify temporal distance correlates with actual path length to goal.

**Latent Dynamics Model**: Predicts future states in a compressed latent space. Needed to generate plausible transitions for augmentation without requiring full environment interaction. Quick check: Compare reconstruction error and prediction accuracy against baseline models.

**Goal-Conditioned Policy**: Learns to reach specific goal states rather than maximizing reward. Needed to handle sparse-reward settings where success is binary. Quick check: Test policy on held-out goal states not seen during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Dataset -> Temporal Encoder -> Latent Dynamics Model -> Transition Augmenter -> Goal-Conditioned Policy

**Critical Path**: Temporal distance calculation → Latent transition augmentation → Goal-conditioned policy training → Policy evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: TempDATA trades computational complexity for improved sample efficiency. The latent dynamics model adds training overhead but enables generation of diverse transitions without environment interaction. The temporal distance encoding requires additional computation but provides crucial information for sparse-reward tasks.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor performance when offline dataset lacks diverse trajectories (model cannot generate meaningful augmentations)
- Degraded performance with highly stochastic environments (latent dynamics model predictions become unreliable)
- Limited scalability beyond 100-step horizons (experiments suggest this is a current limitation)

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify temporal distance encoding captures meaningful task structure by visualizing latent space trajectories
2. Test augmentation quality by comparing diversity of generated transitions against original dataset
3. Evaluate policy performance with and without temporal augmentation to quantify contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

Major uncertainties remain around TempDATA's scalability to truly long-horizon tasks beyond 100 steps, as experiments only demonstrate performance up to this horizon. The ablation studies suggest the temporal augmentation is critical, but do not isolate the relative importance of trajectory-level versus transition-level temporal encoding. The method's dependence on a learned latent dynamics model introduces potential compounding errors, particularly when transferring to environments with different dynamics or visual observations.

## Limitations

- Scalability limited to approximately 100-step horizons based on experimental results
- Ablation studies do not clearly separate contributions of trajectory-level vs transition-level temporal encoding
- Dependence on learned latent dynamics model introduces potential compounding errors, especially with visual observations

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the core contribution: temporal distance-aware augmentation improves goal-reaching performance in offline MBRL
**Medium confidence** in the relative effectiveness across all benchmark tasks, given the limited number of environments tested
**Medium confidence** in the claim of state-of-the-art performance, as some recent trajectory augmentation methods are not directly compared

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate TempDATA on longer-horizon tasks (200+ steps) to test scalability limits of the temporal augmentation approach
2. Perform controlled ablation studies to quantify the relative contributions of trajectory-level vs transition-level temporal distance encoding
3. Test robustness to model misspecification by evaluating performance when the latent dynamics model is trained on a different but related environment
