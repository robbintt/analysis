# PodBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Instruction-Aware Audio-Oriented Podcast Script Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14903
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14903
- Reference count: 20
- Introduces benchmark of 800 podcast script samples with inputs up to 21K tokens

## Executive Summary
PodBench addresses the gap in evaluating LLM performance for instruction-aware, context-grounded podcast script generation. It introduces a benchmark of 800 samples with inputs up to 21K tokens and a two-stage evaluation framework combining deterministic constraint checking with LLM-based quality assessment. Experiments reveal that while proprietary models excel, open-source models with explicit reasoning show superior robustness in handling long contexts and multi-speaker coordination. However, high instruction following does not guarantee high content substance, highlighting a critical performance divergence. PodBench provides a reproducible testbed for advancing audio-centric conversational AI.

## Method Summary
PodBench presents a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating podcast script generation tasks. The benchmark comprises 800 samples with input contexts ranging from 800 to 21,000 tokens, encompassing various podcast genres and formats. The evaluation framework employs a two-stage approach: first, deterministic constraint checking verifies adherence to structural requirements and instruction-following, followed by LLM-based quality assessment that evaluates content coherence and conversational quality. This methodology aims to provide a balanced assessment that captures both technical compliance and creative quality aspects of podcast script generation.

## Key Results
- Proprietary models outperform open-source models on instruction-following tasks
- Open-source models with explicit reasoning demonstrate superior robustness in long-context handling
- High instruction-following scores do not correlate with high content quality scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its specialized focus on audio-oriented conversational content, which differs significantly from standard text generation tasks. The two-stage evaluation framework captures both technical compliance (through deterministic constraints) and qualitative aspects (through LLM assessment), providing a more comprehensive evaluation than single-metric approaches. The inclusion of long-context inputs (up to 21K tokens) challenges models' ability to maintain coherence and speaker consistency across extended conversations, a critical capability for realistic podcast generation.

## Foundational Learning

**Podcast script structure** - Why needed: Understanding the unique format requirements of podcast scripts versus other text formats. Quick check: Verify models can generate proper dialogue tags, speaker labels, and scene transitions.

**Long-context modeling** - Why needed: Podcast conversations often involve extensive background information and multiple speakers. Quick check: Assess models' ability to maintain context and coherence across 10K+ token inputs.

**Multi-speaker coordination** - Why needed: Natural conversations require distinct speaker voices and consistent character portrayal. Quick check: Evaluate whether models can maintain speaker consistency throughout extended dialogues.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Collection -> Preprocessing -> Model Generation -> Deterministic Constraint Checking -> LLM Quality Assessment

**Critical Path:** Instruction Input -> Model Generation -> Constraint Verification -> Quality Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The two-stage evaluation balances computational efficiency (deterministic checks) with nuanced assessment (LLM evaluation), though this introduces potential evaluator bias and subjectivity in the quality assessment phase.

**Failure Signatures:** Models may excel at structural compliance while producing superficial content, or demonstrate creative quality but fail to follow explicit instructions, highlighting the divergence between instruction-following and content substance.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test constraint checking accuracy on a subset of generated scripts. 2) Compare evaluator consistency across different LLM models. 3) Analyze correlation between instruction-following scores and content quality scores across model types.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- LLM-based quality assessment introduces subjectivity and potential evaluator bias
- Benchmark focuses exclusively on English-language podcasts, limiting cross-lingual generalizability
- 800-sample size may not fully capture the diversity of real-world podcast formats

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Novel benchmark introduction with 800 samples and two-stage evaluation framework
- **Medium Confidence**: Proprietary models outperform open-source models in instruction-following
- **Medium Confidence**: High instruction-following does not guarantee high content substance

## Next Checks

1. Conduct inter-rater reliability analysis on LLM-based quality assessment component
2. Expand benchmark to include multilingual podcast samples for cross-lingual evaluation
3. Implement ablation studies to determine relative importance of deterministic constraints versus LLM assessment
