# Classifying Clinical Outcome of Epilepsy Patients with Ictal Chirp Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.13476
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13476
- **Reference count:** 6
- **Primary result:** Achieved up to 88.8% accuracy for identifying optimal epilepsy cases using Random Forest and k-NN classifiers on t-SNE embeddings

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the use of t-SNE dimensionality reduction on chirp features extracted from intracranial EEG recordings to classify clinical outcomes in epilepsy patients. The researchers evaluated three classification tasks using four classifiers on 2D t-SNE embeddings, finding that Random Forest and k-NN achieved the highest performance. SHAP sensitivity maps were employed to reveal feature importance patterns across the embedding space, demonstrating how chirp attributes influence regional clustering and class separation.

## Method Summary
The researchers extracted chirp features from intracranial EEG recordings of epilepsy patients and applied t-SNE dimensionality reduction to create 2D embeddings. Four classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, k-NN) were evaluated across three classification tasks using these embeddings. The study employed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) sensitivity maps to interpret feature importance and understand how chirp attributes influenced clustering and class separation in the embedding space.

## Key Results
- Random Forest and k-NN classifiers achieved the highest performance, with up to 88.8% accuracy for identifying optimal cases
- t-SNE visualizations effectively clustered similar cases based on clinical outcomes
- SHAP sensitivity maps revealed distinct feature importance patterns across different regions of the embedding space

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by transforming high-dimensional chirp features from EEG signals into lower-dimensional t-SNE embeddings that preserve meaningful relationships between patient cases. This dimensionality reduction enables visualization and classification while maintaining the essential characteristics that distinguish successful from less successful treatment outcomes. The combination of advanced feature extraction (chirp analysis) with interpretable visualization techniques allows clinicians to understand not just which patients will likely have optimal outcomes, but also why certain features are predictive.

## Foundational Learning
- **t-SNE dimensionality reduction**: Why needed - Reduces high-dimensional data to 2D for visualization and classification; Quick check - Verify that similar cases cluster together in the 2D space
- **Chirp feature extraction**: Why needed - Captures temporal patterns in EEG signals relevant to seizure dynamics; Quick check - Confirm that extracted features show meaningful variation across patient outcomes
- **SHAP sensitivity analysis**: Why needed - Provides interpretable feature importance for complex models; Quick check - Validate that top features align with clinical expectations
- **Multi-class classification evaluation**: Why needed - Assesses model performance across different clinical outcome categories; Quick check - Compare precision, recall, and F1-scores across all classes
- **Cross-validation techniques**: Why needed - Ensures model robustness and prevents overfitting; Quick check - Test performance consistency across different data splits

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** EEG signals -> Chirp feature extraction -> t-SNE embedding -> Classification -> SHAP interpretation

**Critical path:** The core workflow follows: signal preprocessing → chirp feature extraction → t-SNE dimensionality reduction → classification → SHAP analysis. Each step builds upon the previous one, with the t-SNE embedding serving as the critical bridge between raw features and interpretable classification.

**Design tradeoffs:** The choice of t-SNE over other dimensionality reduction techniques prioritizes visualization quality and cluster preservation over computational efficiency. Chirp features were selected for their ability to capture temporal patterns in EEG signals, though this limits the approach to frequency-modulated signal characteristics.

**Failure signatures:** Poor clustering in t-SNE visualizations may indicate inadequate feature extraction or inappropriate parameter selection. Low classification accuracy could result from class imbalance, insufficient training data, or inappropriate classifier choice for the embedding space.

**First experiments:**
1. Verify that similar patient cases cluster together in the t-SNE embedding space before classification
2. Test classification performance on a held-out validation set to assess generalization
3. Compare SHAP feature importance scores against clinical expectations for epilepsy outcomes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to larger, more diverse patient cohorts remains uncertain
- Focus on specific chirp feature extraction limits assessment of alternative feature representations
- Performance metrics primarily evaluated on balanced datasets, which may not reflect real-world clinical data distributions

## Confidence

**High confidence:** t-SNE visualization effectiveness for clustering similar cases

**Medium confidence:** Classification accuracy on the tested dataset (88.8% for optimal cases)

**Medium confidence:** SHAP-based feature importance interpretation

**Low confidence:** Generalizability to different patient populations and clinical settings

## Next Checks

1. Test classification performance on an independent, multi-center dataset with varying demographic characteristics
2. Compare chirp feature embeddings against raw signal and other feature extraction methods using identical t-SNE and classification pipeline
3. Evaluate classifier robustness under simulated class imbalance conditions representative of actual clinical data distributions
