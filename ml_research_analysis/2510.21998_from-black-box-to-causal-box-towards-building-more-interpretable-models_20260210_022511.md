# From Black-box to Causal-box: Towards Building More Interpretable Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21998
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21998
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: A framework for building causally interpretable models with a graphical criterion and a tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of building prediction models that can consistently answer counterfactual queries. The authors identify that common model classes like blackbox and concept-based models lack causal interpretability in general. They propose a novel framework that enables the construction of models that are causally interpretable by design. The key innovation is a graphical criterion that determines whether a given model architecture can support specific counterfactual queries. The work establishes a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive accuracy, characterizing the maximal set of features that yields an interpretable model with optimal predictive expressiveness. Experiments on both synthetic (BarMNIST) and real-world (CelebA) datasets validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating that causally interpretable models can consistently answer counterfactual questions while non-interpretable models produce inconsistent or incorrect counterfactual predictions.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces causal interpretability as a property that determines whether a prediction model can consistently answer counterfactual queries from observational data. The authors develop a framework that uses causal diagrams to specify which counterfactual queries a model can support. They establish a graphical criterion that determines whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. To address the tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy, they identify the unique maximal set of features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive expressiveness. The approach involves first determining the set of admissible features for causal interpretability using the graphical criterion, then training a model on this maximal set to achieve the best possible predictive performance while maintaining causal interpretability.

## Key Results
- Neither blackbox nor concept-based models are causally interpretable in general
- A complete graphical criterion determines whether a model architecture supports counterfactual queries
- There exists a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive accuracy
- Causally interpretable models can consistently answer counterfactual questions while non-interpretable models yield inconsistent predictions
- The framework identifies the unique maximal set of features for interpretable models with optimal predictive expressiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging causal diagrams to explicitly encode the causal structure of the data-generating process. By mapping model architectures to causal diagrams, the authors can determine which counterfactual queries are identifiable from observational data. The graphical criterion exploits the do-calculus rules to identify when counterfactual queries can be reduced to observable quantities. This causal approach ensures that the model's predictions remain consistent under interventions, addressing the fundamental limitation of standard prediction models that lack causal reasoning capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

Causal diagrams and do-calculus
- Why needed: To formally specify which counterfactual queries are identifiable from observational data
- Quick check: Can the query be expressed as a function of observed variables using do-calculus rules?

Causal interpretability
- Why needed: To ensure models can consistently answer counterfactual queries rather than just making predictions
- Quick check: Does the model's prediction remain valid under interventions on input features?

Graphical criterion for model support
- Why needed: To determine whether a specific model architecture can support given counterfactual queries
- Quick check: Can the causal diagram be transformed to express the query using only observed variables?

Maximal feature set
- Why needed: To identify the largest set of features that maintains causal interpretability while maximizing predictive power
- Quick check: Is the feature set the unique maximal set that satisfies the graphical criterion?

Counterfactual consistency
- Why needed: To ensure model predictions remain coherent when answering different counterfactual scenarios
- Quick check: Do predictions change consistently when inputs are modified according to the causal structure?

Predictive expressiveness
- Why needed: To quantify the predictive performance achievable within the constraints of causal interpretability
- Quick check: How does the model's accuracy compare to unconstrained blackbox models on the same task?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Causal diagram -> Graphical criterion -> Maximal feature set -> Interpretable model
Critical path: Feature selection via graphical criterion → Model training on admissible features → Counterfactual query evaluation
Design tradeoffs: Causal interpretability vs predictive accuracy; feature completeness vs model complexity
Failure signatures: Inconsistent counterfactual predictions; violation of graphical criterion; suboptimal feature selection
First experiments:
1. Test graphical criterion on simple causal structures (e.g., chain graphs) to verify correctness
2. Evaluate counterfactual consistency on BarMNIST dataset with known ground truth
3. Compare predictive accuracy of interpretable vs blackbox models on CelebA dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations

- The graphical criterion's practical applicability across diverse real-world datasets remains unclear
- The tradeoff characterization may not hold under different data distributions or model architectures beyond those tested
- Experiments are limited to synthetic (BarMNIST) and a single real-world (CelebA) dataset, raising generalizability concerns
- Implementation of maximal predictive expressiveness in complex, high-dimensional settings remains to be demonstrated

## Confidence

Theoretical framework for causal interpretability: High
Graphical criterion validity: Medium
Tradeoff characterization between interpretability and accuracy: Medium
Experimental validation across diverse datasets: Low

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on additional real-world datasets with varying causal structures to assess generalizability.
2. Implement the framework on high-dimensional data (e.g., medical imaging or genomics) to evaluate scalability and practical limitations.
3. Compare the predictive performance of causally interpretable models against state-of-the-art blackbox models in a broader range of tasks to quantify the tradeoff more precisely.
