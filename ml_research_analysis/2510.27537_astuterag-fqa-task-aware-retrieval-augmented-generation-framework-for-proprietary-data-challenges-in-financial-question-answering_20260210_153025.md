# AstuteRAG-FQA: Task-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Proprietary Data Challenges in Financial Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.27537
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27537
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 23% accuracy improvement and 18% gain in regulatory compliance compared to baseline RAG systems for financial question answering

## Executive Summary
AstuteRAG-FQA addresses the challenge of applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to financial question answering in the presence of proprietary data, regulatory constraints, and security requirements. The framework introduces a task-aware four-tier query classification system that enables tailored retrieval and reasoning strategies for different complexity levels. By integrating hybrid retrieval (BM25 + DPR), dynamic prompt engineering, and multi-layered security mechanisms, the system achieves 23% better accuracy and 18% higher regulatory compliance compared to baseline approaches. The framework is validated on financial QA datasets and demonstrates robustness in handling complex, sensitive financial queries while maintaining transparency and security.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a four-tier query classification (explicit factual, implicit factual, interpretable rationale, hidden rationale) using a BERT-base classifier (91.6% accuracy). Hybrid retrieval combines BM25 (via Elasticsearch) for lexical precision with DPR for semantic understanding. Dynamic prompt generation uses LangChain with Chain-of-Thought prompting and GPT-4. Multi-layered security includes differential privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls. Compliance monitoring operates through three tiers: pre-retrieval filtering, risk-aware scoring, and post-generation AI checks. The system is evaluated on FinQA and FiQA datasets with LoRA fine-tuning on BBRC regulatory corpus.

## Key Results
- 23% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline RAG systems
- 18% gain in regulatory compliance rate (RCR 92.4%)
- Retrieval Precision@5 of 87.2% and F1 score of 83.5%
- Four-tier classification accuracy of 91.6% with per-level performance ranging from 97.2% (Level 1) to 79.6% (Level 4)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Four-tier query stratification enables adaptive retrieval depth and generation strategy. A BERT-base classifier (91.6% accuracy) routes queries to one of four complexity levels, with Level 1-2 using structured retrieval and Level 3-4 triggering hybrid retrieval with causal reasoning modules. This matching of retrieval effort to reasoning demand reduces unnecessary retrieval and focuses resources where needed.

### Mechanism 2
Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense passage retrieval) improves precision for financial queries over single-strategy approaches. Sparse retrieval captures lexical precision while dense retrieval captures semantic similarity, with results fused to optimize both exact-term matching and contextual relevance.

### Mechanism 3
Three-tier compliance filtering increases regulatory adherence without fully sacrificing accuracy. Pre-retrieval restricts to GDPR-compliant sources, risk-aware scoring penalizes non-compliant documents, and post-generation uses regex rules and XAI APIs to flag violations, catching compliance breaches at different pipeline stages.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) basics
  - Why needed here: The entire framework builds on RAG's premise that grounding LLM outputs in retrieved documents reduces hallucinations and improves factual accuracy.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why RAG reduces hallucinations compared to closed-book LLM generation?

- Concept: Sparse vs. dense retrieval
  - Why needed here: AstuteRAG-FQA uses both BM25 (sparse, lexical) and DPR (dense, semantic). Understanding when each excels is essential for debugging retrieval quality.
  - Quick check question: For a query containing a specific ticker symbol "AAPL," which retrieval method would likely have higher precision, and why?

- Concept: Financial regulatory frameworks (Basel III, GDPR)
  - Why needed here: The system's compliance logic references specific regulations. Without this context, you cannot evaluate whether compliance checks are correctly implemented.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary purpose of Basel III Pillar 2, and how might it affect what documents a compliance filter should allow?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Query Classifier (BERT-base) → Hybrid Retriever (BM25 + DPR) → Security/Privacy Layer (OAuth 2.0, TLS 1.3, k-anonymity) → Dynamic Prompt Generator (LangChain + GPT-4 + CoT) → LLM (GPT-4/T5-Large with LoRA) → Compliance Validator (regex + XAI APIs) → Response Output

- Critical path: Query classification accuracy determines all downstream decisions (retrieval depth, security level, prompt template). Misclassification at this stage cascades.

- Design tradeoffs: Higher retrieval depth improves Level 3-4 accuracy but increases latency (>900ms target threshold). Stricter compliance filtering raises RCR but may exclude relevant proprietary data. Fine-tuning on regulatory corpora improves compliance but risks overfitting to specific jurisdictions.

- Failure signatures: Level 1 query routed to Level 4 retrieval path → excessive latency and unnecessary complexity. Compliance filter blocks all proprietary data → accuracy drops sharply on firm-specific queries. Classifier confidence below threshold → system falls back to generic retrieval, reducing precision.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Classifier validation: Test BERT-base classifier on held-out financial queries. Target >90% accuracy. Measure per-level precision/recall.
  2. Retrieval ablation: Run queries with BM25-only, DPR-only, and hybrid retrieval. Compare RP@5 across all four query levels.
  3. Compliance stress test: Inject known non-compliant content into retrieval corpus. Measure whether three-tier filtering catches violations at each stage. Target RCR >90%.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can AstuteRAG-FQA maintain its 23% accuracy improvement when extended to multimodal financial inputs (charts, visualizations, and real-time data streams)? The current system processes only textual and tabular data, while visual elements in financial reports require fundamentally different embedding and reasoning mechanisms that have not been designed or tested.

### Open Question 2
How can the compliance monitoring subsystem adapt dynamically to rapidly evolving regulatory frameworks across multiple jurisdictions without manual rule updates? The current system uses regex-based rules and post-generation checks tied to static regulatory corpora, creating lag and compliance risk when regulations change.

### Open Question 3
What is the quantifiable privacy-utility tradeoff when applying differential privacy mechanisms to proprietary financial data in the AstuteRAG-FQA retrieval pipeline? The paper mentions differential privacy but provides no quantitative analysis of privacy guarantees (ε, δ values) or their impact on retrieval accuracy, particularly for Level 4 queries that synthesize sensitive client data.

## Limitations

- Framework's reliance on proprietary data access introduces significant scalability constraints and complex data-sharing agreements
- Four-tier classification system may struggle with ambiguous queries that don't fit cleanly into predefined categories
- Compliance monitoring mechanisms depend heavily on rule-based heuristics that may not capture nuanced regulatory interpretations or evolving standards

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The hybrid retrieval approach (BM25 + DPR) is well-established and the 23% accuracy improvement is plausible given complementary retrieval methods
- **Medium confidence**: The four-tier query classification system shows reasonable internal validation (91.6% accuracy) but lacks extensive external validation on diverse financial query types
- **Low confidence**: The claimed 18% gain in regulatory compliance is difficult to independently verify given the complexity of financial regulations and lack of standardized compliance measurement frameworks

## Next Checks

1. **Classifier robustness test**: Evaluate the BERT-base classifier on a held-out test set containing ambiguous queries that could plausibly fit multiple tiers. Measure classification uncertainty and fallback behavior when confidence scores fall below threshold.

2. **Compliance validation audit**: Conduct a blind review where independent financial compliance experts evaluate whether the system's output meets regulatory standards for 100 randomly selected queries across different jurisdictions and regulatory frameworks.

3. **Proprietary data impact analysis**: Systematically measure accuracy degradation when proprietary data sources are removed or restricted. Quantify the trade-off between compliance restrictions and retrieval performance to identify optimal filtering thresholds.
