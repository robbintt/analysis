# Re-examining Granger Causality from Causal Bayesian Networks Perspective

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Novel framework transforms Granger causality from predictive to causal interpretation using CBNs and RCCP

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental criticism of Granger causality - that it lacks true causal interpretation and remains merely a predictive tool. The author proposes a novel framework that re-examines GC through the lens of causal Bayesian networks (CBNs) and Reichenbach's Common Cause Principles (RCCP). By combining bivariate and multivariate Granger causality approaches with logical-AND operations, the method successfully filters out spurious associations while identifying true causal links. The framework demonstrates how chains, forks, and colliders in time series data can be detected using RCCP, effectively transforming GC into a causal inference tool rather than just a predictive one.

## Method Summary
The core methodology combines both bivariate (BVGC) and multivariate (MVGC) Granger causality approaches using a logical-AND operation to identify genuine causal relationships. This hybrid approach leverages Reichenbach's Common Cause Principles to distinguish between direct causal effects, spurious associations due to common causes, and collider structures. The framework analyzes time series data through the causal Bayesian networks perspective, allowing for proper causal interpretation of Granger causality results. The method explicitly addresses the issue of spurious associations that plague traditional GC approaches by requiring consensus between BVGC and MVGC results before declaring a causal link. This filtering mechanism helps eliminate false positives that arise from indirect effects or common causes.

## Key Results
- Framework successfully transforms Granger causality from predictive to causal interpretation
- Method correctly inferred most causal links on simulated data with known ground truth connectivity matrices
- Logical-AND operation effectively filtered out spurious associations while maintaining true causal detections
- Approach achieved satisfactory performance in identifying chains, forks, and colliders as predicted by RCCP

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by establishing a theoretical bridge between Granger causality and causal Bayesian networks through Reichenbach's Common Cause Principles. When two variables are statistically dependent, RCCP states that either one causes the other, they share a common cause, or they are both effects of a common cause (collider). By applying both BVGC and MVGC approaches and requiring agreement between them, the method effectively tests these different causal structures. The logical-AND operation ensures that only relationships consistent with both approaches - and therefore more likely to represent true causal links - are accepted. This dual-perspective approach captures the essence of RCCP while leveraging the predictive power of GC, resulting in causal inference rather than mere prediction.

## Foundational Learning

Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs): Directed acyclic graphs representing causal relationships between variables
- Why needed: Provides the formal causal framework to interpret GC results causally
- Quick check: Can represent chains, forks, and colliders properly

Reichenbach's Common Cause Principle (RCCP): Statistical dependence implies causal connection (direct causation, common cause, or collider)
- Why needed: Theoretical foundation for distinguishing true causal links from spurious associations
- Quick check: Must correctly identify all three dependency structures

Bivariate vs Multivariate Granger Causality: Two approaches to measuring predictive causality
- Why needed: Different sensitivities to direct vs indirect effects
- Quick check: BVGC captures direct effects, MVGC controls for confounders

Causal Sufficiency: Assumption that all relevant variables are measured
- Why needed: Framework assumes no hidden confounders
- Quick check: Method may fail when latent variables exist

Spurious Association: Apparent relationship due to indirect effects or common causes
- Why needed: Major limitation of traditional GC approaches
- Quick check: Must be filtered out to achieve causal interpretation

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Time Series Data -> BVGC Analysis -> MVGC Analysis -> Logical-AND Filter -> Causal Graph

Critical Path: The logical-AND operation between BVGC and MVGC results is the critical path, as it determines whether a causal link is accepted or rejected. This filtering step must be robust to noise and maintain high sensitivity to true causal effects while achieving high specificity against spurious associations.

Design Tradeoffs: The method trades computational complexity (running both BVGC and MVGC) for improved causal accuracy. The logical-AND approach may reduce sensitivity to weak causal effects but increases specificity against false positives. The framework assumes causal sufficiency, which limits applicability but simplifies the causal structure inference.

Failure Signatures: False negatives may occur when weak causal effects fail to pass both BVGC and MVGC thresholds. False positives may arise from systematic biases in either approach that align coincidentally. Performance degradation is expected when latent confounders are present or when the causal structure violates the assumptions of either BVGC or MVGC.

First Experiments:
1. Test the logical-AND filtering on synthetic data with known spurious associations to verify false positive reduction
2. Evaluate sensitivity to threshold selection in both BVGC and MVGC components
3. Assess performance on cyclic dependency structures that violate DAG assumptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method assumes causal sufficiency, limiting applicability when hidden confounders exist
- Performance on real-world data with complex noise patterns remains unverified
- Logical-AND operation may reduce sensitivity to weak but genuine causal effects

## Confidence

High confidence: The theoretical framework connecting GC to CBNs through RCCP is sound and well-established

Medium confidence: The logical-AND approach for combining BVGC and MVGC shows promise based on simulated results

Medium confidence: The method's ability to detect chains, forks, and colliders through RCCP is theoretically valid but empirically unverified

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on real-world multivariate time series datasets with known causal structures to validate performance beyond simulations

2. Evaluate robustness under varying levels of noise and different network topologies, particularly those with feedback loops and cyclic dependencies

3. Assess performance when latent confounders are present to quantify the impact of the causal sufficiency assumption
