# The dynamics of meaning through time: Assessment of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.05552
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05552
- **Reference count:** 6
- **Key outcome:** GPT-4 and Claude Instant 100k achieved near-maximum scores on semantic shift tasks, while smaller Llama variants and Google Bard underperformed, highlighting that model architecture and training data quality outweigh parameter count for temporal semantic understanding.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates large language models' ability to interpret semantic shifts over time using historical terms. Models were tested on their capacity to describe how meanings and synonyms for terms like "Data Mining" and "Michael Jackson" evolved across decades from the 1920s to 2020s. GPT-4 and Claude Instant 100k demonstrated superior performance in factuality and comprehensiveness, while smaller Llama variants and Google Bard underperformed, especially on terms requiring deep historical context. The study found that model architecture and training data quality are more critical than parameter size for temporal semantic understanding, with the code-based Llama 34B model outperforming larger Llama models, suggesting structured dataset retraining enhances analytical reasoning.

## Method Summary
The study employed zero-shot evaluation of existing LLMs without fine-tuning, using two test terms: "Data Mining" (technical) and "Michael Jackson" (cultural figure). Models were prompted to create decade-by-decade tables describing meanings and synonyms based on historical context. Human expert panels evaluated responses on factuality (accuracy of semantic evolution capture) and comprehensiveness (description length plus synonym coverage), with a maximum score of 22. The evaluation relied on human experts to assess responses against historical truth, though the exact rubric and number of evaluators were not specified.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 and Claude Instant 100k achieved near-maximum scores, demonstrating strong performance in factuality and comprehensiveness.
- Smaller Llama variants (7B, 13B) and Google Bard underperformed, particularly on terms requiring deep historical context.
- CodeLlama 34B outperformed larger Llama models, suggesting structured dataset retraining enhances analytical reasoning for temporal semantic understanding.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured data pretraining (e.g., code) may enhance temporal semantic reasoning capabilities in LLMs.
- Mechanism: Code datasets, with their inherent logic and syntax, may instill structured analytical thought processes. This could potentially transfer to handling unstructured historical semantic shifts by enabling more systematic pattern recognition.
- Core assumption: The cognitive skills gained from processing code are transferable to non-code reasoning tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Notably, the code-based Llama 34B model outperformed larger Llama models, suggesting that structured dataset retraining enhances analytical reasoning."
  - [section 4] "The distinct performance of this model may be attributable to its extensive retraining on code datasets... Such exposure potentially enhances a model’s analytical capabilities."
  - [corpus] The corpus signal "On the Potential of Large Language Models to Solve Semantics-Aware Process Mining Tasks" notes LLMs' ability to reason about processes. This offers weak, indirect support for reasoning transfer, but provides no direct evidence on code pretraining's impact on temporal semantics.
- Break condition: If subsequent studies fail to replicate CodeLlama's superior performance on diverse historical semantic tasks, or if probing studies show no difference in internal representations related to structured reasoning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model performance on temporal semantic understanding appears dependent on training data diversity and model architecture, not solely on parameter count.
- Mechanism: LLMs primarily trained on recent internet text may lack exposure to historical language evolution. Models with more diverse, higher-quality, or specialized training data, combined with optimized architectures, can better capture and retrieve this underrepresented knowledge.
- Core assumption: Access to and ability to process historical or more diverse text data is a primary bottleneck, not just parameter count.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results indicate that model architecture and training data quality outweigh size in temporal semantic understanding."
  - [section 1] "This temporal gap poses a particular challenge for LLMs... Consequently, the historical evolution of words... may be underrepresented in modern training data."
  - [corpus] "How LLMs Comprehend Temporal Meaning in Narratives" investigates this comprehension, suggesting temporal meaning is a distinct capability to evaluate, but doesn't confirm the data quality mechanism directly.
- Break condition: If future, much larger models trained on similar contemporary datasets spontaneously develop strong temporal semantic understanding, the data-quality-over-scale hypothesis would be weakened.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The temporal context in a prompt can elicit historically appropriate semantic interpretations from capable LLMs without specialized fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: The prompt "create a table with decades... describing meaning... based on knowledge of that period" uses temporal anchoring. In high-performing models, this triggers retrieval of time-specific associations and semantic relationships encoded in their training data.
- Core assumption: The models have already encoded sufficient temporal-contextual information from their pretraining to answer such queries when prompted correctly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "Prompts were specifically crafted to challenge each model’s ability to capture and relay temporal semantic shifts without additional training or fine-tuning."
  - [section 4] GPT-4 and Claude's "consistent performance across terms suggests... [they are] more attuned to changes in meaning across different temporal contexts."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is silent on prompt engineering effectiveness for temporal semantics; no direct support or contradiction found.
- Break condition: If models are found to be simply hallucinating plausible-sounding but factually incorrect histories for most terms (despite scoring well on a few), rather than truly retrieving temporally-conditioned semantics.

## Foundational Learning
- Concept: **Diachronic Semantic Change**
  - Why needed here: This is the core phenomenon the paper evaluates. Understanding that word meanings evolve over time (e.g., pejoration, amelioration, broadening) is essential to grasp the models' task.
  - Quick check question: What does "amelioration" mean in the context of semantic change?
- Concept: **Word Embeddings (specifically Diachronic)**
  - Why needed here: The paper references this as the traditional computational method for tracking semantic change. Grasping that words are represented as vectors in space, and that these vectors can be compared across time slices, is foundational for understanding the problem space.
  - Quick check question: How might a diachronic word embedding for the word "gay" differ between a 1900s corpus and a 2020s corpus?
- Concept: **In-Context Learning / Zero-Shot Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The methodology relies on prompting models without task-specific fine-tuning. An engineer needs to understand that this tests the model's pre-existing, generalized capabilities elicited solely through the prompt.
  - Quick check question: Why did the researchers explicitly avoid fine-tuning the models for this task?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: LLM Pretrained Weights -> Tokenizer/Prompting Interface -> Human Expert Panel
- Critical path:
  1. **Prompt Engineering:** Designing a structured, temporal-anchoring prompt (e.g., "by decade").
  2. **Model Inference:** Passing the prompt to the LLM, which performs autoregressive generation based on its pretrained weights.
  3. **Response Parsing:** Structuring the model's output (e.g., the table) for evaluation.
  4. **Expert Scoring:** Human experts assess responses against historical truth for factuality and comprehensiveness.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Generality vs. Specialization:** Using general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) vs. developing specialized models (e.g., MacBERTh) for historical text. The study tests the former but discusses the potential of the latter.
  - **Evaluation Method:** Relying on human expert evaluation (subjective, expensive, high-quality) vs. automated metrics like perplexity (objective, cheap, but not a direct measure of semantic factuality).
- Failure signatures:
  - **Hallucination:** Model confidently describes a meaning for a term in a decade that has no historical basis.
  - **Presentism:** Model describes the *current* meaning of the term for all historical periods.
  - **Omission:** Model leaves decades blank or provides very short, non-comprehensive answers.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Prompt Variation Study:** Systematically vary the prompt (e.g., change "by decade" to "by half-century," or change the output format from a table to a narrative) to test prompt sensitivity on the top-performing models.
  2. **Term Expansion & Domain Analysis:** Significantly expand the term list (e.g., 50+ terms) across diverse domains to see if the performance of models like CodeLlama 34B generalizes beyond the initial test cases.
  3. **Retraining/Fine-tuning Intervention:** Take a lower-performing open model (e.g., Llama 7B/13B) and fine-tune it on a curated historical corpus, then re-evaluate to test if specialized training improves temporal understanding.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** Does the performance of LLMs in tracking semantic shifts generalize when evaluating a significantly larger corpus of terms across more diverse time periods?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Discussion that future research should "expand the scope of this study by incorporating a larger set of terms and additional time periods to assess models’ abilities to generalize across domains."
  - Why unresolved: The current study was limited to only two distinct terms ("Data Mining" and "Michael Jackson"), which is insufficient to fully establish a robust benchmark for the field.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A replication of the study using a lexicon of hundreds of terms spanning different grammatical categories and historical eras.

- **Open Question 2:** To what extent does code-based pre-training specifically enhance a model's ability to reason about unstructured historical semantic shifts?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion highlights the unexpected success of CodeLlama 34B and explicitly calls for "investigating how structured reasoning abilities gained from code datasets translate to understanding unstructured historical data."
  - Why unresolved: While the study observed that CodeLlama outperformed larger general Llama models, the specific causal mechanism linking structured coding syntax to improved temporal semantic analysis remains hypothesized but unproven.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing models with identical architectures trained on varying proportions of code versus natural language historical texts to isolate the variable.

- **Open Question 3:** Can resource-efficient, smaller models achieve high performance in temporal semantic understanding through domain-specific fine-tuning alone?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion notes that smaller models like Llama 7B failed but suggests that "future research could explore fine-tuning smaller models for specific historical linguistic tasks, thereby balancing resource efficiency with improved performance."
  - Why unresolved: The current results show smaller models struggle significantly, but it is unclear if this is a fundamental limitation of parameter count or simply a result of insufficient task-specific training data.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or similar fine-tuning techniques to small models using historical corpora to measure performance gains.

## Limitations
- The evaluation methodology relies on human expert scoring without detailed rubric specifications, introducing potential subjectivity and hindering reproducibility.
- The study is limited to only two test terms, constraining generalizability across diverse semantic domains.
- The paper mentions perplexity as an objective metric but does not operationalize or report it, leaving a gap in quantitative validation.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The finding that GPT-4 and Claude Instant 100k demonstrated superior performance in factuality and comprehensiveness is well-supported by the evaluation results. The observation that model architecture and training data quality outweigh parameter count for temporal semantic understanding is also strongly supported by the comparative performance data.
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that CodeLlama 34B outperformed larger Llama models due to structured code dataset retraining is plausible but requires further validation. The prompt engineering approach of temporal anchoring is effective but may be sensitive to prompt variations not explored in the study.
- **Low confidence:** The mechanism suggesting that cognitive skills from code processing transfer to temporal semantic reasoning is speculative and lacks direct evidence. The generalization of findings from only two terms to broader semantic domains is uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt Variation Study:** Systematically vary the prompt structure (e.g., change temporal granularity from decades to centuries, alter output format from tables to narratives) for the top-performing models to assess sensitivity and robustness of the temporal anchoring approach.
2. **Term Expansion & Domain Analysis:** Expand the evaluation to include 50+ terms across diverse domains (technical, cultural, social, etc.) to test whether the observed performance patterns of models like CodeLlama 34B generalize beyond the initial test cases.
3. **Controlled Retraining Intervention:** Select a lower-performing open model (e.g., Llama 7B/13B), fine-tune it on a curated historical corpus, and re-evaluate its performance on the semantic shift task to directly test whether specialized training improves temporal understanding capabilities.
