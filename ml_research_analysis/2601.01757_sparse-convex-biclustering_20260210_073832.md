# Sparse Convex Biclustering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01757
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01757
- Authors: Jiakun Jiang; Dewei Xiang; Chenliang Gu; Wei Liu; Binhuan Wang
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: SpaCoBi achieves higher ARI than baselines (0.91-0.96 vs 0.77-0.79) in high-dimensional biclustering simulations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Sparse Convex Biclustering (SpaCoBi), a novel method for biclustering high-dimensional data that simultaneously clusters rows and columns while performing feature selection through a convex optimization framework. Traditional biclustering approaches struggle with noise accumulation and computational complexity in large-scale datasets. SpaCoBi addresses these challenges by incorporating sparsity via L2-norm penalties and using an efficient ADMM algorithm with Sylvester equation solvers. The method demonstrates superior performance in both simulated and real-world gene expression data, achieving perfect clustering recovery on mouse olfactory bulb data while identifying biologically meaningful features.

## Method Summary
SpaCoBi uses a convex optimization framework to simultaneously cluster observations and features of a data matrix while selecting informative features. The method employs an ADMM algorithm where the key computational challenge is solving a Sylvester equation MA+AN=H at each iteration. The optimization incorporates L2-norm penalties for sparsity, with weights computed via k-NN Gaussian kernels. The algorithm uses adaptive penalty parameters and warm-starting across a grid search over regularization parameters. For validation, the method performs stability selection to choose optimal tuning parameters, evaluating performance using Adjusted Rand Index for clustering and AUC for feature selection.

## Key Results
- In simulations with 400 features, SpaCoBi achieved ARIs of 0.91-0.96 compared to 0.77-0.79 for Bi-ADMM
- SpaCoBi demonstrated near-perfect feature selection with AUC values approaching 0.8 across all tested dimensions
- On mouse olfactory bulb gene expression data, SpaCoBi achieved ARI=1.0 (perfect recovery) versus 0.12 for Bi-ADMM, identifying 23 key informative genes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The convex formulation with L2-norm penalties enables global optimization while encouraging similar rows/columns to have similar feature representations. The ADMM algorithm efficiently handles the non-smooth penalty terms through decomposition, and the Sylvester equation solver provides stable numerical solutions at each iteration. The k-NN Gaussian kernel weights adapt to local data geometry, creating meaningful similarity measures that guide the clustering process while preserving sparsity for feature selection.

## Foundational Learning
- **ADMM optimization**: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers decomposes complex convex problems into simpler subproblems - needed for efficient SpaCoBi optimization
- **Sylvester equation solvers**: Matrix equations of form MA+AN=H arise in many applications - Bartels-Stewart algorithm provides stable numerical solution
- **Convex clustering penalties**: L2-norm penalties encourage row/column similarities while preserving convexity - enables global optimization guarantees
- **k-NN Gaussian kernels**: Local similarity measures adapt to data geometry - creates meaningful weights for clustering regularization
- **Stability selection**: Repeated subsampling validates feature importance across random data splits - reduces false positives in high-dimensional settings

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data matrix → Weight computation (k-NN kernel) → ADMM loop (Sylvester solve → Proximal updates → Dual updates) → Convergence check → Parameter tuning via grid search

**Critical path**: A-update (Sylvester equation) → V,Z,G updates (proximal operators) → Dual variable updates → Convergence check

**Design tradeoffs**: Convex formulation guarantees global optimum but requires careful parameter tuning; ADMM decomposition enables efficient computation but needs proper penalty parameter scaling; sparsity penalties enable feature selection but may over-shrink important signals

**Failure signatures**: Non-convergence indicates poor ADMM penalty parameter scaling; poor clustering suggests inadequate weight computation or regularization strength; numerical instability in Sylvester solver indicates ill-conditioned M or N matrices

**First experiments**: 1) Verify Sylvester solver on small synthetic matrices with known solutions; 2) Test ADMM convergence on simple clustering problems; 3) Validate weight computation on synthetic data with ground truth similarities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the three-parameter formulation differ functionally from the two-parameter version, and what are the implications for model interpretability?
- What is the optimal range for ADMM penalty parameters, and how does this affect convergence behavior across different data regimes?
- Can the method be extended to handle missing data or non-Euclidean similarity measures while maintaining computational efficiency?

## Limitations
- Three-parameter formulation distinction from two-parameter version is unclear, limiting reproducibility
- ADMM penalty parameters are unspecified, critical for convergence but absent from reported results
- Single real-data application, though compelling, lacks broader biological validation across diverse datasets

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Convex optimization framework and ADMM algorithm are mathematically sound; simulation results show consistent superiority over baselines
- **Medium confidence**: Real-data application results are compelling but based on a single dataset with known ground truth
- **Low confidence**: Parameter tuning strategy lacks detailed justification; relationship between two-parameter and three-parameter formulations is unclear

## Next Checks
1. Implement the three-parameter SpaCoBi formulation with systematic grid search over γ₁, γ₂, γ₃ ranges, ensuring γ₃ path covers sparse regimes
2. Validate convergence behavior across multiple synthetic datasets with varying cluster separation and noise levels, monitoring primal/dual residuals
3. Apply SpaCoBi to additional real datasets with known cluster structure (e.g., cancer genomics, microbiome data) and compare feature selection results with domain experts
