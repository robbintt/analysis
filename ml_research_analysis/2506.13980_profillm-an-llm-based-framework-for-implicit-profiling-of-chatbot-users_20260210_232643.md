## Executive Summary
ProfiLLM is a novel framework for implicit, dynamic user profiling in chatbot interactions, specifically targeting technical domains like IT and cybersecurity. The system infers user proficiency through a structured taxonomy and an LLM-based scoring mechanism, updating profiles based on user prompts without requiring explicit questionnaires. Evaluated on 1,315 conversations from 263 synthetic users, ProfiLLM significantly reduces the gap between actual and predicted ITSec proficiency scores, achieving 55-65% improvement after just one prompt, with further refinement over subsequent interactions. The method outperforms various LLM configurations and ablation studies, demonstrating robustness across different user archetypes and prompt lengths.

## Method Summary
ProfiLLM employs a hierarchical taxonomy of 23 IT/cybersecurity subdomains to ground unstructured user prompts. For each interaction, an LLM classifies the prompt into relevant subdomains and scores the user's proficiency (1-5 scale) in each area. The user's overall profile is updated using a weighted average formula with inverse time-decay weighting, where the confidence weight on new information decreases as interaction count increases. The framework uses GPT-4o with separate subdomain scoring and a context window size of 1, achieving rapid profile convergence while maintaining stability over time.

## Key Results
- Reduces MAE between actual and predicted ITSec proficiency scores by 55-65% after first prompt
- Performance improves further with subsequent interactions, reaching optimal convergence by 3-4 prompts
- Outperforms baseline configurations including concurrent subdomain scoring and fixed confidence weights
- Demonstrates robustness across different user archetypes (novice, intermediate, advanced) and prompt lengths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Taxonomy-Grounding for Profile Granularity
Mapping unstructured user prompts to a structured, hierarchical taxonomy prevents ambiguous profiling and enables domain-specific adaptation. The system anchors free-form text to a fixed inventory of 23 ITSec subdomains, isolating expertise to relevant areas rather than applying a global "tech-savviness" score.

### Mechanism 2: Context-Weighted Proficiency Scoring
An LLM infers user proficiency (1-5 scale) by evaluating linguistic cues—specifically concept complexity and terminology—within a constrained context window. The system passes the current prompt and a sliding window of previous turns to an LLM that acts as a classifier, looking for jargon density and conceptual depth.

### Mechanism 3: Inverse Time-Decay Aggregation
Dynamically adjusting the weight of new evidence based on interaction count stabilizes profiles over time while allowing rapid initial adaptation. The profile update relies on a weighted average where the weight assigned to the new prompt's score decays as the interaction count increases.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Exponential/Time-Decay Weighting**
  - Why needed here: The core logic of ProfiLLM is not just "scoring" but "merging new scores with history." Understanding how alpha (learning rate) dictates the influence of recent vs. historical data is critical for tuning the beta parameter.
  - Quick check question: If a user acts like a novice for 5 turns and then uses expert jargon on the 6th, should the profile update faster with a high alpha or a low alpha?

- **Concept: Slot-Filling / Schema Matching**
  - Why needed here: The architecture relies on mapping unstructured text to specific "slots" in the taxonomy.
  - Quick check question: Does the prompt "My internet is slow" belong to Networking/General or Hardware/Peripherals?

- **Concept: LLM-as-a-Judge (Evaluation)**
  - Why needed here: The system uses an LLM to generate scores, but also used LLMs (Claude) to validate synthetic data quality.
  - Quick check question: What are the risks of using the same class of model (e.g., GPT-4) to both generate the synthetic user behavior and evaluate the profiling accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Interface -> Taxonomy Router -> Scoring Engine -> Aggregator -> Storage
- **Critical path:** The System Prompt used in the Scoring Engine. The paper implies carefully crafted prompts are needed to distinguish between "simple problem" and "simple user."
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Context Window Size (|W|): The paper found |W|=1 (just the previous turn) was optimal. Larger windows increased latency and token cost without improving accuracy.
  - Concurrent vs. Separate Scoring: Ablation study proved scoring subdomains separately is vital; concurrent scoring "performed the worst."
- **Failure signatures:**
  - The "Yo-Yo" Profile: MAE fluctuates wildly. Diagnosis: Decay rate beta is too low (learning rate alpha remains too high for too long).
  - The "Stuck" Profile: MAE remains flat despite new information. Diagnosis: Decay rate beta is too aggressive, or alpha is effectively zero.
  - The "Intermediate" Trap: Intermediate users are harder to classify than Novice/Advanced. This is a signal-to-noise issue inherent in the middle of the distribution.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Calibration: Run ProfiLLM on the synthetic dataset with alpha fixed to 1.0. Confirm the high variance/instability shown in the ablation study to understand the need for decay.
  2. Context Sensitivity Test: Manually submit a conversation where the user starts with high-jargon (Expert) but then switches to simple questions (Novice). Verify if the decay function prevents the profile from dropping too fast to "Novice" just because the problem became simpler.
  3. Taxonomy Stress Test: Feed prompts that span multiple subdomains (e.g., "My cloud storage is syncing slowly over WiFi"). Verify if the "Separate Scoring" mechanism handles the intersection of Networking and Software better than a global score.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does integrating profile-aware response adaptation into the chatbot influence subsequent user behavior or profiling accuracy?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "A key question is whether adapting chatbot responses based on inferred profiles influences user behavior and profiling accuracy."
  - Why unresolved: The study focused exclusively on optimizing the profile inference mechanism while keeping the chatbot's response generation static.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An A/B study comparing user interactions and error rates (MAE) between a static chatbot and one that dynamically adapts its responses based on ProfiLLM's output.

- **Open Question 2:** Can the incorporation of explicit inputs, such as challenge questions or brief questionnaires, improve profiling accuracy compared to the fully implicit approach?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the "deliberate design of ProfiLLM as fully implicit" and suggest that "incorporating challenge questions or preliminary questionnaires may improve profiling accuracy."
  - Why unresolved: The current framework was designed to be non-disruptive, strictly avoiding direct questioning to maintain user engagement.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring the speed of profile convergence and accuracy between purely implicit profiling and hybrid implicit-explicit methods.

- **Open Question 3:** Do the rapid proficiency inference results generalize to larger human populations and other specialized domains beyond IT/cybersecurity?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "Extending ProfiLLM to new domains and testing it with larger human user groups" as a key research direction.
  - Why unresolved: The primary evaluation relied on synthetic users derived from a small sample (63 humans), with a validation test of only five human users.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Empirical trials involving hundreds of real human users across distinct domains (e.g., legal, medical) to verify MAE reduction trends.

## Limitations

- **Synthetic Data Dependency:** The evaluation relies entirely on synthetically generated conversations from human-annotated personas, introducing uncertainty about real-world performance.
- **Single Domain Generalization:** ProfiLLM is explicitly evaluated and optimized for IT/Cybersecurity domains, with effectiveness for other domains remaining untested.
- **LLM-Specific Optimization:** Reported performance gains are based on specific LLM (GPT-4o) and configuration choices, with performance potentially degrading with different models.

## Confidence

- **Significant Improvement in MAE (55-65% after 1 prompt):** High confidence
- **Effectiveness of Inverse Time-Decay Aggregation:** High confidence
- **Taxonomy-Grounding Improves Precision:** Medium confidence
- **Context-Weighted Scoring via LLM:** High confidence

## Next Checks

1. **Real-World User Study:** Deploy ProfiLLM in a controlled environment with actual IT helpdesk users to measure MAE and profile convergence against the synthetic benchmark.

2. **Cross-Domain Transfer Test:** Adapt the taxonomy and scoring prompts for a different domain (e.g., healthcare or finance) and evaluate if the core ProfiLLM architecture maintains its performance improvements.

3. **Ablation of Synthetic Data Generation:** Systematically vary the parameters and prompts used to generate synthetic user conversations and measure the impact on ProfiLLM's reported accuracy to assess the robustness of the evaluation.
