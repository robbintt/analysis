core_contribution: This paper establishes quantitative bounds on the sampling error
  of score-based generative models (SGMs) by analyzing the stability and forgetting
  properties of the reverse-time Markov chain. The authors prove that under weak assumptions
  on the data distribution (dissipativity and polynomial growth of the score function),
  the backward dynamics satisfy a Lyapunov drift condition and a localized minorization
  condition, leading to exponential forgetting of the initial condition in a weighted

# On Forgetting and Stability of Score-based Generative models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.21868
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21868
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Establishes quantitative bounds on SGM sampling error via reverse-time Markov chain stability analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the stability and forgetting properties of score-based generative models (SGMs). The authors analyze the reverse-time dynamics of SGMs through the lens of continuous-time Markov processes, proving that these models exhibit exponential forgetting of initial conditions under reasonable assumptions on the data distribution. The theoretical framework decomposes the total sampling error into three components - initialization, discretization, and score approximation errors - all of which are geometrically discounted along the sampling trajectory. This work bridges the gap between empirical observations of SGM robustness and theoretical guarantees, providing principled explanations for why SGMs perform well in practice.

## Method Summary
The authors establish quantitative bounds on SGM sampling error by analyzing the stability and forgetting properties of the reverse-time Markov chain associated with the continuous-time backward SDE dynamics. Under weak assumptions on the data distribution (dissipativity and polynomial growth of the score function), they prove that the backward dynamics satisfy a Lyapunov drift condition and a localized minorization condition. These conditions together ensure exponential forgetting of the initial condition in a weighted total variation metric. The analysis separates the theoretical continuous-time dynamics from practical considerations like discretization and neural network approximation errors, providing a clean framework for understanding SGM behavior.

## Key Results
- Under dissipative drift conditions and polynomial score growth, SGMs exhibit exponential forgetting of initial conditions in weighted total variation
- The total SGM output error decomposes into initialization, discretization, and score approximation errors, all geometrically discounted along the trajectory
- Numerical experiments on Gaussian and mixture targets confirm that early errors in the reverse trajectory have diminishing influence on final generated distributions
- The forgetting property provides a principled explanation for the empirical robustness of SGMs observed in practice

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The theoretical foundation rests on establishing that the reverse-time Markov chain associated with SGMs satisfies classical stability conditions from continuous-time process theory. The key mechanism is that the backward dynamics possess a Lyapunov function that decreases on average (drift condition) while the process also satisfies a minorization condition that ensures sufficient mixing. Together, these create a contraction-like behavior in the weighted total variation metric, causing the process to forget its initial condition exponentially fast. This forgetting property explains why SGMs are robust to initialization and why errors made early in the sampling trajectory become progressively less important.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dissipative drift condition**: Ensures the process doesn't explore the entire state space indefinitely, creating a "funnel" toward a compact region - needed to prevent theoretical explosion and enable practical bounds
- **Polynomial score growth**: Bounds the rate at which the score function can increase, preventing unbounded gradients that would destabilize the dynamics - needed to maintain control over the reverse process
- **Weighted total variation metric**: A distance measure that accounts for the geometry of the state space through a weight function - needed to capture the appropriate notion of convergence for these processes
- **Localized minorization condition**: Ensures the process has sufficient probability of reaching any point in a compact set from any starting point - needed to guarantee mixing and prevent getting stuck in subsets
- **Lyapunov drift condition**: Provides a bound on how quickly the process can escape from a compact set - needed to establish geometric ergodicity
- **Reverse-time SDE dynamics**: The mathematical framework describing how the generative process flows backward from noise to data - needed as the foundation for all subsequent analysis

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Distribution -> Score Function -> Backward SDE -> Markov Chain -> Generated Sample
**Critical Path**: The core theoretical analysis flows from assumptions on the data distribution (dissipativity, score growth) → verification of Lyapunov drift and minorization conditions → establishment of forgetting bounds → error decomposition
**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes theoretical tractability by assuming idealized continuous dynamics, which may not perfectly capture practical neural network implementations with discrete steps and finite capacity
**Failure Signatures**: If the data distribution violates the dissipative condition or score function grows too rapidly, the forgetting bounds break down and initialization errors may persist indefinitely
**First Experiments**: 1) Verify dissipative condition empirically on real datasets by estimating score function norms 2) Test polynomial growth bounds across different state space regions 3) Quantify discretization error contribution by comparing continuous-time theory with Euler-Maruyama implementations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The dissipative drift condition and polynomial score growth assumptions may not hold for complex real-world data distributions like natural images or text
- The polynomial growth assumption on the score function is particularly restrictive for neural network approximations
- The separation of continuous-time theory from discretization and approximation errors may underestimate cumulative practical effects
- The localized minorization condition requires careful choice of localization set C, which lacks full automation
- The framework doesn't fully address the finite capacity limitations of neural network score estimators

## Confidence
- **High**: Theoretical framework under stated assumptions (dissipativity, polynomial score growth)
- **Medium**: Practical implications for neural SGM implementations with discretization and approximation errors
- **Medium**: Error decomposition components and their geometric discounting along trajectories

## Next Checks
1. Test the dissipative and polynomial growth conditions empirically on real-world datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) by estimating score function norms across the state space
2. Quantify the actual contribution of discretization error in practical SGMs by comparing continuous-time theory with Euler-Maruyama implementations using varying step sizes
3. Evaluate the sensitivity of forgetting bounds to the choice of localization set C by varying its construction method across different data distributions
