core_contribution: LLM4ES presents a novel framework for learning user embeddings
  from event sequences by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on text-enriched
  representations of user histories. The approach converts structured event data into
  descriptive text, enhances it through creative transformation using LLMs, and then
  fine-tunes the model via next-token prediction to generate semantically rich user

# LLM4ES: Learning User Embeddings from Event Sequences via Large Language Models
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.05688
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05688
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: State-of-the-art performance with up to 7% relative improvement in ROC-AUC on financial and non-financial datasets

## Executive Summary
LLM4ES introduces a novel framework for learning user embeddings from event sequences by fine-tuning large language models on text-enriched representations of user histories. The approach converts structured event data into descriptive text, enhances it through creative transformation using LLMs, and fine-tunes the model via next-token prediction to generate semantically rich user embeddings. This method addresses the challenge of adapting LLMs to low-variability domains like financial transactions while achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets.

## Method Summary
The LLM4ES framework transforms structured event sequences into descriptive text representations that capture semantic relationships between events. It then applies creative text transformation using LLMs to enrich these representations before fine-tuning the model through next-token prediction. This approach enables the generation of semantically rich user embeddings that capture complex patterns in user behavior while maintaining computational efficiency through targeted fine-tuning rather than full model training.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 7% relative improvement in ROC-AUC compared to existing methods across financial and non-financial datasets
- Demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across different domains and event types
- Performs effectively as part of embedding ensembles, validating utility for diverse downstream applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages LLMs' natural language understanding capabilities by converting structured event data into rich textual representations. This transformation allows the model to capture semantic relationships and contextual information that might be lost in traditional numerical representations. The creative text transformation step enhances the expressiveness of the representations, while the next-token prediction fine-tuning objective naturally aligns with the sequential nature of user event histories.

## Foundational Learning
- **Event Sequence Encoding**: Converting structured events to text allows leveraging LLMs' natural language processing strengths - needed because traditional numerical encodings lose semantic context; quick check: compare embedding quality between text and numerical encodings
- **Fine-tuning vs. Prompting**: Fine-tuning provides better performance than prompting for embedding generation in low-variability domains - needed because prompting alone lacks task-specific adaptation; quick check: measure performance differences between fine-tuning and prompting approaches
- **Semantic Enrichment**: Creative text transformation enhances representation expressiveness - needed to capture complex relationships in user behavior; quick check: analyze embedding distances for semantically similar vs. dissimilar event sequences
- **Next-token Prediction**: Aligns with sequential nature of user histories - needed because it naturally models temporal dependencies; quick check: verify embedding quality improves with longer sequence lengths

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Event Sequences -> Text Conversion -> Creative Transformation -> LLM Fine-tuning -> User Embeddings

**Critical Path**: The fine-tuning process through next-token prediction is the critical path, as it directly determines the quality and relevance of generated user embeddings.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Fine-tuning offers superior performance compared to prompting but requires more computational resources and careful hyperparameter tuning. The text conversion step adds preprocessing overhead but enables leveraging LLMs' semantic understanding capabilities.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor embedding quality may result from inadequate text conversion that fails to capture event semantics, insufficient fine-tuning leading to underfitting, or creative transformation that introduces noise rather than meaningful enrichment.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Compare ROC-AUC performance between text-based and numerical encoding approaches on a financial dataset
2. Measure embedding quality degradation when fine-tuning is replaced with prompting only
3. Evaluate the impact of different text transformation strategies on embedding expressiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational overhead of fine-tuning large language models may limit deployment in resource-constrained environments
- Evaluation focuses on static performance metrics without extensively exploring temporal stability of embeddings over time
- Validation covers a relatively limited set of event types and may not fully represent real-world diversity

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core methodology of converting event sequences to text and using next-token prediction for embedding generation is technically sound
- Medium confidence: State-of-the-art performance claims are supported but comparison baselines may not represent full spectrum of recent methods
- Medium confidence: Generalization claims are supported by cross-domain experiments but scope of tested domains is limited

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate embedding stability and performance decay over extended time periods with periodic re-embedding to assess temporal robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify impact of creative text transformation step versus simpler text representations
3. Test framework on event sequences with significantly higher cardinality and variability to validate scalability claims beyond current datasets
