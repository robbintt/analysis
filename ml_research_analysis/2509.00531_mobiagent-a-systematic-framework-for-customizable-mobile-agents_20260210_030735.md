# MobiAgent: A Systematic Framework for Customizable Mobile Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.00531
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00531
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: Achieves state-of-the-art mobile agent performance with 2-3x latency optimization

## Executive Summary
MobiAgent presents a comprehensive framework for mobile agents that addresses the critical challenges of accuracy and efficiency in real-world task execution. The system introduces a multi-role agent architecture (Planner, Decider, Grounder) through the MobiMind series, complemented by the AgentRR acceleration framework that leverages record-and-replay mechanisms with multi-level experiences. The framework is validated through MobiFlow, a benchmarking suite based on Directed Acyclic Graphs that enables systematic evaluation of mobile agent performance.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates three core components: the MobiMind-series agent models with a specialized multi-role architecture designed for mobile contexts, the AgentRR acceleration framework that implements record-and-replay with multi-level experiences for performance optimization, and the MobiFlow benchmarking suite that uses Directed Acyclic Graphs for systematic evaluation. An AI-assisted agile data collection pipeline reduces manual annotation costs while maintaining quality standards for training and evaluation.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance against both general-purpose LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5-pro) and specialized GUI agent models (UI-TARS-1.5-7B)
- AgentRR framework delivers 2-3x optimization on task completion latency with 60%-85% action replay rates
- Maintains >99% correctness under power law user distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its specialized multi-role architecture that separates planning, decision-making, and grounding functions, allowing each component to be optimized for its specific task. The AgentRR acceleration framework leverages learned experiences through record-and-replay, significantly reducing computational overhead for common user patterns while maintaining high accuracy through multi-level experience caching.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-role agent architecture**: Separates cognitive functions into specialized roles (Planner, Decider, Grounder) to optimize each function's performance and enable modular improvements. Why needed: Mobile agents require different skill sets for planning versus execution versus contextual understanding. Quick check: Verify each role can operate independently and their outputs are properly synchronized.

**Record-and-replay acceleration**: Captures user interaction patterns and application states to enable rapid execution of common tasks without full reasoning overhead. Why needed: Mobile agents face latency constraints that make repeated full reasoning cycles impractical. Quick check: Measure replay accuracy versus full reasoning for common user patterns.

**DAG-based benchmarking**: Uses Directed Acyclic Graphs to represent task dependencies and execution paths, enabling systematic evaluation of agent performance across different scenarios. Why needed: Mobile tasks have complex dependencies that require structured evaluation frameworks. Quick check: Validate benchmark DAGs represent realistic mobile task flows.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: User Input -> MobiMind Multi-role System (Planner -> Decider -> Grounder) -> AgentRR Acceleration (Experience Cache -> Replay Engine) -> Mobile App Interaction -> MobiFlow Benchmarking

**Critical path**: User input flows through the multi-role system for task understanding, then through AgentRR for execution optimization, with benchmarking capturing performance metrics throughout.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades off some flexibility for speed through the replay mechanism, prioritizes mobile-specific optimizations over general-purpose capabilities, and uses structured benchmarking that may not capture all edge cases.

**Failure signatures**: Performance degradation when user patterns deviate from power law distributions, reduced accuracy with novel app interfaces not represented in training data, and potential bottlenecks in the multi-role coordination layer.

**First experiments**:
1. Test replay accuracy for common user patterns versus full reasoning execution
2. Evaluate multi-role coordination under high-load conditions
3. Benchmark performance across different app categories and complexity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Performance claims require verification of testing conditions and datasets used
- AgentRR framework optimization tested primarily under power law user distributions
- Data collection pipeline effectiveness quantification not provided

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: State-of-the-art performance claims relative to specified competitors
- **Medium confidence**: AgentRR latency optimization and correctness metrics under stated conditions
- **Low confidence**: AI-assisted data collection pipeline cost reduction claims without supporting metrics

## Next Checks
1. Replicate performance comparison against GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5-pro under identical task conditions and datasets
2. Test the AgentRR framework across non-power law user distributions and varying application complexity levels
3. Evaluate the data collection pipeline's annotation cost reduction across multiple app domains and task types
