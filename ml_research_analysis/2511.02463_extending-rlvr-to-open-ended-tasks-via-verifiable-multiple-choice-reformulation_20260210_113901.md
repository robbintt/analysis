## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of extending RLVR to open-ended tasks where no unambiguous ground truth exists. The authors introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation (VMR), a method that restructures open-ended tasks into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling RLVR-style training without external verifiers. Experimental results show that VMR-RLVR achieves an average gain of 3.29 points over traditional RLHF across seven open-ended benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in reasoning capabilities for open-ended domains.

## Method Summary
The method converts preference pairs (chosen vs rejected responses) into multiple-choice discrimination problems where the model must identify which response is superior. A rule-based verifier checks if the model selected the correct option via exact string matching. To prevent length collapse from pure multiple-choice training, the method uses a mixed objective combining the verification reward with a small RLHF component (α=0.1 weight) on a 5% subsample of general prompts. The approach uses GRPO framework on DeepSeek-R1-Distill models with ~20k MCQ samples and achieves gains across seven open-ended benchmarks.

## Key Results
- VMR-RLVR achieves 3.29 average points gain over RLHF across seven benchmarks
- Reasoning density increases from 18-20 (RLHF baselines) to 26 (VMR-RLVR)
- Response length collapse occurs with pure MCQ training but is mitigated by adding 5% RLHF component
- Gains are limited for non-reasoning models (+0.50 points on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multiple-Choice Reformulation Creates Verifiable Signals
Converting open-ended tasks into multiple-choice discrimination problems enables rule-based verification without requiring explicit ground-truth answers for the original open-ended prompts. The method transforms preference pairs into binary classification tasks where verification reduces to checking if the model selected the correct option via exact string matching against randomized ground truth positions.

### Mechanism 2: Mixed-Objective Training Prevents Length Collapse
Pure multiple-choice training causes response length collapse, but adding a small weighted RLHF objective from general prompts preserves response diversity while maintaining reasoning gains. The joint objective combines binary verification rewards on MCQ data with continuous reward model scores on a 5% subsample of general prompts.

### Mechanism 3: Contrastive Discrimination Improves Reasoning Density
Training on relative quality comparisons forces the model to develop more discriminative reasoning patterns, increasing reasoning steps per token ("reasoning density") without increasing verbosity. The model learns to identify distinguishing features between good and bad responses, internalizing quality criteria as structured reasoning patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards)**
  - Why needed: VMR-RLVR is built on the RLVR paradigm, which uses deterministic verifiers instead of learned reward models. Understanding the baseline RLVR setup is essential to grasp why extending it to open-ended tasks is challenging.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why RLVR works well for math and code but struggles with creative writing?

- **Preference Learning and Reward Models**
  - Why needed: The method relies on existing preference datasets to construct MCQs. Understanding how reward models are trained and their limitations clarifies the motivation for verification-based alternatives.
  - Quick check: What are three failure modes of learned reward models in RLHF?

- **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**
  - Why needed: The paper implements VMR-RLVR under the GRPO framework, which requires understanding how group-based advantage estimation differs from standard PPO.
  - Quick check: How does GRPO differ from PPO in terms of baseline estimation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Preference datasets → MCQ construction with randomized option ordering → filtering by accuracy range [0%, 85%] → GRPO training with mixed verification + RLHF objective → policy model with improved reasoning capabilities
- **Critical path:** Convert preference pairs to MCQ format → randomize option positions → filter out trivial samples → run GRPO training with mixed objective → monitor response length and reasoning density
- **Design tradeoffs:** More MCQ data vs general prompts (tradeoff between verification benefits and length diversity); accuracy filtering strictness (sensitivity analysis shows performance varies with different cutoffs); number of options (paper uses N=2 for simplicity)
- **Failure signatures:** Response length dropping below 300 tokens (length collapse from insufficient RLHF regularization); MCQ accuracy reaching 100% early (data too easy, need to filter or increase difficulty); reasoning density not increasing despite training progress (model may not have sufficient base reasoning capability)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce length collapse by training with pure MCQ data (α=0), 2) Ablate accuracy filter by comparing different ranges [0%, 85%] vs [20%, 70%] vs no filtering, 3) Test on non-reasoning model like Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct to verify marginal gains (~0.5 points)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What alternative strategies beyond mixing in RLHF objectives can prevent response length collapse when training exclusively on multiple-choice reformulated data?
- Basis in paper: "In the future, we intend to investigate alternative strategies to alleviate the collapse of response lengths typically associated with training exclusively on multiple-choice datasets."
- Why unresolved: The current approach requires a weighted combination of VMR-RLVR and RLHF (α=0.1), which partially relies on model-based rewards and doesn't fully achieve the goal of pure verifiable training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a pure RLVR method on open-ended tasks that maintains response length and diversity without any RLHF mixing, validated across the same seven benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What intrinsic model properties or pre-training characteristics determine whether VMR-RLVR will yield significant gains in open-ended reasoning?
- Basis in paper: VMR-RLVR shows 3.29 average point gains on reasoning models but only 0.50 points on the non-reasoning Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, suggesting "intrinsic strong reasoning capabilities are a prerequisite."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate which specific architectural, training, or capability factors enable VMR-RLVR effectiveness, limiting predictability of when to apply this method.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments across diverse model families with controlled variations in reasoning capabilities, pre-training data composition, and model scale to identify predictive factors for VMR-RLVR success.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does training on multiple-choice preference comparisons transfer to improved generation quality on the original open-ended tasks, or does it primarily improve comparative judgment ability?
- Basis in paper: The method trains models to select between response pairs, yet evaluation measures direct response quality on open-ended benchmarks; the mechanism of transfer from comparison to generation remains unclear.
- Why unresolved: While UMAP visualization suggests learned reasoning patterns generalize across queries, no controlled experiment isolates whether gains come from improved generation versus improved internal quality discrimination.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies measuring both generation quality and pairwise discrimination accuracy on held-out tasks, plus analysis of whether VMR-RLVR models show different error patterns than RLHF baselines on open-ended generation.

## Limitations
- The method requires a base model with strong reasoning capabilities; gains are limited for non-reasoning models (only +0.50 points on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct)
- The accuracy filtering [0%, 85%] threshold was determined empirically but performance varies significantly with different cutoffs
- Length collapse remains a fundamental challenge for pure verification-based training despite mitigation attempts

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The 3.29 average gain over RLHF across seven benchmarks is well-supported by experimental results and multiple evaluation metrics
- **Medium confidence**: The reasoning density metric (26 vs 18-20 for baselines) is novel and demonstrates clear improvements, though the metric itself is not widely established
- **Medium confidence**: The length collapse phenomenon is clearly demonstrated but the exact threshold of α=0.1 may be dataset/model-specific and require tuning

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce length collapse**: Train VMR-RLVR with α=0 (no RLHF component) and verify that response length decreases significantly compared to RLHF baseline
2. **Ablate accuracy filtering**: Compare training with different accuracy filter ranges ([0%, 85%] vs [20%, 70%] vs no filtering) to determine sensitivity to this hyperparameter
3. **Test on non-reasoning base**: Apply VMR-RLVR to a non-reasoning model (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) and verify that gains are minimal (~0.5 points)
