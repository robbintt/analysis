# HyDRA: A Hybrid Dual-Mode Network for Closed- and Open-Set RFFI with Optimized VMD

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.12133
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12133
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Hybrid dual-mode network achieving SOTA accuracy in closed-set RFFI and robust open-set detection using optimized VMD and dual encoder architecture

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HyDRA, a hybrid dual-mode network for radio frequency fingerprint identification that combines optimized Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with a fusion of CNNs, Transformers, and Mamba components. The system supports both closed-set classification of known devices and open-set detection of unauthorized devices. The optimized VMD uses closed-form solutions to eliminate iterative reconstruction errors, while the dual-encoder architecture adapts to varying signal conditions. Evaluation on public datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in closed-set scenarios and effective identification of unknown devices in open-set scenarios, with practical deployment on edge hardware achieving millisecond-level inference.

## Method Summary
HyDRA processes raw IQ signals through a three-stage pipeline: lossless VMD decomposition into three fixed-frequency IMFs, multi-scale feature extraction via CFRE (ResConv1d blocks), and dual-path encoding through either TDSE (Transformer Dynamic Sequence Encoder) or MLFE (Mamba Linear Flow Encoder). The VMD optimization fixes center frequencies at multiples of the fundamental symbol frequency and solves analytically to avoid ADMM reconstruction errors. For closed-set classification, both encoders produce class probabilities via softmax. For open-set detection, a temperature-scaled softmax with threshold discrimination identifies unknown devices by detecting low-confidence predictions.

## Key Results
- Closed-set accuracy: 99.78% on SingleDay dataset, 99.88% on ManyTx dataset
- Open-set accuracy: 94.67% at temperature=1.6, threshold=0.999
- Edge deployment: 8ms inference on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX (TDSE), 78ms (MLFE with Mamba-minimal)
- VMD optimization: Lossless VMD achieves 90.71% vs ADMM VMD's 89.46% on ManyTx

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Closed-Form VMD Eliminates Reconstruction Error
Fixing VMD center frequencies and deriving closed-form solutions removes ADMM's iterative reconstruction artifacts that degrade spectral fingerprint features. Standard VMD uses ADMM optimization with a penalty term that introduces nonzero reconstruction error. By fixing center frequencies at multiples of the fundamental symbol frequency and solving analytically, the decomposition becomes lossless—preserving discriminative hardware-induced spectral features.

### Mechanism 2: Selective State-Space Model Enables Linear-Complexity Long-Range Dependencies
Mamba's selective SSM captures RF signal long-range dependencies at O(T) complexity while maintaining competitive accuracy to Transformer's O(T²) self-attention. The MLFE encoder uses input-dependent parameters that discretize a continuous state-space model, allowing selective propagation of relevant signal history without explicit pairwise attention.

### Mechanism 3: Temperature-Scaled Softmax Threshold Discriminates Unknown Devices
Maximum softmax probability with temperature scaling and threshold τ separates known-device high-confidence predictions from uncertain unknown-device classifications. Temperature T controls softmax sharpness—known devices produce peaked distributions while unknown devices yield flatter distributions. Setting τ near 1.0 and T < 1 amplifies this separation, enabling binary legal/illegal decisions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)**
  - Why needed here: HyDRA's preprocessing layer decomposes IQ signals into narrowband IMFs; understanding bandwidth-constrained variational optimization is essential for grasping why ADMM introduces artifacts.
  - Quick check question: Why does the ADMM penalty term in standard VMD introduce reconstruction error that may harm high-SNR fingerprinting?

- **Concept: Selective State-Space Models (Mamba)**
  - Why needed here: MLFE replaces attention with input-dependent SSMs; you must understand how discretization and selective gating enable efficient sequence modeling.
  - Quick check question: How does the timescale parameter Δ in Eq. 17 control which historical information propagates through the state?

- **Concept: Open-Set Classification and Threshold Calibration**
  - Why needed here: HyDRA's security contribution hinges on distinguishing known vs. unknown transmitters; threshold-temperature interaction is non-obvious.
  - Quick check question: Why does increasing threshold τ require decreasing temperature T to maintain high open-set accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw IQ → Lossless VMD (k modes) → CFRE (ResConv1d blocks) → TDSE (Transformer Layers) or MLFE (Mamba SSM) → Linear Head → Softmax with Temperature → Threshold Discrimination

- **Critical path:** The CFRE extracts multi-scale temporal features (kt=3, kf=15 kernels with dilation); this feeds both encoder branches. For open-set, the softmax probability distribution is the decision point—incorrect temperature/threshold calibration collapses security guarantees.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - TDSE vs. MLFE: TDSE offers ~0.1-0.5% higher accuracy; MLFE offers 5.8× faster training and ~34% smaller model size. Choose TDSE for high-stakes closed-set; MLFE for edge deployment.
  - IMF mode count k: k=3 optimal; higher k degrades generalization while increasing preprocessing time.
  - Threshold τ: Higher τ improves illegal detection but increases false rejection of legal devices; calibrate per security requirements.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Legal devices classified as illegal: pmax consistently below τ → check if temperature T is too high or training data lacks class diversity.
  - Illegal devices classified as legal: pmax exceeds τ for unknown devices → threshold too low or unknown devices too similar to known distribution.
  - Slow inference on edge: MLFE using Mamba-minimal shows 78ms vs. TDSE's 8ms → verify official Mamba library compatibility.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate lossless VMD benefit:** Train TDSE on ManyTx with (a) no preprocessing, (b) ADMM VMD (k=3), (c) lossless VMD (k=3). Confirm Table I accuracy ordering: lossless > none > ADMM.
  2. **Calibrate open-set threshold:** Using held-out SingleDay data, sweep τ ∈ [0.90, 0.999] and T ∈ [0.5, 3.0]; plot accuracy surface and identify optimal point for your security-utility tradeoff.
  3. **Profile encoder latency:** Deploy both TDSE and MLFE on target edge hardware; measure inference time over 1000 runs with warm-up. If MLFE exceeds latency budget, quantify accuracy loss from switching to TDSE.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can HyDRA be adapted to perform real-time signal synchronization and online VMD processing with low enough latency for live wireless authentication?
- **Basis in paper:** The Conclusion states future work focuses on "real-time signal synchronization" and "optimizing online VMD processing for low-latency performance" to move away from offline datasets.
- **Why unresolved:** The current evaluation relies on pre-packaged, equalized datasets (WiSig), which bypass the computational challenges of live signal acquisition and decomposition.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful deployment on an antenna-integrated edge device demonstrating millisecond-level latency for the full pipeline (sync → VMD → inference).

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can an adaptive thresholding mechanism improve open-set classification robustness compared to the current static parameters?
- **Basis in paper:** The Conclusion identifies "developing adaptive thresholding for robust open-set classification" as a necessary step for handling real-world environments.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study uses fixed hyperparameters (Temperature = 1.6, Threshold = 0.999) derived from grid search, which may be brittle in dynamic channel conditions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An algorithm that dynamically adjusts τ and T based on signal quality or environment noise, showing maintained or improved accuracy over static baselines.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What are the true inference speed and efficiency of HyDRA (MLFE) on edge hardware when using the official Mamba library compared to the Mamba-minimal substitute?
- **Basis in paper:** Section V.F notes that the edge deployment used "Mamba-minimal... which does not represent the optimal outcome" due to library incompatibilities, resulting in significantly higher inference time (78ms vs 8ms for TDSE).
- **Why unresolved:** Software dependencies on the Jetson Xavier NX prevented benchmarking the optimized official kernel, leaving the MLFE's actual efficiency potential unverified.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking results of the official Mamba library running on the target edge hardware (Jetson Xavier NX).

## Limitations

- VMD optimization assumes signal center frequencies align with harmonic multiples of symbol rate, which may not hold for all modulation schemes or under severe Doppler conditions
- Open-set recognition robustness depends critically on threshold-temperature calibration, with limited exploration of unknown device similarity scenarios
- Edge deployment performance relies on Mamba-minimal library due to compatibility issues, preventing accurate assessment of MLFE efficiency with official implementation

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Closed-set classification performance on WiSig (99.78% accuracy, well-documented with multiple datasets)
- **Medium confidence:** Lossless VMD mechanism (internally validated but lacks external dataset comparison)
- **Medium confidence:** MLFE computational efficiency claims (benchmarked only on internal hardware)
- **Low confidence:** Open-set robustness to adversarial or highly similar unknown devices (limited to controlled dataset scenario)

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset VMD validation:** Apply lossless VMD to at least two different RF fingerprinting datasets (e.g., RF-DNA, DeepLearningCrowd) with varying modulation schemes and sampling rates. Measure if the closed-form approach maintains accuracy advantage over ADMM-based VMD when center frequencies deviate from harmonic multiples.

2. **Open-set robustness stress test:** Generate synthetic unknown devices by applying small perturbations to known device fingerprints (Gaussian noise with increasing variance). Measure false acceptance rate as perturbation magnitude increases, establishing the security boundary where similar devices cause misclassification.

3. **Real-world deployment latency profiling:** Deploy HyDRA on multiple edge platforms (Jetson Xavier NX, Raspberry Pi 5, Coral Dev Board) under varying signal-to-noise conditions. Measure inference latency, power consumption, and accuracy degradation to verify the claimed millisecond-level performance across diverse hardware.
