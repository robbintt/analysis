# The AI Language Proficiency Monitor -- Tracking the Progress of LLMs on Multilingual Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.08538
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08538
- Reference count: 22
- Comprehensive benchmark evaluates LLMs across up to 200 languages, revealing English and large European languages achieve highest scores while larger low-resource languages like Swahili score lower despite many speakers

## Executive Summary
The AI Language Proficiency Monitor is a comprehensive benchmark system designed to track the progress of large language models across up to 200 languages, with particular focus on low-resource languages. It aggregates diverse tasks including translation, question answering, math, and reasoning using datasets such as FLORES+, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA, and ARC. The system provides an open-source, auto-updating leaderboard and dashboard to identify strengths and gaps in model performance, revealing that English and large European languages achieve the highest proficiency scores while larger low-resource languages like Swahili show lower scores despite having many speakers.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates models using accuracy for classification, question answering, and math tasks, while using SpBLEU for translation tasks. For languages without existing benchmark data, the system uses Google Neural Machine Translation to automatically translate English benchmarks. Models are evaluated using few-shot prompting with minimal language-agnostic prompts to isolate reasoning capability from instruction-following ability. The system aggregates diverse metrics using min-max normalization to create a unified Language Proficiency Score, with daily auto-updates via GitHub Actions using OpenRouter and HuggingFace APIs for inference.

## Key Results
- English and large European languages achieve the highest proficiency scores in the benchmark
- Larger low-resource languages like Swahili show lower scores despite having many speakers
- The monitor successfully extends evaluation to 200 languages using machine translation as a scalable proxy
- Few-shot prompting with minimal language-agnostic prompts effectively isolates model reasoning capability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Translation as a Scalable Evaluation Proxy
The monitor extends evaluation to low-resource languages by treating machine translation as a viable proxy for native benchmark construction. It identifies gaps in human-translated benchmarks and uses Google Neural Machine Translation to translate English benchmarks into target languages, then evaluates models on these synthetic datasets using language-agnostic prompts. This assumes translation quality is sufficiently high to preserve task requirements without systematic bias.

### Mechanism 2: Aggregation via Min-Max Normalized Scoring
The system enables cross-task and cross-language comparison by normalizing distinct metrics into a unified "Language Proficiency Score." Raw scores from diverse tasks are scaled using min-max normalization, with the aggregate score being the arithmetic mean of these normalized task scores. This assumes all tasks contribute equally to proficiency and allows meaningful normalization across different score distributions.

### Mechanism 3: Language-Agnostic Few-Shot Prompting
The system isolates model reasoning capability from instruction-following capability by minimizing language-specific prompt engineering. Instead of translating complex instructions, it uses minimal prompts with few-shot examples, forcing models to infer task structure from examples rather than explicit natural language instructions. This assumes models possess sufficient in-context learning ability to map input-output patterns regardless of prompt language.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: SpBLEU (SentencePiece BLEU)
**Why needed here:** Standard BLEU scores are biased against languages with complex morphology or poor tokenization. SpBLEU creates a language-neutral playing field using a SentencePiece tokenizer trained on FLORES+ data.

**Quick check question:** Why would a standard tokenizer unfairly penalize a model evaluating a polysynthetic language like Inuktitut compared to English?

### Concept: Data Contamination in API Evaluation
**Why needed here:** The paper relies on API-based inference (OpenRouter). If benchmark data leaks into training data, scores are invalidated.

**Quick check question:** What specific configuration in OpenRouter does the paper mandate to mitigate the risk of providers training on evaluation queries?

### Concept: Min-Max Normalization
**Why needed here:** Allows the combination of accuracy (0.0-1.0) with SpBLEU (often 0-100 or lower) into a single index.

**Quick check question:** If the "min" value for a specific task is set too high (e.g., assuming a baseline of 0.5 when random chance is 0.25), how does this skew the aggregate score for smaller models?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
GitHub Actions (Daily Trigger) -> OpenRouter/HuggingFace APIs -> Static Benchmarks (FLORES+, MMLU) + Dynamic Translation (Google Translate API) -> Inference endpoints (Remote API calls) -> SpBLEU calculation and Accuracy checks -> HuggingFace Spaces (Dashboard/Leaderboard)

### Critical path:
1. **Translation Phase:** Check if language/task pair exists in human datasets; if not, generate via Google Translate
2. **Inference Phase:** Format few-shot prompt -> Query Model API -> Extract response (e.g., parsing `<reasoning> #### <number>` for math)
3. **Scoring Phase:** Compute task metric -> Min-Max Normalize -> Aggregate to Proficiency Score

### Design tradeoffs:
- **Coverage vs. Quality:** The system trades the high fidelity of human translation for the scalability of machine translation to reach 200 languages
- **Cost vs. Robustness:** The system currently samples only 10 instances per combination due to compute constraints, trading statistical significance for breadth of coverage

### Failure signatures:
- **Parsing Errors:** Models failing to follow the `<reasoning> #### <number>` format specifically in low-resource languages, leading to "zero" scores not due to lack of knowledge but format adherence
- **API Drift:** Changes to OpenRouter model routing causing sudden, artificial drops in performance
- **Translation Artifacts:** Spikes in error rates for specific languages where Google Translate introduces systematic semantic shifts in key nouns/verbs

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Sanity Check (Random Baseline):** Run the evaluation pipeline with a random-output model to establish the floor for the min-max normalization and verify the parsing logic
2. **Translation Perturbation Test:** Take a high-performing language (e.g., French) and pass it through a round-trip translation (French->English->French) to measure the performance drop induced by translation noise
3. **Prompt Sensitivity Analysis:** Vary the number of few-shot examples (0-shot vs. 2-shot vs. 5-shot) on a mid-resource language (e.g., Swahili) to determine if the "language-agnostic" assumption holds or if the model requires more context

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
**Question:** To what extent do scores on the AI Language Proficiency Monitor predict performance in real-world downstream applications for low-resource languages?
**Basis in paper:** [explicit] Stakeholders criticized the system, noting that performance on academic benchmarks "doesn’t necessarily correlate with downstream application performance in a language" (Section 4.2).
**Why unresolved:** The monitor relies on standardized datasets (MMLU, ARC) which may lack cultural relevance or practical utility for specific linguistic communities.
**What evidence would resolve it:** A study correlating the monitor's leaderboard scores with human evaluation results on practical, domain-specific tasks (e.g., local medical or legal advice) in low-resource languages.

### Open Question 2
**Question:** How does the noise introduced by machine-translating benchmark data affect the validity of comparing model performance across low-resource languages?
**Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors use Google NMT to generate benchmarks for languages without data, acknowledging that machine translation is "inferior" to human translation (Section 3.1).
**Why unresolved:** Translation errors in the test set may artificially lower scores or introduce systematic biases that obscure the true linguistic capabilities of the models.
**What evidence would resolve it:** Comparing model rankings on the auto-translated test sets against rankings on newly available, human-curated datasets for the same low-resource languages.

### Open Question 3
**Question:** Does sampling only 10 instances per task and language combination result in statistically stable and reliable rankings?
**Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that resource constraints currently limit automated runs to "10 instances per combination of model, task, and language" (Section 5.1).
**Why unresolved:** Low sample sizes typically increase variance, making it difficult to distinguish meaningful performance differences between models from statistical noise.
**What evidence would resolve it:** Re-evaluating a subset of models with significantly larger sample sizes (e.g., n=100) to measure the variance and stability of the resulting rankings.

## Limitations
- Translation quality uncertainty: Machine translation introduces potential systematic bias that may affect cross-language comparisons
- Statistical power concerns: Small sample size (10 instances) may not provide stable performance estimates
- API dependency risks: External service changes could affect reproducibility and consistency
- Normalization sensitivity: Min-max normalization may compress meaningful performance differences when extreme outliers occur

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** The technical implementation of benchmark infrastructure, dataset selection, and metric choice is well-documented and methodologically sound
**Medium Confidence:** The aggregation methodology and few-shot prompting approach are reasonable but may not fully capture multidimensional language proficiency
**Low Confidence:** Translation-based extension to low-resource languages lacks direct validation against native benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. **Translation Validation Study:** Compare model rankings on native vs. machine-translated benchmarks for 5-10 high-resource language pairs to quantify translation bias
2. **Sample Size Sensitivity Analysis:** Compare performance metrics using current 10-sample approach versus larger samples (50-100 instances) to measure variance reduction
3. **Cross-Provider Consistency Test:** Evaluate the same model across multiple API providers to quantify performance variance attributable to provider differences
