# ChronoPlay: A Framework for Modeling Dual Dynamics and Authenticity in Game RAG Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18455
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18455

- Primary result: Framework captures dual dynamics in game RAG benchmarks with up to 25% accuracy degradation over time

## Executive Summary
ChronoPlay introduces a framework addressing the challenge of dual dynamics in game RAG benchmarks, where both knowledge evolution and user interest drift impact system performance. The framework employs a dual-source synthesis engine that combines official game knowledge with player community input, paired with a dual-dynamic update mechanism tracking both knowledge changes and interest shifts. Experiments across three games demonstrate that RAG systems exhibit significant performance volatility, with accuracy dropping by up to 25% during certain phases, validating the framework's ability to capture these dynamics.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a dual-source synthesis engine that generates synthetic data by blending official game documentation with player community discourse patterns. This creates realistic query-answer pairs that reflect both evolving game mechanics and shifting player interests. The dual-dynamic update mechanism tracks two distinct temporal processes: knowledge evolution (changes in game content, mechanics, and official information) and interest drift (changes in what players want to know about). These components work together to create time-evolving benchmarks that reveal performance degradation patterns in RAG systems that static benchmarks miss.

## Key Results
- RAG systems show up to 25% accuracy degradation in certain temporal phases
- Performance volatility is consistent across three different game benchmarks
- Static benchmarks fail to capture the dual dynamics, providing misleading evaluations
- The framework successfully models both knowledge evolution and interest drift as distinct failure modes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by recognizing that RAG performance degradation in games stems from two independent temporal processes: official knowledge updates that change what constitutes correct answers, and player interest drift that changes what questions are being asked. By synthesizing data that captures both processes and updating them independently, the framework creates more realistic evaluation conditions than static benchmarks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dual dynamics identification**: Understanding that RAG degradation comes from two sources (knowledge evolution + interest drift) rather than one unified temporal process
  - Why needed: Static benchmarks conflate these effects, masking root causes of performance issues
  - Quick check: Can you separate accuracy drops into knowledge vs. interest components?

- **Synthetic data generation for temporal modeling**: Creating realistic query-answer pairs that evolve over time
  - Why needed: Real longitudinal data is scarce and expensive to collect
  - Quick check: Does synthetic data preserve realistic query distributions and answer evolution patterns?

- **Dual-source knowledge integration**: Combining official documentation with community discourse
  - Why needed: Player questions often involve community knowledge not in official sources
  - Quick check: Does the framework capture edge cases where community knowledge diverges from official sources?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Synthesis Engine -> Update Mechanism -> Benchmark Generation -> RAG Evaluation

Critical Path: The framework generates time-series synthetic data through the synthesis engine, applies dual-dynamic updates, creates temporal benchmarks, and evaluates RAG performance across time periods to identify degradation patterns.

Design Tradeoffs: The use of synthetic data enables scalable temporal modeling but introduces uncertainty about authenticity compared to real-world longitudinal data. The framework prioritizes coverage and controllability over absolute realism.

Failure Signatures: RAG systems show two distinct failure modes - knowledge-based failures (when official information changes) and interest-based failures (when player queries shift to new topics). These manifest as different temporal patterns in accuracy degradation.

First 3 Experiments:
1. Apply framework to three games with varying update frequencies to validate dual dynamics across different temporal scales
2. Compare RAG performance on ChronoPlay benchmarks versus static benchmarks to quantify evaluation accuracy improvements
3. Analyze correlation between knowledge evolution rates and accuracy degradation to validate the framework's sensitivity to knowledge changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic data fidelity remains untested against real longitudinal data, raising questions about whether performance drops reflect genuine RAG degradation or synthetic generation artifacts
- Three-game sample size provides proof-of-concept but insufficient evidence for generalizability across different gaming genres with varying update patterns
- The framework assumes regular, predictable update patterns that may not reflect the irregular nature of real game updates or community interest shifts

## Confidence
- High: The framework's conceptual contribution in identifying dual dynamics as distinct failure modes is methodologically sound
- Medium: Quantitative results showing 25% accuracy degradation are credible within the experimental setup but may not generalize without broader game coverage
- Low: Claims about providing "authentic" evaluations are premature without validation against real-world longitudinal RAG deployments

## Next Checks
1. Apply ChronoPlay to generate synthetic benchmarks for games where real longitudinal RAG performance data exists, then compare predicted vs. actual accuracy degradation patterns
2. Test the framework across at least 10 games spanning different genres (competitive FPS, MMORPG, puzzle, strategy) to identify genre-specific vs. universal dual dynamic patterns
3. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing the synthetic community knowledge generated by the dual-source engine against actual player discussions from forums and social media to assess authenticity
