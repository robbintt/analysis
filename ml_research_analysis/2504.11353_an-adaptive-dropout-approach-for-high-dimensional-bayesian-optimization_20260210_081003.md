# An Adaptive Dropout Approach for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.11353
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11353
- Authors: Jundi Huang; Dawei Zhan
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AdaDropout outperforms standard BO and six state-of-the-art high-dimensional methods on 100D CEC benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of high-dimensional Bayesian optimization where standard methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality in acquisition function optimization. The proposed Adaptive Dropout (AdaDropout) method dynamically reduces the dimensionality of the acquisition function by dropping optimization variables when no improvement is observed. By adaptively adjusting the optimization subspace, AdaDropout effectively balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional spaces. Experimental results on 100-dimensional CEC 2013 and CEC 2017 benchmark problems demonstrate that AdaDropout outperforms standard Bayesian optimization and six state-of-the-art high-dimensional BO methods in terms of optimization efficiency and solution quality.

## Method Summary
AdaDropout implements adaptive dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization by maintaining a current optimization dimensionality d that starts at D (full dimension) and decreases when no improvement is observed. At each iteration, d dimensions are randomly selected for optimization while the remaining D-d dimensions are fixed to values from the current best solution. The Expected Subspace Improvement (ESSI) acquisition function is optimized over this d-dimensional subspace using a Genetic Algorithm with population size max(10, 4d) and generations = 200d/population_size. When a sampled point fails to improve the current best solution (f(x_next) > f_min), the optimization dimensionality is reduced from d to d-1, creating a progressive transition from global exploration to local exploitation.

## Key Results
- AdaDropout outperforms standard Bayesian optimization on all 57 CEC benchmark functions at 100 dimensions
- Statistical significance confirmed via Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = 0.05) across 30 independent runs
- Achieves faster convergence and better final solutions compared to six state-of-the-art high-dimensional BO methods
- Demonstrates effective balance between exploration in early iterations and exploitation in later iterations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Gradual dimensionality reduction of acquisition function optimization enables transition from global exploration to local exploitation, mitigating the curse of dimensionality.
- Mechanism: Start with full D-dimensional acquisition function optimization. When a sampled point fails to improve the current best (f(x_next) > f_min), reduce optimizing dimensions from d to d-1. Maintain dimensionality when improvement occurs. This creates automatic progression from broad D-dimensional search to focused low-dimensional refinement.
- Core assumption: Variables that don't contribute to improvement when optimized together can be temporarily fixed to values from the current best solution without permanently degrading search quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By gradually reducing the dimension of the acquisition function, the proposed approach has less and less difficulty to optimize the acquisition function."
  - [section 3.1]: "This adaptive dropout strategy gradually concentrates the search onto promising subspaces. When improvement is detected (i.e., f(x_next) < f_min), the best solution is updated and the current dimensionality d is maintained, ensuring that the search remains sufficiently explorative. Over iterations, the search space transitions from a full D-dimensional global search to a lower-dimensional local search."
  - [corpus]: "High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization using Lasso Variable Selection" addresses similar challenges through variable selection but uses Lasso regression rather than adaptive dimensionality reduction.
- Break condition: Strong variable interactions requiring simultaneous optimization of all dimensions will cause premature fixing of important variables; aggressive dropout triggers may trap search in local optima before adequate exploration.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Random subspace selection with Expected Subspace Improvement (ESSI) acquisition function maintains search diversity while reducing per-iteration computational cost.
- Mechanism: Each iteration randomly selects d dimensions from D-dimensional space for optimization. The ESSI acquisition function is optimized only over this subspace. Non-selected dimensions inherit values from current best solution x*. Random selection over iterations provides probabilistic coverage of dimension combinations.
- Core assumption: Random dimension selection over many iterations provides sufficient coverage; fixing non-optimized dimensions to current best values preserves solution quality while enabling tractable subproblems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2, Algorithm 2]: "Select optimizing variables: Randomly select d optimizing variables from the original D-dimensional search space... Form the new solution x_next = [x_min,1, ..., y_next,1, ..., x_min,i, ..., y_next,d, ..., x_min,D]."
  - [section 4.1]: "The ESSI acquisition function is optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). For AdaDropout, the GA population size is max(10, 4d), where d is the number of optimizing variables."
  - [corpus]: Corpus provides weak direct evidence for random subspace selection specifically; related papers focus on alternative variable selection methods.
- Break condition: Critical variable combinations rarely co-selected due to randomness will slow convergence; errors in fixed dimensions at current best solution propagate through subsequent iterations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Progressive focus from high-dimensional early exploration to low-dimensional late exploitation yields rapid initial gains followed by sustained refinement.
- Mechanism: Full/high-dimensional optimization in early iterations identifies promising regions broadly. As algorithm drops dimensions based on non-improvement, search intensity concentrates within identified regions. The automatic dimensionality reduction encodes exploration-exploitation balance without explicit scheduling parameters.
- Core assumption: Promising regions identified early remain valid targets for local refinement; important dimensions can be approximated while others are fixed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: "For instance, in the cases of f2, f6, and f11, AdaDropout exhibits a steep decline in f_min during the early iterations, followed by a stable and consistent improvement. This suggests that AdaDropout effectively exploits the initial high-dimensional optimization phase for rapid performance gains while maintaining steady progress in the later stages."
  - [section 4.2]: "Compared with standard Bayesian optimization, AdaDropout initially performs slightly worse, which may be attributed to the gradual reduction in the dimensionality of the acquisition function during the early iterations. However, in the later stages, AdaDropout exhibits steady improvements, whereas standard BO suffers from the curse of high-dimensional optimization, leading to performance stagnation."
  - [corpus]: "Bayesian Optimization with Inexact Acquisition" discusses acquisition optimization challenges that AdaDropout addresses through dimensionality reduction.
- Break condition: Misleading initial samples or too-short exploration phase causes premature commitment to suboptimal regions; functions with multiple comparable local optima may cause early commitment to inferior basin.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Gaussian Process Surrogate Models**
  - Why needed here: AdaDropout depends on GP predictive mean and uncertainty for acquisition function computation. Understanding GP scaling with dimension explains why acquisition optimization becomes difficult and why dimensionality reduction helps.
  - Quick check question: Given N samples in D dimensions with RBF kernel, how does GP prediction complexity scale, and why does uncertainty estimation degrade in high dimensions with sparse samples?

- Concept: **Acquisition Functions (Expected Improvement)**
  - Why needed here: The core problem AdaDropout solves is acquisition function optimization difficulty in high dimensions. Understanding EI's multimodal structure and exploration-exploitation trade-off clarifies why subspace optimization is effective.
  - Quick check question: Why does EI(x) = 0 at all previously evaluated points, and how does this create multimodal landscapes that worsen with dimensionality?

- Concept: **Curse of Dimensionality in Search**
  - Why needed here: Motivates the entire approach. Exponential search space growth with dimension makes both GP modeling and acquisition optimization increasingly difficult with fixed sample budgets.
  - Quick check question: For a search space where each of D dimensions is discretized into M values, what is the total number of possible points, and what fraction can typically be evaluated under expensive function constraints?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Initialization Module -> Dimension Manager -> Subspace Selector -> Acquisition Optimizer -> Solution Constructor -> Evaluator & Updater

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize with LHS -> train GP -> identify best solution
  2. Loop: select d dimensions -> train GP -> optimize ESSI over subspace via GA -> construct full candidate -> evaluate -> if no improvement and d>1: d=d-1 -> update best
  3. Terminate at N_max evaluations (1000 in experiments)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dropout rate: One dimension per non-improving iteration is conservative. Aggressive multi-dimension dropout risks premature convergence; slower dropout extends exploration.
  - Initial sample size: 200 for 100D balances model quality vs. budget. Fewer samples risks poor GP; more consumes evaluation budget.
  - Subspace selection: Random selection is assumption-free but provides no importance guidance. Importance-based selection requires additional computation.
  - Fixed variable source: Using x* is simple but propagates errors. Alternatives (mean, posterior sampling) add complexity.

- Failure signatures:
  1. **Premature convergence**: Rapid dimension drop (d reaches 1-2 quickly) with minimal total improvement—indicates dropout trigger too aggressive or landscape highly multimodal.
  2. **Stagnation in high dimensions**: d remains at D throughout, slow convergence—suggests improvement criterion too lenient or function dominated by noise.
  3. **Dimension oscillation**: d drops then recovers repeatedly—may indicate noisy objective or implementation error in improvement check.
  4. **Subspace coverage failure**: Good performance on separable functions, poor on coupled functions—random selection rarely picks critical interacting dimensions together.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation on controlled test function**: Implement on 50D Rosenbrock or Rastrigin; compare AdaDropout vs. standard BO vs. fixed-dimension Dropout; log convergence curves and dimensionality trajectory to verify adaptive mechanism provides measurable benefit.
  2. **Dropout trigger sensitivity analysis**: Test variants: drop after 1 non-improvement (paper default), drop after 2 consecutive non-improvements, drop if improvement < threshold; measure convergence speed vs. final solution quality tradeoff.
  3. **Variable interaction stress test**: Create synthetic functions with controlled interaction structure (fully separable additive, pairwise interactions only, full coupling); compare AdaDropout performance across structures to characterize assumption boundaries and identify interaction levels where performance degrades.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: How can the AdaDropout framework be effectively extended to handle expensive constrained optimization and multi-objective optimization problems? (Paper explicitly calls this out in Conclusion)
- **Open Question 2**: Does the monotonic reduction of the optimizing dimensionality risk permanent entrapment in local optima, and could a mechanism to re-increase dimensions mitigate this? (Inferred from monotonic dropout logic)
- **Open Question 3**: Is the random selection of optimizing variables efficient for real-world problems with highly non-uniform variable importance? (Inferred from comparison to importance-aware methods)

## Limitations
- AdaDropout doesn't handle expensive constraints or multiple objectives as acknowledged by the authors
- Random subspace selection may be inefficient for problems with non-uniform variable importance
- The monotonic dimension reduction may cause premature convergence on functions with strong variable interactions

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core adaptive dimensionality reduction mechanism and its ability to mitigate acquisition function optimization difficulty
- **Medium confidence** in random subspace selection effectiveness across diverse function classes
- **Medium confidence** in dropout timing and its exploration-exploitation balance

## Next Checks
1. **Mechanism validation test**: Implement on synthetic functions with controlled variable interactions (fully separable, pairwise coupled, fully coupled); measure AdaDropout performance degradation as interaction strength increases to quantify assumption boundaries.

2. **Dropout trigger sensitivity test**: Run AdaDropout with different dropout triggers (1 non-improvement, 2 non-improvements, threshold-based) on 2-3 CEC functions; analyze convergence speed vs. final quality tradeoff to identify optimal dropout aggressiveness.

3. **Subspace coverage analysis**: For a 10D subset of a CEC function, track frequency of dimension co-selection over 1000 iterations; compute coverage probability for critical dimension pairs to quantify whether random selection provides sufficient exploration of interacting variables.
