- Pixel diffusion with perceptual loss achieves FID 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance in 80 epochs

## Executive Summary
PixelGen is a novel pixel diffusion framework that generates images directly in pixel space without using VAEs, challenging the traditional two-stage latent diffusion approach. The key innovation is the introduction of two complementary perceptual losses—LPIPS for local textures and a DINO-based loss for global semantics—that guide the model toward a meaningful perceptual manifold rather than modeling all pixel-space signals. This approach enables PixelGen to outperform strong latent diffusion baselines, achieving state-of-the-art FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 while training for only 80 epochs without classifier-free guidance.

## Method Summary
PixelGen employs a DiT backbone with x-prediction (predicting clean images and converting to velocity) and flow matching via logit-normal time sampling. The model is trained with a combination of reconstruction loss, LPIPS loss for local textures, DINO-based perceptual loss for global semantics, and REPA loss for feature alignment. Crucially, perceptual losses are gated based on noise level (applied only when t > 0.3) to preserve diversity while ensuring perceptual quality. The approach is demonstrated on both class-to-image generation (ImageNet-256) and text-to-image generation (using 36M images and BLIP3o-60k captions with Qwen3-1.7B encoder).

## Key Results
- Achieves FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance in 80 epochs
- Scores 0.79 on GenEval for text-to-image generation
- Outperforms strong latent diffusion baselines while avoiding VAE complexity
- Demonstrates faster convergence than traditional latent diffusion approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PixelGen succeeds by recognizing that pixel-space generation doesn't need to model every pixel-level signal—instead, it can focus on the perceptual manifold that humans actually care about. By combining LPIPS (capturing local texture details) with DINO-based loss (capturing global semantic structure), the model learns to generate images that are perceptually meaningful rather than pixel-perfect reconstructions. The noise-gating strategy (disabling perceptual losses for the first 30% of timesteps) prevents the model from collapsing into mode-seeking behavior, preserving diversity while still benefiting from perceptual guidance.

## Foundational Learning

**Flow Matching vs. Denoising Diffusion**
- Why needed: Flow matching provides better training stability and sample quality than traditional denoising diffusion
- Quick check: Verify velocity conversion from x-prediction and proper logit-normal time sampling implementation

**Perceptual Loss Integration**
- Why needed: LPIPS and DINO losses guide generation toward human-perceivable quality rather than pixel-level accuracy
- Quick check: Confirm perceptual losses are only active when t > 0.3 and produce meaningful gradients

**Noise-Gating Strategy**
- Why needed: Prevents early perceptual supervision from collapsing diversity while maintaining quality
- Quick check: Verify threshold at 0.3 and monitor diversity metrics during training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image -> DiT Backbone -> x-prediction -> Flow Matching Loss + Perceptual Losses (gated) -> Generated Image

**Critical Path**: Input image → Patch embedding (16x16) → DiT layers (SwiGLU, RoPE2d, RMSNorm) → x-prediction head → Velocity conversion → Flow matching objective

**Design Tradeoffs**: Pixel diffusion offers end-to-end simplicity and potentially better perceptual quality but requires significantly more compute than latent diffusion; perceptual losses add training complexity but enable better sample quality

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Blurry outputs → Perceptual losses not properly gated or underweighted
- Low diversity → Perceptual supervision applied too early (threshold too low)
- Training instability → Missing gradient clipping or incorrect EMA application

**First Experiments**:
1. Train baseline DiT without perceptual losses to establish reference performance
2. Add LPIPS loss only to verify local texture improvements
3. Add P-DINO loss only to verify global semantic improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can richer perceptual objectives, such as adversarial losses, be stabilized and integrated into PixelGen to further enhance realism? The paper notes adversarial losses are "often unstable" for pixel diffusion but leaves their potential benefit unexplored.

**Open Question 2**: What specific designs for pixel-space samplers or CFG strategies are necessary to close the performance gap with latent diffusion models in guided generation? PixelGen trails state-of-the-art latent models when Classifier-Free Guidance is applied.

**Open Question 3**: Is there a theoretically optimal or continuous schedule for applying perceptual supervision rather than the empirically determined "noise-gating" threshold? The current 0.3 threshold is derived from ablation studies rather than theoretical understanding.

## Limitations
- Pixel-level generation requires significantly more compute than latent diffusion approaches
- Exact composition of the 36M text-to-image pretraining dataset and BLIP3o-60k captions is unspecified
- REPA loss integration details with JiT baseline are not fully detailed in the paper

## Confidence

**Major Claim Confidence**:
- Pixel diffusion outperforming latent diffusion: High confidence (supported by quantitative FID/GenEval results)
- Perceptual losses effectiveness: High confidence (systematic ablation studies show clear improvements)
- No VAE advantage: Medium confidence (demonstrates strong results but comparative efficiency analysis limited)

## Next Checks
1. Implement noise-gating at t > 0.3 and verify perceptual losses are properly disabled during early timesteps
2. Run controlled ablation: train with only LPIPS loss, only P-DINO loss, and both together to confirm complementary effects
3. Test model stability with and without gradient clipping, particularly for text-to-image generation scenarios
