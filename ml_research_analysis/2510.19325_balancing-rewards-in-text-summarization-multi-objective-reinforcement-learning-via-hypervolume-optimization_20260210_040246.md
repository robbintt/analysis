# Balancing Rewards in Text Summarization: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning via HyperVolume Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19325
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19325
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: HVO outperforms GRPO in overall scores and demonstrates more balanced performance across multiple objectives (consistency, coherence, relevance, fluency) in text summarization.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of balancing multiple objectives in text summarization by proposing hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning strategy. HVO integrates hypervolume evaluation into the reward computation framework to guide the model toward the Pareto front, dynamically adjusting scores between groups during reinforcement learning. Experimental results on CNN/DailyMail and BillSum datasets show that HVO outperforms group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and demonstrates more balanced performance across different dimensions. A 7B foundation model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task while maintaining a shorter generation length.

## Method Summary
HVO is a GRPO-based reinforcement learning method that addresses multi-objective summarization by computing rewards based on hypervolume maximization rather than simple linear weighting. The method generates groups of summaries for each prompt, scores them across four dimensions using UniEval (coherence, consistency, fluency, relevance), and calculates a scalar reward using hypervolume aggregation with a conciseness constraint. The policy model (Qwen 2.5 7B) is updated using the aggregated rewards with KL divergence penalty to maintain stability.

## Key Results
- HVO outperforms GRPO in overall scores on CNN/DailyMail and BillSum datasets
- HVO demonstrates more balanced performance across coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance dimensions
- A 7B model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 while generating shorter summaries
- HVO achieves state-of-the-art hypervolume and overall scores in multi-objective summarization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hypervolume-Based Scalarization
- **Claim:** Replacing linear weighted rewards with hypervolume-based scalarization guides the model toward the Pareto front more effectively than fixed weights.
- **Mechanism:** Standard multi-objective RL often sums rewards (e.g., $r = \sum w_k r_k$), which fails to capture non-convex regions of the Pareto front. HVO computes a scalar reward based on the dominated hypervolume relative to a reference point (Eq. 3).
- **Core assumption:** The evaluation metrics (UniEval dimensions) correlate sufficiently with human preferences, and the hypervolume indicator serves as a valid proxy for "summary quality" in high-dimensional space.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] ("dynamically adjusts the scores... using the hypervolume method... generating balanced summaries"), [section 2.2] ("weighted linear combination... has non-trivial limitations... optimizing towards hypervolume maximization ensures continuous improvement")
- **Break condition:** If the objective space is convex or the evaluation metrics are highly correlated, the computational overhead of hypervolume calculation may not yield significant gains over linear weighting.

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic Length Constraint
- **Claim:** A dynamic length constraint prevents the "summary length collapse" common in RL fine-tuning.
- **Mechanism:** Unconstrained RL optimization can exploit reward functions by generating degenerate outputs (e.g., extremely short text to maximize "fluency"). The authors introduce a conciseness reward (Eq. 4) derived from a sigmoid-like function centered on the dataset's average compression ratio.
- **Core assumption:** The optimal summary length is approximately correlated with the average compression ratio of the human-written references in the training set.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 2.2] ("GRPO encounters issues with training instability... summary length collapse... we propose a new length constraint method"), [figure 4] (Shows HVO maintains shorter, consistent lengths compared to baselines while achieving higher scores)
- **Break condition:** If the target domain requires significantly different summary densities than the training data (e.g., extremely abstractive "tweet-length" summaries), this constraint would incorrectly penalize valid outputs.

### Mechanism 3: Group-Relative Advantage Estimation
- **Claim:** Group-relative advantage estimation stabilizes the gradient signal for multi-dimensional rewards.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of relying on absolute reward values from a critic model, HVO (via GRPO) calculates advantages $\hat{A}$ by normalizing rewards within a group of $G$ outputs generated for the same prompt.
- **Core assumption:** The diversity within the group of $G$ generated samples is sufficient to provide a meaningful baseline for comparison.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 2.1] ("For a specific question... policy model generates a group of G individual summaries... $\hat{A}_{i,t} = \frac{r_i - \text{mean}}{\text{std}}$"), [figure 3] (Training dynamics show HVO maintains higher reward standard deviation, which the authors argue creates a "more significant advantage signal")
- **Break condition:** If the group size $G$ is too small, variance estimates become noisy, leading to unstable training.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pareto Front & Scalarization**
  - **Why needed here:** The core problem is balancing competing metrics (fluency vs. consistency). Understanding that linear sums often fail to find optimal trade-offs (non-convex regions) is prerequisite to grasping why hypervolume is used.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a weighted sum of rewards fail to find a solution that balances two objectives perfectly?

- **Concept: Hypervolume Indicator**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses this metric not just for evaluation, but as a training loss component. You must understand it measures the volume of objective space dominated by a solution set relative to a reference point.
  - **Quick check question:** If a solution improves one objective slightly but worsens another significantly, would the hypervolume increase or decrease? (Hint: It generally decreases if it moves away from the utopian point).

- **Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) & GRPO**
  - **Why needed here:** HVO builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant of PPO. Understanding the "clip" mechanism and the need for a reference model ($\pi_{ref}$) is essential to read the loss function (Eq. 1).
  - **Quick check question:** What role does the $\beta D_{KL}$ term play in Equation 1?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Policy Model ($\pi_\theta$: Qwen 2.5 7B) -> Reference Model ($\pi_{ref}$: frozen copy) -> Reward Engine (UniEval + Conciseness) -> Aggregator (Hypervolume Calculator) -> Optimizer (GRPO update loop)

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Batch Generation:** Sample prompts $q$; Policy generates $G$ summaries per prompt
  2. **Multi-Dim Scoring:** UniEval scores summaries on 4 dimensions; Conciseness score calculated
  3. **Hypervolume Aggregation:** Convert multi-dim scores into a scalar reward $r_i$ using Eq. 3 (requires setting $\epsilon, \delta$)
  4. **Advantage Calculation:** Normalize $r_i$ within the group of $G$ to get $\hat{A}$
  5. **Policy Update:** Maximize objective $J(\theta)$ (Eq. 1) using gradient ascent on the clipped objective

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **UniEval vs. LLM-as-Judge:** The authors choose UniEval (smaller, likely faster/more deterministic) over a large LLM judge. *Assumption:* This reduces compute cost but may inherit UniEval's specific biases.
  - **Hypervolume Reference Point:** The method sets a reference point slightly worse than the nadir. If the reference point is too lenient, it may not push for optimality; if too strict, it may provide sparse rewards.
  - **Length Constraint:** The sigmoid ($\lambda, \rho$) parameters are hard-coded. This prioritizes stability over flexibility for varying document types.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Length Collapse:** If the conciseness reward weight is too low or $\rho$ is misconfigured, the model may output empty strings or single words to maximize "fluency" trivially.
  - **Reward Hacking:** The model might learn to generate text that specifically triggers high UniEval scores (e.g., specific linguistic patterns) rather than truly semantic summarization.
  - **Gradient Conflict:** While HVO aims to solve this, drastic differences in reward scale between dimensions could still destabilize the hypervolume calculation.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on Aggregation:** Compare HVO (Hypervolume) vs. simple Linear Weighted Sum on the same base model to verify the specific contribution of the hypervolume geometry.
  2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity ($\epsilon, \delta$):** Perturb the hypervolume constants in Eq. 3 to ensure the "monotonic adjustment" is robust and not over-tuned to the specific values (0.99, 0.1).
  3. **Cross-Domain Generalization:** Train on CNN/DailyMail (news) and test on BillSum (legislation) without the specific "conciseness" constraint to see if the length prior holds or if the model collapses.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can HVO generalize effectively to other text generation tasks beyond summarization?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The method is introduced specifically for text summarization, and experiments are restricted to CNN/DailyMail and BillSum datasets.
- **Why unresolved:** The reward dimensions (coherence, consistency, etc.) and length constraints are tailored to the specific mechanics of summarization.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful application of HVO to distinct generation tasks (e.g., translation, dialogue) using task-specific multi-objective rewards.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How sensitive is the optimization stability to the choice of the reference point (nadir) and hyperparameters ($\delta, \epsilon$)?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors select a "slightly worse reference point" and specific constants ($\delta=0.1, \epsilon=0.99$) heuristically without providing ablation studies.
- **Why unresolved:** Hypervolume calculations can be sensitive to reference point placement; inappropriate values might distort the gradient direction or Pareto approximation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study showing performance variance across different reference point configurations and hyperparameter values.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Do the improvements in automated hypervolume and UniEval scores reliably translate to increased human preference?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper relies entirely on UniEval as the reward signal and evaluation metric, citing its correlation with human judgment, but includes no direct human evaluation.
- **Why unresolved:** Reinforcement learning on proxy metrics can lead to "reward hacking," where the model optimizes the metric without improving actual semantic quality for humans.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A human side-by-side evaluation comparing HVO summaries against GRPO and GPT-4 baselines.

## Limitations
- Unproven generalization across domains: HVO's effectiveness on other summarization domains (e.g., scientific papers, meeting transcripts) remains untested.
- Hypervolume computational overhead: The method becomes computationally expensive as the number of objectives increases.
- Evaluation dependency: HVO's performance is tightly coupled with the quality of the UniEval metric.
- Length constraint rigidity: The sigmoid-based conciseness reward assumes optimal summaries cluster around the training data's average compression ratio.

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core mechanism: The theoretical foundation of using hypervolume maximization for multi-objective optimization is well-established.
- **Medium confidence** in empirical results: While experimental results show HVO outperforming baselines, the lack of human evaluation reduces confidence in practical significance.
- **Medium confidence** in training stability claims: The paper demonstrates training stability compared to GRPO, but doesn't extensively explore edge cases.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain robustness test:** Train HVO on CNN/DailyMail and evaluate on completely different summarization datasets (e.g., XSum, arXiv) without domain-specific tuning.
2. **Human evaluation correlation:** Conduct human preference studies comparing HVO-optimized summaries against GRPO and baseline models.
3. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary the critical hyperparameters (ε, δ, ρ, λ) across multiple orders of magnitude to identify regions of instability.
