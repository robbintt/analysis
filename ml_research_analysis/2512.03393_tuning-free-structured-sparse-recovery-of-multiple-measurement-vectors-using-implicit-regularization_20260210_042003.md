# Tuning-Free Structured Sparse Recovery of Multiple Measurement Vectors using Implicit Regularization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03393
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03393
- Authors: Lakshmi Jayalal; Sheetal Kalyani
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Tuning-free approach achieves performance comparable to optimally-tuned baselines while being robust to parameter misspecification and low SNR conditions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel tuning-free method for structured sparse recovery of multiple measurement vectors (MMV) that leverages implicit regularization through overparameterization. The approach factorizes the target matrix into components that decouple shared row-support from individual vector entries, applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective. By using a Hadamard-product parameterization, the method promotes row sparsity through optimization dynamics rather than explicit regularization, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of sparsity level or noise variance.

The proposed method demonstrates robust performance across various SNR conditions and parameter settings, achieving results comparable to optimally-tuned baselines such as M-OMP, M-SP, AMP-MMV, M-BSBL, and M-FOCUSS. This makes it particularly practical for real-world applications where critical parameters are unknown or difficult to estimate. The theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees under specific initialization conditions, while empirical results validate the approach's effectiveness in both noiseless and noisy scenarios.

## Method Summary
The proposed method factorizes the target matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ into components that decouple shared row-support from individual vector entries, applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective $\min_{\mathbf{X}} \|\mathbf{Y} - \mathbf{A}\mathbf{X}\|_F^2$. The key innovation is a Hadamard-product parameterization $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{U} \circ \mathbf{V}$ where $\mathbf{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ and $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$, which promotes row sparsity through optimization dynamics rather than explicit regularization. The Hadamard-product structure encourages shared sparsity patterns across multiple measurement vectors, while the gradient descent dynamics drive the solution toward the desired row-sparse structure.

## Key Results
- Achieves performance comparable to optimally-tuned baselines (M-OMP, M-SP, AMP-MMV, M-BSBL, M-FOCUSS) without requiring parameter tuning
- Demonstrates robustness to parameter misspecification and low SNR conditions where traditional methods fail
- Requires no prior knowledge of sparsity level or noise variance, making it practical for real-world applications
- Shows consistent performance across different initialization schemes, validating the implicit regularization mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits implicit regularization through overparameterization, where the optimization dynamics naturally promote row sparsity without explicit regularization terms. The Hadamard-product parameterization creates a structure that encourages shared sparsity patterns across multiple measurement vectors, while the gradient descent dynamics drive the solution toward the desired row-sparse structure. The overparameterization acts as a form of implicit bias, where the optimization trajectory is guided by the parameterization structure rather than explicit constraints or penalties.

## Foundational Learning
- Implicit regularization through overparameterization: Why needed - to eliminate explicit tuning parameters; Quick check - verify solution sparsity without regularization terms
- Hadamard-product parameterization: Why needed - to decouple shared row-support from individual entries; Quick check - confirm row sparsity emerges during optimization
- Gradient descent dynamics for structured recovery: Why needed - to leverage optimization trajectory for regularization; Quick check - track convergence behavior and sparsity patterns
- Factorized representation: Why needed - to enable implicit regularization; Quick check - verify that factorization captures shared structure

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input measurements $\mathbf{Y}$ and sensing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ -> Factorization layer (creates $\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{V}$) -> Hadamard-product parameterization ($\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{U} \circ \mathbf{V}$) -> Gradient descent optimization -> Row-sparse output $\mathbf{X}$

Critical path: The factorization layer and Hadamard-product parameterization are critical, as they establish the structure that enables implicit regularization. The gradient descent optimization then exploits this structure to recover the row-sparse solution.

Design tradeoffs: The Hadamard-product parameterization increases parameter count by factorizing the target matrix, but eliminates the need for explicit regularization and tuning. This trade-off favors robustness and simplicity over computational efficiency.

Failure signatures: Non-convergence occurs when initialization is not sufficiently small or balanced. Poor sparsity recovery happens when measurement matrices lack sufficient structure or when noise levels exceed theoretical bounds.

First experiments:
1. Verify convergence with different initialization magnitudes and balance
2. Test sparsity recovery under varying noise levels and SNR conditions
3. Compare performance against baselines with both optimal and random parameter settings
4. Validate the implicit regularization by testing with different factorization schemes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the theoretical understanding of implicit regularization in overparameterized settings, including the role of initialization in convergence guarantees and the extension of analysis to more general sparsity structures beyond row sparsity.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies on specific assumptions about initialization magnitude and balance that may not hold in practice
- Convergence guarantees assume noiseless or low-noise conditions, with limited theoretical framework for high-noise regimes
- Computational inefficiencies may arise from the Hadamard-product parameterization for large-scale problems
- The method is specifically designed for row-sparse structures and may not generalize to other structured sparsity patterns
- Performance depends on the choice of factorization scheme and may require careful selection for different problem domains

## Confidence

High confidence in empirical demonstration of noise robustness and comparison with baselines
Medium confidence in theoretical convergence analysis under stated assumptions
Low confidence in generalization to highly structured sparsity patterns beyond row sparsity

## Next Checks

1. Empirical evaluation of convergence behavior with non-uniform initialization magnitudes to test theoretical assumptions
2. Scalability testing on large-scale problems to quantify computational overhead from the Hadamard-product parameterization
3. Extension of theoretical analysis to high-noise regimes with explicit convergence rate bounds
4. Investigation of alternative factorization schemes and their impact on implicit regularization
5. Testing on problems with different structured sparsity patterns beyond row sparsity
