# Wind Power Scenario Generation based on the Generalized Dynamic Factor Model and Generative Adversarial Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00692
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00692
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: GDFM+GAN method significantly outperforms alternatives, achieving KL divergence < 0.3 for variability distributions and cumulative energy difference of ~0.06% (short periods) to 5.18% (long periods)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a wind power scenario generation method that combines the generalized dynamic factor model (GDFM) and generative adversarial network (GAN). The method addresses the challenge of synthesizing realistic long-term wind power scenarios that capture spatial and temporal correlations, marginal distributions, and ramping behaviors across multiple wind farms. By leveraging the GDFM's ability to model spatial and frequency correlations in the frequency domain and the GAN's strength in generating realistic waveforms and marginal distributions, the proposed approach produces scenarios that closely match actual wind power data. Numerical tests on Australian wind farms demonstrate that the GDFM+GAN method significantly outperforms alternatives, achieving better representation of statistical characteristics, variability, and extreme events.

## Method Summary
The proposed method integrates GDFM and GAN to generate wind power scenarios. First, GDFM decomposes multi-farm wind power data into common factors (shared meteorological drivers) and idiosyncratic components (local conditions) using cross power spectral density analysis and dynamic principal component analysis. The GAN then synthesizes realistic dynamic filter magnitudes in the frequency domain while preserving original phase angles, enabling diverse scenario generation. The combined approach reconstructs new power spectral densities, which are transformed back to time-series via static PCA. The method processes 5-minute resolution data from 20 Australian wind farms, with training on 2012-2016 and validation on 2017 data from AEMO.

## Key Results
- KL divergence for 10-minute variability distributions is less than 0.3
- Cumulative energy difference in power spectral densities is approximately 0.06% for short periods and 5.18% for longer periods
- GDFM+GAN method significantly outperforms competing alternatives in representing statistical characteristics, variability, and extreme events

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The GDFM component captures spatial-temporal correlations by decomposing multi-farm wind power into common and idiosyncratic components in the frequency domain.
- **Mechanism:** Cross power spectral density (CPSD) matrices are computed from historical data, then decomposed via dynamic principal component analysis (DPCA). The q largest eigenvalues define the common component (shared meteorological drivers), while remaining eigenvalues define idiosyncratic noise (local conditions). Factor loading A(ωm) preserves geographic relationships; dynamic filter B(ωm) captures stochastic co-movements.
- **Core assumption:** Wind power signals admit a low-dimensional latent structure where a small number q of dynamic factors explain most cross-farm covariance at each frequency.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "The generalized dynamic factor model (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density analysis"; [Section II.A-B] Equations (5)-(9) formalize CPSD decomposition and dynamic factor extraction
- **Break condition:** If eigenvalue spectrum does not exhibit clear separation between large (common) and small (idiosyncratic) eigenvalues, the q-selection becomes arbitrary and spatial correlation fidelity degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The GAN synthesizes realistic dynamic filter magnitudes that preserve temporal waveform structure while enabling diverse scenario generation.
- **Mechanism:** The GAN generator G(z) produces magnitude matrices Ĝ(z) from Gaussian noise; these are combined with preserved phase angles ∠B(ωm) from the original filter to form synthesized filter B̂(ωm). The discriminator distinguishes synthesized vs. original filters, driving adversarial improvement. Phase preservation maintains temporal alignment; magnitude synthesis enables diverse outputs.
- **Core assumption:** The phase of B(ωm) encodes sufficient temporal structure that synthesizing only magnitudes yields realistic waveforms.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "we use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal information from the observation data"; [Section III.B] Equation (24): B̂(ωm) = Ĝ(z)∠B(ωm)
- **Break condition:** If magnitude-phase coupling is stronger than assumed, fixed phases with synthesized magnitudes produce physically implausible spectral densities or temporal artifacts.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Combining GDFM and GAN yields complementary coverage—GDFM provides spectral/spatial fidelity; GAN provides marginal distribution and waveform realism.
- **Mechanism:** GDFM's factor loading A(ωm) is reused (geographic relationships are intrinsic). GAN-synthesized B̂(ωm) introduces controlled randomness. New CPSD Ŝχ = A·B̂·SX is reconstructed, inverse Fourier transformed to covariance, then converted to time-series via static PCA. The idiosyncratic component can be retained from data or synthesized.
- **Core assumption:** Factor loading A(ωm) remains valid for future scenarios (stationary geographic relationships); only dynamic factors need resynthesis.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated performance improvements over competing alternatives"; [Section V.D] Table II: KL divergence < 0.3 for variability distributions
- **Break condition:** If A(ωm) drifts over time (e.g., due to climate pattern shifts or new wind farm placements), reuse without re-estimation introduces systematic bias.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cross Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**
  - **Why needed here:** CPSD is the fundamental representation from which GDFM extracts all structure; understanding frequency-domain correlation is essential for debugging spectral decomposition.
  - **Quick check question:** Given two wind farm signals, can you explain why their CPSD contains both magnitude (shared power) and phase (timing relationship) information?

- **Concept: Dynamic vs. Static Factor Models**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses dynamic factors (frequency-domain) with static PCA for final time-series extraction; distinguishing these prevents confusion about which decomposition operates where.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the GDFM perform DPCA at each frequency separately rather than applying SPCA once on the covariance matrix?

- **Concept: GAN Training Dynamics (Min-Max Objective)**
  - **Why needed here:** The GAN's role in synthesizing B(ωm) relies on adversarial convergence; understanding mode collapse and discriminator saturation helps diagnose training failures.
  - **Quick check question:** If the discriminator achieves 100% accuracy early in training, what happens to generator gradients, and how might this manifest in synthesized filters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Historical wind power matrix X -> Preprocess (detrend/normalize) -> GDFM Frontend (CPSD -> DPCA -> A(ωm), B(ωm), f(ωm)) -> GAN Module (G(z) -> Ĝ(z) -> B̂(ωm) = Ĝ(z)∠B(ωm)) -> Reconstruction (Ŝχ = A·B̂·SX -> inverse FFT -> ŜX -> SPCA -> X̂)

- **Critical path:**
  1. CPSD computation (all downstream analysis depends on spectral quality)
  2. Eigenvalue threshold selection for q (controls common vs. idiosyncratic split)
  3. GAN training on B(ωm) magnitudes (determines scenario diversity and realism)
  4. Phase-magnitude recombination (if misaligned, spectral fidelity degrades)
  5. Inverse transform and SPCA (final time-series extraction)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Higher q captures more common variance but risks overfitting to noise; lower q increases smoothing
  - GAN complexity (layers, training iterations) trades off against mode collapse risk and compute cost
  - Concatenating 10-day GAN outputs (as done for 100-day scenarios) assumes independence at block boundaries—valid for long-term statistics but may miss cross-boundary ramp events

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Synthesized waveforms appear smoothed or lack extreme ramp events -> GAN undertrained or mode-collapsed; check discriminator loss convergence
  - Spatial correlation heatmap shows near-zero off-diagonal values -> q too low or CPSD decomposition failed; verify eigenvalue spectrum
  - PSD of synthesized scenarios deviates significantly from actual at high frequencies -> phase-magnitude mismatch; inspect ∠B(ωm) preservation

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline reproduction:** Implement GDFM-only scenario generation on a 2-farm subset; verify CPSD decomposition and spatial correlation match Fig. 8 patterns before adding GAN complexity.
  2. **GAN ablation:** Train GAN on B(ωm) magnitudes with fixed phases; visualize synthesized filter magnitudes vs. original to confirm distributional similarity before full integration.
  3. **KL divergence validation:** Generate 100 scenarios via GDFM+GAN; compute KL divergence for 10-min, 30-min, 1-hour variability distributions; target < 0.3 as reported in Table II. If exceeded, iterate on q-selection or GAN architecture.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can integrating alternative conditional generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or diffusion models, with the GDFM framework enhance training stability and mode coverage compared to the GAN-based approach?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion states: "Future work will explore integrating alternative conditional generative models—such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and diffusion models—with the GDFM framework."
  - **Why unresolved:** While the current GDFM+GAN method is effective, GANs are prone to mode collapse and training instability. VAEs and diffusion models offer different trade-offs regarding computational cost and stability that have not yet been tested within this specific hybrid architecture.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study measuring the statistical fidelity, training convergence speed, and diversity of scenarios generated by GDFM-VAE and GDFM-Diffusion models against the proposed GDFM+GAN.

- **Open Question 2:** Does the GDFM+GAN framework maintain its performance when applied to diverse geographic regions and offshore wind farms, which exhibit different spatial correlation patterns than the onshore Australian farms tested?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion explicitly notes: "Future studies will extend our analysis to include diverse geographic regions and wind farms of various scales (e.g., onshore and offshore)..."
  - **Why unresolved:** The numerical tests in the paper are restricted to specific Australian wind farms. Offshore wind patterns and farms in different climatic regions possess distinct spectral densities and spatial correlations that may challenge the current model's parameter settings or filter extraction assumptions.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful application of the model to offshore wind datasets and geographically distinct regions, demonstrating that the spatial-temporal correlations and ramping characteristics are preserved without significant re-tuning of the GDFM structure.

- **Open Question 3:** How can the relationship between the synthesized magnitude Ĝ(z) and the phase angle ∠B(ωm) be modeled to eliminate the discrepancies observed in high-frequency spectral densities?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section V.E (Power Spectral Density Validation) notes a discrepancy in high frequencies (periods < 20 minutes) because the model synthesizes the filter magnitude but reuses observed phase angles, admitting, "we do not have a model for the relationship between Ĝ(z) and ∠B(ωm)."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current method treats the phase angle as a static property derived from historical data, independent of the newly synthesized magnitude. This mismatch creates inaccuracies in the generated power spectral densities at short time scales.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Developing a learning mechanism (e.g., a sub-network) that predicts phase angles conditioned on the generated magnitude, resulting in a generated PSD that matches the actual data's high-frequency fluctuations more closely.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks detailed GAN architecture specifications (layer sizes, activation functions, learning rates) and exact DPCA parameter choices (number of dynamic factors q, eigenvalue thresholding criteria)
- Performance metrics lack statistical significance testing and comparison against baseline uncertainty bounds
- Validation relies on single-year out-of-sample testing without cross-validation or sensitivity analysis to parameter choices

## Confidence
- **GDFM+GAN approach:** Medium - mathematically sound framework with promising numerical results, but lacking detailed implementation specifications
- **Individual GDFM component:**
