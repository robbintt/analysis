# Forecasting Clinical Risk from Textual Time Series: Structuring Narratives for Temporal AI in Healthcare

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.10340
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10340
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Encoder models outperform decoders in clinical event forecasting, with BioClinical-ModernBERT achieving F1 0.879 and concordance 0.677.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for forecasting clinical risk from unstructured textual narratives by transforming case reports into structured temporal representations. Using a hybrid LLM-assisted pipeline, the authors extract timestamped clinical findings and evaluate diverse models—including fine-tuned and prompted decoders, and encoder-based transformers—on tasks like event prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Encoder models consistently outperform decoders in event forecasting, with BioClinical-ModernBERT achieving the highest F1 (0.879) and concordance (0.677). For survival analysis, instruction-tuned decoders like Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct perform best, reaching 0.76 c-index at 168 hours. Sensitivity analyses show that temporal ordering improves temporal reasoning, while event classification is more sensitive to missing historical context than event ranking. The study highlights that domain-specific pretraining enhances generalization and that no single model dominates across all tasks. Overall, the work provides a replicable framework for temporal clinical forecasting, demonstrating that LLM-derived time series can capture clinically relevant patterns, though additional validation on real-time clinical data is needed for deployment.

## Method Summary
The study uses PubMed Open Access case reports filtered for sepsis-related critical care cases, applying LLM extraction to create timestamped clinical event sequences. Three forecasting tasks are evaluated: event occurrence prediction (binary classification), temporal ordering (ranking events by time), and survival analysis (time-to-mortality). Five modeling paradigms are tested: fine-tuned decoder LLMs with MLP heads, zero/few-shot prompting, fine-tuned encoder models with MLP heads, and encoder masking approaches. Models are trained on serialized `[CLS] t1:e1 [SEP] t2:e2 [SEP]...` sequences with AdamW optimization and evaluated using F1 scores, concordance indices, and time-dependent c-index metrics.

## Key Results
- BioClinical-ModernBERT achieves highest F1 (0.879) and concordance (0.677) for event forecasting
- Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct performs best in survival analysis with 0.76 c-index at 168 hours
- Temporal ordering improves concordance for ranking tasks but text-ordering sometimes yields better classification F1
- Domain-specific pretraining provides crucial generalization benefits across external datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Converting unstructured narratives into chronological (event, time) tuples reduces temporal leakage and aligns input structure with forecasting logic. Clinical narratives often interleave retrospective commentary with current findings (text-order ≠ time-order). The proposed pipeline (Regex + LLM extraction) flattens this into a strictly time-ordered sequence, forcing the model to rely only on past events relative to the prediction cutoff t. Core assumption: The LLM-based annotator can accurately resolve relative timestamps into absolute hourly integers relative to admission. Evidence: "...timestamped clinical findings... minimize causal leakage by restricting input to past events." Break condition: If the extraction LLM fails to resolve vague temporal expressions, the time-series ordering collapses, potentially introducing noise rather than signal.

### Mechanism 2
Encoder-based models (e.g., BioClinical-ModernBERT) outperform decoder LLMs on short-horizon event forecasting due to bidirectional context aggregation over dense event sequences. Encoders use a `[CLS]` token to attend to all historical events simultaneously, capturing local co-occurrence patterns effectively. In contrast, decoders process autoregressively (left-to-right), which aligns with text generation but introduces directional bias unsuitable for temporal ranking unless explicitly retrained. Core assumption: The prognostic signal relies more on the "bag of historical events" context than long-range sequential dependencies for short-term windows (1h–24h). Evidence: "Encoder models, especially those with a fine-tuned MLP head, achieve substantially higher F1 scores than decoder LLMs." Break condition: If the event history exceeds the encoder's context window, truncation may lose critical early signals, potentially favoring long-context decoders.

### Mechanism 3
Domain-specific pretraining provides robustness to distribution shift, which is critical for generalizing from case reports (training) to external validation sets. Models like BioClinical-ModernBERT have prior exposure to clinical terminology and event relationships. This prior acts as a regularizer, stabilizing performance when the input distribution changes (e.g., from PMOA case reports to the sepsis-100 subset). Core assumption: The specialized pretraining corpus sufficiently overlaps with the vocabulary and semantics of the target Sepsis-3 reports. Evidence: "...biomedical pretraining provides crucial benefits for real-world deployment... BioClinical-ModernBERT variants show the smallest performance degradation on external datasets." Break condition: If the target domain involves novel clinical jargon or languages not present in the pretraining corpus, the generalization advantage may diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Temporal Leakage vs. Causal Validity**
  - Why needed here: Standard LLMs process text as it appears. In clinical notes, "outcome" often appears early (e.g., "Patient presented with sepsis and later died"). Without reordering, models "cheat" by seeing the future.
  - Quick check question: If you feed a discharge summary into a standard LLM to predict mortality, is it predicting or reading the conclusion?

- **Concept: Time-Ordered vs. Text-Ordered Representations**
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates that the order of tokens matters. Text-order reflects narrative style; Time-order reflects clinical causality. Different tasks (ranking vs. classification) prefer different orderings.
  - Quick check question: Does sorting a patient's history by timestamp help the model understand when to intervene, or just what happened?

- **Concept: Encoder (Bidirectional) vs. Decoder (Autoregressive) Attention**
  - Why needed here: This architectural difference explains why no single model dominates. Encoders see the whole history at once (better for classification); Decoders generate forward (better for long-horizon survival simulation).
  - Quick check question: Why would a model that predicts the next word (Decoder) struggle to rank the order of three future distinct medical events compared to a model that looks at everything simultaneously (Encoder)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Case Report (Text) -> LLM/Regex Pipeline -> List of `(Event String, Time Integer)` -> Flatten to `[CLS] t1:e1 [SEP] t2:e2 [SEP]...` -> Encoder (ModernBERT) or Decoder (Llama) -> MLP Head (Classification/Regression) or Masking (Cloze task)

- **Critical path:** The Extraction Pipeline. If the timestamps are noisy, the "Textual Time Series" is misaligned, and the forecasting model learns garbage. The quality of the "Bronze Standard" (sepsis-100) validation is the ground truth.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - MLP Head vs. Masking: MLP heads maximize F1 (Accuracy); Fine-tuned Masking maximizes Concordance (Ranking)
  - Encoder vs. Decoder: Use Encoders for short-term risk prediction (1-24h); Use Instruction-Tuned Decoders for long-term survival analysis (168h+)
  - Data Order: Use Time-ordered data for training if temporal reasoning is the goal; Text-ordered might generalize better to messy raw notes in some contexts

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Random-level F1 at 1h: Indicates the model cannot handle short-horizon signals (common in generic BERT or weak decoders)
  - High F1 but Low Concordance: Model predicts "events will happen" but fails to order them (implies lack of temporal reasoning)
  - Performance Collapse on External Sets: Suggests overfitting to the narrative style of the training corpus (PMOA) rather than learning clinical patterns

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run `BioClinical-ModernBERT-base` (Encoder) vs. `Llama-3.1-8B` (Decoder) on the T2S2 test set for the "Next 24h" prediction task. Verify that Encoder F1 > Decoder F1.
  2. Train the best Encoder on *Text-Ordered* vs. *Time-Ordered* sequences. Measure the delta in Concordance Index (c-index) to quantify the value of explicit temporal structuring.
  3. Apply Timestep Dropout (mask 50% of history) to the input. Observe if Concordance remains stable while F1 drops, confirming that ranking is more robust to missing history than binary classification.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Does the forecasting framework generalize from retrospective case reports to routine clinical documentation, such as MIMIC-IV discharge summaries?
  - Basis in paper: Explicit (Limitations and Future Directions: "generalizability to real-world health-system text may be limited... future work planned on... MIMIC-IV discharge summaries")
  - Why unresolved: The current study relies on PubMed case reports which highlight rare or atypical presentations, creating a potential distribution shift from routine clinical notes
  - What evidence would resolve it: Direct evaluation of the pipeline on large-scale EHR datasets like MIMIC-IV to measure performance retention

- **Question:** Can the framework demonstrate measurable improvements in patient outcomes when validated in real-time clinical deployment?
  - Basis in paper: Explicit (Discussion and Conclusion: "Additional work would be required to validate performance on real-time clinical data and demonstrate measurable impact on patient outcomes in deployment.")
  - Why unresolved: The study establishes technical feasibility using historical text, but real-time deployment involves latency constraints and integration into clinical workflows that remain untested
  - What evidence would resolve it: Prospective trials assessing whether the system improves clinical decision-making and reduces sepsis mortality in a live hospital setting

- **Question:** Is the textual time series approach robust across broader diagnostic categories beyond sepsis?
  - Basis in paper: Explicit (Limitations and Future Directions: "our framework is fundamentally disease-agnostic... future work planned on broader diagnostic categories")
  - Why unresolved: The current benchmark is restricted to sepsis-3 patients; temporal patterns and documentation styles may differ significantly in other medical conditions
  - What evidence would resolve it: Application of the extraction and forecasting pipeline to the 125K+ PMOA case reports spanning other diagnostic conditions

## Limitations

- The extraction pipeline's reliability across diverse clinical narratives remains unclear despite validation against sepsis-100 gold standards
- The claim that temporal ordering universally improves performance is nuanced—text-order can outperform for classification tasks
- Encoder models' superiority for short-horizon tasks assumes the event history fits within context windows, which may not hold for extended patient stays

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Encoder models consistently outperform decoders for event forecasting (F1 0.879 vs. lower scores), and BioClinical-ModernBERT shows best generalization to external datasets
- **Medium Confidence:** The survival analysis results (Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct achieving 0.76 c-index) are promising but rely on instruction-tuned decoders, which weren't evaluated for the other tasks
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that no single model dominates across all tasks, while supported, doesn't fully account for potential ensemble approaches that might combine strengths

## Next Checks

1. **Extraction Reliability Test:** Re-run the LLM extraction pipeline on sepsis-100 with different annotator models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and measure inter-annotator agreement on (event, time) tuples to establish extraction consistency

2. **Context Window Stress Test:** Evaluate encoder performance on progressively longer patient histories (e.g., truncate to 50, 100, 200 events) to identify the breakpoint where decoders might outperform due to superior long-context handling

3. **Ensemble Validation:** Train a simple ensemble combining the top encoder (BioClinical-ModernBERT) and decoder (Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) to test whether hybrid approaches can achieve state-of-the-art across all three task types simultaneously
