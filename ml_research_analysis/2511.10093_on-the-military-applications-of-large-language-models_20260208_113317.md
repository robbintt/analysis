# On the Military Applications of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.10093
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10093
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Commercial cloud services like Azure OpenAI enable rapid deployment of military NLP applications, but operational reliability and security concerns remain significant barriers to adoption.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates military applications of large language models (LLMs) by interrogating Microsoft Copilot for potential use cases and assessing the feasibility of implementing them using commercial cloud services like Microsoft Azure. The study identifies promising applications in summarization, data analysis, document generation, and decision support, while highlighting concerns around operational reliability, security, and accessibility in military contexts. Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Language services offer straightforward implementation pathways, but cloud dependency poses challenges for field operations and data security. The authors conclude that while COTC services enable rapid deployment of many NLP capabilities, significant development and security considerations remain for real-world military adoption.

## Method Summary
The study employed interrogation of Microsoft Copilot (GPT-4 Turbo) to identify potential military NLP applications and assess implementation feasibility using Azure cloud services. The approach involved prompting Copilot with specific military use cases, analyzing responses for technical viability, and evaluating Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Language features for implementation. The evaluation focused on summarization, report generation, and data fusion capabilities using general military texts without specifying exact documents or providing quantitative metrics.

## Key Results
- Summarization and text generation capabilities are the most directly applicable LLM functions for military use cases
- Azure OpenAI Service provides straightforward implementation via REST API, with fine-tuning and RAG support available
- Operational reliability, security concerns, and cloud dependency present significant barriers to military adoption

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Summarization and text generation capabilities are the most directly applicable LLM functions for military use cases.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained transformer models generate coherent summaries and documents by predicting likely next tokens based on learned patterns from massive text corpora. The paper identifies summarization as a core strength because it aligns directly with NLP tasks the models were trained on.
- Core assumption: The input documents follow patterns similar to the model's training distribution, and quality can be maintained through prompt engineering and human oversight.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We conclude that the summarization and generative properties of language models directly facilitate many applications at large and other features may find particular uses."
  - [Section III.A]: "The very reasonable result given by the LLM suggests that we were at the core of LLM abilities, namely NLP tasks."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus support; neighbor papers focus on other ML domains (object detection, sentiment analysis, suicide prevention) rather than summarization specifically.
- Break condition: Input documents contain highly specialized jargon, classified terminology, or formats not represented in training data, causing degradation in summary quality or introduction of hallucinations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables integration of proprietary military data without requiring full model retraining.
- Mechanism: User queries first retrieve relevant documents from a search index containing custom data; retrieved excerpts are combined with the query into an augmented prompt. The LLM generates responses grounded in this external context rather than relying solely on pre-trained knowledge.
- Core assumption: The retrieval system surfaces sufficiently relevant documents, and the combined context fits within the model's context window.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section IV.A.1]: "In RAG architectures, the user input, e.g., a question or request, is first send to an information retrieval system that contains the custom, proprietary data in a search index and returns relevant search results that are then combined with the user input into the actual prompt given to the LLM."
  - [Section III.D]: Copilot suggested RAG as a technique to prevent hallucinations in military use.
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus support for RAG specifically in military contexts found in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: Retrieval fails to surface relevant documents, context window is exceeded by large document sets, or retrieved content introduces conflicting information that degrades response quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning with supervised learning can adapt base models to military-specific tasks and terminology.
- Mechanism: Low-rank approximation (LoRA) fine-tuning adjusts a small subset of model parameters using labeled input-output pairs representing desired military task behavior. The customized model is then deployed like a base model via API.
- Core assumption: Sufficient labeled training data exists for the target military task, and the fine-tuning process does not introduce unwanted behaviors or catastrophic forgetting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section IV.A.2]: "With regional limitations, Azure OpenAI supports (un)supervised fine-tuning of certain LLMs, which means creating a customized model from a base model by training and validating it with application-specific, proprietary data."
  - [Section IV.A.2]: "Azure OpenAI applies low-rank approximation (LoRA), where only a small, important subset of all parameters is tuned, to reduce complexity."
  - [corpus]: Neighbor paper on suicide prediction in military contexts [arXiv:2505.12220] discusses ML applications requiring domain-specific training but does not address LLM fine-tuning directly.
- Break condition: Training data is insufficient, biased, or contains sensitive information that creates security risks; fine-tuned model exhibits degraded performance on general tasks or introduces task-specific hallucinations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Prompt Engineering**
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes that base models are adapted primarily through skillful prompt construction. Understanding system/user/assistant roles, few-shot learning, and temperature control is essential before attempting any implementation.
  - Quick check question: Can you construct a prompt that includes role designation, task instructions, and example outputs in the correct format for a chat completion API?

- Concept: **Stateless Model Architecture**
  - Why needed here: The paper notes LLMs are inherently stateless—each API call is independent. Application developers must manage conversation history and context externally.
  - Quick check question: If a user asks a follow-up question in a chat session, what must your application include in the next API call to maintain conversation coherence?

- Concept: **Cloud Security and Data Residency**
  - Why needed here: The paper identifies operational security as a critical concern. Understanding deployment regions, data processing locations, and container-based edge deployment options is essential for military applications.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between global, data zone, and regional deployment in Azure OpenAI, and which would be appropriate for processing classified information?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Azure OpenAI Service**: Provides REST API access to GPT-4 base models, fine-tuning capabilities, and inference endpoints. Control plane handles resource management; data planes handle authoring (fine-tuning) and inference (completions).
  - **Azure AI Search**: Stores and indexes proprietary documents for RAG implementations. Returns relevant excerpts based on query similarity.
  - **Azure AI Language**: Offers preconfigured NLP features (NER, PII detection, summarization, sentiment analysis) and customizable features (custom NER, conversational language understanding, question answering). Some features support container-based deployment for disconnected environments.
  - **Application Layer**: Manages prompt construction, conversation history, API orchestration, and output validation.

- Critical path:
  1. Define the specific military NLP task (summarization, entity extraction, question answering, etc.)
  2. Determine whether preconfigured features, base model + prompt engineering, RAG, or fine-tuning is appropriate
  3. Evaluate data security requirements and select deployment region or container option
  4. Develop and test prompts with representative military documents
  5. Implement human-in-the-loop validation for output quality and security

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Base model + prompt engineering vs. fine-tuning**: Prompt engineering is faster and cheaper but limited by context window and pre-trained knowledge. Fine-tuning improves task-specific performance but requires labeled data and increases complexity.
  - **RAG vs. fine-tuning**: RAG is more adaptable for changing data but requires retrieval infrastructure. Fine-tuning embeds knowledge in model weights but requires retraining for data updates.
  - **Cloud vs. edge deployment**: Cloud offers full LLM capabilities but requires connectivity and raises security concerns. Edge containers (available for some Azure AI Language features) work in disconnected environments but cannot run full LLMs due to computational requirements.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Inconsistent outputs**: Same prompt producing different results across sessions indicates temperature settings or underlying model stochasticity. Mitigation: Lower temperature, implement output validation.
  - **Hallucinations**: Model generating plausible but incorrect information. Mitigation: RAG grounding, human oversight, fact-checking systems.
  - **Refusal to process**: Model declining to process certain file formats or content types, as observed with .pdf handling inconsistency in the paper. Mitigation: Pre-processing to standardized formats, multiple retry attempts.
  - **Context window overflow**: Long documents or conversation histories exceeding model limits. Mitigation: Chunking, summarization of prior context, selective context inclusion.
  - **Ethical filter blocking**: Azure services evaluating content for harmful material and blocking training jobs. Mitigation: Procurement-level agreements, content pre-screening.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Summarization baseline test**: Use Azure OpenAI or Azure AI Language to summarize publicly available military field manuals or after-action reports. Measure summary quality, consistency across runs, and hallucination rate. This tests the paper's primary recommended use case.
  2. **RAG prototype with mock sensitive data**: Build a simple RAG system using Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI with a small corpus of simulated military SOPs. Test query accuracy and whether responses remain grounded in retrieved documents. Evaluate whether sensitive query patterns could expose unintended information.
  3. **Container deployment test**: Deploy one Azure AI Language feature (e.g., PII detection or key phrase extraction) in a local Docker container. Verify disconnected operation capability and compare latency/throughput against cloud API. This assesses feasibility for field deployment scenarios.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can operational reliability of LLMs be guaranteed for military applications when models exhibit inconsistent, contradictory, and unpredictable behavior?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that "contradictions riddled some of the conversations" and note that "observed contradictions cannot be explained away by the context window size, hallucination, or bias" and "need to be mitigated for military use to gain traction and credibility."
- Why unresolved: Current LLMs produce inconsistent outputs across identical queries on different days, refuse to correct errors, and display "lazy" behavior—none of which are acceptable in military contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of validated methods for ensuring consistent, deterministic outputs; empirical testing showing reliability rates meeting military standards.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can LLM capabilities be effectively deployed in disconnected or field environments given their computational requirements and current cloud dependency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "currently LLMs consume so massive resources that they require access to regional cloud computing services" and that this "may render LLM-based solutions unfeasible" for field training and actual operations.
- Why unresolved: Local deployment options for LLMs are not yet available; only smaller NLP services can run in containers in disconnected environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of quantized or compressed LLMs running on tactical edge hardware with acceptable latency and accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What architectural solutions can address operational security concerns when proprietary or sensitive military data must be transmitted to commercial cloud services for LLM processing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "all prompts with potentially security-critical information will naturally be posted to the service as clear text" and that RAG and fine-tuning "further opens indirect visibility to a larger private database."
- Why unresolved: The tension between leveraging commercial COTC services and maintaining operational security remains unresolved; private cloud infrastructure comparable to commercial providers is impractical.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validated secure computation protocols, on-premises deployment options for full LLMs, or cryptographic approaches enabling cloud processing without data exposure.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively reduce hallucination and improve factual accuracy for domain-specific military applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention RAG as a potential mitigation strategy but do not validate its effectiveness for reducing hallucinations in military contexts, while identifying hallucination as a critical barrier to adoption.
- Why unresolved: RAG is suggested but not empirically tested for military use cases where factual accuracy is mission-critical.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments measuring hallucination rates with and without RAG on military-specific tasks and data.

## Limitations
- Security and operational reliability assessments are theoretical rather than based on field testing with real military conditions
- Military documents used for testing are not specified, preventing exact reproduction
- Evaluation relied on Copilot interrogation rather than direct implementation and deployment testing

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core claim that summarization and text generation are the most directly applicable LLM functions for military use
- **Medium Confidence**: The feasibility assessment of Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Language services for military deployment
- **Medium Confidence**: The RAG and fine-tuning implementation pathways

## Next Checks
1. **Security Filter Validation**: Test whether Azure OpenAI content filters block legitimate military content (weapons, tactics, operations) and whether adjustment options are available under procurement agreements. Document false positive rates and mitigation strategies.
2. **Disconnection Performance**: Deploy Azure AI Language containers for selected features (PII detection, summarization) in a simulated disconnected environment and measure latency, throughput, and accuracy degradation compared to cloud API performance.
3. **Field Document Testing**: Implement the summarization pipeline with actual military field manuals and after-action reports, measuring consistency across runs, hallucination rates, and sensitivity to military jargon and classification markings.
