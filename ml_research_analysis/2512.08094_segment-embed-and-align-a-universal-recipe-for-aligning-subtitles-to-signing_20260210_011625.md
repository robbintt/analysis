core_contribution: SEA is a training-free, modular approach that segments continuous
  sign language video into signs, embeds signs and subtitles into a shared space,
  and aligns them via dynamic programming. It achieves state-of-the-art alignment
  across four datasets in three sign languages (BSL, ASL, DSGS), outperforming prior
  methods by leveraging pretrained models and language-specific fine-tuning.

# Segment, Embed, and Align: A Universal Recipe for Aligning Subtitles to Signing
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08094
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08094

- Key outcome: Training-free approach achieves state-of-the-art alignment across four datasets in three sign languages

## Executive Summary
SEA presents a modular approach for aligning subtitles to sign language video by segmenting continuous signing into individual signs, embedding both signs and subtitles into a shared space, and aligning them using dynamic programming. The method leverages pretrained models and is training-free, enabling rapid deployment across different sign languages. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on alignment tasks across four datasets covering British Sign Language (BSL), American Sign Language (ASL), and Deutsche Gebärdensprache (DSGS).

## Method Summary
The SEA approach consists of three main stages: segmentation, embedding, and alignment. First, continuous sign language video is segmented into individual signs using a pretrained sign segmentation model. Second, both the segmented signs and corresponding subtitles are embedded into a shared vector space using language-specific models. Finally, dynamic programming is used to align the embedded sign and subtitle sequences based on their similarity in the shared space. The entire pipeline is training-free, relying on pretrained models and language-specific fine-tuning where necessary.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art alignment performance across four datasets in three sign languages
- Demonstrates strong generalization capability across BSL, ASL, and DSGS without language-specific training
- Provides a fast and general solution for creating parallel sign language datasets for downstream applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by breaking down the alignment problem into three modular components that can be addressed independently. The segmentation module isolates individual signs from continuous signing, the embedding module creates comparable representations for signs and text in a shared space, and the alignment module finds the optimal correspondence between these representations. This decomposition allows each component to leverage specialized pretrained models while maintaining flexibility to adapt to different sign languages through component substitution.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sign language segmentation**: Required to identify individual signs within continuous signing; quick check: evaluate segmentation accuracy on continuous signing sequences
- **Cross-modal embedding**: Needed to create comparable representations for signs and text; quick check: measure embedding similarity between aligned and misaligned pairs
- **Dynamic programming alignment**: Used to find optimal alignment between sign and subtitle sequences; quick check: test alignment accuracy against ground truth alignments
- **Pretrained model adaptation**: Critical for leveraging existing models in new sign languages; quick check: assess performance when substituting different pretrained models
- **Language-specific fine-tuning**: Necessary for adapting the approach to different sign languages; quick check: compare performance with and without fine-tuning

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Video Input -> Sign Segmentation -> Sign Embedding -> Subtitle Embedding -> Dynamic Programming Alignment -> Aligned Output
**Critical Path**: The embedding space quality is the critical path, as poor embeddings will cascade through to alignment quality regardless of segmentation or alignment method
**Design Tradeoffs**: Training-free design enables rapid deployment but depends heavily on pretrained model quality; modularity allows component substitution but requires careful integration
**Failure Signatures**: Poor segmentation leads to fragmented signs; poor embeddings result in misaligned sequences; incorrect dynamic programming parameters cause suboptimal alignments
**First Experiments**: 1) Test segmentation accuracy on continuous signing sequences; 2) Evaluate embedding similarity between aligned and misaligned pairs; 3) Measure alignment accuracy against ground truth alignments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Heavy dependence on pretrained model quality and availability, particularly for low-resource sign languages
- Limited generalization to sign languages with different signing patterns or emotional expressiveness
- Potential performance degradation when substituting components with less sophisticated alternatives

## Confidence
- High confidence in segmentation and embedding methodology as they are well-established components
- Medium confidence in alignment component due to dependence on embedding space quality
- Medium confidence in cross-language generalization based on limited language coverage (3 sign languages)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SEA's performance on additional sign languages with varying resource availability and signing styles to assess generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine individual contributions of each component to overall performance
3. Test the approach's robustness to variations in video quality, signer characteristics, and background conditions
