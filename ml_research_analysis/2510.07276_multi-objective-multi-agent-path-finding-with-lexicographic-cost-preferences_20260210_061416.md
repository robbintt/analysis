# Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding with Lexicographic Cost Preferences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07276
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07276
- Authors: Pulkit Rustagi; Kyle Hollins Wray; Sandhya Saisubramanian
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Introduces LCBS, the first algorithm to solve 10-objective MO-MAPF instances

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding (MO-MAPF), where agents must navigate to their goals while optimizing multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously. The authors propose a lexicographic framework that allows users to specify preferences over objectives, replacing the computational burden of constructing Pareto frontiers with a more scalable approach. They introduce Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search (LCBS), which leverages lexicographic A* search to directly compute solutions aligned with user-defined preferences, achieving significant improvements in success rates and scalability.

## Method Summary
The paper presents LCBS, an algorithm that extends Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for MO-MAPF by incorporating lexicographic preferences. Instead of maintaining Pareto-optimal solutions at each node, LCBS uses lexicographic A* as its low-level planner, which optimizes objectives sequentially by priority. The high-level CBS framework handles conflicts between agents, while the low-level lexicographic A* ensures each agent's path is optimal with respect to the lexicographically ordered objectives. This approach scales linearly with the number of objectives and avoids the exponential blowup associated with traditional Pareto-based methods.

## Key Results
- LCBS achieves higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines, especially as the number of objectives increases
- LCBS is the only method that successfully solves instances with up to ten objectives
- Evaluations on standard and randomized benchmarks confirm lexicographic optimality of LCBS solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LCBS works by replacing the Pareto-optimal search at each CBS node with lexicographic A*, which directly optimizes objectives according to user preferences. This eliminates the need to construct and maintain large Pareto frontiers, reducing computational overhead. The lexicographic ordering ensures that higher-priority objectives are optimized first, with lower-priority objectives considered only when higher ones are equal. This hierarchical approach makes the search more tractable while still respecting user preferences, allowing the algorithm to scale to problems with many objectives.

## Foundational Learning

**Conflict-Based Search (CBS)**: A two-level search algorithm for MAPF that separates pathfinding (low-level) from conflict resolution (high-level). Why needed: CBS provides the framework for handling multi-agent conflicts without centralized search. Quick check: Understand how CBS uses individual agent searches and conflict constraints.

**Lexicographic Optimization**: A method of ordering objectives by priority, optimizing higher-priority objectives before considering lower ones. Why needed: Enables scalable multi-objective optimization by reducing the solution space. Quick check: Verify that lexicographic ordering produces consistent preference-based solutions.

**Pareto Optimality**: A solution is Pareto optimal if no objective can be improved without worsening another. Why needed: Traditional MO-MAPF approaches rely on Pareto frontiers, which become intractable with many objectives. Quick check: Understand the computational complexity of maintaining Pareto sets.

**Multi-Objective Pathfinding**: Extension of single-objective pathfinding to optimize multiple conflicting criteria simultaneously. Why needed: Real-world scenarios often involve trade-offs between different path quality metrics. Quick check: Identify common objective combinations in practical applications.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: CBS High-Level -> Lexicographic A* Low-Level -> Path Validation

**Critical Path**: Agent path computation → Conflict detection → Constraint addition → Re-planning → Solution validation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritizes scalability over finding all Pareto-optimal solutions; sacrifices completeness of the Pareto frontier for computational efficiency

**Failure Signatures**: High conflict density can cause exponential growth in constraints; lexicographic ordering may miss non-dominated solutions that users might prefer

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify lexicographic A* correctly orders solutions by priority 2) Test CBS with lexicographic A* on simple 2-agent, 2-objective problems 3) Measure scalability by gradually increasing number of objectives

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Claims about LCBS being the only algorithm capable of solving 10-objective instances are limited to specific benchmark sets
- Linear scalability with respect to number of objectives is asserted but not rigorously proven across diverse problem classes
- Evaluation focuses on solution existence and success rates but lacks extensive analysis of solution quality metrics like makespan or total cost

## Confidence
- Lexicographic optimality of LCBS solutions: High
- Linear scalability with number of objectives: Medium
- LCBS is the only method solving 10-objective instances: Medium
- Success rate improvements over baselines: High

## Next Checks
1. Test LCBS on a wider range of benchmark instances, including those outside standard MAPF datasets, to verify generalizability
2. Compare lexicographic A* against other possible low-level planners within LCBS to assess the impact on performance and solution quality
3. Analyze solution makespan and total cost distributions to understand the trade-offs of lexicographic optimization versus other multi-objective approaches
