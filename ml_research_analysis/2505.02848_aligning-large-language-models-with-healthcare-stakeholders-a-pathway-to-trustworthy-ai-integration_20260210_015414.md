# Aligning Large Language Models with Healthcare Stakeholders: A Pathway to Trustworthy AI Integration

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02848

- This review highlights the critical need to align large language models (LLMs) with healthcare stakeholder preferences to enable safe, effective, and responsible integration into clinical workflows.

## Executive Summary
This review examines the essential requirement for aligning large language models with healthcare stakeholder preferences to ensure safe and effective integration into clinical environments. The paper emphasizes that human involvement throughout the entire LLM development lifecycle - from data curation through inference - is fundamental to achieving this alignment. The review provides a comprehensive analysis of current techniques, applications, challenges, and future directions for building trustworthy human-LLM collaboration in healthcare settings.

## Method Summary
The review employs a narrative synthesis approach to examine LLM alignment in healthcare, drawing from existing literature across multiple domains. The analysis covers domain-specific pretraining, instruction-based alignment, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and prompt engineering techniques. The methodology involves categorizing applications across clinical workflows, patient care, medical education, and healthcare payers, while identifying key challenges including linguistic generalizability, cost-efficient alignment, hallucination mitigation, and regulatory frameworks. The review synthesizes these elements to provide a comprehensive outlook on building trustworthy human-LLM collaboration in healthcare.

## Key Results
- Human involvement throughout LLM development lifecycle is essential for stakeholder alignment
- Domain-specific pretraining and instruction-based alignment techniques enhance healthcare task performance
- Comprehensive applications exist across clinical workflows, patient care, medical education, and healthcare payers
- Critical challenges include linguistic generalizability, cost-efficient alignment, hallucination mitigation, and regulatory frameworks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The alignment of LLMs with healthcare stakeholders works through multi-layered human involvement that ensures models reflect clinical realities, ethical standards, and practical workflow requirements. This mechanism operates by incorporating stakeholder preferences at each development stage, from training data selection that captures domain-specific terminology and clinical contexts, through alignment techniques that teach models to follow healthcare-specific instructions and preferences, to inference-time interventions that maintain accuracy and safety. The human-in-the-loop approach creates feedback loops that continuously refine model behavior, while techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning and RLHF provide structured ways to incorporate clinical reasoning and stakeholder values into model outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- Domain-specific pretraining: Needed because general LLMs lack healthcare terminology and clinical context understanding; quick check involves evaluating model performance on healthcare-specific benchmarks
- Instruction-based alignment: Required to teach models healthcare-specific task completion and response formats; quick check involves testing model compliance with healthcare instruction sets
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback: Essential for capturing nuanced stakeholder preferences and clinical safety considerations; quick check involves measuring improvement in human preference scores
- Prompt engineering techniques: Necessary for guiding model reasoning through complex clinical scenarios; quick check involves comparing performance with and without structured prompts
- Regulatory framework understanding: Required to ensure compliance with healthcare standards and legal requirements; quick check involves mapping model capabilities to regulatory requirements
- Hallucination mitigation strategies: Critical for maintaining clinical accuracy and patient safety; quick check involves measuring hallucination rates in healthcare-specific scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data Curation -> Model Training -> Alignment Techniques -> Inference -> Stakeholder Feedback
Critical path: Human-in-the-loop development process that integrates stakeholder preferences at every stage
Design tradeoffs: Balancing model performance with safety requirements, computational efficiency with alignment quality, and general capabilities with domain specificity
Failure signatures: Hallucinations in clinical outputs, misalignment with stakeholder preferences, inability to handle domain-specific terminology, regulatory non-compliance
First experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline LLM performance on healthcare-specific tasks without alignment
2. Test domain-specific pretraining impact on clinical terminology understanding
3. Measure RLHF effectiveness in improving stakeholder preference alignment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis is primarily conceptual rather than based on systematic empirical evaluation
- Many techniques lack rigorous validation specifically within healthcare contexts
- Discussion of regulatory frameworks remains largely theoretical without specific compliance pathways

## Confidence
High for the general premise that stakeholder alignment is necessary for trustworthy healthcare AI integration
Medium for the identified techniques and applications, as these are well-established in the broader AI literature
Low for specific claims about implementation effectiveness and clinical impact due to lack of empirical healthcare-specific validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic reviews of published studies evaluating LLM performance in actual healthcare workflows with measurable clinical outcomes
2. Perform cost-benefit analyses of different alignment approaches specifically in healthcare settings
3. Develop and test standardized evaluation frameworks for healthcare LLM safety, accuracy, and stakeholder satisfaction
