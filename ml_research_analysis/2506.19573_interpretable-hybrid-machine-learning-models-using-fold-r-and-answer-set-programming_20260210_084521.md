# Interpretable Hybrid Machine Learning Models Using FOLD-R++ and Answer Set Programming

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.19573
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19573
- Reference count: 2
- Key outcome: Hybrid ML-ASP model improves accuracy (e.g., SVM from 72.6% to 94.0% on Autism dataset, p<10^-10) while providing interpretable explanations.

## Executive Summary
This study proposes a hybrid classification model that combines black-box machine learning classifiers with interpretable Answer Set Programming (ASP) rules induced by the FOLD-R++ algorithm. The method uses ASP rules to correct uncertain ML predictions and provide human-readable explanations, particularly when ML models perform suboptimally. Experiments on five medical datasets demonstrate statistically significant accuracy improvements and F1 score gains, with the hybrid approach showing particular effectiveness on challenging datasets where standard ML models struggle. The approach preserves ML model integrity while adding interpretability through transparent rule-based explanations aligned with domain knowledge.

## Method Summary
The hybrid model trains standard ML classifiers (RF, SVM, KNN, MLP) and FOLD-R++ separately on the same training data. At inference, predictions are made using ML models with confidence scores via predict_proba; if confidence exceeds 0.6, the ML prediction is used, otherwise the ASP prediction is used. The FOLD-R++ algorithm generates human-readable rules that can correct uncertain ML predictions and provide explanations through proof trees. The approach uses stratified 80-20 train-test splits with 10 experiments per model-dataset combination using varying random seeds to ensure robustness.

## Key Results
- Hybrid model achieved statistically significant accuracy improvements across all five medical datasets
- SVM accuracy increased from 72.6% to 94.0% on Autism Screening dataset (p<10^-10)
- F1 score gains were observed across multiple datasets, particularly when ML models performed poorly
- The hybrid approach is particularly effective when ML models perform suboptimally

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach leverages the complementary strengths of ML and symbolic reasoning: ML models excel at capturing complex patterns but lack interpretability, while ASP rules provide transparent decision logic but may not capture all patterns. By using ML for high-confidence predictions and ASP rules for uncertain cases, the system achieves both high accuracy and interpretability. The 0.6 confidence threshold acts as a switch that routes predictions to the most appropriate component based on certainty.

## Foundational Learning
- **FOLD-R++ algorithm**: Inductive logic programming method that generates human-readable rules from data; needed to create interpretable rules from training data; quick check: verify rule coverage and quality on validation set.
- **Answer Set Programming (ASP)**: Declarative logic programming paradigm for knowledge representation and reasoning; needed to encode and execute interpretable rules; quick check: test rule consistency and correctness with Clingo.
- **Confidence threshold calibration**: Heuristic threshold (0.6) determining when to use ML vs ASP predictions; needed to balance accuracy and interpretability; quick check: evaluate performance across different threshold values.
- **Hybrid inference strategy**: ML-first approach with ASP fallback for low-confidence predictions; needed to maximize accuracy while providing explanations; quick check: monitor prediction routing statistics across confidence levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data -> Preprocessing -> ML Training -> ASP Rule Induction -> Hybrid Inference Engine -> Prediction + Explanation

**Critical Path:**
Preprocessing → ML Training → Confidence Calculation → Rule-based Correction (if needed) → Final Prediction

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Fixed 0.6 threshold vs. adaptive threshold selection (overfitting concerns)
- Rule coverage vs. rule complexity and interpretability
- ML accuracy vs. ASP correction capability
- Computational overhead of ASP solving vs. interpretability benefits

**Failure Signatures:**
- Rule variability across different train-test splits
- Performance degradation when ASP overrides correct high-confidence ML predictions
- Scalability issues with Clingo on larger datasets
- Overfitting of rules to training data

**First Experiments:**
1. Test hybrid model with varying confidence thresholds (0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8) to find optimal trade-offs
2. Run FOLD-R++ multiple times on same dataset to quantify rule stability and consistency
3. Measure inference time and rule coverage on datasets with 10K+ instances to identify scalability bottlenecks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the computational overhead of ASP solvers like Clingo be reduced for larger and more complex datasets?
- Can dynamic or adaptive confidence threshold selection methods outperform the fixed 0.6 threshold without overfitting to training data?
- How do domain experts evaluate the clinical utility and interpretability of the ASP-generated explanations in real-world decision-making contexts?
- How can the variability and sensitivity of FOLD-R++ induced rules to data splitting be mitigated through dynamic rule refinement techniques?

## Limitations
- Rule quality from FOLD-R++ varies significantly across datasets and random seeds
- The 0.6 confidence threshold is heuristic without systematic optimization
- Computational overhead from ASP solving may limit scalability to larger datasets

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The fundamental concept that ASP rules can correct uncertain ML predictions and provide explanations is well-supported. The experimental methodology using 10-fold testing with statistical significance is sound.

**Medium Confidence:** The specific performance improvements (accuracy gains of 21.4-30.8 percentage points) are well-documented but may vary with different data splits, preprocessing choices, or parameter settings not fully specified.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the hybrid approach to non-medical domains and larger datasets remains untested, as does the robustness of the 0.6 confidence threshold.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study testing hybrid model with varying confidence thresholds (0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8) to determine optimal trade-offs
2. Perform rule stability analysis by running FOLD-R++ multiple times on same dataset to quantify consistency and assess overfitting risks
3. Evaluate scalability by benchmarking inference time and rule coverage on datasets with 10K+ instances to identify computational bottlenecks and potential optimizations
