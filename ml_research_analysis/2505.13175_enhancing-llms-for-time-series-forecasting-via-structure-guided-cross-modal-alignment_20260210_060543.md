## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of using large language models (LLMs) for time series forecasting by proposing a novel cross-modal alignment framework called Structure-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment (SGCMA). The key insight is that effective alignment should leverage the structural consistency between time series and language sequences rather than just token-level features. SGCMA achieves this through two main components: (1) Structure Alignment, which transfers language-derived state transition structures to time series using HMM and MEMM models, and (2) Semantic Alignment, which aligns temporal patches with language tokens through cross-attention weighted by state probabilities. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with SGCMA achieving significant improvements over existing methods including 4.0-5.9% reductions in MSE/MAE compared to LLM-based baselines, and strong performance in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting scenarios. The framework shows that carefully designed sequence-level structural alignment is sufficient to activate frozen LLMs for effective time series forecasting.

## Method Summary
The proposed SGCMA framework addresses the fundamental challenge of cross-modal alignment between language and time series data by focusing on structural consistency rather than token-level features. The approach consists of two key components: Structure Alignment and Semantic Alignment. Structure Alignment employs Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMM) to learn state transition structures from language sequences and transfer these structures to time series data, capturing temporal dependencies at a structural level. Semantic Alignment then uses a cross-attention mechanism where temporal patches from time series are aligned with language tokens, with the attention weights modulated by state probabilities derived from the structural alignment. This dual approach enables frozen LLMs to effectively process time series data by leveraging the rich semantic and structural information encoded in language models. The framework operates without requiring fine-tuning of the LLM, making it efficient and scalable for various time series forecasting tasks.

## Key Results
- SGCMA achieves 4.0-5.9% reductions in MSE/MAE compared to existing LLM-based forecasting baselines
- Demonstrates strong performance in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting scenarios
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, and Exchange datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of SGCMA stems from its focus on structural consistency rather than token-level alignment. By transferring language-derived state transition structures to time series through HMM and MEMM models, the framework captures the inherent sequential patterns in both modalities at a higher level of abstraction. This structural alignment preserves the temporal dependencies and patterns that are crucial for forecasting, while the subsequent semantic alignment through cross-attention ensures that the rich semantic information from language models is appropriately mapped to time series features. The approach recognizes that time series and language share fundamental sequential structures, and by aligning these structures first, the cross-modal transfer becomes more effective and robust.

## Foundational Learning

**Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** - Probabilistic models for sequences where states are hidden but emissions are observable. Why needed: To learn and transfer state transition structures from language to time series. Quick check: Verify state sequences capture meaningful temporal patterns in both modalities.

**Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMM)** - Discriminative sequence models that directly model state transitions given observations. Why needed: Provides an alternative to HMM for learning state transitions, potentially capturing more complex relationships. Quick check: Compare HMM vs MEMM performance for structure alignment quality.

**Cross-Attention Mechanism** - Attention-based operation that computes relationships between two different sequences. Why needed: To align temporal patches from time series with language tokens based on learned structural relationships. Quick check: Validate attention weights correlate with meaningful cross-modal correspondences.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Time Series Data -> HMM/MEMM Structure Learning -> State Probability Estimation -> Cross-Attention Alignment -> LLM Forecasting

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is Structure Alignment (HMM/MEMM) → State Probability Estimation → Cross-Attention Alignment, as errors in structural learning propagate through the entire framework.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades model adaptation (fine-tuning) for computational efficiency by keeping LLMs frozen, while accepting the complexity of cross-modal alignment. This design choice prioritizes scalability but may limit fine-grained adaptation to specific time series characteristics.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may manifest as: (1) degraded forecasting accuracy when time series exhibit highly non-linear patterns that HMM/MEMM cannot capture, (2) misalignment between language structures and time series patterns leading to noisy cross-attention weights, or (3) inability to generalize to time series with fundamentally different structural properties than those in training data.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Validate structural alignment quality by visualizing state sequences for both language and time series data
2. Test cross-attention alignment on simple synthetic time series with known patterns
3. Compare forecasting performance using only semantic alignment vs. combined structure + semantic alignment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's generalizability to diverse time series domains with highly non-linear or chaotic patterns remains unclear
- Performance heavily depends on the quality of state probability estimates from HMM/MEMM, which may not capture complex temporal dynamics
- Limited exploration of alternative state transition models that might better capture time series characteristics

## Confidence
- Effectiveness of structure-guided alignment over token-level approaches: Medium
- SGCMA is sufficient to activate frozen LLMs for time series forecasting: Medium
- Strong few-shot and zero-shot performance claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SGCMA on a broader range of time series datasets, including those with non-stationary and non-linear patterns, to assess robustness and generalizability
2. Compare the performance of SGCMA against fine-tuned LLMs or other adaptive models to determine if structural alignment alone is indeed sufficient
3. Investigate the impact of alternative state transition models (e.g., deep learning-based approaches) on alignment quality and forecasting accuracy to validate the choice of HMM and MEMM
