# Provable Recovery of Locally Important Signed Features and Interactions from Random Forest

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11081
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11081
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces LocalLSSFind method for identifying locally important signed features and interactions in Random Forest predictions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents LocalLSSFind, a method for identifying locally important signed features and interactions in Random Forest predictions. The approach combines global and local co-occurrence patterns along decision paths, weighted by depth, to recover the true underlying signed interactions under a Locally Spiky Sparse (LSS) model. Theoretical guarantees prove consistent recovery of local signed interactions and individual features for specific test points.

The method addresses the challenge of interpreting complex Random Forest models at the individual prediction level, offering a statistically grounded solution for local feature and interaction importance. Empirical results show that LocalLSSFind outperforms existing methods like TreeSHAP in identifying locally relevant interactions, particularly in models with single or multiple interactions. Application to the COMPAS dataset demonstrates its ability to provide interpretable insights into individual predictions, highlighting feature interactions and their directionality.

## Method Summary
LocalLSSFind combines global and local co-occurrence patterns along decision paths in Random Forests, weighted by depth, to identify locally important signed features and interactions. The method operates under a Locally Spiky Sparse (LSS) model assumption and provides theoretical guarantees for consistent recovery of local signed interactions. It analyzes decision paths across all trees in the forest, aggregating evidence of feature co-occurrences weighted by their depth in the tree structure. The approach recovers both individual feature importance and pairwise interaction effects with signed directionality (positive or negative contribution to prediction).

## Key Results
- LocalLSSFind demonstrates consistent recovery of true underlying signed interactions under the LSS model
- Outperforms TreeSHAP in identifying locally relevant interactions, particularly for single and multiple interaction scenarios
- Successfully applied to COMPAS dataset, providing interpretable insights into individual predictions with feature interaction directionality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages the path-based structure of decision trees in Random Forests. When a test point follows a specific path through multiple trees, certain features co-occur along these paths. By weighting these co-occurrences by tree depth and combining global frequency patterns with local path information, the method can identify which features and feature interactions are locally important for that specific prediction. The depth weighting ensures that deeper nodes (which make more specific decisions) have greater influence on the recovered importance scores.

## Foundational Learning
- **Random Forest decision paths**: Understanding how data points traverse decision trees is crucial for identifying co-occurrence patterns of features (Why needed: Core mechanism of the method; Quick check: Trace a single test point through multiple trees)
- **Locally Spiky Sparse (LSS) model**: The theoretical foundation assumes sparse, localized interactions rather than smooth, global effects (Why needed: Enables provable recovery guarantees; Quick check: Verify sparsity assumption holds in test data)
- **Feature interaction detection**: The method recovers signed interactions, distinguishing between positive and negative contributions (Why needed: Provides actionable interpretability; Quick check: Compare recovered signs with known ground truth)

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Data point -> Decision path traversal in all trees -> Feature co-occurrence counting -> Depth-weighted aggregation -> Local importance scoring
- **Critical path**: The core algorithm flows from identifying decision paths for a test point through all trees, counting co-occurrences of features along these paths, applying depth weights, and aggregating to produce local importance scores
- **Design tradeoffs**: Prioritizes theoretical guarantees under LSS model over general applicability to non-sparse interaction patterns; balances computational complexity with interpretability needs
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance when LSS assumption violated; computational bottlenecks with very large forests; reduced interpretability for high-dimensional features
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Verify co-occurrence counting accuracy on synthetic data with known interactions, 2) Benchmark depth weighting impact on recovery performance, 3) Test scalability on increasing numbers of trees

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework relies heavily on LSS model assumption, behavior on non-sparse patterns unclear
- Current analysis focuses on pairwise interactions, extension to higher-order interactions may introduce computational challenges
- Empirical validation limited to relatively small-scale datasets, computational complexity may be prohibitive for very large forests

## Confidence
- LSS model assumption applicability: Medium confidence
- Theoretical recovery guarantees: High confidence
- Empirical performance claims: Medium confidence
- Computational scalability: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test LocalLSSFind on datasets with known non-sparse interaction patterns to evaluate robustness beyond the LSS assumption
2. Benchmark computational efficiency on large-scale Random Forests (100+ trees) with high-dimensional features to assess scalability
3. Conduct a user study with domain experts to validate the interpretability and actionability of the recovered signed interactions in real-world decision-making contexts
