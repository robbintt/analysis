# BaZi-Based Character Simulation Benchmark: Evaluating AI on Temporal and Persona Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23337
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23337
- Reference count: 9
- Introduces first BaZi-based character simulation benchmark with 30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvements over mainstream LLMs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first BaZi-based character simulation benchmark for evaluating AI systems on temporal and persona reasoning tasks. The authors create the Celebrity 50 dataset containing 488 QA pairs across five life dimensions, enabling assessment of AI's ability to generate realistic, temporally coherent personas. They propose a BaZi-LLM system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models, achieving significant performance improvements over baseline models like DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a novel approach that combines traditional BaZi (Eight Characters) temporal reasoning with modern LLM capabilities. They construct the Celebrity 50 dataset by collecting detailed life information across five dimensions for 50 celebrities, creating 488 QA pairs. The BaZi-LLM system processes symbolic temporal data alongside LLM-based reasoning to generate culturally grounded character simulations. Performance is evaluated through human judgment of accuracy, comparing against baseline LLMs under controlled conditions.

## Key Results
- BaZi-LLM system achieves 30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvements over mainstream LLMs
- Performance drops 20%-45% when using incorrect birth information, demonstrating importance of accurate temporal grounding
- System successfully generates realistic, temporally coherent personas across five life dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of symbolic temporal reasoning (BaZi) with LLMs enables culturally grounded character simulation that captures both temporal progression and personality consistency. The BaZi system provides structured temporal frameworks that guide LLM responses, while the LLM adds natural language fluency and contextual understanding. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both symbolic reasoning and neural generation.

## Foundational Learning
- **BaZi (Eight Characters) system**: Traditional Chinese temporal reasoning framework using birth date/time components to analyze personality and life events. Needed for cultural grounding and temporal coherence; quick check: verify understanding of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches.
- **Temporal persona coherence**: Ability to maintain consistent character traits and life progression across different time periods. Needed for realistic character simulation; quick check: test temporal consistency across multiple Q&A pairs.
- **Symbolic-LLM integration**: Combining rule-based symbolic reasoning with neural language models. Needed to leverage structured temporal knowledge while maintaining natural language generation; quick check: validate output against both symbolic rules and language quality metrics.
- **Cultural knowledge grounding**: Embedding culturally specific reasoning frameworks into AI systems. Needed for authentic character simulation in specific cultural contexts; quick check: compare outputs with cultural experts' expectations.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: BaZi parser -> Temporal reasoner -> LLM prompt generator -> Language model -> Response evaluator

**Critical Path**: Input birth information → BaZi parsing → Temporal analysis → Context generation → LLM prompting → Response generation → Accuracy evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Symbolic reasoning provides strong temporal constraints but limited linguistic flexibility; LLMs offer natural language generation but may lack temporal consistency. The hybrid approach balances these tradeoffs but adds complexity and computational overhead.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when birth information is incorrect (20%-45% drop), inconsistent persona traits across temporal dimensions, culturally inappropriate responses that violate BaZi principles.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test BaZi parser accuracy with known birth dates to establish baseline temporal reasoning capability
2. Evaluate LLM response quality with and without BaZi-guided prompts to measure integration effectiveness
3. Conduct human evaluation of persona consistency across the five life dimensions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark generalizability limited by focus on 50 celebrities, may not represent full diversity of BaZi applications
- Human judgment evaluation lacks detailed inter-rater reliability analysis and standardized criteria
- Performance improvements measured under controlled conditions; real-world applicability and computational overhead remain unclear

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core methodology and BaZi-LLM system design are well-documented; performance degradation with incorrect birth information is directly supported
- **Medium confidence**: Comparative performance claims against baseline models are credible but lack detailed implementation information
- **Low confidence**: Broader impact claims on virtual character simulation extend beyond empirical results

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation studies using celebrities from different cultural backgrounds and historical periods to assess benchmark generalizability
2. Implement inter-rater reliability analysis for human evaluations with standardized evaluation criteria
3. Test BaZi-LLM system against broader range of contemporary LLM architectures and prompting strategies
