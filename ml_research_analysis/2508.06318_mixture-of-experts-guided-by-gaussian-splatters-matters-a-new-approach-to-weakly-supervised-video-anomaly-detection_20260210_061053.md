core_contribution: This paper introduces Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts
  (GS-MoE), a novel approach for weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD)
  that addresses the limitations of current methods in detecting complex, real-world
  anomalies. The key innovations are (1) Temporal Gaussian Splatting (TGS), which
  uses Gaussian kernels to create a more complete representation of anomalies along
  the temporal dimension, allowing the model to learn from subtle, low-scoring anomalous
  snippets that traditional methods overlook, and (2) a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
  where each expert is specialized to capture specific anomaly types, with a gate
  model integrating these predictions with coarse-level features to leverage anomaly

# Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.06318
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06318
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GS-MoE achieves 91.58% AUC on UCF-Crime, outperforming previous methods by 3.56%

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel approach for weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) that addresses limitations of current methods in detecting complex, real-world anomalies. The key innovations include Temporal Gaussian Splatting (TGS) for enhanced temporal representation and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that specializes experts for specific anomaly types. GS-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.58% AUC on UCF-Crime, demonstrating particular effectiveness for complex anomalies like shoplifting and burglary.

## Method Summary
GS-MoE combines Temporal Gaussian Splatting with a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to improve weakly-supervised video anomaly detection. The Temporal Gaussian Splatting module uses Gaussian kernels to create complete temporal representations of anomalies, enabling learning from subtle, low-scoring anomalous snippets that traditional methods overlook. The MoE component consists of specialized expert networks, each capturing specific anomaly types, with a gate model integrating predictions using coarse-level features to leverage anomaly correlations. This dual approach addresses both the temporal incompleteness and the diversity of anomaly types that challenge existing WSVAD methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91.58% AUC on UCF-Crime, outperforming previous methods by 3.56%
- Demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence (82.89% AP) and MSAD (87.72% AUC) datasets
- Shows up to 24.3% improvement over baselines on specific anomaly categories like shoplifting and burglary

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper hypothesizes that class-specific fine-grained representations are essential for detecting subtle anomalies. TGS addresses the temporal incompleteness problem by creating more complete anomaly representations along the temporal dimension, allowing the model to learn from subtle, low-scoring anomalous snippets that traditional methods miss. The MoE architecture with specialized experts captures diverse anomaly types more effectively than monolithic approaches, while the gate model integrates these predictions with coarse-level features to leverage correlations between different anomaly types.

## Foundational Learning

**Temporal Gaussian Splatting** - Why needed: To create complete temporal representations of anomalies; Quick check: Verify Gaussian kernels effectively capture temporal continuity in anomaly sequences.

**Mixture-of-Experts Architecture** - Why needed: To specialize in different anomaly types rather than using monolithic models; Quick check: Confirm each expert develops distinct feature representations for different anomaly categories.

**Weakly-Supervised Learning** - Why needed: Training without frame-level anomaly labels while still achieving accurate detection; Quick check: Validate performance with limited anomaly supervision.

**Gate Model Integration** - Why needed: To combine expert predictions with coarse-level features and leverage anomaly correlations; Quick check: Ensure gate model effectively weights expert contributions based on input characteristics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Video -> Feature Extraction -> Temporal Gaussian Splatting -> Expert Networks -> Gate Model -> Anomaly Score

**Critical Path:** Feature extraction and TGS processing feed into multiple expert networks, whose outputs are integrated by the gate model to produce final anomaly predictions.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The MoE architecture provides specialization benefits but increases model complexity and computational requirements compared to monolithic approaches. TGS adds temporal modeling capability but requires careful kernel parameter tuning.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation on datasets with anomaly types not well-represented in training data; reduced effectiveness when temporal patterns are non-Gaussian or highly irregular.

**First Experiments:**
1. Ablation study removing TGS to isolate its contribution versus MoE components
2. Cross-dataset evaluation (training on UCF-Crime, testing on XD-Violence) to assess generalization
3. Computational efficiency benchmarking against baseline methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- MoE architecture complexity raises concerns about overfitting potential and generalizability to different anomaly distributions
- Claims about TGS enabling learning from subtle snippets are inferred rather than explicitly validated through ablation studies
- Category-level performance improvements may be subject to variance in dataset composition and evaluation methodology

## Confidence
- **State-of-the-art performance claim (91.58% AUC on UCF-Crime): High confidence** - Supported by quantitative results and direct comparison with established baselines
- **TGS enabling learning from subtle snippets: Medium confidence** - Causal relationship inferred from performance gains but not explicitly validated
- **Category-level improvements (24.3% on shoplifting/burglary): Medium confidence** - Subject to dataset composition variance and evaluation methodology

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of Temporal Gaussian Splatting versus the MoE architecture
2. Perform cross-dataset evaluation to assess generalization when training on one dataset and testing on another with different anomaly types
3. Analyze computational efficiency comparing inference time and resource requirements against simpler baseline methods
