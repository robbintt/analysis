# Unified Multimodal Brain Decoding via Cross-Subject Soft-ROI Fusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.20249
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20249
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Cross-subject brain decoding with BLEU-4 of 0.2911 and CIDEr of 0.6952 on NSD dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a unified multimodal brain decoding approach that addresses cross-subject generalization and interpretability challenges in fMRI-based brain captioning. The method constructs a cross-subject shared space using multi-atlas soft ROIs and voxel-wise gated fusion to adaptively combine functional priors. An interpretable prompt optimization loop leverages a locally deployed LLM to generate and select human-readable prompts, while parameterized constrained decoding improves text quality. Evaluated on the NSD dataset under a cross-subject protocol, the approach surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods including MINDLLM and UMBRAE.

## Method Summary
The method addresses cross-subject generalization and interpretability in multimodal brain decoding by introducing a cross-subject shared space based on multi-atlas soft ROIs with global label alignment. A voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate) adaptively combines functional priors from different subjects. The approach incorporates an interpretable prompt optimization loop using a locally deployed LLM to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts, enhanced by parameterized constrained decoding to improve text quality. The framework is evaluated on the NSD dataset under a cross-subject brain captioning protocol.

## Key Results
- Achieves BLEU-4 of 0.2911 and CIDEr of 0.6952 on NSD dataset
- Outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods including MINDLLM and UMBRAE
- Ablation studies confirm voxel-wise gated fusion and constrained decoding as key performance drivers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by creating a shared representational space across subjects through soft ROI fusion, which captures common functional patterns while allowing subject-specific variations. The voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate) adaptively weights these patterns based on their relevance to the decoding task. The locally deployed LLM's prompt optimization loop generates interpretable captions by iteratively refining prompts based on their alignment with decoded brain signals. Parameterized constrained decoding ensures that generated text remains both high-quality and faithful to the underlying neural representations.

## Foundational Learning
- Cross-subject fMRI decoding: Needed because individual brain anatomy and function vary, requiring methods to generalize across subjects. Quick check: Compare performance on within-subject vs. cross-subject tasks.
- Multi-atlas soft ROI construction: Required to create subject-invariant functional regions that capture shared neural patterns. Quick check: Validate ROI alignment against known functional connectivity patterns.
- Voxel-wise gated fusion: Essential for adaptive combination of functional priors, weighting informative voxels more heavily. Quick check: Analyze gate activation patterns for interpretability.
- Parameterized constrained decoding: Needed to balance text quality with fidelity to neural representations. Quick check: Compare unconstrained vs. constrained decoding outputs.
- Prompt optimization with LLM: Required for generating interpretable captions that map neural activity to natural language. Quick check: Evaluate prompt relevance through human assessment.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
fMRI signals -> Multi-atlas soft ROI construction -> Voxel-gate fusion -> Neural encoder -> LLM prompt optimization -> Constrained decoding -> Captions

Critical Path:
fMRI preprocessing -> Soft ROI alignment across subjects -> Voxel-gate fusion of functional priors -> Neural encoding -> Prompt generation and selection -> Constrained decoding of captions

Design Tradeoffs:
- Soft ROI fusion vs. hard ROI boundaries: Soft fusion allows smoother transitions and better generalization but requires careful weight calibration
- Global vs. local label alignment: Global alignment ensures consistency across subjects but may miss subject-specific nuances
- Voxel-wise gating: Provides adaptive fusion but increases model complexity and potential overfitting
- LLM-based prompt optimization: Improves interpretability but introduces dependency on external model performance

Failure Signatures:
- Poor cross-subject generalization: Indicates misalignment in soft ROI construction or inadequate functional prior fusion
- Low text quality: Suggests issues with constrained decoding parameters or prompt optimization loop
- Lack of interpretability: Points to problems in the prompt generation process or insufficient voxel-wise gating
- Overfitting to training subjects: Indicates need for stronger regularization or more diverse training data

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study removing voxel-wise gated fusion to quantify its contribution
2. Comparison of soft ROI fusion vs. single-atlas approach on cross-subject performance
3. Analysis of prompt quality with and without parameterized constrained decoding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Cross-subject shared space generalizability depends heavily on multi-atlas soft ROI construction quality, which lacks explicit validation against ground truth functional connectivity
- Prompt optimization loop's handling of prompt diversity and local optima is unclear, potentially limiting interpretability claims
- Evaluation restricted to NSD dataset and specific cross-subject brain captioning protocol raises questions about robustness across different fMRI tasks
- Voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism's interpretability benefits are asserted but not rigorously demonstrated through qualitative analysis or human evaluation

## Confidence
- Performance improvements (BLEU-4 0.2911, CIDEr 0.6952): Medium - benchmarked only against limited methods on single dataset
- Contribution of voxel-wise gated fusion and constrained decoding: Medium - supported by ablation studies but effect sizes and statistical significance not detailed
- Interpretability claims related to prompt optimization loop and soft ROI fusion: Low - lacks systematic validation of prompt relevance and functional interpretability

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the unified multimodal brain decoding framework on additional fMRI datasets (e.g., HCP, OpenfMRI) to assess robustness and generalizability beyond the NSD dataset.
2. **Prompt optimization analysis**: Conduct a systematic evaluation of the locally deployed LLM's prompt generation process, including prompt diversity metrics and qualitative assessment by human experts, to verify interpretability gains.
3. **Functional ROI interpretability**: Perform a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis (e.g., functional connectivity, ROI overlap with known atlases) to validate the meaningfulness and interpretability of the soft ROI fusion mechanism.
