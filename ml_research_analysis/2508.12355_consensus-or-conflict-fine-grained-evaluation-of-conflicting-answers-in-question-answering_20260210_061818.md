  models not only to identify all valid answers but also to detect specific conflicting
  answer pairs. To support this task, a novel cost-effective methodology is introduced
  that leverages fact-checking datasets to construct NATCONFQA, a new benchmark for
  realistic conflict-aware MAQA enriched with detailed conflict labels for all answer

# Consensus or Conflict? Fine-Grained Evaluation of Conflicting Answers in Question-Answering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.12355
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12355
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Novel benchmark NATCONFQA for conflict-aware multi-answer QA, revealing LLM fragility in detecting conflicting answer pairs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-answer question-answering (MAQA) where answers may conflict, requiring models to identify all valid answers while detecting specific conflicting pairs. The authors introduce a novel methodology that leverages fact-checking datasets to construct NATCONFQA, a benchmark for realistic conflict-aware MAQA enriched with detailed conflict labels. Eight high-end LLMs are evaluated on this benchmark, revealing significant performance gaps in handling various conflict types. The study demonstrates that while models achieve high precision in conflict detection, they struggle with recall and distinguishing between conflicting and non-conflicting answer pairs, exposing flawed strategies in their conflict resolution approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a cost-effective methodology to construct NATCONFQA by leveraging existing fact-checking datasets, transforming fact-checking instances into QA format with multiple answers. The benchmark includes detailed conflict labels for all answer pairs, enabling fine-grained evaluation of conflict detection capabilities. The evaluation framework measures both the identification of all valid answers and the detection of specific conflicting pairs. Eight state-of-the-art LLMs were systematically evaluated using this framework, with manual annotation ensuring high-quality conflict labels. The methodology addresses the challenge of creating realistic conflict-aware MAQA benchmarks while maintaining annotation quality and coverage.

## Key Results
- Models achieve high precision but fail to output all correct answers, showing significant recall gaps
- Fine-grained conflict identification reveals models struggle to distinguish between conflicting and non-conflicting answer pairs
- Performance varies significantly across different conflict types, exposing model fragility in handling specific conflict patterns
- The benchmark successfully exposes flawed strategies employed by LLMs when resolving conflicting answers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by transforming fact-checking data into QA format, where each fact-checking claim becomes a question and the verdict (true/false) along with evidence creates multiple answer candidates. Conflicts naturally arise when evidence supports different verdicts or when interpretations differ. This approach captures realistic conflict scenarios while maintaining annotation quality through the structured nature of fact-checking data.

## Foundational Learning

**Conflict-aware MAQA**: Why needed - Essential for realistic QA scenarios where multiple valid answers exist and may contradict each other; Quick check - Can the model identify all valid answers while detecting conflicts between them?

**Fact-checking dataset transformation**: Why needed - Provides a cost-effective source of labeled conflicts; Quick check - Are the transformed instances maintaining semantic integrity of original fact-checking claims?

**Fine-grained conflict labeling**: Why needed - Enables detailed analysis of model performance on different conflict types; Quick check - Do the conflict labels capture the full spectrum of realistic answer conflicts?

**Multi-answer evaluation framework**: Why needed - Measures both completeness (recall) and precision in conflict detection; Quick check - Does the framework account for all valid answers while accurately identifying conflicts?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Question -> LLM Generation -> Answer Extraction -> Conflict Detection -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**: The evaluation pipeline processes each question through the LLM to generate multiple answers, then applies conflict detection algorithms to identify conflicting pairs, followed by comparison with ground truth conflict labels to compute precision and recall metrics.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Using fact-checking datasets ensures high-quality conflict labels but may introduce sampling bias toward specific conflict types. The binary conflict classification simplifies evaluation but may miss nuanced answer relationships.

**Failure Signatures**: Models show systematic recall gaps in multi-answer scenarios, failing to output all valid answers. They struggle particularly with nuanced conflicts where answers are semantically similar but technically contradictory.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Generate answers for NATCONFQA benchmark questions using different prompting strategies
2. Apply conflict detection algorithm to identify conflicting answer pairs
3. Compare model predictions against ground truth conflict labels to compute precision-recall metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the research reveals several implicit areas for further investigation, particularly regarding the underlying reasons for systematic recall gaps and how different model architectures might better handle conflict detection.

## Limitations

- Potential sampling bias from using fact-checking datasets, which may not represent full diversity of conflicts in general QA scenarios
- Binary conflict classification may oversimplify nuanced answer relationships in complex domains
- Manual conflict labeling introduces human subjectivity and potential inconsistencies across annotators
- Focus on English-language data limits generalizability to other languages and cultural contexts

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The methodology for constructing NATCONFQA from fact-checking data is sound and well-documented

**Medium confidence**: The observed performance patterns of LLMs in conflict detection are reliable but may not generalize to all QA domains

**Low confidence**: The specific conflict categories identified may not capture the full spectrum of real-world answer conflicts

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-lingual validation by constructing similar benchmarks in other languages to test generalizability of conflict patterns
2. Implement inter-annotator agreement analysis to quantify and address potential subjectivity in conflict labeling
3. Design ablation studies testing different prompting strategies and model architectures to isolate factors affecting conflict detection performance
