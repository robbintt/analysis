# An extrapolated and provably convergent algorithm for nonlinear matrix decomposition with the ReLU function

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.23832
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23832
- Reference count: 40
- The paper introduces a provably convergent extrapolated block coordinate descent algorithm for nonlinear matrix decomposition using the ReLU function

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the nonlinear matrix decomposition problem where the goal is to approximate a sparse nonnegative matrix X using max(0,Θ) for a low-rank matrix Θ. The authors demonstrate that two common formulations (LS-RMD and Latent-RMD) can yield different optimal solutions, motivating their proposed 3B-RMD formulation that expresses Θ as a product W H. They develop an extrapolated block coordinate descent (eBCD) algorithm with rigorous convergence guarantees, representing a significant advance over prior work that lacked such theoretical foundations for accelerated variants.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a reparametrized formulation called 3B-RMD where the low-rank matrix Θ is expressed as a product of two matrices W and H. They develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for this formulation and introduce an extrapolated variant (eBCD) that incorporates momentum-like updates. The convergence of both algorithms is proven under standard assumptions, with the eBCD method showing improved convergence rates. The key innovation is the theoretical guarantee of convergence for the extrapolated variant, which was previously lacking in the literature for similar accelerated optimization methods.

## Key Results
- The eBCD method significantly accelerates the standard BCD algorithm for the 3B-RMD formulation
- The proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets in terms of both accuracy and runtime
- Convergence guarantees are established for both the standard BCD and the extrapolated variant (eBCD)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of the approach stems from the careful reparametrization of the nonlinear decomposition problem into a form amenable to block coordinate descent optimization. By expressing the low-rank matrix as a product W H, the problem becomes better conditioned and allows for efficient coordinate updates. The extrapolation step introduces momentum that accelerates convergence without sacrificing the monotonic improvement property, while the theoretical analysis ensures global convergence to stationary points.

## Foundational Learning

**Block Coordinate Descent (BCD)**: An optimization technique that minimizes a multivariate function by iteratively optimizing along coordinate directions. Needed for efficiently solving the non-convex 3B-RMD problem. Quick check: Verify that each block update can be computed in closed form or efficiently.

**ReLU Activation**: The rectified linear unit function max(0,x) introduces nonlinearity into the decomposition. Needed to model thresholded or sparse activation patterns. Quick check: Confirm the derivative exists almost everywhere for convergence analysis.

**Extrapolation/Momentum**: Technique that uses information from previous iterations to accelerate convergence. Needed to overcome slow convergence of standard BCD. Quick check: Ensure extrapolation parameter satisfies theoretical bounds.

**Nonconvex Optimization**: The 3B-RMD problem is non-convex, requiring specialized convergence analysis. Needed because the ReLU nonlinearity creates non-convex objective functions. Quick check: Verify Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property for convergence guarantees.

**Matrix Factorization with Nonnegativity**: The decomposition requires nonnegative factors W and H. Needed to maintain physical interpretability and match problem structure. Quick check: Confirm projection steps preserve nonnegativity constraints.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Matrix X -> 3B-RMD Formulation -> BCD/eBCD Updates -> Convergence Monitoring -> Factor Matrices W, H

**Critical Path**: The algorithm iteratively updates W and H in alternating fashion, with each update solving a convex subproblem. The critical computational path involves solving these subproblems efficiently, which the authors accomplish through closed-form solutions or efficient numerical methods.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The 3B-RMD formulation trades the flexibility of general low-rank matrices for the computational benefits of the product form W H. While this may restrict the solution space slightly, it enables provable convergence and efficient computation. The extrapolation parameter must be carefully tuned to balance acceleration against potential instability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate ill-conditioning of the subproblems, inappropriate choice of extrapolation parameter, or violation of problem assumptions (e.g., insufficient rank). Divergence or cycling suggests the need to adjust the extrapolation schedule or check implementation details.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test convergence on small synthetic matrices with known ground truth to verify correctness
2. Compare convergence speed of BCD vs eBCD on moderate-sized problems to observe acceleration empirically
3. Evaluate sensitivity to initialization and rank selection on real datasets to understand practical limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The algorithm assumes fully observed matrices without handling missing data, limiting real-world applicability
- Empirical evaluation focuses on clean synthetic and real-world datasets, with unclear performance on noisy, incomplete data
- The comparison does not include recent deep learning-based approaches that might offer superior performance through end-to-end training

## Confidence

**Theoretical convergence guarantees**: High - The proofs follow established optimization frameworks and are well-structured

**Algorithmic performance claims**: Medium - Results are compelling but limited to specific data types and comparison set

**Practical applicability**: Medium - Strong on idealized problems but uncertain for noisy, incomplete real-world data

## Next Checks

1. Test algorithm performance on datasets with missing entries and varying noise levels to assess robustness beyond the current ideal conditions

2. Compare against recent deep learning approaches for nonlinear matrix factorization that could leverage end-to-end training

3. Evaluate scaling behavior on larger matrices (1000+ dimensions) to understand computational limits and potential bottlenecks
