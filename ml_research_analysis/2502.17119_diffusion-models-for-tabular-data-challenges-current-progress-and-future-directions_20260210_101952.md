- This survey provides the first comprehensive review of diffusion models for tabular data, covering works from June 2015 to December 2024.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews diffusion models for tabular data, addressing unique challenges including mixed data types, missing values, small datasets, and domain-specific constraints. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in domains like images and text, their application to tabular data requires specialized adaptations due to inherent challenges such as heterogeneous features and feature dependencies. The survey categorizes relevant works into four key application areas: data augmentation, data imputation, trustworthy data synthesis, and anomaly detection. It demonstrates that diffusion models outperform traditional methods like GANs and VAEs across various benchmarks while highlighting ongoing challenges including scalability, evaluation metrics, privacy concerns, and interpretability.

## Method Summary
The survey provides a comprehensive literature review of diffusion models applied to tabular data from June 2015 to December 2024. It systematically categorizes 40+ relevant works into four main application areas: data augmentation (including single-table and multi-relational synthesis), data imputation, trustworthy data synthesis (privacy-preserving and fairness-preserving), and anomaly detection. The authors maintain an updated GitHub repository tracking this rapidly evolving field and provide detailed analysis of technical challenges, current approaches, and future research directions.

## Key Results
- Diffusion models outperform traditional GANs and VAEs on tabular data synthesis tasks across multiple benchmarks
- Latent-space unification approaches (using VAEs or embeddings) better capture cross-feature dependencies than separate models for numerical and categorical data
- Conditional diffusion models provide more robust imputation than traditional "impute-then-generate" pipelines
- The field faces critical challenges including scalability to large datasets, standardized evaluation metrics, privacy guarantees, and feature correlation modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Unification of Heterogeneous Features
- **Claim:** Diffusion models outperform GANs on tabular data when mapping mixed-type features into a continuous latent space rather than processing them via separate diffusion processes.
- **Mechanism:** Using VAEs or specialized embedding layers to tokenize features into a unified manifold preserves cross-feature correlations that are destroyed when treating columns independently.
- **Core assumption:** Semantic relationships between categorical and numerical data can be captured in continuous vector space without losing critical discrete boundaries.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section IV-A1] TabSyn proposes joint latent space operation; [Section IV-A1] CoDi notes separate models hinder cross-feature correlation capture; [Corpus] related survey highlights mixed data type handling as primary bottleneck.
- **Break condition:** High cardinality categorical features or small datasets may cause the VAE encoder to introduce noise or mode collapse.

### Mechanism 2: Conditional Score-Based Imputation
- **Claim:** Diffusion models impute missing values more robustly than "impute-then-generate" pipelines by treating observed values as conditioning context for reverse denoising.
- **Mechanism:** The model reconstructs missing values by estimating the score function conditioned on observed portions rather than relying on single deterministic fill.
- **Core assumption:** Missingness mechanism (MAR/MCAR) is recoverable from observed data distribution.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section V] TabCSDI partitions input into observed and unobserved parts with conditional diffusion model; [Section IV-A1] MissDiff masks loss function to train on incomplete data.
- **Break condition:** If missingness is MNAR and unobserved values fundamentally alter data distribution in ways not represented in observed training set, conditional generation will be biased.

### Mechanism 3: Anomaly Detection via Reconstruction Difficulty
- **Claim:** Diffusion models serve as effective anomaly detectors because they learn robust manifold of "normal" data; anomalies identified by high reconstruction error or deviation from learned score function.
- **Mechanism:** During training, model minimizes divergence between predicted noise and actual noise for normal samples; anomalous samples yield higher loss values or different estimated diffusion times.
- **Core assumption:** Training data consists predominantly of "normal" samples and anomalies lie in low-density regions of learned distribution.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section VII] TabADM assigns anomaly scores based on likelihood of being generated; samples in low-density regions exhibit high loss values; [Section VII] DTE uses estimated diffusion time as anomaly score.
- **Break condition:** If training data heavily contaminated with anomalies, model may learn to reconstruct anomalies as normal, reducing detection sensitivity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)**
  - **Why needed here:** Many modern tabular diffusion models are formulated as SDEs rather than discrete Markov chains. Understanding "drift" and "diffusion" coefficients is necessary to grasp how noise is scheduled.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain the difference between "Variance Exploding" (VE) and "Variance Preserving" (VP) schedules and why VE might be preferred for highly irregular tabular distributions?

- **Concept: Score Matching**
  - **Why needed here:** Unlike GANs which learn a discriminator, diffusion models often learn the "score" (gradient of the log-likelihood). This is critical for understanding how to sample from the model using Langevin dynamics.
  - **Quick check question:** What does the score network $S_\theta(x, t)$ actually predict during the reverse process?

- **Concept: Multimodal vs. Multinomial Diffusion**
  - **Why needed here:** Tabular data mixes continuous and discrete types. You must understand that you cannot apply Gaussian diffusion directly to categorical data without transformation.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does applying a simple Gaussian diffusion process to a one-hot encoded vector result in non-sensical intermediate states?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Preprocessor (Normalizer/Encoder) -> Diffusion Core (Denoising Network) -> Postprocessor (Detokenizer/Denormalizer)
- **Critical path:** The encoding strategy determines success. Using simple One-Hot encoding on high-cardinality features induces sparsity that the diffusion model fails to denoise effectively. The shift to Latent Diffusion (TabSyn) or specialized embeddings (FinDiff) is the current state-of-the-art path.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - TabDDPM approach: Simpler implementation (separate models for types) but fails to capture cross-correlations
  - TabSyn/AutoDiff approach: Higher complexity (requires training VAE first) but captures complex correlations in unified space
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Dimensionality Collapse: Generated samples look realistic individually but fail to maintain pairwise column correlations
  - Gray Region Overlap: In oversampling, generated minority samples drift into majority class manifold
  - Privacy Leakage: Latent diffusion models that overfit autoencoder may memorize training records
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline: Implement TabDDPM on clean dataset (e.g., Adult Census) to establish baseline for numerical/categorical generation fidelity
  2. Ablation: Replace One-Hot encoder in baseline with learned embedding layer (as in FinDiff) to measure gain in correlation capture on high-cardinality data
  3. Imputation Test: Introduce synthetic missingness (MCAR) and compare standard MICE imputation against conditional diffusion model like TabCSDI on small dataset (e.g., Iris) to verify robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can efficient sampling and training methods be developed to reduce computational cost of diffusion models for high-dimensional tabular datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors state in Section IX that diffusion models are "computationally intensive" and identify "Scalability" as key area needing more research.
- Why unresolved: Current diffusion processes require many iterative steps and heavy neural network evaluations, making them slower than GANs or VAEs, particularly problematic for large-scale tabular data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Novel architectures or noise scheduling algorithms that significantly reduce inference time and training resource consumption without sacrificing fidelity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can diffusion models be optimized to accurately capture complex correlations, particularly between heterogeneous (numerical and categorical) features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section IX highlights "Modeling Feature Correlations" as specific challenge, noting that "Most existing diffusion models are not optimized to capture feature correlations," especially cross-feature types.
- Why unresolved: Many current models (e.g., TabDDPM) treat numerical and categorical features with separate diffusion processes, which hinders modeling of dependencies between these two modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Unified diffusion framework that demonstrates superior performance on pairwise correlation metrics compared to models processing feature types independently.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can diffusion models be integrated with strong theoretical privacy guarantees, such as differential privacy, without severely degrading data utility?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Conclusion notes in Section IX that research into privacy techniques with "strong theoretical guarantees, such as differential privacy, remains limited and requires further exploration."
- Why unresolved: While synthetic data is often used for privacy, generative models can memorize and leak training data. Standard federated or basic synthetic approaches lack strict mathematical privacy guarantees.
- What evidence would resolve it: Tabular diffusion model that formally integrates differential privacy mechanisms and proves favorable tradeoff between privacy budgets and machine learning utility.

## Limitations
- Lack of standardized evaluation metrics for assessing quality of synthetic tabular data, particularly regarding preservation of complex feature correlations
- Most existing works focus on relatively small datasets (typically under 100K rows), leaving scalability to large-scale tabular data as open challenge
- Privacy concerns remain inadequately addressed with limited rigorous evaluation of membership inference attacks and differential privacy guarantees

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Diffusion models outperform traditional GANs and VAEs on tabular data augmentation tasks
- Four identified application areas comprehensively cover current research landscape
- Mixed-type feature handling remains primary technical challenge with latent-space unification showing promise

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Superior performance stems specifically from ability to capture cross-feature dependencies in unified latent spaces
- Conditional diffusion models provide more robust imputation than traditional pipelines
- Anomaly detection via reconstruction difficulty is effective for tabular data

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Specific performance rankings between different diffusion architectures (DDPM vs. SDE vs. Latent Diffusion)
- Generalization of current results to real-world, noisy, high-cardinality datasets
- Long-term privacy guarantees of diffusion-synthesized data

## Next Checks

1. **Correlation Preservation Benchmark:** Conduct controlled experiments comparing TabSyn (latent diffusion) against TabDDPM (separate models) on datasets with known feature correlations to quantify practical impact of latent-space unification on cross-feature dependency capture.

2. **Scalability Stress Test:** Evaluate state-of-the-art diffusion models (TabSyn, AutoDiff) on large-scale tabular datasets (>1M rows) to identify performance degradation points and memory bottlenecks, measuring both generation quality and computational efficiency.

3. **Privacy Vulnerability Assessment:** Perform systematic membership inference attacks on diffusion-generated tabular data using established privacy evaluation frameworks to quantify actual privacy-utility tradeoff and identify architectures most vulnerable to privacy breaches.
