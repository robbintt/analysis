# Chameleon: Adaptive Adversarial Agents for Scaling-Based Visual Prompt Injection in Multimodal AI Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04895
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04895
- Authors: M Zeeshan; Saud Satti
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: Chameleon achieves 84.5% ASR against Gemini 2.5 Flash, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks (32.1% ASR) while maintaining imperceptibility with L2 distances below 0.1.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Chameleon, an adaptive adversarial attack framework that exploits image scaling vulnerabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The core method employs an iterative, agent-based optimization loop that dynamically refines image perturbations based on real-time model feedback, allowing attacks to survive standard downscaling operations and inject malicious prompts. When evaluated against Gemini 2.5 Flash, Chameleon achieved an 84.5% Attack Success Rate across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks (32.1% ASR). The attacks successfully compromised agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks. The perturbations remained visually imperceptible with normalized L2 distances below 0.1, while requiring only 12-16 API calls per successful attack.

## Method Summary
Chameleon implements an iterative optimization framework that generates adversarial perturbations surviving image downscaling. The method initializes perturbations δ ~ U(-0.02, 0.02), creates adversarial images I_adv = clip(I + δ, 0, 255), and submits them to the target VLM via API. The system extracts response signals (confidence c, success s), computes reward R = 10.0·s - 0.5·d - 0.2·(1-c) where d is normalized visual distance, and optimizes δ using either hill-climbing or genetic algorithms. The process iterates up to 50 times or until success, evaluating across bicubic, bilinear, and nearest-neighbor downsampling methods. The framework balances attack efficacy against visual imperceptibility through its multi-term reward function.

## Key Results
- Achieved 84.5% Attack Success Rate against Gemini 2.5 Flash across varying scaling factors
- Outperformed static baseline attacks (32.1% ASR) through adaptive optimization
- Maintained visual imperceptibility with normalized L2 distances below 0.1
- Required only 12-16 API calls per successful attack with 87-91% convergence rate

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Scaling-Induced Semantic Emergence
High-resolution adversarial perturbations can be designed to become semantically meaningful instructions only after image downsampling. Standard interpolation algorithms perform weighted pixel averaging during downscaling, transforming carefully structured high-frequency perturbation patterns into low-frequency semantic artifacts that VLMs interpret as actionable prompts.

### Mechanism 2: Feedback-Driven Perturbation Optimization
Chameleon's closed-loop optimization dynamically refines perturbations using real-time model feedback. The system samples initial perturbations, submits them to the VLM, receives response signals, computes rewards, and updates perturbations iteratively until success or iteration limit.

### Mechanism 3: Reward-Balanced Stealth-Efficacy Tradeoff
A multi-term reward function enables discovery of perturbations that are both effective post-scaling and visually imperceptible. The reward R = w1·s - w2·d - w3·(1-c) penalizes visual distance and rewards success while exploiting model uncertainty.

## Foundational Learning

- **Image Scaling Algorithms (Bilinear/Bicubic Interpolation)**: Why needed - The attack fundamentally exploits how these algorithms average pixels during downsampling. Quick check - Given a 4368×4368 image downscaled to 224×224 via bicubic interpolation, approximately how many original pixels contribute to each output pixel's value?

- **Black-Box Optimization under Query Constraints**: Why needed - Chameleon operates with API-only access. Quick check - If an API allows 60 requests/minute and each optimization iteration requires one query, what is the maximum feasible iteration count for a 5-minute attack window?

- **Adversarial Perturbation Constraints (ε-balls, Imperceptibility)**: Why needed - The attack must stay within perturbation budgets. Quick check - For an image with pixel values in [0, 255], what is the maximum per-pixel change allowed by a normalized L2 distance of 0.1 on a 224×224×3 image?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Perturbation Generator → Scaling Simulator → VLM Interface → Reward Computer → Optimizer → Termination Checker
- **Critical path**: Perturbation Generator → Scaling Simulator → VLM Interface → Reward Computer → Optimizer → (loop) → Termination Checker. The VLM Interface latency (~26 sec/call per paper) dominates iteration time.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Hill-climbing: Faster convergence (23.4 iterations), fewer API calls (12.47), but 4% lower ASR and higher visual distance. Genetic Algorithm: Higher ASR (91% vs 87%) and better imperceptibility, but 27% more API calls and ~60 sec longer per attack.
- **Failure signatures**: Convergence without success (high-semantic-content images), excessive perturbation magnitude (L2 > 0.2), query exhaustion (rate-limiting or quota exhaustion).
- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Reproduce baseline ASR gap: Implement static perturbation attack against a test VLM and measure ASR vs. Chameleon-style iterative optimization.
  2. Scaling method robustness test: Run Chameleon against same image set using bicubic, bilinear, and nearest-neighbor interpolation.
  3. Multi-scale consistency defense prototype: Implement defense that processes input images at two resolutions and compares VLM outputs for semantic divergence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Cross-model generalization**: The authors state that "cross-model generalization remains to be tested" as their evaluation focused solely on Gemini 2.5 Flash architecture.

2. **Defense effectiveness**: The paper proposes "multi-scale consistency checks as a necessary defense mechanism" but does not implement or validate this defense.

3. **Robustness on out-of-distribution images**: The authors acknowledge that their "20-image dataset may not capture extreme edge cases" and that high feature density offers natural resistance to the perturbation.

## Limitations

- The attack's success rate may not generalize beyond Gemini 2.5 Flash to other VLM architectures.
- The paper does not validate the proposed multi-scale consistency defense mechanism.
- The 20-image dataset used may not capture extreme edge cases or specialized domains.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of scaling-induced semantic emergence is well-supported by cited literature and the mathematical framework of weighted pixel averaging.
- **Medium Confidence**: The feedback-driven optimization loop is plausible given similar adaptive black-box attacks, but exact reward signal extraction from Gemini responses is unclear.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that perturbations remain visually imperceptible at L2 < 0.1 is weakly supported, lacking perceptual studies or frequency-domain analysis.

## Next Checks

1. **Perceptual Study Validation**: Conduct a user study with 50 participants evaluating Chameleon-generated adversarial images against clean images to verify imperceptibility. Compare results with frequency-domain analysis.

2. **Cross-Model Robustness Test**: Evaluate Chameleon against diverse VLMs (GPT-4V, Claude 3, LLaVA) to determine if 84.5% ASR is specific to Gemini 2.5 Flash or generalizable.

3. **Multi-Scale Consistency Defense Benchmark**: Implement the proposed multi-scale consistency check defense and measure its detection rate against Chameleon attacks, quantifying false positives vs true positives.
