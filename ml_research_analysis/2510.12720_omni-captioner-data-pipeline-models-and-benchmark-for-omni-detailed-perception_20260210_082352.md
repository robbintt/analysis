core_contribution: This work addresses the challenge of fine-grained multimodal perception,
  where models must capture detailed information from audio and visual inputs while
  minimizing hallucinations. To solve this, the authors propose Omni-Detective, an
  agentic data generation pipeline that uses tool-calling to iteratively gather evidence
  and produce detailed yet minimally hallucinatory captions.

# Omni-Captioner: Data Pipeline, Models, and Benchmark for Omni Detailed Perception

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.12720
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12720
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Omni-Captioner sets new state-of-the-art on VDC benchmark and achieves best hallucination-detail trade-off on video-SALMONN 2 testset

## Executive Summary
This work addresses fine-grained multimodal perception by proposing a comprehensive system for detailed audio-visual captioning with minimal hallucinations. The authors introduce Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline that iteratively gathers evidence through tool-calling, and train two models (Audio-Captioner and Omni-Captioner) using a two-stage curriculum. The system achieves state-of-the-art results on the VDC benchmark while maintaining optimal balance between detail and hallucination. Additionally, the authors introduce Omni-Cloze, a cloze-style benchmark for stable evaluation across audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual scenarios.

## Method Summary
The approach centers on Omni-Detective, an agentic pipeline that uses tool-calling to iteratively gather evidence and generate detailed yet minimally hallucinatory captions. The system employs a two-stage curriculum training strategy: first optimizing for audio alignment, then performing joint audio-visual optimization. This is applied to train both Audio-Captioner (audio-focused) and Omni-Captioner (audio-visual) models. The methodology addresses the challenge of capturing fine-grained information from multimodal inputs while minimizing generation of hallucinatory content that doesn't correspond to the input.

## Key Results
- Omni-Captioner sets new state-of-the-art on VDC benchmark
- Achieves best trade-off between detail and hallucination on video-SALMONN 2 testset
- Omni-Cloze benchmark introduced for stable and reliable evaluation across modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The agentic Omni-Detective pipeline addresses hallucination through iterative evidence gathering before caption generation, ensuring captions are grounded in verifiable information. The two-stage curriculum first establishes strong audio alignment before adding visual complexity, allowing the model to build robust multimodal understanding progressively. The cloze-style evaluation provides more stable assessment across modalities compared to traditional metrics.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multimodal Perception** - Understanding how audio and visual information can be integrated for comprehensive scene understanding. Needed because human perception relies on multiple senses working together.
   - Quick check: Verify model can identify same object across audio and visual inputs

2. **Hallucination Detection** - Methods for measuring when generated content doesn't correspond to input data. Needed because multimodal models often generate plausible but incorrect content.
   - Quick check: Compare generated captions against ground truth for factual accuracy

3. **Curriculum Learning** - Training strategy that progresses from simple to complex tasks. Needed to build robust understanding before adding complexity.
   - Quick check: Monitor performance improvement across curriculum stages

4. **Tool-Calling in Agentic Systems** - Using external tools to gather evidence before decision-making. Needed for grounding generation in verifiable information.
   - Quick check: Verify tool outputs are incorporated into final generation

5. **Cloze Evaluation** - Fill-in-the-blank style assessment for stable measurement. Needed because traditional metrics can be unstable across modalities.
   - Quick check: Test evaluation consistency across different input types

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Omni-Detective -> Evidence Gathering -> Two-stage Curriculum -> Audio-Captioner/Omni-Captioner -> Evaluation (Omni-Cloze)

**Critical Path**: Data generation through Omni-Detective pipeline → Two-stage curriculum training → Model inference → Cloze-style evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The agentic approach trades computational efficiency for reduced hallucinations through iterative evidence gathering. The two-stage curriculum trades longer training time for more robust multimodal understanding. Cloze evaluation trades granularity for stability across modalities.

**Failure Signatures**: Over-reliance on audio may lead to missing visual details; over-reliance on visual cues may miss audio-only events; tool-calling failures may result in incomplete evidence gathering; curriculum misalignment may cause suboptimal feature fusion.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test single-stage vs two-stage curriculum performance on audio-only tasks
2. Evaluate hallucination rates with and without Omni-Detective evidence gathering
3. Compare cloze-style evaluation stability against traditional metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Omni-Detective pipeline may introduce systematic biases based on tool selection and search strategies
- Two-stage curriculum lacks extensive ablation studies to quantify individual stage contributions
- Evaluation methodology requires validation of Omni-Cloze benchmark's coverage across modalities

## Confidence
- State-of-the-art results on VDC: Medium
- Improved hallucination-detail trade-off on video-SALMONN 2: Medium
- Effectiveness of two-stage curriculum: Medium
- Generalizability to other benchmarks: Low (not extensively tested)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to isolate contributions of audio alignment vs joint optimization stages
2. Evaluate model performance across broader range of multimodal benchmarks beyond VDC and video-SALMONN 2
3. Perform human evaluation studies to validate objective metrics for hallucination and detail trade-offs
