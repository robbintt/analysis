# Soft Inductive Bias Approach via Explicit Reasoning Perspectives in Inappropriate Utterance Detection Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08480
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08480
- Reference count: 0
- Kanana-1.5 model achieved 87.0046% accuracy, improving by 3.89% over standard supervised learning

## Executive Summary
This study addresses inappropriate utterance detection in conversational texts by proposing a soft inductive bias approach that uses explicit reasoning perspectives to guide large language model inference. The authors define four reasoning perspectives—surface-level, causal, impact-based, and comprehensive—to constrain the reasoning process and prevent errors. Through fine-tuning Korean LLMs with this framework, the Kanana-1.5 model achieved 87.0046% accuracy, representing a 3.89% improvement over standard supervised learning approaches. The results demonstrate that guided reasoning through explicitly defined perspectives enables more precise and consistent judgments compared to simple knowledge imitation.

## Method Summary
The study proposes a soft inductive bias approach for inappropriate utterance detection by explicitly defining reasoning perspectives that guide the inference process. The authors construct four reasoning perspectives: surface-level (literal interpretation), causal (underlying reasons), impact-based (consequences), and comprehensive (holistic evaluation). These perspectives are integrated into the fine-tuning process of Korean large language models, constraining the reasoning steps to prevent errors and improve consistency. The approach represents a departure from standard supervised learning by providing structured reasoning guidance rather than relying solely on pattern recognition from training data.

## Key Results
- Kanana-1.5 model achieved 87.0046% accuracy in inappropriate utterance detection
- Performance improved by approximately 3.89% over standard supervised learning baselines
- The soft inductive bias approach with explicit reasoning perspectives enabled more precise and consistent judgments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The soft inductive bias approach works by providing structured reasoning guidance that constrains the model's inference process. By explicitly defining four reasoning perspectives (surface-level, causal, impact-based, and comprehensive), the method prevents reasoning errors that can occur when models rely solely on pattern matching. This structured approach guides the model through logical steps rather than allowing arbitrary reasoning paths, resulting in more consistent and accurate judgments for inappropriate utterance detection.

## Foundational Learning
- **Inductive bias in machine learning**: Why needed - Understanding how prior assumptions guide learning; Quick check - Review how different bias types affect model generalization
- **Explicit reasoning frameworks**: Why needed - To comprehend how structured reasoning improves model decisions; Quick check - Examine existing frameworks for breaking down complex judgment tasks
- **Large language model fine-tuning**: Why needed - To understand how additional training objectives modify base model behavior; Quick check - Review standard fine-tuning techniques for classification tasks
- **Inappropriate content detection**: Why needed - To grasp the specific challenges in detecting subtle inappropriate utterances; Quick check - Survey common approaches and evaluation metrics for toxicity detection

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input text -> Reasoning perspective selection -> Constrained reasoning steps -> Classification output

**Critical path**: The reasoning perspective application represents the critical path, as it directly influences the classification decision through structured analysis of the input text across surface, causal, impact, and comprehensive dimensions.

**Design tradeoffs**: The approach trades model flexibility for reasoning consistency, potentially limiting creative interpretation but improving reliability in inappropriate utterance detection. The manual definition of perspectives requires domain expertise but ensures logical coherence.

**Failure signatures**: Potential failures include: perspectives becoming too rigid and missing nuanced cases, overfitting to specific perspective structures, and inability to handle utterances that don't fit neatly into the four defined categories.

**First experiments**:
1. Compare classification accuracy with and without perspective guidance on the same dataset
2. Test individual perspective effectiveness by disabling each perspective in isolation
3. Evaluate model performance on edge cases that challenge the defined reasoning perspectives

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can an architecture be designed where the model independently constructs reasoning perspectives, removing the need for manual definition?
- Basis: The conclusion states the intent to design an architecture for self-constructed perspectives to ensure accessibility even without domain knowledge.
- Why unresolved: The current method relies on manually pre-defined perspectives (surface, causal, impact, holistic) provided by the researchers.
- What evidence would resolve it: A future study demonstrating a model that dynamically generates and utilizes its own valid reasoning perspectives without human priors.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would integrating humanities-based background knowledge into the perspective design significantly increase the performance improvement margin?
- Basis: The results analysis suggests that designing elaborate perspectives based on humanities knowledge is necessary to increase the performance gains from adding perspective steps.
- Why unresolved: The current study utilized logically defined perspectives but did not incorporate deep humanities metadata to refine them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the current model against a variant trained on perspectives enriched with explicit humanities context.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the soft inductive bias approach generalize effectively to other languages or downstream tasks beyond Korean inappropriate utterance detection?
- Basis: The paper focuses exclusively on Korean conversational text and a specific detection task, while claiming the method prevents reasoning errors.
- Why unresolved: The efficacy of the four specific reasoning perspectives (surface, causal, impact, holistic) is only validated within the linguistic and contextual constraints of the Korean dataset used.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the same reasoning distillation method to a different language or a distinct NLP classification task (e.g., sentiment analysis).

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a single Korean-language dataset without cross-linguistic validation
- No statistical significance testing or confidence intervals reported for accuracy improvements
- Comparison focuses only on supervised learning baselines without benchmarking against state-of-the-art inappropriate content detection methods

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The methodological framework of using explicit reasoning perspectives (surface-level, causal, impact-based, comprehensive) is clearly articulated and represents a novel approach to guiding LLM inference

**Medium confidence**: The reported 87.0046% accuracy and 3.89% improvement over baseline, as these metrics come from single dataset evaluation without statistical validation or cross-validation procedures described

**Low confidence**: Generalization claims about preventing reasoning errors and enabling consistent judgments across different inappropriate utterance detection scenarios, given the narrow scope of evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation with multiple folds on the Kanana dataset and report statistical significance testing (t-tests or ANOVA) to verify that the 3.89% improvement is not due to random variation
2. Evaluate the soft inductive bias approach on multilingual inappropriate utterance datasets to test cross-linguistic generalization of the explicit reasoning framework
3. Benchmark against established inappropriate content detection methods (e.g., toxicity classifiers, hate speech detectors) and domain-specific approaches to contextualize the claimed performance improvements
