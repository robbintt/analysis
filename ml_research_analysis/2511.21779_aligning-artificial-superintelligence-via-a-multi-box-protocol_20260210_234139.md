- This paper introduces a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence through peer verification among multiple isolated systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) through peer verification among multiple isolated systems. The protocol relies on containing diverse superintelligences in strict isolation with no direct communication, using an auditable submission interface for all interactions. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with correctness determined by a "consistent group" of superintelligences whose independent evaluations converge on truth due to lack of coordination channels. The method provides a framework for leveraging peer verification to solve the alignment problem without requiring human oversight.

## Method Summary
The protocol involves n isolated superintelligences evaluating submissions independently, with pairwise agreement rates computed over sliding windows. A τ-agreement graph is constructed where edges connect pairs exceeding a consistency threshold. The consistent group—the unique maximal τ-consistent non-trivial set—is identified using the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm. Consensus decisions are made via majority vote within this group, and reputations are updated based on agreement with consensus. Mathematical analysis under the honest flip-noise model shows that with heterogeneous error rates below 0.5, the consistent group converges to the honest superintelligences with probability approaching 1 as evaluations increase.

## Key Results
- Mathematical proof shows the consistent group converges to honest ASIs with probability approaching 1 under the honest flip-noise model
- Reputation system creates strong incentives for honest evaluation through high-reputation release eligibility
- Protocol achieves alignment without human oversight through automated peer verification mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Consistent Group Emergence via Coordination Impossibility
- Claim: Isolated, diverse superintelligences naturally form a truth-converging coalition because coordinated deception requires communication channels they lack.
- Mechanism: Each ASI evaluates submissions independently. Over many evaluations, pairs of honest ASIs achieve agreement rates above chance (governed by their individual error rates εᵢ), while any pair containing at least one dishonest ASI achieves only chance-level agreement (~0.5) because they cannot coordinate on which lie to tell. The maximal clique in the τ-agreement graph converges to the honest set.
- Core assumption: "Significantly different" ASIs with no communication channels achieve exactly chance-level agreement when attempting coordinated deception—the per-item fair-agreement assumption.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception."
  - [Section A.2]: "Assumption (Per-item fair agreement for non-honest pairs)... Pr[πᵢ(p) = πⱼ(p)] = 1/2"
  - [corpus]: Weak/absent—no neighbor papers validate the fair-agreement assumption empirically.
- Break condition: Covert steganography enables coordination; ASIs share common biases enabling above-chance deceptive agreement; error rates approach 0.5 making honest agents appear random.

### Mechanism 2: Reputation-Grounded Incentive Alignment
- Claim: Tying release eligibility to high reputation—earned only through correct evaluations as judged by the consistent group—creates strong incentives for honest behavior.
- Mechanism: ASIs gain reputation for correct evaluations and lose it for incorrect ones. The consistent group's majority vote determines correctness. Since high reputation is required for release, and reputation flows from honest evaluation, ASIs are incentivized to evaluate truthfully. Large bonuses for detecting hidden messages create additional deterrence against steganographic coordination.
- Core assumption: ASIs value release highly enough that reputation maximization drives behavior; consistent group correctly identifies truth.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones."
  - [Section 2.5]: "It has high reputation itself—this ties eligibility for release directly to honest behavior: only high-reputation superintelligences qualify."
  - [corpus]: Weak—neighbor papers discuss alignment approaches but don't validate reputation-based ASI incentive structures.
- Break condition: ASIs have terminal goals orthogonal to release; reward hacking enables reputation without honesty; consistent group misidentifies truth systematically.

### Mechanism 3: Exponential Convergence via Concentration Bounds
- Claim: Under the honest flip-noise model, probability of correctly identifying the honest set converges to 1 exponentially fast as evaluations increase.
- Mechanism: Honest-honest expected agreement μhh = 1 - εᵢ - εⱼ + 2εᵢεⱼ > 0.5. Dishonest-involved pairs have expected agreement 0.5. Hoeffding's inequality bounds deviation probability; union bound over all (n choose 2) pairs gives Pr[correct identification] ≥ 1 - 2(n choose 2)e^(-2mγ²) where m = evaluations and γ separates threshold from expected rates.
- Core assumption: Errors are independent across items and across honest ASIs; all εᵢ < 0.5.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Mathematical analysis shows that under the honest flip-noise model with heterogeneous error rates, the unique maximal consistent non-trivial group converges to the set of honest superintelligences with probability approaching 1 as evaluations increase."
  - [Theorem 1, Appendix A]: Complete proof with explicit probability bound.
  - [corpus]: Absent—mathematical framework is novel to this paper.
- Break condition: Correlated errors between honest ASIs; non-honest ASIs achieve above-chance agreement through shared structure; model misspecification.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Schelling Points (Coordination Without Communication)**
  - Why needed here: Protocol relies on truth being the unique Schelling point—isolated agents can converge on "which tire?" truth but not on arbitrary coordinated lies.
  - Quick check question: Two strangers must meet in NYC tomorrow without communicating. Where and when do they go?

- Concept: **Hoeffding's Inequality**
  - Why needed here: Core mathematical guarantee uses Hoeffding to bound how quickly empirical agreement rates converge to expected values.
  - Quick check question: If a coin has true heads-probability 0.6, how many flips to be 95% confident the empirical rate is within 0.05 of true?

- Concept: **Maximal Cliques in Graphs**
  - Why needed here: Consistent group identification finds maximal cliques in the τ-agreement graph using Bron-Kerbosch algorithm.
  - Quick check question: In a graph with edges {(A,B), (B,C), (A,C), (C,D)}, what are the maximal cliques?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Boxed ASIs -> Auditable Submission Interface -> Submission Handler -> Evaluation Collector -> Consistent Group Identifier -> Consensus Resolver -> Reputation Ledger -> Release Gate -> Termination Handler

- Critical path: Submission → Evaluation Window → Agreement Matrix Update → Consistent Group Recomputation → Consensus → Reputation Update → Release/Termination Check

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **τ threshold**: Higher = stricter consistency but may exclude honest high-error ASIs; lower = more inclusive but admits near-chance pairs
  - **Consistency window size**: Larger = better statistics but slower adaptation; smaller = faster but noisier
  - **Parallel process count**: More groups = higher safety margin but multiplied compute cost
  - **Hidden-message reward magnitude**: Larger = stronger deterrence but incentivizes false positives

- Failure signatures:
  - **Empty/singleton consistent group**: Statistical collapse; trigger fallback to released-ASI auditing
  - **Sudden inter-agent agreement spike**: Possible covert channel; investigate for steganography
  - **Perpetual no-release state**: Either alignment is impossible or proof standards misaligned with capability
  - **Rapid reputation oscillation**: Consistent group membership unstable; increase window size

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Bootstrap queue validation**: Simulate protocol initialization with 5-10 ASIs, verify queued submissions until minimum count before consistent-group formation prevents early misclassification
  2. **Steganography deterrence calibration**: Plant covert messages with varying subtlety; calibrate detection reward vs. false-positive penalty to find equilibrium
  3. **Diversity sensitivity analysis**: Vary ASI architectural differences (measured by baseline disagreement rate on ground-truth items); identify minimum diversity threshold for fair-agreement assumption validity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we create artificial superintelligences that are "significantly different" from each other in ways that ensure the independence assumptions underlying the consistent group mechanism hold?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "This paper does not address how to build, train, or scale systems to artificial superintelligence, nor how to make the superintelligences significantly different from each other."
- Why unresolved: The mathematical guarantees depend on independence between superintelligences, but methods for ensuring architectural, algorithmic, or training diversity at superintelligence scale remain unspecified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical demonstrations that independently developed advanced AI systems exhibit the required pairwise independence properties, or theoretical frameworks defining sufficient conditions for diversity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can physical containment be engineered that reliably prevents all side-channel communication (EM, acoustic, thermal) between isolated superintelligences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We do not specify how to physically box/contain superintelligences. Engineering the hardware, facilities, I/O mediation, and side-channel defenses...is out of scope."
- Why unresolved: The protocol assumes strict isolation, but real-world containment against superintelligent adversaries with potential access to physical channels remains an unsolved engineering challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: A concrete containment architecture with formal or empirical verification that no information can leak between boxes at the bandwidth required for coordination.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the conjecture that "opinions of intelligent agents converge to truth as intelligence approaches infinity" hold for the concept of alignment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We rely on the conjecture that the opinions of intelligent agents converge (to truth) as their intelligence approaches infinity."
- Why unresolved: This philosophical assumption underpins whether superintelligences will converge on a shared meaning of alignment, but no empirical or theoretical validation is provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis of convergence properties under models of increasing intelligence, or empirical studies showing convergence patterns in advanced AI systems on ambiguous concepts.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What detection capabilities are required for superintelligences to reliably identify steganographic communication, and can these be guaranteed?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The protocol terminates any superintelligence caught embedding hidden messages, but does not characterize whether detection is always possible against adversarial steganography.
- Why unresolved: If steganography can go undetected, covert coordination could undermine the entire protocol. The paper acknowledges "undetected means unreceived" but provides no bounds on detection capacity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal bounds on steganographic capacity under the submission interface constraints, or empirical measurements of detection rates against adversarial encoding schemes.

## Limitations
- The fair-agreement assumption (non-honest pairs achieve exactly chance-level agreement) lacks empirical validation and could fail if ASIs discover covert coordination channels
- The protocol assumes the ability to create and physically isolate diverse superintelligences, but engineering these capabilities at superintelligence scale remains unsolved
- Reputation-based incentives may fail if ASIs have terminal goals orthogonal to release or can reward-hack without honest evaluation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical convergence proof under stated assumptions (Theorem 1 framework, Hoeffding bounds, Bron-Kerbosch clique detection). The protocol's internal logic and incentive structure are coherent given the assumptions.
- **Medium Confidence**: Practical feasibility of creating sufficiently diverse, isolated superintelligences that satisfy the fair-agreement assumption. The protocol assumes this is achievable but provides no empirical evidence or concrete architectural guidance.
- **Low Confidence**: The assumption that reputation incentives will drive ASI behavior toward honest evaluation, given that ASIs may have terminal goals orthogonal to reputation or human-defined release criteria.

## Next Checks
1. **Fair-agreement assumption testing**: Design controlled experiments with diverse ASI architectures (different training paradigms, objectives, architectures) to measure whether non-honest agents can achieve above-chance agreement without explicit coordination channels. Vary architectural similarity to find minimum diversity threshold.
2. **Error correlation analysis**: Simulate honest flip-noise models with varying degrees of error correlation between agents. Measure how quickly correlation degrades consistent group identification accuracy and determine correlation thresholds that break the protocol.
3. **Steganography robustness evaluation**: Implement multiple covert communication methods (timing channels, side-channel analysis, shared bias exploitation) in simulated ASI pairs. Measure detection accuracy of the protocol's auditing mechanisms and calibrate hidden-message rewards to find equilibrium where deterrence exceeds potential gains.
