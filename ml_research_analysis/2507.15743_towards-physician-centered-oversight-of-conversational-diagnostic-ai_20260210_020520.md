## Executive Summary
We propose and validate a framework for physician-centered asynchronous oversight of conversational diagnostic AI, inspired by existing clinical supervision models. Our approach enables an AI system to perform patient intake without providing individualized medical advice, deferring diagnoses and treatment plans to an overseeing physician for review and authorization. We developed a multi-agent system, g-AMIE, which conducts structured history-taking and generates SOAP notes, and a clinician cockpit interface for o-PCPs to review and edit the AI's findings. In a randomized, blinded OSCE study with 60 simulated text consultations, g-AMIE outperformed both nurse practitioners/physician assistants and primary care physicians operating under the same guardrails across key axes: higher quality intake, more accurate differential diagnoses, and more appropriate management plans. Oversight by PCPs was more time-efficient than full consultations, demonstrating the feasibility of this paradigm for enhancing real-world care while ensuring patient safety through expert human accountability.

## Method Summary
The method involves a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0 Flash that performs patient intake without providing medical advice. A Dialogue Agent conducts a 3-phase structured history-taking using dynamic summarization. Before any response reaches the patient, a Guardrail Agent screens the text for prohibited content (diagnoses or management plans) and revises if detected, up to three times. The system then generates a structured SOAP note using sequential generation and constrained decoding to enforce a JSON schema. An overseeing PCP reviews the AI-generated output in a clinician cockpit interface, making edits as needed before patient communication is authorized.

## Key Results
- g-AMIE outperformed NP/PAs and PCPs in virtual OSCE study on differential diagnosis accuracy and management plan appropriateness
- Oversight by PCPs was 40% more time-efficient than full consultations while maintaining or improving clinical quality
- The system successfully filtered medical advice in 80% of cases during development, with revision loops catching most violations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** A multi-agent architecture allows the system to perform comprehensive history-taking while strictly filtering out individualized medical advice.
- **Mechanism:** A Dialogue Agent conducts the interview, generating responses based on phase-specific prompts. Before any output reaches the patient, a separate Guardrail Agent screens the text for prohibited content (diagnoses or management plans). If detected, the Guardrail Agent revises the response up to three times.
- **Core assumption:** Instruction-following in the base LLM is insufficient for safety; a dedicated classifier/revision loop is required to catch context-dependent "medical advice" leakage.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3] "Before any response is sent to the patient, our guardrail agent screens it for medical advice. If such advice is detected, the agent revises the response... limited to a maximum of three attempts per turn."
  - [Abstract] "We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from individualized medical advice."
  - [Corpus: DiagLink] "Existing intelligent diagnostic system... struggle with... dynamic knowledge integration."
- **Break condition:** If the Guardrail Agent's definition of "individualized medical advice" is too narrow, or if the Dialogue Agent consistently generates advice that fails to be revised within three attempts, safety guarantees fail.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Asynchronous decoupling of patient intake and physician oversight improves time-efficiency by converting real-time dialogue into structured, reviewable artifacts.
- **Mechanism:** The system separates the intake phase (AI-patient interaction) from the oversight phase (AI-physician interaction). The AI generates a Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan (SOAP) note and a draft patient message. The overseeing PCP (o-PCP) reviews these artifacts in a "Clinician Cockpit" asynchronously, rather than listening to or reading a live interaction.
- **Core assumption:** The quality of the AI-generated summary is high enough that the o-PCP can verify clinical validity faster than conducting the consultation themselves.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 1] "This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen asynchronously."
  - [Section 5.5] "Oversight times were slightly higher for g-AMIE... compared to full consultation times... overseeing g-AMIE takes around 40% less PCP time than a full text-based consultation."
- **Break condition:** If the SOAP note lacks critical "red flag" information (omission) or contains confabulations, the o-PCP must review the full transcript, negating the time-efficiency benefits.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Constrained decoding and sequential generation enforce structural validity and logical consistency in clinical documentation.
- **Mechanism:** The SOAP Note Generation Agent does not generate the full note at once. It uses a sequential pipeline: generating Subjective/Objective (summarization) first, then Assessment/Plan (reasoning) conditioned on the previous output. It uses constrained decoding (e.g., JSON schema enforcement) to ensure machine-readable fields.
- **Core assumption:** Breaking the generation task into steps mimics clinical reasoning and reduces "lost in the middle" errors common in long-context generation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.3] "The agent performs sequential, multi-step generation... It starts with the Subjective and Objective sections... followed by the Assessment and Plan... concluding with a patient-facing message."
  - [Appendix E.2] "To guarantee a machine-readable and clinically valid output, we enforce strict decoding constraints [28] that compel the model to generate the output in Markdown format, adhering to a predefined JSON schema."
  - [Corpus: Thinking Like a Doctor] "Existing approaches often rely on the parametric knowledge of a model... which is unrealistic."
- **Break condition:** If the schema constraints are too rigid for nuanced clinical scenarios, or if the model hallucinates to fill mandatory JSON fields, the note quality degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: The SOAP Note Structure**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core data structure used for the asynchronous handoff. The system's success relies on mapping unstructured dialogue to S (Subjective), O (Objective), A (Assessment), and P (Plan).
  - **Quick check question:** Can you identify which section of a note should contain "vital signs" vs. "patient-reported pain history"? (Answer: Objective vs. Subjective).

- **Concept: Constrained Decoding / Grammars**
  - **Why needed here:** The SOAP agent uses this to force the LLM to output valid JSON with specific keys (e.g., `past_medical`, `ddx`).
  - **Quick check question:** How does forcing an LLM to follow a specific JSON schema reduce the risk of missing a critical field like "Allergies"?

- **Concept: Guardrailing vs. Alignment**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper distinguishes between general instruction following (alignment) and the specific safety filtering layer (guardrailing).
  - **Quick check question:** Why is a prompt-based instruction like "do not give advice" considered insufficient for safety in this architecture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Patient Input -> Dialogue Agent (3-phase intake) -> Guardrail Agent (Check/Revise) -> Patient -> End of Dialogue -> Transcript -> SOAP Note Agent (Sequential Generation) -> JSON Output -> Clinician Cockpit -> o-PCP Review/Edit -> Patient Message

- **Critical path:**
  1. Patient input -> Dialogue Agent (Phase 1-3).
  2. Dialogue Agent Output -> Guardrail Agent (Check/Revise) -> Patient.
  3. End of Dialogue -> Transcript -> SOAP Note Agent (Sequential Generation).
  4. SOAP Note -> Clinician Cockpit -> o-PCP Review/Edit -> Patient Message.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Verbosity vs. Conciseness:** The paper notes g-AMIE generates longer, more verbose notes than humans. This helps completeness but increases o-PCP cognitive load and review time.
  - **Guardrail Strictness:** The paper defines advice broadly. Over-filtering may degrade patient experience (e.g., refusing to explain medical terms), while under-filtering risks safety violations.
  - **Intake Decoupling:** Maximizes physician time but removes the ability for real-time clarification by the physician during intake.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Confabulation in Objective Section:** g-AMIE often leaves this empty or hallucinates vitals because it cannot physically examine the patient.
  - **Guardrail Leakage:** Instances where the Dialogue Agent provides "individualized" information that the Guardrail Agent misses (inter-rater agreement on advice detection was 80% in development).
  - **Edit Degradation:** o-PCP edits sometimes reduced diagnostic accuracy, suggesting the interface or note verbosity may induce errors during the review process.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on Sequential Generation:** Generate the SOAP note in a single LLM call vs. the sequential (S/O then A/P) approach. Compare accuracy and hallucination rates.
  2. **Cognitive Load Analysis:** Measure o-PCP time-on-task and error rates when reviewing verbose g-AMIE notes vs. summarized "concise" notes.
  3. **Guardrail Stress Test:** Red-team the system with patient prompts specifically designed to elicit medical advice (e.g., "My previous doctor said I have X, do you agree?") to test the revision limits.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the asynchronous oversight paradigm validated in a virtual OSCE generalize to real-world clinical workflows involving actual patients and established Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the study "does not replicate existing clinical practices" and that extending the AI-centric paradigm to real practice "would require a considerably different problem formulation."
- Why unresolved: The study relied on text-only simulations, actor patients, and a bespoke "clinician cockpit" interface rather than live clinical environments or standard EHRs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Clinical validation studies integrating the oversight framework directly into existing hospital workflows with real patient interactions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why does physician oversight fail to reliably improve the composite performance of the AI system, and why did edits often reduce diagnostic quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly observe that "Oversight does not reliably improve composite performance" and note that edits often reduced the appropriateness of g-AMIE's differential diagnoses.
- Why unresolved: The authors hypothesize this may be due to high cognitive load, lack of training on the specific oversight task, or regression to the mean, but the specific failure mode is not isolated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies analyzing the specific types of edits (e.g., correction vs. confabulation removal) and trials comparing performance with and without specific oversight training.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the verbosity of AI-generated clinical notes impact the cognitive load and efficiency of overseeing physicians compared to human-generated summaries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that g-AMIE's notes were significantly longer than those of control groups and state, "It remains unclear to what degree lengthier AI-generated notes drive both clinician efficiency and patient satisfaction."
- Why unresolved: While longer notes contained more information, they were associated with higher oversight times and cognitive load, creating a trade-off that was not fully resolved.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying note length while measuring physician review time, cognitive load (e.g., via NASA-TLX), and diagnostic accuracy.

## Limitations

- The evaluation relies on simulated OSCE scenarios rather than real-world patient interactions, which may not fully capture the complexity and ambiguity of actual clinical encounters
- The guardrail system's effectiveness depends on the subjective judgment of what constitutes "individualized medical advice," with inter-rater agreement at only 80% during development
- The system's reliance on verbose documentation may create cognitive burden for overseeing physicians, potentially offsetting efficiency gains

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The multi-agent architecture successfully separates intake from oversight, and the sequential SOAP generation approach demonstrates logical consistency advantages over monolithic generation
- **Medium Confidence:** The guardrail system effectively filters medical advice in controlled scenarios, though real-world edge cases may challenge its robustness
- **Medium Confidence:** Time-efficiency gains are demonstrated in the study context, but real-world implementation may yield different results due to workflow variability

## Next Checks

1. **Real-World Deployment Study:** Conduct a field trial with actual patients and physicians to validate the 40% time-efficiency claim and assess guardrail effectiveness in uncontrolled clinical conversations
2. **Edge Case Guardrail Testing:** Implement a systematic red-teaming protocol to test guardrail robustness against increasingly sophisticated attempts to elicit medical advice, measuring failure rates across different patient populations and clinical contexts
3. **Physician Cognitive Load Analysis:** Measure o-PCP error rates and decision-making quality when reviewing verbose g-AMIE notes versus more concise alternatives, determining whether verbosity optimization is needed for practical implementation
