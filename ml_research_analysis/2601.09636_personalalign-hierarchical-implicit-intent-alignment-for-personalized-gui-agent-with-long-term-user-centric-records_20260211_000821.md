# PersonalAlign: Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent with Long-Term User-Centric Records

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09636
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09636
- Reference count: 28
- Introduces PersonalAlign task requiring GUI agents to infer and align with users' implicit intents using long-term interaction records

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PersonalAlign, a task that requires GUI agents to infer and align with users' implicit intents by leveraging long-term interaction records. The authors construct AndroidIntent, a benchmark annotated with 775 user preferences and 215 routines from 20,000 records, and propose HIM-Agent, a hierarchical memory framework that organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Experiments show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution (by 15.7%) and proactive performance (by 7.3%) over existing GUI agents. The work highlights the challenge of handling vague instructions and the difficulty in balancing proactive accuracy, showing that current GUI agents struggle to provide reliable proactive suggestions without stronger context analysis capabilities.

## Method Summary
The authors propose HIM-Agent, a hierarchical memory framework that organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. The framework leverages long-term user interaction records to infer implicit intents and align GUI agent behavior accordingly. The AndroidIntent benchmark provides annotated data with 775 user preferences and 215 routines from 20,000 interaction records, enabling evaluation of personalized GUI agent performance.

## Key Results
- HIM-Agent improves execution performance by 15.7% over existing GUI agents
- HIM-Agent improves proactive performance by 7.3% over existing GUI agents
- Current GUI agents struggle to provide reliable proactive suggestions without stronger context analysis capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hierarchical memory framework enables effective organization and retrieval of user preferences and routines from long-term interaction records. By structuring memory hierarchically, HIM-Agent can efficiently match current contexts with learned patterns, allowing for more accurate intent inference and personalized responses. The long-term records provide rich context that helps resolve vague instructions and enables proactive suggestions based on learned user behavior patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hierarchical memory organization**: Needed for efficient storage and retrieval of user preferences and routines; quick check: verify memory access times scale logarithmically with record count
- **Implicit intent inference**: Required to handle vague or incomplete user instructions; quick check: measure intent prediction accuracy on ambiguous commands
- **Long-term user behavior modeling**: Essential for capturing patterns and routines; quick check: evaluate routine prediction accuracy over extended time periods
- **Context-aware proactive suggestion**: Enables timely and relevant recommendations; quick check: assess suggestion precision and recall on diverse user scenarios
- **Personalization through interaction records**: Allows adaptation to individual user preferences; quick check: compare performance across different user profiles
- **Vague instruction resolution**: Critical for handling real-world user inputs; quick check: measure accuracy on intentionally ambiguous commands

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User Interaction Records -> Hierarchical Memory Module -> Intent Inference Engine -> GUI Execution Layer -> Proactive Suggestion System
- **Critical path**: User interaction → Memory lookup → Intent alignment → Action execution → Feedback collection
- **Design tradeoffs**: Hierarchical memory vs. flat storage (efficiency vs. complexity), proactive suggestions vs. user control (helpfulness vs. intrusiveness)
- **Failure signatures**: Incorrect intent inference leading to wrong actions, over-proactive suggestions causing user frustration, memory overload from excessive records
- **First experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing hierarchical memory to measure performance impact, 2) Evaluation of proactive suggestion precision vs. recall trade-offs, 3) Cross-user testing to assess personalization effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Uncertainty about whether 775 user preferences and 215 routines sufficiently represent real-world user behavior diversity across different demographics and usage patterns
- Evaluation focuses on Android platforms, raising questions about generalizability to other operating systems or GUI environments
- Acknowledged but unresolved trade-off between proactive accuracy and suggestion reliability, suggesting potential for unwanted or incorrect suggestions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The reported 15.7% improvement in execution performance and the framework's ability to leverage long-term records for intent alignment
- **Medium confidence**: The generalizability of findings beyond Android platforms and the real-world applicability of the proactive suggestion system
- **Medium confidence**: The sufficiency of the AndroidIntent benchmark for capturing the full complexity of user preferences and routines

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-platform validation studies to test HIM-Agent's performance on iOS and desktop GUI environments
2. Perform longitudinal studies with diverse user demographics to assess how well the framework adapts to different user groups and usage patterns over extended periods
3. Implement controlled user studies comparing HIM-Agent's proactive suggestions against ground truth preferences to quantify the precision-recall trade-off in real-world scenarios
