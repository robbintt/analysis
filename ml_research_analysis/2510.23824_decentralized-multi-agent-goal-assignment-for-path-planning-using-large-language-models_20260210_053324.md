# Decentralized Multi-Agent Goal Assignment for Path Planning using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.23824
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23824
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** GPT-4.1 agents with structured prompts achieved makespans near optimal solver without centralized planning, outperforming greedy and random baselines

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that large language models can serve as highly effective decentralized agents for goal assignment in multi-agent grid environments when provided with structured prompts and explicit quantitative information. Using GPT-4.1-based agents, the research achieved makespans close to optimal solver performance without centralized planning, consistently outperforming both greedy and random assignment strategies. The results highlight the crucial role of prompt design and input structure in enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs for collaborative tasks, providing new benchmarks for language-model-driven coordination in scalable, decentralized multi-agent systems.

## Method Summary
The research evaluates decentralized goal assignment for multi-agent path planning in fully observable grid-world environments. Agents independently generate ranked goal preferences using structured prompts containing grid images, agent-goal distance tables, and chain-of-thought reasoning checklists. Assignments are resolved through deterministic index ordering without negotiation. The method compares four approaches: greedy nearest-goal assignment, random assignment, centralized brute-force optimal, and LLM-based agents (GPT-4.1 and LLaVA). Experiments use 100 randomly generated 20×20 grids with 2-6 agents and goals, measuring makespan as the primary metric.

## Key Results
- GPT-4.1 agents with distance tables achieved makespan of 15.12 versus optimal 14.85
- Performance degraded to 17.67 makespan without distance tables (comparable to greedy 17.93)
- Re-ranking each step slightly improved results (15.12 vs 15.50) compared to ranking once
- LLaVA models performed worse than random assignment at scale due to unstable strategy shifts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured prompts with chain-of-thought reasoning enable LLMs to approximate globally optimal assignments in decentralized settings.
- Mechanism: The prompt design forces agents through explicit reasoning steps—listing goals, estimating distances, drafting full assignments, comparing alternatives—before producing rankings. This scaffolding reduces locally greedy choices and encourages consideration of team-level makespan.
- Core assumption: LLMs can reliably execute multi-step reasoning checklists when explicitly instructed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans"
  - [section IV.A] "We employ explicit step-by-step checklists and structured reasoning sections in the prompt to elicit more consistent and globally informed choices from LLM agents"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related work suggests in-context learning aids coordination but does not validate CoT-specific effects.
- Break condition: If prompts omit structured checklists or agents skip intermediate steps, performance degrades toward greedy baselines.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Explicit quantitative information (agent-goal distance tables) is the primary driver of near-optimal LLM performance.
- Mechanism: Distance tables ground LLM reasoning in exact path costs, bypassing the model's unreliable spatial inference from grid images alone. This reduces estimation errors and enables accurate makespan comparisons.
- Core assumption: BFS-computed distances accurately reflect true navigation costs (no dynamic obstacles or inter-agent path conflicts during traversal).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPT-4.1-based agents...achieved makespans close to the optimal solver without centralized planning"
  - [section VI, Table I] With distances: 15.12 makespan; without distances: 17.67 (comparable to greedy 17.93)
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on distance table effects; assumption remains paper-specific.
- Break condition: If distance computation is inaccurate or tables are omitted, LLM performance collapses toward heuristic levels.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Deterministic conflict resolution (agent index ordering) paired with decentralized ranking enables scalable coordination without negotiation.
- Mechanism: Agents independently compute ranked preferences, then a fixed rule assigns contested goals to lower-index agents. This eliminates iterative communication overhead while guaranteeing unique assignments.
- Core assumption: All agents have identical world knowledge and conflict-resolution rules are known a priori.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent index ordering), without negotiation"
  - [section IV] "In the event of a conflict, the agent with the lowest index receives priority"
  - [corpus] Related work addresses belief coordination but not index-based conflict rules specifically.
- Break condition: If agents have inconsistent world views or resolution rules vary, assignments may conflict or produce deadlocks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Makespan minimization**
  - Why needed here: The objective function for all experiments; understanding that minimizing max arrival time differs from minimizing total distance.
  - Quick check question: Why might assigning an agent to its nearest goal increase overall makespan?

- **Concept: Breadth-first search (BFS) for shortest paths**
  - Why needed here: BFS computes the distance tables that ground LLM reasoning; assumes uniform edge costs in grid environments.
  - Quick check question: What assumption does BFS make about movement costs between adjacent cells?

- **Concept: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting**
  - Why needed here: The primary technique for eliciting structured reasoning from LLMs; explains why prompt design matters more than model choice alone.
  - Quick check question: How does CoT differ from standard prompting in terms of intermediate output requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Environment Generator -> Distance Oracle (BFS) -> Prompt Constructor -> LLM Agent (per agent) -> Conflict Resolver -> Path Executor

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate scenario -> compute distances -> construct prompts -> LLM inference -> collect rankings -> resolve conflicts -> execute paths -> measure makespan

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - With vs. without distance tables: Accuracy vs. reliance on external computation
  - Rank-once vs. re-rank-every-step: Computation cost vs. adaptability (paper shows re-ranking slightly better: 15.12 vs. 15.50)
  - GPT-4.1 vs. LLaVA: Cost/latency vs. reasoning stability (LLaVA performed worse than random at scale due to unstable strategy shifts)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - LLM output not parseable as complete ranking -> fallback to greedy
  - Distance tables inconsistent with actual grid -> assignment quality degrades
  - LLaVA-style strategy oscillation -> makespan exceeds random baseline

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce the greedy baseline on 10 random 20×20 grids with 4 agents; verify BFS distances and makespan computation match paper methodology.
  2. Test GPT-4.1 with distance tables vs. without on 20 scenarios; confirm the ~2.5-step performance gap reported in Table I.
  3. Introduce a single-agent conflict (two agents preferring same goal) and verify index-order resolution produces unique assignments without negotiation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of decentralized LLM-based goal assignment scale with team sizes significantly larger than the six agents tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion explicitly lists "larger team sizes" as a necessary direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to a maximum of six agents; computational complexity and coordination difficulty may increase non-linearly for LLMs in larger groups.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks showing makespan and token usage in scenarios with 20, 50, or 100 agents.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can LLM-based agents maintain near-optimal coordination in dynamic environments with moving obstacles or partial observability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion identifies "dynamic obstacles" and "partial observability" as limitations of the current study, and the Conclusion suggests exploring "dynamic settings."
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies on static, fully observable grids; real-world application requires handling uncertainty and state changes that may disrupt the LLMs' reasoning chains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of agent performance in grid-worlds where obstacles move or agents lack full knowledge of other agents' positions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does replacing the deterministic conflict-resolution rule with LLM-driven negotiation improve assignment efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that agents "did not participate in... negotiation" (Section VII), yet the Conclusion calls for "richer agent communication protocols."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if LLMs can effectively self-resolve conflicts without the hard-coded, fixed agent index ordering used in the study.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments where agents must reach consensus through iterative dialogue rather than a fixed rule.

## Limitations

- The study assumes deterministic agent behavior and identical world knowledge, without addressing how agents would handle dynamic obstacles or inter-agent path conflicts during execution.
- Comparison with LLaVA models shows performance degradation at scale, suggesting model choice significantly impacts reliability for multi-agent coordination tasks.
- Exact prompt template and checklist wording details are referenced but not fully reproduced in the paper text.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core claim that structured prompts with distance tables enable GPT-4.1 agents to achieve near-optimal makespans is well-supported by the experimental results (makespan 15.12 vs optimal 14.85).
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism explaining why chain-of-thought prompting improves performance is plausible but relies on the assumption that LLMs reliably execute multi-step reasoning when explicitly instructed.
- **Low Confidence**: The scalability claims beyond 6 agents remain untested, as all experiments used 2-6 agents only.

## Next Checks

1. Test the same prompt structure with smaller grid sizes (e.g., 10×10) where optimal solutions can be exhaustively verified, to confirm the CoT mechanism works as intended across different scales.

2. Implement a dynamic obstacle scenario where obstacles appear during agent movement, and evaluate whether the LLM agents can adapt their assignments or require complete replanning.

3. Compare the LLM-based approach against a distributed auction algorithm variant to determine whether the performance gain comes from LLM reasoning or simply from having complete distance information available to all agents.
