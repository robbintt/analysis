# Multitask Multimodal Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Images

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.23325
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23325
- **Reference count**: 20
- **Primary result**: Medformer achieves state-of-the-art multitask medical image classification across 18 MedMNIST datasets using self-supervised pretraining

## Executive Summary
This thesis develops advanced self-supervised learning techniques for medical image analysis, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data. The core contribution is Medformer, a neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain adaptation that handles varying medical image types from 2D X-rays to complex 3D MRIs. The research introduces innovative SSL pretext tasks validated through rigorous experimentation using the MedMNIST dataset, demonstrating that Medformer can effectively learn generalized features applicable to various downstream tasks while reducing reliance on large labeled datasets.

## Method Summary
The method uses a transformer backbone with Input Adaptformer modules that inject domain-specific priors via cross-attention between input tokens and latent embeddings for dimensionality, modality, and body part. A shared main body learns task-agnostic representations while Output Adaptformer modules with task-specific latents route domain information to classification heads. The approach employs VICReg-based self-supervised pretraining on multi-modal unlabeled data, followed by multi-task training with domain-aware batching to improve parameter efficiency without catastrophic interference.

## Key Results
- Medformer effectively processes heterogeneous medical images (2D/3D, multiple modalities) without architectural changes
- VICReg-based self-supervised pretraining improves downstream performance, especially for data-scarce tasks (+0.094 AUC improvement for DermaMNIST)
- Multi-task training with domain-aware batching matches or exceeds single-task performance on 14/18 datasets
- The approach reduces reliance on large labeled datasets while maintaining or improving predictive accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Learnable latent embeddings enable a single transformer backbone to process heterogeneous medical images without architectural changes. Adaptformer modules inject domain-specific priors via cross-attention between input tokens and latent embeddings for dimensionality, modality, and body part. The shared backbone remains task-agnostic while latents modulate attention patterns.

### Mechanism 2
VICReg-based self-supervised pretraining on multi-modal unlabeled data improves downstream performance, especially for data-scarce tasks. The pretraining objective enforces invariance between augmented views of the same sample while maintaining variance across embedding dimensions and reducing covariance between them.

### Mechanism 3
Multi-task training with domain-aware batching improves parameter efficiency without catastrophic interference. Each mini-batch samples from multiple datasets; the Input Adaptformer selects appropriate latents per-sample. Gradient updates are shared across tasks through the backbone, but task-specific latents in the Output Adaptformer isolate final predictions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Self-Supervised Pretext Tasks**
  - **Why needed here**: The thesis relies on SSL to pretrain on unlabeled medical images. Understanding that pretext tasks generate supervisory signals from data structure is essential.
  - **Quick check**: Can you explain why VICReg doesn't need negative pairs, unlike SimCLR?

- **Concept: Cross-Attention in Transformers**
  - **Why needed here**: Adaptformers use cross-attention between input tokens and latent embeddings. You must understand how queries from one sequence attend to keys/values from another.
  - **Quick check**: In the Input Adaptformer, which sequence provides queries and which provides keys/values?

- **Concept: Medical Image Heterogeneity**
  - **Why needed here**: The thesis motivation hinges on why medical images are harder to unify than natural images (modality differences, standardized acquisition creating visual similarity, subtle pathological differences).
  - **Quick check**: Why does high visual similarity between medical images challenge contrastive SSL methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw Input (2D/3D) -> [Patchify + Positional Encoding] -> [Input Adaptformer] -> [Main Body: Task-agnostic Transformer] -> [Output Adaptformer] -> [Task-specific Head] -> logits
- **Critical path**: Input Adaptformer conditioning → Main Body representation learning → Output Adaptformer task routing. The Main Body is where transfer learning occurs; Adaptformers are where domain specialization happens.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Small model (28×28 input) offers lower compute but loses fine-grained details; large model (224×224) captures subtle features but requires 140GB GPU memory. Single vs. Multi-Adaptformer balances parameter sharing against specialization.
- **Failure signatures**: Loss not decreasing suggests checking latent embedding initialization; good training but poor validation accuracy indicates overfitting; 3D tasks worse than 2D suggests insufficient batch size or 3D pretraining data.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline single-task on PathMNIST to validate pipeline (~97% accuracy expected); 2) Multi-task training on 3 similar CT abdominal datasets to verify no degradation; 3) SSL pretraining → fine-tune on BreastMNIST (780 samples) to validate SSL benefits for data-scarce scenarios.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results primarily validated on MedMNIST datasets with controlled acquisition protocols, not clinical-grade datasets with natural variations
- VICReg SSL pretraining conducted without evaluation of pretraining data composition effects or comparison to supervised pretraining baselines
- Claims of generalizability based on internal dataset diversity rather than external validation on completely unseen modalities

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Medformer architecture implementation and training pipeline functionality; multi-task training avoids catastrophic interference; VicReg SSL improves performance on small datasets within MedMNIST
- **Medium confidence**: Transfer learning benefits from shared backbone across dissimilar modalities; SSL pretraining generalizes to unseen medical imaging tasks; latent embedding conditioning effectively routes domain-specific information
- **Low confidence**: Performance claims on real-world clinical datasets with natural variations; scalability to much larger input resolutions without architectural modifications; effectiveness for rare diseases with extremely limited samples

## Next Checks
1. **External validation**: Evaluate Medformer on at least two external medical imaging datasets (e.g., CheXpert for chest X-rays, BraTS for brain tumors) to test generalizability beyond MedMNIST
2. **Pretraining data sensitivity**: Systematically vary the composition and size of SSL pretraining data to quantify the relationship between pretraining corpus characteristics and downstream performance
3. **Clinical relevance assessment**: Conduct radiologist review of model predictions on challenging cases to evaluate whether learned features align with clinical diagnostic reasoning rather than dataset artifacts
