# MiRAGE: A Multiagent Framework for Generating Multimodal Multihop Question-Answer Dataset for RAG Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.15487
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15487
- Reference count: 40
- Multiagent framework generates domain-specific, multimodal, multi-hop QA datasets for RAG evaluation

## Executive Summary
MiRAGE is a multiagent framework designed to generate domain-specific, multimodal, multi-hop question-answer datasets for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. It employs specialized agents including recursive context optimization, adversarial verification, and domain-expert persona injection to synthesize complex QA pairs grounded in technical documents with both text and visual elements. Across four domains (finance, regulation, science, and journalism), MiRAGE produces datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and strong factual faithfulness (up to 0.97) while maintaining thematic alignment with source domains.

## Method Summary
MiRAGE operates through a swarm of specialized agents that work collaboratively to generate high-quality QA datasets. The framework begins by selecting relevant source documents and extracting both text and visual elements. A multi-hop question generator creates complex questions requiring multiple reasoning steps, while the context builder optimizes the retrieval context. The adversarial verifier ensures question complexity and difficulty, and the domain expert persona agent maintains thematic consistency. Visual elements are processed through a visual agent that generates descriptions when direct analysis is unavailable. The final output consists of structured question-answer pairs that can be used to evaluate RAG system performance across multiple dimensions including reasoning depth, factual accuracy, and domain relevance.

## Key Results
- Generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) compared to baseline approaches
- Achieves strong factual faithfulness scores (up to 0.97) while maintaining thematic alignment with source domains
- Ablation studies demonstrate critical importance of context building, verification, and domain conditioning components
- Remains effective with LLMs when visual descriptions are provided, though visual grounding remains challenging

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MiRAGE's effectiveness stems from its multiagent architecture that decomposes the complex task of dataset generation into specialized sub-tasks. Each agent addresses a specific challenge: the recursive context optimizer ensures retrieval quality, the adversarial verifier maintains question difficulty, and the domain expert persona agent preserves thematic consistency. This specialization allows the framework to generate questions that require genuine multi-hop reasoning while remaining grounded in factual source material. The combination of automated quality checks with domain-specific conditioning creates datasets that are both challenging for RAG systems and representative of real-world technical documentation.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-hop reasoning**: Understanding how questions requiring multiple inference steps can be systematically generated
- Why needed: To evaluate RAG systems' ability to perform complex reasoning across multiple documents
- Quick check: Can the framework generate questions that require combining information from at least three different source elements?

**Multimodal processing**: Integration of text and visual information in question generation
- Why needed: Technical documents often contain crucial visual elements that must be incorporated into QA pairs
- Quick check: Does the framework maintain quality when visual descriptions must substitute for actual image analysis?

**Adversarial verification**: Using opposing agents to ensure question difficulty and quality
- Why needed: To prevent the generation of trivial or easily answerable questions
- Quick check: Does the verifier successfully filter out questions that can be answered with single-hop reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Document selection -> Text/Visual extraction -> Multi-hop question generation -> Context building -> Adversarial verification -> Domain conditioning -> QA output

**Critical path**: The most important sequence is Context building -> Multi-hop question generation -> Adversarial verification, as these directly determine question quality and complexity

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Specialization vs. integration: More specialized agents improve quality but increase complexity
- Automation vs. control: Higher automation reduces manual oversight but may miss edge cases
- Visual grounding vs. description reliance: Direct image analysis provides better quality but requires stronger model capabilities

**Failure signatures**:
- Low complexity scores indicate context building or question generation failures
- Poor faithfulness scores suggest verification or domain conditioning issues
- Inconsistent domain alignment points to persona agent problems

**Three first experiments**:
1. Generate a simple single-hop question from a single document and verify basic functionality
2. Test multi-hop generation with two documents to validate reasoning complexity
3. Evaluate visual element integration using both direct image analysis and description-based approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges several open questions regarding MiRAGE's generalizability across diverse technical domains, as validation was limited to four specific areas. The framework's reliance on strong multimodal capabilities in underlying LLMs raises concerns about scalability when visual grounding is required. Additionally, the manual evaluation sample size may not fully capture edge cases or systematic biases in the generated datasets.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability across diverse technical domains, validated only on finance, regulation, science, and journalism
- Heavy reliance on strong multimodal capabilities in underlying LLMs for visual grounding
- Manual evaluation sample size (100 examples per domain) may miss systematic biases or edge cases
- Performance with abstract or domain-specific imagery remains challenging

## Confidence
- **High**: The multiagent architecture's core design and its effectiveness in generating complex multi-hop questions with improved reasoning depth
- **Medium**: Claims about domain-specific alignment and factual faithfulness, given the limited domain scope
- **Medium**: Effectiveness of ablation studies, though some critical components may interact in ways not fully isolated
- **Low**: Generalization to completely novel domains or specialized technical fields not represented in the evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain transferability test: Apply MiRAGE to 2-3 additional technical domains (e.g., medical, engineering, legal) and evaluate consistency in complexity metrics and faithfulness scores
2. Large-scale automated evaluation: Implement comprehensive automated validation pipelines to assess dataset quality across thousands of examples rather than the current 100-sample manual evaluation
3. Visual grounding robustness test: Systematically evaluate MiRAGE's performance with progressively more abstract or domain-specific visual content to quantify the impact of visual description availability on final QA quality
