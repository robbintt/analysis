# Enhancing New-item Fairness in Dynamic Recommender Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.21362
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21362
- Reference count: 40
- FairAgent increases new-item exposure up to 30%, reduces TGF by 86.34%, and improves HR by 39.41% on KuaiRec-Small

## Executive Summary
FairAgent introduces a reinforcement learning framework to address new-item fairness in dynamic recommender systems, where continuous introduction of new items and evolving user preferences create persistent fairness challenges. The method integrates knowledge distillation and a novel multi-component reward mechanism—balancing new-item exploration, fairness, and accuracy—to adapt recommendations over time. Experiments on three public datasets show FairAgent significantly increases exposure for new items while improving fairness metrics and maintaining high recommendation accuracy.

## Method Summary
FairAgent employs a reinforcement learning approach to dynamically recommend items in environments with continuous new-item introduction and shifting user preferences. The framework uses knowledge distillation to leverage historical user behavior patterns and introduces a novel reward mechanism with three components: new-item exploration reward to promote exposure of new items, fairness reward to ensure equitable treatment across item ages, and accuracy reward to maintain recommendation quality. This design allows the system to adaptively balance fairness and accuracy while responding to evolving user preferences in real time.

## Key Results
- New-item exposure increased up to 30% on tested datasets
- TGF (Time-to-General Fairness) reduced by 86.34% on average
- HR (Hit Rate) improved by 39.41% on KuaiRec-Small while maintaining fairness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FairAgent's effectiveness stems from its integration of reinforcement learning with a multi-component reward system that explicitly accounts for new-item exploration, fairness, and accuracy. The knowledge distillation component enables the model to leverage historical user behavior, improving adaptability to evolving preferences. The reward mechanism ensures that the agent is incentivized to promote new-item exposure without sacrificing recommendation accuracy, addressing the inherent trade-off in dynamic environments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Enables adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments where user preferences and item pools change over time; quick check: agent learns optimal policy via reward maximization.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfers knowledge from historical user behavior models to improve generalization and stability; quick check: student model mimics teacher model outputs.
- **Multi-Objective Reward Design**: Balances competing goals (fairness, accuracy, exploration) through weighted reward components; quick check: reward weights tuned to achieve target fairness-accuracy trade-off.
- **Dynamic Recommender Systems**: Systems that must adapt to continuous item introduction and evolving user preferences; quick check: performance metrics tracked over time.
- **New-Item Fairness**: Ensuring newly introduced items receive equitable exposure relative to established items; quick check: exposure distribution analyzed by item age.
- **TGF (Time-to-General Fairness)**: Metric measuring how quickly fairness is achieved across item groups; quick check: lower TGF indicates faster fairness convergence.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User behavior data -> Knowledge distillation module -> RL agent with multi-component reward -> Recommendation output -> Environment feedback
**Critical Path**: User feedback → Knowledge distillation → RL agent → Recommendation → Environment → Updated feedback
**Design Tradeoffs**: Knowledge distillation improves stability but may slow adaptation; reward balancing is critical to avoid over-prioritizing fairness at the expense of accuracy.
**Failure Signatures**: Over-exploration of new items leading to accuracy drops; insufficient fairness gains due to poor reward weighting; model collapse if knowledge distillation is too rigid.
**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing knowledge distillation; 2) Single-reward ablation (fairness-only, accuracy-only, exploration-only); 3) Long-term stability test across multiple time windows.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided.

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize to larger-scale production systems with millions of items.
- Fairness gains and accuracy maintenance need validation over longer time horizons.
- Model performance is sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly reward trade-off coefficients.

## Confidence
- High: New-item exposure increases (up to 30%) and fairness improvements (TGF reduction 86.34%) are directly measured and reported.
- Medium: Accuracy maintenance (HR improvement 39.41% on KuaiRec-Small) may not generalize across all datasets due to varying baselines and limited evaluation scope.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal study to assess the stability of fairness and accuracy metrics over extended periods and under shifting user preferences.
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of knowledge distillation and each reward component to overall performance.
3. Test FairAgent on larger-scale, real-world datasets with millions of items to confirm scalability and robustness in production environments.
