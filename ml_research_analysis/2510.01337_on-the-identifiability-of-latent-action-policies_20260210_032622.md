# On the Identifiability of Latent Action Policies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01337
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01337
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proves that under certain assumptions, entropy-regularized LAPO guarantees identifiability of latent action policies satisfying determinism, disentanglement, and informativeness

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental question of when learned latent action representations in reinforcement learning can be identified and guaranteed to satisfy key desiderata. The author formalizes three critical properties for latent action policies: determinism (actions deterministically produce outcomes), disentanglement from state (action semantics are independent of context), and informativeness (actions contain sufficient information for policy learning). Under assumptions including continuous transition models and injective actions, the paper proves that an entropy-regularized LAPO (Latent Action Policy Optimization) objective ensures these properties are satisfied, providing theoretical justification for why discrete action representations work well in practice.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing latent action policy identifiability by defining three desiderata and proving conditions under which they can be guaranteed. The core approach uses entropy-regularized optimization to maximize mutual information between actions and their effects while maintaining continuity and injectivity constraints. The author establishes that when these conditions hold, the learned encoder satisfies determinism, disentanglement from state, and informativeness properties, which in turn ensure statistical efficiency in downstream policy learning.

## Key Results
- Proves that entropy-regularized LAPO guarantees identifiability of encoders satisfying determinism, disentanglement, and informativeness
- Establishes that these three desiderata ensure statistical efficiency in downstream policy learning
- Shows that continuity of transition models and injectivity of actions are sufficient conditions for the theoretical guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's theoretical framework works by establishing a formal connection between latent action representations and their effects on the environment. By maximizing mutual information between actions and outcomes while enforcing entropy regularization, the approach ensures that learned representations capture the essential structure needed for effective policy learning. The injectivity assumption ensures that different actions produce distinguishable outcomes, while continuity guarantees that similar actions produce similar effects, enabling stable learning.

## Foundational Learning

**Entropy Regularization**: A technique that encourages exploration by adding an entropy term to the objective function, preventing premature convergence to suboptimal deterministic policies. Needed to balance exploitation and exploration in latent action spaces. Quick check: Verify that the entropy term prevents collapse to deterministic policies during training.

**Mutual Information Maximization**: Measures the statistical dependence between actions and their effects, ensuring that learned representations capture meaningful environmental interactions. Required to guarantee informativeness of latent actions. Quick check: Confirm that mutual information between actions and effects increases during training.

**Injectivity of Actions**: Ensures that different latent actions map to distinct outcomes, preventing ambiguity in the learned representation space. Critical for guaranteeing determinism of the learned encoder. Quick check: Test whether small perturbations in latent actions produce distinguishable state changes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment -> State Encoder -> Latent Action Space -> Action Decoder -> Environment

**Critical Path**: State observation → Latent action encoding → Action execution → State transition → Effect measurement → Mutual information update

**Design Tradeoffs**: The paper trades off representational richness for identifiability guarantees, focusing on discrete action spaces where injectivity is more easily satisfied. This contrasts with continuous action representations that may offer more flexibility but lack theoretical guarantees.

**Failure Signatures**: Loss of injectivity leads to ambiguous action effects; violation of continuity assumptions results in unstable learning dynamics; insufficient entropy regularization causes premature convergence to suboptimal policies.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test LAPO objective on simple grid-world environments with discrete action spaces to verify theoretical guarantees
2. Evaluate sensitivity to violations of injectivity assumption by introducing action ambiguities
3. Compare entropy-regularized LAPO with standard RL objectives on environments requiring precise action control

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The injectivity assumption may not hold in complex real-world environments with high-dimensional action spaces
- Results depend heavily on continuity assumptions that may be violated in environments with discontinuous dynamics
- Focus on entropy-regularized LAPO may limit applicability to other regularization schemes or objective functions

## Confidence
- Theoretical proofs under stated assumptions: High
- Practical applicability across diverse environments: Medium
- Generalizability to continuous action spaces: Low
- Robustness to assumption violations: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Empirical testing of the LAPO objective across diverse environments with varying action space complexities to assess real-world identifiability
2. Investigation of the impact of relaxing the injectivity assumption on action representations
3. Comparison of entropy-regularized LAPO with alternative regularization approaches in terms of both identifiability and downstream policy performance
