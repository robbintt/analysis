# An invertible generative model for forward and inverse problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.03910
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03910
- Reference count: 40
- Proposes a novel generative model framework for solving both forward and inverse problems using invertible mappings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a unified generative model framework for solving both forward and inverse problems in scientific computing. The key innovation is an invertible mapping S: R^(n+m) → R^(n+m) that can handle both simulation (sampling from likelihood) and inference (sampling from posterior). The approach combines two triangular normalizing flows - one upper and one lower - into a single invertible mapping. The framework is demonstrated on linear and nonlinear inverse problems as well as an inpainting task, showing promising results for generating samples from both likelihood and posterior distributions.

## Method Summary
The proposed method constructs an invertible mapping S by combining upper and lower triangular normalizing flows. This structure allows the model to handle conditional distributions while maintaining invertibility. The training loss can be evaluated directly on S and its inverse, making the learning process efficient. For linear Gaussian cases, the authors provide an analytical solution showing improved conditioning properties compared to traditional transport maps. The framework operates by learning a transformation that maps between latent space and data space, enabling both forward simulation and inverse inference through the same learned mapping.

## Key Results
- Successfully generates samples from both likelihood and posterior distributions
- Analytical solution for linear Gaussian case shows better conditioning than traditional transport maps
- Demonstrated effectiveness on linear and nonlinear inverse problems and inpainting tasks
- Framework provides unified approach for both forward simulation and inverse inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the properties of triangular normalizing flows to create an invertible mapping that can handle conditional distributions. The upper and lower triangular structure ensures that each dimension depends only on previous dimensions in a predictable way, enabling efficient computation of both the forward and inverse mappings. This structure is particularly well-suited for inverse problems where we need to sample from conditional distributions. The analytical solution for the linear Gaussian case demonstrates that this approach provides better numerical stability than traditional methods.

## Foundational Learning
- **Triangular normalizing flows**: Needed to ensure invertibility while maintaining computational efficiency. Quick check: Verify that the Jacobian is triangular and easily invertible.
- **Conditional distributions**: Essential for inverse problems where we condition on observed data. Quick check: Ensure the model can properly handle conditioning on different observation patterns.
- **Transport maps**: Traditional approach for similar problems; the proposed method improves upon them. Quick check: Compare conditioning properties with standard transport maps.
- **Invertible neural networks**: Core requirement for the unified forward/inverse approach. Quick check: Verify that both forward and inverse passes are computationally tractable.
- **Latent variable models**: The framework learns a mapping between latent space and observation space. Quick check: Ensure the latent space captures the relevant structure of the problem.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data -> Triangular Flows (Upper + Lower) -> Latent Space <-> Data Space -> Posterior/Sampling

Critical path: Input data → Triangular flow transformation → Latent representation → Inverse transformation for sampling

Design tradeoffs: The triangular structure ensures invertibility but may limit expressivity compared to general flow architectures. This tradeoff is acceptable because the focus is on conditional distributions where triangular structure is natural.

Failure signatures: Poor conditioning in the linear case, inability to capture complex nonlinear relationships, limited expressivity for highly structured data.

First experiments:
1. Test on a simple 1D linear inverse problem with Gaussian noise to verify the analytical solution
2. Evaluate on a 2D nonlinear inverse problem with known ground truth to assess accuracy
3. Test the inpainting capability on synthetic image data with varying mask patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis is limited to linear Gaussian cases with analytical solutions
- Triangular flow architecture may have limited expressivity compared to other flow designs
- Experimental evaluation is relatively limited with few benchmark problems tested
- Scalability to high-dimensional problems needs further investigation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the proposed approach on a larger set of benchmark inverse problems, including both linear and nonlinear cases, and compare with state-of-the-art methods.
2. Analyze the scalability and performance of the method for high-dimensional problems, and investigate the impact of the triangular flow architecture on expressivity.
3. Investigate the robustness of the approach to different choices of prior distributions and noise models, beyond the Gaussian case considered in the theoretical analysis.
