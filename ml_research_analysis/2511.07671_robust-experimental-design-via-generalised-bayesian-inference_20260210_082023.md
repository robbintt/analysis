# Robust Experimental Design via Generalised Bayesian Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07671
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07671
- Reference count: 40
- Proposes Generalised Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (GBOED) for robust parameter inference under model misspecification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of model misspecification in Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) by proposing Generalised Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (GBOED). The authors extend Gibbs inference to the experimental design setting, using generalised Bayesian inference for robust parameter inference. GBOED employs scoring rules like weighted score matching with inverse multi-quadric kernels to handle outliers and model misspecification. The method introduces the Gibbs expected information gain (Gibbs EIG) as a utility function for design selection, demonstrating enhanced robustness to outliers and incorrect noise distributional assumptions across three experimental design problems.

## Method Summary
GBOED extends traditional BOED by incorporating generalised Bayesian inference through Gibbs inference principles. The method uses weighted score matching with inverse multi-quadric kernels as scoring rules to handle model misspecification and outliers. The Gibbs expected information gain (Gibbs EIG) serves as the utility function for selecting optimal experimental designs. This approach induces more exploration of the design space compared to traditional methods, leading to improved predictive performance when models are misspecified. The framework is evaluated across linear regression, pharmacokinetics, and location finding problems.

## Key Results
- GBOED demonstrates enhanced robustness to outliers and incorrect noise distributional assumptions compared to traditional BOED
- Gibbs EIG induces more exploration of the design space, leading to improved predictive performance under model misspecification
- Ablation studies confirm that Gibbs EIG contributes to better design selection, particularly in higher dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by replacing standard Bayesian inference with Gibbs inference in the experimental design framework. Gibbs inference uses scoring rules to update beliefs in a way that is robust to model misspecification. The inverse multi-quadric kernel in weighted score matching provides a mechanism to downweight outliers and handle heavy-tailed noise distributions. The Gibbs EIG utility function naturally balances exploration and exploitation in design selection, leading to designs that perform well even when the assumed model is incorrect.

## Foundational Learning
- Generalised Bayesian Inference: Why needed - provides robustness when standard Bayesian assumptions fail; Quick check - verify scoring rule satisfies properness conditions
- Gibbs Inference: Why needed - enables robust updating under model uncertainty; Quick check - confirm stationary distribution matches target distribution
- Scoring Rules: Why needed - quantifies quality of predictive distributions; Quick check - verify scoring rule is proper and local
- Inverse Multi-quadric Kernels: Why needed - handles outliers and heavy-tailed distributions; Quick check - validate kernel parameters through cross-validation
- Expected Information Gain: Why needed - measures informativeness of experimental designs; Quick check - confirm Monte Carlo estimates converge
- Model Misspecification: Why needed - real-world models rarely match true data-generating process; Quick check - test robustness across varying degrees of misspecification

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Scoring Rules -> Gibbs Inference -> Design Selection -> Utility Evaluation

**Critical Path:**
1. Define scoring rule (weighted score matching with inverse multi-quadric kernel)
2. Implement Gibbs inference for parameter posterior approximation
3. Compute Gibbs expected information gain for candidate designs
4. Select design maximizing Gibbs EIG
5. Evaluate predictive performance under misspecification

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Scoring rule choice balances robustness vs. efficiency
- Kernel parameters affect outlier sensitivity
- Exploration-exploitation tradeoff in design selection
- Computational cost vs. approximation accuracy

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance on well-specified models (overly conservative)
- Sensitivity to kernel parameter selection
- Computational bottlenecks in high dimensions
- Convergence issues in Gibbs inference

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare GBOED vs. standard BOED on linear regression with outliers
2. Test robustness across varying noise distributions in pharmacokinetics problem
3. Evaluate scalability by increasing dimension in location finding task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results primarily validated through synthetic examples, raising questions about real-world applicability
- Computational complexity of Gibbs framework not thoroughly analyzed for high-dimensional problems
- Scoring rule and kernel function choices lack systematic justification across different problem types

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Theoretical foundation connecting Gibbs inference to robust experimental design | High |
| Empirical results showing improved robustness under model misspecification | Medium |
| Claims about general applicability across diverse scientific domains | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Test GBOED on real-world experimental datasets from multiple scientific domains to assess generalizability
2. Conduct computational efficiency benchmarking comparing GBOED to standard BOED methods across varying dimensions
3. Perform sensitivity analysis of scoring rule and kernel function choices on design quality and robustness
