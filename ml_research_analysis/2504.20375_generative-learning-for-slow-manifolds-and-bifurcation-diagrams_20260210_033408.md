## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Conditional score-based generative models can reconstruct bifurcation diagrams and generate initial conditions on slow manifolds for dynamical systems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework that leverages conditional score-based generative models (cSGMs) to sample from slow manifolds and reconstruct bifurcation diagrams in dynamical systems. The approach addresses the challenge of exploring long-term system behavior when traditional model reduction techniques are difficult to apply. By training cSGMs on data from parameter-dependent systems, the method can generate samples consistent with specified quantities of interest such as parameter values or observables. The framework is demonstrated on three examples: a cusp bifurcation surface, the Chafee-Infante reaction-diffusion PDE, and a plug-flow tubular reactor system. Results show that cSGMs can effectively reconstruct bifurcation surfaces and generate initial conditions on slow manifolds, with the Monte Carlo sampling-based cSGM offering computational efficiency advantages over neural network-based approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework employs conditional score-based generative models to sample from slow manifolds in dynamical systems. Two approaches are presented: a neural network-based cSGM and a Monte Carlo sampling (MCS)-based cSGM. Both models learn the score function (gradient of log-density) of the data distribution conditioned on specified labels (e.g., parameter values). The neural network approach uses a time-dependent denoising score matching loss, while the MCS approach approximates the score using mini-batch Monte Carlo integration. For high-dimensional systems like PDEs, the method incorporates dimensionality reduction via Diffusion Maps to identify the low-dimensional manifold, followed by Geometric Harmonics to lift samples back to the full state space. The trained cSGMs can then generate new samples on the manifold consistent with specified labels, enabling exploration of bifurcation surfaces and generation of initial conditions for long-term simulations.

## Key Results
- Successfully reconstructed a cusp bifurcation surface using both NN-based and MCS-based cSGMs, generating samples consistent with specified parameter values
- Applied the framework to the Chafee-Infante reaction-diffusion PDE, confirming a 2D slow manifold and reconstructing steady-state profiles via Geometric Harmonics
- Demonstrated generation of conversion/temperature profiles for a plug-flow tubular reactor system, showing agreement with training data across varying Damköhler numbers
- Showed computational efficiency advantages of the MCS-based cSGM over the NN-based approach for generating large numbers of samples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the mathematical connection between score-based generative models and stochastic differential equations. The reverse-time SDE framework allows sampling from complex distributions by gradually denoising from Gaussian noise. Conditioning on labels modifies the drift term of the SDE, ensuring generated samples satisfy the specified constraints. For high-dimensional systems, Diffusion Maps identifies the intrinsic low-dimensional structure (slow manifold) where the dynamics concentrate, while Geometric Harmonics provides a computationally efficient way to map between the reduced and ambient spaces. This combination allows the cSGM to operate in a lower-dimensional space where learning is more tractable, then reconstruct full-dimensional states with minimal loss of fidelity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Maps**: Non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that identifies intrinsic manifold structure in high-dimensional data by constructing a diffusion operator based on pairwise distances
  - Why needed: Identifies the low-dimensional slow manifold where dynamical systems concentrate their long-term behavior
  - Quick check: Verify that eigenvalues of the diffusion operator show a spectral gap indicating low-dimensional structure
- **Geometric Harmonics**: Extension of Diffusion Maps that enables function approximation and mapping between reduced and ambient spaces using the eigenvectors of the diffusion operator
  - Why needed: Provides a computationally efficient way to lift samples from the reduced manifold back to the full state space
  - Quick check: Validate that reconstructed functions preserve important features of the original data
- **Score-based Generative Models**: Models that learn the gradient of the log-density (score function) of a target distribution, enabling sampling via reverse-time diffusion processes
  - Why needed: Provides a principled framework for generating samples from complex, high-dimensional distributions
  - Quick check: Verify that the learned score function correctly points toward regions of higher probability density
- **Conditional Generation**: Extension of generative models that incorporates additional information (labels) to bias the generated samples toward satisfying specified constraints
  - Why needed: Enables generation of samples consistent with specific parameter values or observables
  - Quick check: Confirm that generated samples satisfy the conditioning constraints within acceptable tolerance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Training Data -> Diffusion Maps -> Reduced Space -> cSGM Training -> Sample Generation -> Geometric Harmonics -> Ambient Space

**Critical Path:**
1. Generate training data from dynamical system across parameter range
2. Apply Diffusion Maps to identify low-dimensional manifold
3. Train cSGM on reduced data with conditioning on labels
4. Generate samples on manifold using trained cSGM
5. Use Geometric Harmonics to lift samples to ambient space
6. Validate generated samples against known system behavior

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- NN-based cSGM offers end-to-end differentiability but requires careful architecture design and hyperparameter tuning
- MCS-based cSGM trades computational efficiency for potential variance in score estimates
- Dimensionality reduction via Diffusion Maps enables tractable learning but may lose some fine-grained information
- Geometric Harmonics provides efficient lifting but accuracy depends on quality of reduced representation

**Failure Signatures:**
- Generated samples show excessive noise or fail to capture essential features of training data
- Conditioning constraints are not satisfied by generated samples
- Reconstructed high-dimensional profiles lack smoothness or show artifacts
- Manifold identification via Diffusion Maps fails to capture true low-dimensional structure

**First Experiments:**
1. Train cSGM on synthetic cusp bifurcation data, generate samples at specific parameter values, and compare distribution to training data
2. Apply Diffusion Maps to Chafee-Infante PDE data, verify 2D manifold structure, and train cSGM conditioned on first Fourier mode coefficient
3. Generate conversion/temperature profiles for plug-flow reactor across range of Damköhler numbers and compare to traditional integration results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Non-uniform conditional distributions**: The current framework can approximate bimodal distributions on manifolds but doesn't precisely match non-uniform training distributions. Future work will explore improved matching for complex conditional distributions.
- **Computational efficiency for multi-parameter exploration**: While the framework shows promise, generating training data for bifurcation surfaces with multiple free parameters becomes computationally costly with current integration-based approaches.
- **Direct high-dimensional generation**: The current approach requires dimensionality reduction and subsequent lifting via Geometric Harmonics due to noise introduced by the generative model. A more direct approach that generates smooth high-dimensional profiles without these intermediate steps would be valuable.

## Limitations
- Lack of specified training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizer) and Diffusion Maps parameters (kernel scale, eigenvector selection thresholds) creates significant reproducibility barriers
- Assumes sufficient training data exists to adequately sample the slow manifold, which may not hold for systems with complex or sparsely sampled bifurcation structures
- Geometric Harmonics lifting procedure could introduce errors when reconstructing high-dimensional states, particularly for systems with nonlinear coupling between modes

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The theoretical framework connecting conditional SGMs to slow manifold sampling and bifurcation reconstruction is sound and well-articulated
- **Medium confidence**: The numerical demonstrations on synthetic cusp bifurcation and PDE systems show proof-of-concept viability, though limited to relatively simple cases
- **Low confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency advantages over neural network approaches lack rigorous benchmarking and scaling analysis

## Next Checks
1. Perform systematic ablation studies varying Diffusion Maps parameters (ε, δ) to quantify their impact on manifold reconstruction accuracy and Geometric Harmonics lifting fidelity
2. Implement cross-validation testing on held-out parameter regions to assess generalization beyond training data distribution
3. Benchmark computational runtime and sample quality against alternative approaches (traditional model reduction, neural ODEs) across multiple dynamical systems with varying dimensionality and complexity
