# N-BEATS-MOE: N-BEATS with a Mixture-of-Experts Layer for Heterogeneous Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.07490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07490
- Authors: Ricardo Matos; Luis Roque; Vitor Cerqueira
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: N-BEATS-MOE improves forecasting accuracy on heterogeneous time series by 2.66% to 9.57% across multiple datasets

## Executive Summary
N-BEATS-MOE extends the N-BEATS architecture by incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer that replaces standard sum aggregation with a learned weighted sum determined by a gating network. This dynamic weighting enables the model to adaptively focus on different time series components based on input characteristics, improving handling of heterogeneous time series datasets. Experiments across 12 benchmark datasets with 100,141 time series show N-BEATS-MOE achieves consistent improvements over N-BEATS, particularly in datasets with varied domains (e.g., M1, M3, M4), while maintaining interpretability through the gating mechanism.

## Method Summary
The N-BEATS-MOE architecture introduces a Mixture-of-Experts layer into the standard N-BEATS framework. The model uses a gating network to dynamically assign weights to different expert networks, creating a learned weighted sum that replaces the traditional sum aggregation. This allows the model to adaptively select and combine experts based on the characteristics of each input time series. The approach maintains the interpretability of N-BEATS while improving its ability to handle heterogeneous datasets through specialized expert networks that can focus on different components or patterns within the time series data.

## Key Results
- Achieved 9.57% improvement in M1 dataset accuracy (SMAPE reduction from 7.34% to 2.68% on monthly series)
- Demonstrated consistent performance improvements across 12 benchmark datasets with 100,141 time series
- Maintained interpretability through gating mechanism while improving decomposition accuracy and scaling of trend and seasonal components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MoE layer enables dynamic specialization by learning to assign different weights to expert networks based on input characteristics. The gating network acts as a router that directs different types of time series patterns to specialized experts, allowing the model to leverage domain-specific knowledge within the expert networks. This adaptive combination of experts provides better handling of heterogeneous datasets compared to static aggregation methods, as the model can learn which experts are most relevant for different types of time series patterns and components.

## Foundational Learning
- Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): Why needed - enables dynamic specialization for heterogeneous data; Quick check - verify gating network properly routes inputs to appropriate experts
- Time series decomposition: Why needed - understanding trend and seasonal components; Quick check - validate decomposition accuracy against known patterns
- Gating networks: Why needed - determines expert weights dynamically; Quick check - ensure gating mechanism provides interpretable results

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input -> N-BEATS blocks -> MoE Layer (Gating Network + Expert Networks) -> Output

Critical path: Input time series flows through N-BEATS blocks, then through the MoE layer where the gating network determines expert weights, and finally produces the forecast through weighted combination of expert outputs.

Design tradeoffs: The MoE layer adds computational complexity but provides better handling of heterogeneous data through dynamic specialization. The gating mechanism introduces interpretability but requires careful tuning to avoid overfitting.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may indicate inadequate expert specialization, gating network malfunction, or imbalance in expert weight distribution. Monitor expert utilization rates and gating decisions for debugging.

First experiments:
1. Verify gating network correctly routes different time series patterns to appropriate experts
2. Test expert specialization by analyzing weight distributions across different dataset domains
3. Validate decomposition accuracy by comparing expert outputs with known time series components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational efficiency concerns due to additional MoE layer complexity and potential increased inference time
- Interpretability claims lack thorough validation against domain knowledge or practical utility assessment
- Limited evaluation of uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasting capabilities

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core methodology and experimental results showing performance improvements are robust
- Medium confidence: Interpretability claims regarding expert specialization need more comprehensive validation
- Medium confidence: Scalability claims require more detailed computational complexity analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify computational overhead and establish performance vs. complexity trade-offs
2. Perform domain expert validation of interpretability claims by comparing expert specialization with known time series characteristics
3. Extend evaluation to include probabilistic forecasting metrics and uncertainty quantification for risk-sensitive applications
