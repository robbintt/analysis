## Executive Summary
This chapter examines current developments in linguistic theory and methods, focusing on the increasing integration of computational, cognitive, and evolutionary perspectives. Four major themes shape contemporary linguistics: explicit testing of hypotheses about symbolic representation, the impact of artificial neural networks on theoretical debates, the importance of intersubjectivity in linguistic theory, and the growth of evolutionary linguistics. By connecting linguistics with computer science, psychology, neuroscience, and biology, the authors provide a forward-looking perspective on the changing landscape of linguistic research.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes computational approaches to testing linguistic theories, including surprisal-based efficiency metrics, dependency locality analysis, phylogenetic comparative methods, and Rational Speech Act models. Key methods involve using large language models to estimate word probabilities, dependency parsers to analyze syntactic structure, and Bayesian phylogenetic inference to model language evolution. The approach combines corpus analysis, computational modeling, and cross-linguistic comparison to evaluate competing theoretical claims about language structure and use.

## Key Results
- Word lengths are optimized for efficient communication, with surprisal predicting length better than raw frequency
- Syntactic structures reflect locality and harmony principles, though these sometimes conflict and are resolved differently across languages
- Language evolution can be modeled using phylogenetic methods, revealing both similarities and differences between vocabulary and grammatical change

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Information-theoretic metrics (surprisal, mutual information) can validate whether linguistic structures optimize for communicative efficiency.
- Mechanism: Words/expressions are assigned probability estimates given context; negative log probability (surprisal) quantifies information content. Lower surprisal for predictable items, higher for informative ones. Corpus analysis tests whether word lengths, ordering, and structures minimize surprisal-based costs.
- Core assumption: Human language production/comprehension approximates rational information-theoretic optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "efficiency principles validated through surprisal metrics"
  - [section 2.2] Piantidosi et al. (2011) show surprisal predicts word lengths better than raw frequency; Pimentel et al. (2023) refine with LLM-based estimates.
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related papers mention NLP applications to biological sequences but not surprisal specifically.
- Break condition: If language data is dominated by translation artifacts (as Koplenig et al. 2023 note), efficiency correlations may be confounded. If LLM probability estimates are systematically biased for low-frequency constructions, surprisal measurements become unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sub-symbolic neural networks can learn approximate symbolic representations (dependency trees, grammatical features) through predictive training, without explicit symbolic supervision.
- Mechanism: LLMs trained on next-word prediction develop internal structure—attention heads approximate syntactic dependencies; hidden units track grammatical features. Probe tasks reveal whether symbolic structures emerge in representational geometry.
- Core assumption: Emergent structure in neural representations is homologous (not just analogous) to symbolic grammars posited by linguists.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] Hewitt & Manning (2019) find LLMs learn dependency tree approximations; Manning et al. (2020) show attention heads track verb-object dependencies.
  - [section 3.2] Wilcox et al. (2024) demonstrate island constraints emerge from predictive processing without explicit training.
  - [corpus] "How Linguistics Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Language Models" directly addresses this debate but offers contested conclusions.
- Break condition: If LLMs succeed on grammaticality judgments via surface pattern matching rather than hierarchical structure, the mechanism is superficial. If attention-probed structures don't generalize across languages/typologies, emergence is language-specific rather than symbolic in the linguistic sense.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Linguistic structure is shaped by intersubjective inference—speakers recursively model listeners' mental states, and grammatical forms evolve to support this alignment.
- Mechanism: Rational Speech Act (RSA) models formalize this: listeners infer speaker utility; speakers select utterances maximizing communicative efficiency given listener model. Iterated learning across agents leads to structural conventions.
- Core assumption: Intersubjective reasoning is computationally tractable and actually performed (approximately) during real-time language use.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] RSA framework (Frank & Goodman 2012) unifies intersubjectivity with information theory; Kehler & Rohde (2013, 2019) show pronoun interpretation follows probabilistic expectations about mental states.
  - [section 5.2] Kirby et al. (2008) iterated learning experiments show structure emerges from transmission across agents.
  - [corpus] Weak; no corpus papers directly address intersubjectivity mechanisms.
- Break condition: If RSA models require too many free parameters to be psychologically plausible, the mechanism is underdetermined. If iterated learning effects only appear in artificial toy domains, generalization to natural language evolution is unproven.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Surprisal and Information Theory**
  - Why needed here: Core metric for testing efficiency claims; underlies LLM training objectives and psycholinguistic processing models.
  - Quick check question: Given "The cat sat on the ___", which has higher surprisal: "mat" or "quasar"? Explain why.

- Concept: **Symbolic vs. Sub-symbolic Computation**
  - Why needed here: Frames the debate over whether LLM internal states constitute linguistic theory or merely approximate behavior.
  - Quick check question: A dependency grammar parse is symbolic; an attention weight matrix is sub-symbolic. What would it mean for the latter to "implement" the former?

- Concept: **Phylogenetic Comparative Methods**
  - Why needed here: Used to infer historical dynamics and test whether structural principles (harmony, locality) hold across evolutionary timescales.
  - Quick check question: If word order A → B has higher transition probability than B → A across phylogenies, what does this suggest about the underlying principle?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Surprisal estimator -> Corpus annotator -> Phylogenetic inference engine -> RSA simulator -> Probe classifiers

- Critical path:
  1. Select linguistic principle to test (efficiency, locality, harmony).
  2. Define operationalization (e.g., dependency length = linear distance between head and dependent).
  3. Build counterfactual baseline (permuted corpora, artificial grammars).
  4. Compare natural vs. counterfactual distributions; statistical test for significant difference.
  5. Control for confounds (head-directionality, translation bias, corpus genre).

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **LLM vs. count-based probabilities**: LLMs provide better long-tail estimates but introduce training-data opacity; n-gram counts are transparent but sparse.
  - **Single-language vs. multilingual**: Single-language depth vs. cross-linguistic generality; typological claims require diverse sampling.
  - **Tree-only vs. horizontal-transfer phylogenies**: Trees are tractable but miss contact effects; horizontal models are more realistic but harder to estimate.

- Failure signatures:
  - Efficiency/structure correlations disappear when controlling for genealogical relatedness (phylogenetic non-independence).
  - Probe classifiers succeed on trained distribution but fail on held-out constructions (overfitting to dataset artifacts).
  - RSA predictions diverge from human behavior in naturalistic (non-toy) domains.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Replicate Pimentel et al. (2023)**: Use an LLM to estimate word surprisal on a multilingual corpus; test whether length ~ frequency or length ~ surprisal. Check whether results hold across held-out languages.
  2. **Dependency locality test**: Calculate dependency length in natural corpora vs. matched pseudo-random baselines constrained for head-directionality (following Jing et al. 2022). Identify which languages show locality violations and characterize them.
  3. **Probe LLM for island constraints**: Train classifier on LLM hidden states to predict grammaticality of filler-gap dependencies; test generalization to held-out island types not seen during probing.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do large language models learn symbolic linguistic representations (e.g., dependency structures, grammatical features) as approximations of human linguistic knowledge, or do they achieve fluency through fundamentally different mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Judging between these responses is an active, and important area of linguistic theory research," referring to three competing positions on whether LLMs instantiate, refute, or merely test linguistic theories.
- Why unresolved: Probing studies show LLMs develop attention heads resembling syntactic dependencies (Manning et al. 2020), but critics argue LLMs lack intentional grounding and can learn "impossible" languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparisons of LLM internal representations against human neural processing data during identical language tasks; tests of whether LLMs generalize linguistic rules to truly novel constructions in human-like ways.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Rational Speech Act (RSA) models of pragmatics be scaled from toy domains to naturalistic conversational data while retaining explanatory power?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "One major shortcoming of RSA models is that they are developed to explain toy domains, and operate over a limited set of meanings and alternative utterance options. Expanding RSA models to cover more naturalistic data is a challenging but necessary next step."
- Why unresolved: RSA models require explicit enumeration of possible utterances and meanings, which becomes computationally intractable with natural vocabulary sizes; models also have many free parameters that are difficult to interpret psychologically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of scalable RSA implementations tested against corpora of natural dialogue, with independently motivated parameter constraints from psycholinguistic experiments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do grammar and vocabulary components of language differ in their rates and patterns of evolutionary change across language families?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note conflicting findings—Greenhill et al. (2017) find grammar changes faster than vocabulary in Austronesian and Indo-European, while Matsumae et al. (2021) find grammar correlates more strongly with population history—and conclude: "In short, much more research is needed in this complex area."
- Why unresolved: The two cited studies use different methods (phylogenetic trees vs. genetic population history) and may not be directly comparable; datasets covering both vocabulary and grammar across the same language families remain limited.
- What evidence would resolve it: Phylogenetic analyses using standardized grammatical and lexical databases across matched language families, with explicit modeling of how different transmission pathways (vertical inheritance vs. contact) affect each component.

### Open Question 4
- Question: When locality preferences (minimizing dependency length) conflict with harmony preferences (consistent head-direction), how do different languages resolve this competition?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes the clash: locality favors even distribution of dependents around heads (D1-D2-H-D3-D4) while harmony favors all dependents on one side (H-D1-D2-D3-D4). Jing et al. (2022) find locality exceptions in head-final languages, suggesting harmony may dominate in some cases, but "this may provide another example of how different languages find different solutions."
- Why unresolved: Cross-linguistic studies have not systematically quantified the relative strength of these competing pressures or identified predictors of which principle dominates in specific languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative modeling across a typologically diverse sample measuring dependency length and harmony simultaneously, with phylogenetic controls to distinguish historical contingency from functional optimization.

## Limitations
- Efficiency and locality principles show consistent statistical patterns but may conflate innate cognitive biases with historical/typological contingencies
- Claims that LLM internal states constitute valid linguistic theory lack decisive empirical support and remain methodologically controversial
- Intersubjectivity mechanisms (RSA, iterated learning) are formally elegant but lack direct psycholinguistic evidence for real-time processing implementation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Efficiency metrics (surprisal) reliably predict word length and frequency distributions across corpora
- **Medium confidence**: Dependency locality preferences are real but language-specific exceptions suggest non-universal constraints
- **Low confidence**: Claims that LLM internal states constitute valid linguistic theory remain contested without cross-linguistic validation

## Next Checks
1. Test whether LLM-derived surprisal predicts word lengths in held-out low-resource languages not present in training data
2. Conduct controlled cross-linguistic dependency length analysis comparing natural corpora against permuted baselines matched for head-directionality
3. Evaluate LLM grammaticality judgments on island constraint minimal pairs not seen during probing or fine-tuning
