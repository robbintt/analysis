# Kanade: A Simple Disentangled Tokenizer for Spoken Language Modeling

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Single-layer speech tokenizer disentangling linguistic content from speaker identity using only information bottleneck, achieving state-of-the-art voice conversion and discrimination metrics

## Executive Summary
Kanade is a single-layer speech tokenizer that disentangles linguistic content from speaker identity using only an information bottleneck, without auxiliary disentanglement methods. It uses SSL features as input, reconstructs both SSL and mel spectrograms, and quantizes with FSQ. Experiments show Kanade achieves state-of-the-art speaker disentanglement (voice conversion and discrimination) and lexical availability (ASR/TTS), while maintaining excellent reconstruction quality. On LibriTTS, Kanade obtains 4.2% WER and 81.0% prosody naturalness in TTS, and its 25Hz tokens match k-means performance in pure spoken language modeling.

## Method Summary
Kanade disentangles speech into linguistic content (phonetics + prosody) and acoustic constants (speaker identity) through a two-branch architecture. The content encoder is a single 6-layer transformer that produces tokens at 12.5Hz or 25Hz using FSQ quantization. The global branch extracts speaker embeddings via a 4-layer ConvNeXt. Training occurs in two phases: Phase 1 jointly optimizes mel and SSL reconstruction losses; Phase 2 adds adversarial training for improved quality. The architecture uses WavLM Base+ SSL features (content: layers 6+9 normalized, global: layers 1+2 unnormalized) as input and achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement without complex auxiliary losses.

## Key Results
- Achieves 4.2% WER and 81.0% prosody naturalness in TTS on LibriTTS
- Voice conversion EER: 14.5% (far superior to baselines)
- Speaker discrimination EER: 7.3% (outperforms all baselines)
- 25Hz tokens match k-means performance in LibriSpeech LM perplexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Kanade achieves disentanglement through information bottleneck constraints rather than explicit auxiliary losses. The single-layer content transformer has limited capacity, forcing it to focus on linguistic content while speaker identity is captured by the global branch. SSL reconstruction loss preserves prosody by requiring the content tokens to capture temporal dynamics. The information bottleneck (limited bitrate) ensures content tokens cannot carry speaker information, while the global branch, with access to full context, captures speaker identity. This approach is simpler than multi-layer codecs or complex auxiliary loss functions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Information Bottleneck**: Limits the mutual information between input and content tokens to force focus on relevant information. Why needed: Ensures content tokens cannot carry speaker identity. Quick check: Verify content tokens achieve high speaker ID error rates (>20%).
- **Factorized Variational Autoencoders**: Separate latent spaces for different factors of variation. Why needed: Enables independent manipulation of speaker and content. Quick check: Test voice conversion by swapping global embeddings.
- **Feature-space Learning**: Uses intermediate representations (SSL features) rather than raw waveforms. Why needed: Provides richer input for the model to learn from. Quick check: Compare performance using raw vs. SSL features.
- **Local Attention**: Restricts attention to local windows for efficiency. Why needed: Reduces computational complexity while maintaining context. Quick check: Verify attention window sizes match specifications.
- **Strided Convolution**: Downsamples temporal resolution. Why needed: Controls token rate and computational load. Quick check: Confirm output framerate matches target (12.5Hz or 25Hz).

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: WavLM SSL Features -> Content Encoder (6L Transformer + FSQ) + Global Branch (ConvNeXt + Attentive Pooling) -> Token/Mel Modules (6L/6L) + Mel Decoder -> Vocos Vocoder -> Waveform

Critical Path: The disentanglement relies on the information bottleneck in the content encoder combined with the global branch. The SSL reconstruction loss is critical for prosody preservation, while the adversarial post-training improves quality.

Design Tradeoffs: Single-layer simplicity vs. potential expressiveness of multi-layer codecs. Information bottleneck vs. explicit auxiliary losses for disentanglement. Fixed-rate tokenization vs. variable-rate approaches.

Failure Signatures: Poor disentanglement (speaker leaks into content tokens) manifests as low voice conversion EER and high speaker ID accuracy on content tokens. Degraded prosody shows as low F0Corr (<0.75) and poor naturalness scores.

First Experiments:
1. Train Phase 1 only (no adversarial post-training) and verify WER/CER metrics to confirm basic functionality.
2. Implement voice conversion test: encode source, replace global embedding with target, decode, and measure speaker similarity change.
3. Ablate SSL loss: train without L_ssl and confirm F0Corr drops from ~0.84 to ~0.76, validating SSL loss importance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Why does Kanade achieve superior lexical availability (ASR) while exhibiting lower phonetic discriminability (ABX/PNMI) compared to k-means and hybrid codecs? The paper hypothesizes non-phonetic linguistic information may be present but cannot make a decisive conclusion without further investigation.

2. Can the content stream be further factorized into distinct phonetic and prosodic representations without multi-layer complexity? The paper notes current architecture merges these, but explicit separation could offer better flexibility.

3. How can Kanade be adapted for low-latency streaming inference without compromising unsupervised disentanglement? The bidirectional SSL encoder provides context essential for disentanglement, creating a tension with streaming requirements.

4. Can variable-rate tokenization be integrated to mitigate information redundancy and improve alignment with linguistic categories? Fixed-rate tokenization may not optimally match the non-uniform density of linguistic information.

## Limitations
- Implementation details for local attention padding, strided convolution parameters, and adaLN-Zero integration are underspecified, making exact replication challenging
- Claims about single-layer sufficiency are demonstrated only through k-means comparison rather than direct codec-to-codec comparisons
- GAN post-training improves quality metrics but is not evaluated for disentanglement impact, leaving open whether it introduces speaker leakage

## Confidence
- High confidence: Speaker disentanglement effectiveness (voice conversion, speaker discrimination metrics), lexical availability (ASR/TTS performance), reconstruction quality (MUSHRA, WER)
- Medium confidence: Single-layer sufficiency claims (k-means comparison only), information bottleneck alone for disentanglement (no comparison to auxiliary loss methods)
- Low confidence: Exact architectural implementation details affecting performance (local attention padding, strided conv parameters, adaLN-Zero integration)

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test voice conversion pipeline: encode source speech through content branch, replace global embedding with target speaker, decode, and verify speaker similarity increases while WER remains stable.

2. Ablate SSL loss in Phase 1 training: train without L_ssl to confirm F0Corr drops from ~0.84 to ~0.76 and prosody naturalness degrades, validating SSL loss necessity.

3. Compare token representations against k-means baselines on LibriSpeech LM task: train Kanade at 25Hz, extract tokens, evaluate perplexity, and verify single-layer performance matches or exceeds two-layer codecs as claimed.
