# A pipeline for enabling path-specific causal fairness in observational health data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09841
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09841
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces pipeline for causally fair ML in observational health data with synthetic validation across 4 clinical prediction tasks

## Executive Summary
This work presents a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models using observational health data. The approach maps structural fairness models to observational health settings and identifies causal paths for fairness interventions. The authors demonstrate that dimensionality reduction through outcome-driven feature selection improves estimation of path-specific causal effects in high-dimensional data. Applied to four clinical prediction tasks, the pipeline reveals that no single fairness intervention universally outperforms others, highlighting the importance of context-specific prioritization of causal pathways.

## Method Summary
The pipeline implements path-specific causal fairness through a structured approach that begins with identifying relevant causal pathways in observational health data. It employs dimensionality reduction techniques to improve the estimation of causal effects, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional clinical datasets. The framework allows for the decomposition of bias into direct, indirect, and spurious causal effects, enabling more nuanced fairness-accuracy tradeoff assessments. The method is validated using synthetic experiments that simulate real clinical prediction scenarios, with applications to acute myocardial infarction, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and schizophrenia prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- Dimensionality reduction via outcome-driven feature selection improves path-specific causal effect estimation in high-dimensional health data
- No single fairness intervention consistently outperforms others across different clinical prediction tasks
- Naive feature selection methods can achieve comparable performance to causal regularization strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to decomposing bias along causal pathways, allowing for targeted interventions that address specific sources of unfairness rather than applying blanket fairness constraints. By integrating domain knowledge into the identification of causal paths, the method can prioritize interventions that are most relevant to the clinical context, improving both fairness and predictive performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal inference frameworks** - Needed to identify and manipulate specific causal pathways that contribute to bias; Quick check: Can the framework distinguish between direct, indirect, and spurious causal effects?
- **Observational health data complexities** - Required to handle confounding, selection bias, and measurement error inherent in real-world clinical datasets; Quick check: Does the method account for unmeasured confounding?
- **Path-specific fairness metrics** - Essential for evaluating how different causal pathways contribute to overall model bias; Quick check: Are the metrics sensitive to changes in specific causal pathways?
- **Dimensionality reduction techniques** - Critical for managing high-dimensional clinical data while preserving relevant causal information; Quick check: Does reduction maintain the integrity of identified causal pathways?
- **Domain knowledge integration** - Necessary for contextualizing causal pathways and prioritizing fairness interventions; Quick check: Is domain expertise effectively incorporated into pathway identification?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data Preprocessing -> Causal Pathway Identification -> Dimensionality Reduction -> Fairness Intervention -> Evaluation

Critical Path: The pipeline follows a sequential process where each stage builds upon the previous one. Causal pathway identification must occur before dimensionality reduction, as the reduction is guided by the identified pathways. Fairness interventions are then applied based on the reduced feature set, followed by evaluation using path-specific metrics.

Design Tradeoffs: The method trades computational complexity for improved causal effect estimation accuracy. While the pathway identification and dimensionality reduction steps add overhead, they enable more targeted and effective fairness interventions. The synthetic data validation approach sacrifices real-world complexity for controlled experimentation.

Failure Signatures: Common failure modes include incorrect causal pathway identification leading to ineffective interventions, over-reduction that eliminates important predictive features, and misalignment between synthetic data characteristics and real clinical data structures. Performance degradation may occur when domain knowledge is insufficient or when the assumed causal structures don't match reality.

First Experiments:
1. Apply the pipeline to a real-world clinical dataset with known bias patterns and compare results against baseline models
2. Test the sensitivity of pathway identification to different domain knowledge inputs and assumptions
3. Evaluate the robustness of the pipeline across datasets from different healthcare systems with varying data collection methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic data validation may not fully capture the complexity and confounding structures present in actual clinical data
- Generalizability across diverse healthcare settings remains unclear due to heterogeneous nature of observational health data
- Limited empirical validation in real clinical settings despite theoretically sound causal framework

## Confidence
- **Core methodology**: Medium-High - theoretically sound but limited real-world validation
- **Application to clinical tasks**: Medium - synthetic data validation doesn't fully represent real patient outcomes
- **Fairness intervention effectiveness**: Medium - no single intervention consistently outperforms others, but real-world applicability uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Validate the pipeline using real-world clinical datasets with known bias patterns, comparing results against established fairness metrics and domain expert evaluations
2. Conduct external validation across multiple healthcare systems to assess robustness to different data collection methods, demographic distributions, and clinical practices
3. Perform longitudinal studies to evaluate whether causally fair models maintain performance and fairness properties over time as patient populations and treatment patterns evolve
