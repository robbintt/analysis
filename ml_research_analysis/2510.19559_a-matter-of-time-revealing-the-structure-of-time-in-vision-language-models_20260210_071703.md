# A Matter of Time: Revealing the Structure of Time in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19559
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19559
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: VLMs encode temporal information in a low-dimensional non-linear manifold, enabling efficient timeline extraction via Bézier curves

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) position visual content in time, introducing TIME10k, a benchmark of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth. The authors evaluate 37 state-of-the-art VLMs and discover that temporal information is structured along a compact (~13 dimensions), non-linear manifold in the embedding space—contrasting with linear temporal encoding in language models. Based on this insight, they propose efficient methods to derive explicit timeline representations, achieving competitive accuracy with 20-60x faster inference than baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves three main approaches: (1) Time Probing, where text prompts like "Was built in the year [year]" are encoded and compared via dot-product similarity with image embeddings to predict temporal placement; (2) Embedding Space Analysis using dimensionality reduction techniques (KPCA with cosine kernel, UMAP) to reveal temporal manifold structure and measure chronological ordering; and (3) Timeline Modeling via Bézier curves, where control points sampled from chronologically-sorted time embeddings define a smooth curve that image embeddings can be projected onto for efficient temporal inference.

## Key Results
- Temporal information in VLMs is structured along a low-dimensional (~13 dimensions), non-linear manifold
- KPCA achieves Spearman correlation of 0.96 for chronological ordering vs 0.80 for UMAP
- Bézier curve approach reduces inference time from 5000ms to 11ms while maintaining competitive accuracy
- KPCA-based Bézier(R^S,Int) achieved MAE of 8.81 (CLIP) and 7.77 (EVA-CLIP) with TAI scores of 0.77 and 0.84

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Modal Temporal Alignment via Contrastive Embeddings
Contrastive training positions semantically similar image-text pairs closer in embedding space. When training data includes temporal metadata (e.g., "a vintage car from the 1960s"), the model learns to associate visual features with temporal concepts without explicit temporal supervision. This works when training corpora contain sufficient temporal metadata to establish meaningful cross-modal temporal associations, though performance varies significantly with training data quality (MAE ranging from 6.20 to 144.54).

### Mechanism 2: Low-Dimensional Non-Linear Manifold Encoding
High-dimensional embedding spaces (512+ dimensions) contain a low-dimensional subspace where temporal relationships are preserved. Dimensionality reduction techniques can unfold this manifold while maintaining chronological ordering. The manifold structure is consistent across VLM architectures and sufficiently distinct from noise dimensions, with around 13 dimensions capturing most temporal information.

### Mechanism 3: Bézier Curve Timeline Extraction
A 1D Bézier curve fitted to time embeddings in a reduced subspace provides an explicit, monotonic timeline representation. Control points sampled uniformly from chronologically-sorted time embeddings define a smooth curve. Image embeddings are projected onto this curve, and their position determines predicted year via nearest-neighbor matching or linear interpolation. The approach enforces chronological consistency while capturing non-linear temporal relationships.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning in VLMs**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how image-text alignment emerges from contrastive training is essential for grasping why temporal associations form without explicit temporal labels.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why contrastive loss encourages semantically similar image-text pairs to cluster in embedding space?

- **Concept: Dimensionality Reduction (KPCA, UMAP)**
  - Why needed here: The methodology relies on KPCA and UMAP to reveal temporal manifold structure; understanding their differences (global vs local structure preservation) is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between KPCA (with cosine kernel) and UMAP in terms of what structure they preserve?

- **Concept: Bézier Curves and de Casteljau Algorithm**
  - Why needed here: The Bézier timeline approach uses these for curve fitting and interpolation; understanding control points and curve parameterization is necessary for implementation.
  - Quick check question: How does increasing the number of control points affect curve flexibility vs overfitting risk?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Time Probing (Baseline): Text prompts + VLM text encoder → Time embeddings T_y; Image encoder → Image embedding I; Dot-product similarity → Predicted year
  Embedding Space Analysis: Time embeddings → KPCA/UMAP (1D/2D/3D) → Chronological ordering metrics (ρ, τ, δMNDL)
  Timeline Modeling (Bézier): Time embeddings → KPCA (S=13 dims) → Control points (K=200) → Bézier curve C(t) → Image projection → Year inference (NN or interpolation)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate time embeddings for all years in range Y (1700-2024) using prompts
  2. Apply KPCA (cosine kernel) to reduce to S=13 dimensions
  3. Sample K=200 control points uniformly from sorted time embeddings
  4. Fit Bézier curve using de Casteljau algorithm
  5. Project query image embedding into same subspace, map to curve, infer year

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  UMAP vs Bézier: UMAP achieves better chronological ordering (ρ=0.99) but inference is 20-60x slower (539-554ms vs 9-26ms). Bézier offers explicit, interpretable timeline at minimal cost.
  Subspace dimension (S): Lower dimensions (S<13) lose temporal information; higher dimensions add noise and computation. Figure 6 shows plateau at S≈13.
  Inference method: Nearest-neighbor is simpler; interpolation provides fractional years for finer granularity but shows no significant MAE improvement.

- **Failure signatures:**
  Class imbalance: Categories with pre-photography depictions (Instruments, Weapons) show MAE >30 and TAI <0.5
  Training data quality: Models trained on "CommonPool" or "DFN2B" dramatically underperform (MAE 34-144) vs "Merged-2B" (MAE 6-7)
  Prompt sensitivity: Minimal prompts (P1: "[year]") fail; descriptive prompts like "Was built in the year [year]" work best
  Timeline inversion: UMAP may produce reversed timelines (negative ρ for EVA-CLIP); requires sign correction

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce time probing baseline: Select 2-3 VLMs (CLIP ViT-B/32, EVA-CLIP EVA02-CLIP-L-14-336), run time probing with prompt P7 on TIME10k validation split, verify MAE and TAI match Table 1
  2. Validate manifold dimensionality: Apply KPCA to time embeddings, measure MAE at S=[5, 10, 13, 20, 50] dimensions, confirm elbow at S≈13 per Figure 6
  3. Compare timeline approaches: Implement Bézier(R^S, NN) and UMAP-based timeline, measure inference time and accuracy on held-out images, verify Bézier achieves >20x speedup with comparable TAI

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the methodology for extracting temporal manifolds generalize to other ordinal problems? The conclusion explicitly poses this "fundamental question," asking if the approach can apply to non-temporal ordinal variables given VLMs' effective structuring of time. This remains unresolved as the study focused exclusively on validating the "time of first appearance" dimension. Successful application to other ordinal concepts (e.g., safety levels, price points, or quality rankings) within the same embedding spaces would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
Do generative Vision-Language Models encode temporal information in the same non-linear manifold structure? The authors state that evaluation of timeline extraction methods "should be extended to... generative VLMs" to verify if they possess similar temporal awareness. This remains unresolved as experiments were restricted to contrastive models (like CLIP and SigLIP), leaving the internal geometry of generative encoders unexplored. Applying timeline extraction techniques to visual encoders of generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion components) and measuring chronological alignment would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How robust is the temporal manifold to class imbalance and varying annual ranges? The authors list "the effect of class imbalances and annual ranges" as a limitation requiring further investigation. This remains unresolved as the TIME10k dataset exhibits a natural bias toward recent decades, potentially skewing the learned manifold structure. Ablation studies using synthetically balanced datasets or analyzing manifold distortion when adding/removing data from sparse historical periods would resolve this.

## Limitations

- TIME10k benchmark was not publicly available at time of review, preventing independent verification
- Analysis depends on unstated assumptions about temporal metadata density in VLM training corpora
- KPCA projection of new image embeddings lacks implementation details (pre-image reconstruction method unspecified)

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The core finding that temporal information exists in a low-dimensional manifold (S≈13) is supported by consistent experimental evidence across multiple VLMs and validation metrics. The superiority of KPCA over UMAP for chronological ordering (Spearman ρ=0.96 vs 0.80) is statistically robust.

**Medium confidence:** Claims about cross-modal temporal alignment forming through contrastive training are theoretically sound but lack direct corpus validation. The paper assumes temporal metadata presence without measuring it.

**Low confidence:** The Bézier curve timeline approach's generalizability beyond the tested models and time ranges remains unproven. The choice of K=200 control points appears somewhat arbitrary, and performance on extended historical ranges (pre-1700) is untested.

## Next Checks

1. **Timeline structure validation:** Using a small subset of TIME10k (e.g., Cars class), reproduce the KPCA dimensionality analysis to confirm the elbow point at S≈13 dimensions and validate chronological ordering metrics.

2. **Cross-model temporal consistency:** Apply the timeline approach to an additional VLM architecture not evaluated in the paper (e.g., BLIP-2) to test whether the low-dimensional manifold structure generalizes across models.

3. **Historical range extension:** Test the timeline methods on images depicting periods before 1700 to evaluate whether the temporal structure holds for extended historical ranges and identify potential structural breaks.
