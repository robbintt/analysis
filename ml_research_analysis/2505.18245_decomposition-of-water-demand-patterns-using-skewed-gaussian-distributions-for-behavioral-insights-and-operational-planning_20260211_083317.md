# Decomposition of Water Demand Patterns Using Skewed Gaussian Distributions for Behavioral Insights and Operational Planning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.18245
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18245
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Introduces Skewed Gaussian Distributions for decomposing urban water demand patterns, improving RMSE by >50% over symmetric models while maintaining physical interpretability.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel method for decomposing urban water demand patterns using Skewed Gaussian Distributions (SGD) to capture asymmetric peak shapes and derive operational insights. The approach addresses the limitation of symmetric Gaussian or standard time-series models that fail to accurately represent asymmetric demand patterns such as sharp morning surges followed by gradual declines. By fitting daily demand curves as a sum of skewed Gaussian peaks plus baseline demand, the method enables interpretable parameter extraction at the system level. Tested on six real-world datasets, SGD demonstrated over 50% reduction in root-mean-square error compared to symmetric models while maintaining physical interpretability, supporting applications in leakage detection, demand management, and behavioral analysis.

## Method Summary
The method decomposes daily water demand patterns using Skewed Gaussian Distributions (SGD) as the fundamental building block. Unlike traditional Gaussian or time-series models, SGD explicitly models asymmetry in demand peaks through four parameters: amplitude, timing, width, and skewness. The approach fits observed demand curves as a sum of multiple skewed Gaussian peaks superimposed on baseline demand. Parameter extraction is performed at the system level, enabling both operational applications (leakage detection, demand management) and strategic analyses (behavioral shifts, scenario planning). The framework is implemented in publicly available code and validated against real-world urban residential datasets.

## Key Results
- SGD reduced root-mean-square error by over 50% compared to symmetric Gaussian models across six real-world datasets
- The method maintains physical interpretability while capturing asymmetric peak shapes in water demand patterns
- Successfully decomposes complex demand curves into interpretable parameters (amplitude, timing, width, skewness) at system level

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism leverages the fact that water demand peaks often exhibit inherent asymmetry due to behavioral patterns and operational constraints. Morning demand surges, for instance, tend to be sharp and concentrated, while evening usage often shows more gradual build-up. Traditional symmetric models fail to capture these nuances, leading to systematic errors in prediction and interpretation. By using Skewed Gaussian Distributions, the method explicitly models this asymmetry through the skewness parameter, allowing each peak to reflect its true shape. This improved shape fitting translates directly into better residual patterns, which enhances both synthetic pattern generation and anomaly detection capabilities. The physical interpretability stems from the direct mapping between SGD parameters and observable demand characteristics, enabling operators to relate parameter changes to specific behavioral or operational shifts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Skewed Gaussian Distributions:** Asymmetric probability distributions that extend the normal distribution by adding a skewness parameter to capture non-symmetric peak shapes. Needed to accurately model real-world demand patterns that rarely exhibit perfect symmetry. Quick check: Verify that the skewness parameter can range from negative to positive values to capture both left and right-skewed peaks.
- **Parameter extraction at system level:** Process of identifying individual SGD components (amplitude, timing, width, skewness) from aggregated demand data. Needed to maintain physical interpretability while decomposing complex demand patterns. Quick check: Ensure extracted parameters correlate with known behavioral patterns or operational schedules.
- **Baseline demand modeling:** Separation of constant or slowly-varying demand from peak components in the total demand curve. Needed to isolate transient demand events from steady-state usage patterns. Quick check: Validate that baseline estimates remain stable across different days or conditions.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Raw water demand data -> SGD fitting algorithm -> Parameter extraction module -> Interpretability layer -> Application outputs (anomaly detection, forecasting, behavioral analysis)
- **Critical path:** Data preprocessing -> Peak identification -> SGD parameter fitting -> Validation and error calculation -> Parameter interpretation
- **Design tradeoffs:** Model complexity vs. interpretability (more peaks improve fit but reduce clarity), computational efficiency vs. fitting accuracy (iterative optimization vs. closed-form solutions), generality vs. specificity (universal parameters vs. site-specific calibration)
- **Failure signatures:** Poor peak separation when peaks overlap significantly, parameter instability under noisy data, overfitting when too many peaks are used for simple demand patterns
- **3 first experiments:** 1) Test SGD on a simple dataset with one clear asymmetric peak to verify basic functionality, 2) Compare SGD parameter stability across multiple days with similar demand patterns, 3) Evaluate SGD performance on synthetic data with known peak characteristics to validate fitting accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance on non-residential demand profiles (industrial, commercial) has not been tested and may differ significantly
- Model stability under extreme weather events, infrastructure failures, or sudden behavioral shifts remains unverified
- Physical interpretability assumes asymmetric peaks reliably reflect underlying behavioral or operational drivers, which may not hold in all contexts

## Confidence
- **Major claims validation:** High for demonstrated datasets and applications
- **Generalization to other urban contexts:** Medium
- **Performance on non-standard demand profiles:** Low

## Next Checks
1. Test SGD on industrial/commercial datasets with different peak characteristics to evaluate generalizability beyond residential contexts
2. Evaluate model stability under extreme weather or demand shock scenarios to assess robustness
3. Benchmark against ensemble or hybrid models including deep learning approaches on the same datasets to establish relative performance
