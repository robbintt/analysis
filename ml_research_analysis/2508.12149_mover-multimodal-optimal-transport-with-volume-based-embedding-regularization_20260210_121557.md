# MOVER: Multimodal Optimal Transport with Volume-based Embedding Regularization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.12149
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12149
- Authors: Haochen You; Baojing Liu
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: Achieves state-of-the-art results on text-video-audio retrieval with Recall@1 improvements up to +4.5 percentage points in zero-shot settings and +3.8 in finetuned settings

## Executive Summary
MOVER is a multimodal representation learning framework that integrates optimal transport-based soft alignment with volume-based geometric regularization to build semantically consistent and structured embeddings across multiple modalities. The approach uses optimal transport for flexible cross-modal matching and a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE) to enforce structural alignment. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with Recall@1 improvements up to +4.5 percentage points in zero-shot settings and +3.8 in finetuned settings. MOVER also generalizes well to unseen modality combinations and produces more coherent and semantically separated embedding spaces than existing methods.

## Method Summary
MOVER combines optimal transport-based soft alignment with volume-based geometric regularization to learn cross-modal embeddings. The framework first uses optimal transport to compute soft alignment between different modality representations, allowing for flexible matching rather than rigid pairwise correspondence. It then applies a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE) that encourages the learned embeddings to form structured, compact spaces while maintaining semantic separation. This dual approach addresses both the alignment and structural consistency challenges in multimodal representation learning. The method is trained end-to-end on multimodal datasets, with the optimal transport component computing transport plans between modality distributions and the volume regularization enforcing geometric constraints on the embedding manifold.

## Key Results
- Achieves Recall@1 improvements up to +4.5 percentage points in zero-shot text-video-audio retrieval
- Demonstrates +3.8 percentage point improvements in finetuned settings
- Shows strong generalization to unseen modality combinations
- Produces more semantically separated and coherent embedding spaces compared to existing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MOVER's effectiveness stems from its dual approach to multimodal representation learning. The optimal transport component provides soft alignment between modalities by computing transport plans that minimize the cost of matching representations, allowing for flexible and semantically meaningful cross-modal correspondences. This is particularly effective for handling noise and partial matches in real-world data. The geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE) then enforces structural alignment by encouraging the embedding space to maintain compact, well-separated regions for different semantic concepts while minimizing overall volume. This combination ensures that learned representations are both semantically aligned across modalities and geometrically structured for effective retrieval and downstream tasks.

## Foundational Learning

### Optimal Transport Theory
- **Why needed**: Provides mathematical framework for computing optimal matching between probability distributions, essential for soft alignment between modalities
- **Quick check**: Verify that the Wasserstein distance formulation correctly handles the dimensionality of cross-modal feature spaces

### Volume-Based Regularization
- **Why needed**: Enforces geometric structure in embedding space to maintain semantic separation while minimizing redundancy
- **Quick check**: Confirm that the volume minimization objective preserves class boundaries in learned representations

### Multimodal Embedding Spaces
- **Why needed**: Understanding how different modalities map to shared representation spaces for effective cross-modal retrieval
- **Quick check**: Validate that learned embeddings maintain modality-specific characteristics while enabling cross-modal matching

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
MOVER architecture follows: Input Modalities -> Feature Extractors -> Optimal Transport Alignment -> Volume Regularization -> Shared Embedding Space

### Critical Path
The critical path for training involves: feature extraction from each modality → optimal transport computation between modality pairs → volume regularization application → joint optimization of alignment and structural objectives

### Design Tradeoffs
The framework trades computational complexity (due to optimal transport) for improved alignment flexibility and geometric structure. The volume regularization adds additional computation but enables better semantic separation compared to purely alignment-based methods.

### Failure Signatures
Potential failure modes include: computational bottlenecks with large datasets due to optimal transport scaling, suboptimal volume regularization leading to collapsed or poorly separated embeddings, and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices affecting the balance between alignment and regularization objectives.

### 3 First Experiments
1. Ablation study removing volume regularization to quantify its contribution to performance gains
2. Computational complexity analysis measuring training and inference time scaling with dataset size
3. Cross-modal clustering evaluation to verify semantic separation in learned embedding spaces

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns with optimal transport component for large-scale real-world applications
- Limited validation of volume-based regularization across diverse domain combinations beyond text-video-audio
- Reliance on Recall@1 metric without comprehensive embedding space quality analysis
- Complex implementation requiring careful hyperparameter tuning with unclear relative component contributions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical formulation is sound and reported state-of-the-art results are reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalization claims to unseen modality combinations are supported but need broader validation
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about representation coherence lack quantitative validation beyond retrieval metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct scalability analysis measuring training and inference time as a function of dataset size, comparing against baseline methods
2. Evaluate MOVER on diverse modality pairs (text-image, audio-text, medical imaging with clinical notes) to assess volume regularization robustness
3. Perform quantitative analysis of learned embedding space using semantic separability scores, neighborhood consistency measures, and cross-modal clustering quality metrics
