# Ensemble Distribution Distillation for Self-Supervised Human Activity Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.08225
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08225
- **Authors:** Matthew Nolan; Lina Yao; Robert Davidson
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces EDD for HAR, achieving improved accuracy, robust uncertainty estimates, and adversarial resilience without ensemble inference overhead.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) for self-supervised Human Activity Recognition (HAR), addressing challenges of limited labeled data, model reliability, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. The method leverages unlabeled data and semi-supervised learning to train an ensemble of models, then distills their collective knowledge into a single prior network. This approach achieves improved predictive accuracy, principled uncertainty estimates (epistemic and aleatoric), and substantial robustness against adversarial inputs, all without increasing computational complexity at inference time. Experiments on multiple public HAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method matches or exceeds the accuracy of ensembles while providing superior resilience to adversarial perturbations and more reliable uncertainty estimates.

## Method Summary
The method combines self-supervised pre-training on transformation prediction with ensemble distillation. First, a convolutional base learns representations by predicting applied transformations to unlabeled sensor data. These weights transfer to the supervised HAR task with limited labels. An ensemble of independently trained models is then created, each initialized with varied parameters. The ensemble's collective predictions are distilled into a single prior network that outputs Dirichlet parameters. The distillation minimizes KL divergence between the parametrized distribution and the empirical ensemble distribution, with HAR-specific augmentations improving uncertainty calibration in regions away from training data.

## Key Results
- EDD matches or exceeds ensemble accuracy while providing superior adversarial robustness (ε=0.1)
- The method produces principled epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates
- Significant improvement in AUC-ROC for uncertainty quality compared to baseline methods
- No increase in computational complexity at inference time despite ensemble-level performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Distilling ensemble diversity into a single prior network preserves ensemble-level robustness and uncertainty without inference-time overhead.
- Mechanism: The ensemble's implicit posterior is explicitly modeled as a Dirichlet distribution parametrized by the prior network's outputs. Training minimizes KL divergence between this parametrized distribution and the empirical distribution implied by ensemble predictions.
- Core assumption: The ensemble's diversity genuinely reflects posterior uncertainty (requires independently trained members with varied initialization and batching).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "distills their collective knowledge into a single prior network... without increasing computational complexity at inference time"
  - [section 2.3]: "the outputs of the distillation model are considered to be the parameters of a probability distribution... trained by minimizing the KL divergence"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus support for EDD specifically; related work on knowledge distillation for HAR exists but does not address uncertainty distillation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Self-supervised pre-training on transformation prediction learns representations that transfer to downstream HAR with limited labels.
- Mechanism: Unlabeled sensor data undergoes transformations (noising, scaling, rotation, time-warping, etc.). A convolutional base learns to predict which transformation was applied. These weights transfer to the supervised HAR task, reducing label requirements.
- Core assumption: Features useful for distinguishing transformations are also useful for distinguishing activities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "leveraging unlabeled data and semi-supervised learning"
  - [section 2.1]: "a model was trained in a self-supervised way to identify specific transformations... The learned features are then used in the downstream fully-supervised step"
  - [corpus]: "Subject Invariant Contrastive Learning for Human Activity Recognition" supports contrastive/self-supervised approaches for HAR with domain shifts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Augmenting distillation data with transformed samples and weighted combinations improves uncertainty calibration in regions away from training data.
- Mechanism: EDD alone fails to capture epistemic uncertainty outside the training manifold. Augmentation extends the distillation dataset: (1) applying transforms forces invariance, (2) weighted combinations of multiple samples create "inter-class" regions where ensemble uncertainty should be high, training the prior network to output higher entropy there.
- Core assumption: The ensemble's uncertainty on synthetic intermediate samples is meaningful and generalizes to real out-of-distribution inputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "HAR-specific augmentations improve robustness and calibration"
  - [section 3.1.1]: "EDD failed to capture epistemic uncertainty in regions away from the training data... additional inputs were sampled away from the training data and added to the training set"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for this specific augmentation strategy; this appears novel to the paper.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: KL Divergence**
  - Why needed here: The loss function for distillation; measures mismatch between the prior network's Dirichlet distribution and ensemble's empirical distribution.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why minimizing KL divergence is asymmetric (p||q ≠ q||p) and which direction this method uses?

- **Concept: Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty**
  - Why needed here: The method claims to separate these; epistemic (model/reducible) captures out-of-distribution, aleatoric (data/irreducible) captures noise.
  - Quick check question: Given a sample with high ensemble disagreement, which uncertainty type should increase?

- **Concept: Dirichlet Distribution over Simplex**
  - Why needed here: The prior network outputs Dirichlet parameters (α); uncertainty metrics derive from these via entropy and digamma functions (Equations 6a-c).
  - Quick check question: If all α_i are large and equal, what does this imply about total uncertainty?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Unlabeled data -> Self-supervised pre-training -> Transfer to supervised HAR -> Ensemble training (50 members) -> Augmented distillation dataset -> Prior network (Dirichlet parameters) -> NLL loss with temperature annealing

- **Critical path:**
  1. Train ensemble members independently (expensive, one-time)
  2. Generate distillation dataset by running all ensemble members on augmented data
  3. Train prior network to minimize NLL; anneal temperature; gradually increase weighted-combo augmentation depth

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Ensemble size: Larger (50) improves uncertainty but increases distillation dataset generation cost; smaller (10) is faster but may lose diversity
  - Temperature annealing: Faster annealing risks training instability; slower annealing delays diversity learning
  - Frozen pre-trained layers: Freezing reduces overfitting on limited labels but may limit adaptation

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low AUC-ROC on unperturbed data: Prior network not learning to discriminate correct/incorrect predictions
  - High accuracy but near-random AUC-ROC under perturbation: Uncertainty estimates not robust
  - Training divergence: Temperature schedule too aggressive or too many uncertain samples early

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline sanity check:** Single model vs. ensemble-10 vs. ensemble-50 on unperturbed validation; expect ensemble to outperform, verify implementation
  2. **Ablation on augmentation:** Train prior network with (a) no augmentation, (b) transforms only, (c) weighted combinations only, (d) both; compare AUC-ROC under adversarial perturbation (ε=0.1)
  3. **Label efficiency curve:** Vary labeled samples per class (10, 25, 50, 100); plot accuracy and AUC-ROC for single model, ensemble, and EDD; identify crossover point where EDD matches ensemble

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the separable epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates from the distilled model be leveraged to improve active learning or control schemes in real-world HAR applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 29 states the need to "further investigate the use of separable sources of uncertainty to improve outcomes... for example in active learning."
- Why unresolved: The current study validates the robustness and calibration of uncertainty estimates but does not integrate them into active learning pipelines or control systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results from experiments where the model actively queries labels based on epistemic uncertainty or adjusts control logic based on aleatoric uncertainty.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the proposed semi-supervised ensemble distillation model offer superior domain adaptation capabilities compared to standard semi-supervised baselines?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 29 lists "Compare the domain adaptation capacity of semi-supervised models to our semi-supervised ensemble distillation model" as future work.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are conducted within-dataset (different users, same dataset) and do not test performance when transferring knowledge to entirely new sensor modalities or environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-dataset performance analysis (e.g., training on smartphone data, testing on smartwatch data) comparing the method against non-distilled semi-supervised models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can further advancements in data augmentation techniques specifically designed for time-series data improve the distillation of ensemble diversity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 29 calls for "Further investigation of data augmentation techniques for EDD in HAR."
- Why unresolved: The authors introduced weighted combinations for augmentation but suggest that further techniques could better capture the full diversity of the ensemble.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies identifying specific augmentation methods that reduce the performance gap between the distilled model and the full ensemble, particularly in regions of high uncertainty.

## Limitations
- Claims about uncertainty quality rely on AUC-ROC computed via binary predictions from a thresholded uncertainty metric, which may not fully capture calibration quality
- The method assumes ensemble diversity is sufficient for meaningful distillation, but diversity metrics or failure modes are not explored
- The efficacy of the augmentation strategy (weighted combinations) is not directly validated against simpler baselines

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Improved robustness to adversarial perturbations and accuracy on clean data (well-supported by experimental results across four datasets)
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism of epistemic/aleatoric uncertainty separation via Dirichlet parameters (partially validated by AUC-ROC but lacks calibration curve analysis)
- **Low confidence**: The necessity and effectiveness of the weighted combination augmentation strategy (appears novel with limited ablation)

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on augmentation depth:** Train prior network with (a) no augmentation, (b) transforms only, (c) weighted combinations only, (d) both; compare AUC-ROC under adversarial perturbation (ε=0.1) and calibration curves on out-of-distribution samples
2. **Diversity analysis:** Measure ensemble prediction entropy and inter-model agreement; test whether distillation fails when diversity is artificially reduced (e.g., train ensemble members with same initialization)
3. **Calibration validation:** Generate reliability diagrams comparing EDD uncertainty estimates against true error rates on held-out test data; test whether high-uncertainty samples are indeed misclassified more often
