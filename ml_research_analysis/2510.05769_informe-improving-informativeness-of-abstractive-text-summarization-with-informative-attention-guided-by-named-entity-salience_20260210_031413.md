# InforME: Improving Informativeness of Abstractive Text Summarization With Informative Attention Guided by Named Entity Salience

- This paper proposes a novel approach combining optimal transport-based informative attention and accumulative joint entropy reduction to improve informativeness in abstractive text summarization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving informativeness in abstractive text summarization by proposing a novel learning approach that combines two methods: an optimal transport-based informative attention method and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities. The optimal transport-based informative attention learns focal information from reference summaries that may be missed by traditional cross-attention mechanisms, while the accumulative joint entropy reduction enhances named entity salience in the model's latent space. Experiments on CNN/Daily Mail and XSum datasets demonstrate that the approach achieves better ROUGE scores on CNN/Daily Mail and competitive results on XSum, with human evaluation confirming superior informativeness.

## Method Summary
The proposed InforME approach combines optimal transport-based informative attention with accumulative joint entropy reduction to enhance named entity salience. The optimal transport component learns focal information from reference summaries that traditional cross-attention mechanisms might miss, while the joint entropy reduction component improves the salience of named entities in the model's latent space. This dual-method approach is designed to address the informativeness gap in abstractive summarization by ensuring key information, particularly named entities, are preserved and emphasized in generated summaries.

## Key Results
- Achieved better ROUGE scores on CNN/Daily Mail dataset compared to baseline models
- Demonstrated competitive performance on XSum dataset
- Human evaluation confirmed superior informativeness compared to strong baseline models on both datasets
- Showed ability to mine extrinsic knowledge within datasets, potentially explaining performance differences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing two key limitations in traditional abstractive summarization: (1) missing focal information in reference summaries due to limitations in cross-attention mechanisms, and (2) insufficient emphasis on named entity salience in the latent space. The optimal transport-based attention learns to identify and preserve crucial information that standard attention mechanisms might overlook, while the accumulative joint entropy reduction ensures named entities maintain their importance throughout the generation process. This dual mechanism ensures both content completeness and semantic richness in generated summaries.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Optimal Transport Theory** - Needed to understand how the attention mechanism redistributes focus across the input space; quick check: verify the Wasserstein distance calculations are correctly implemented.
2. **Cross-Attention Mechanisms** - Essential for understanding limitations in standard transformer attention; quick check: confirm baseline models use standard cross-attention.
3. **Named Entity Recognition** - Critical for identifying which entities should be preserved; quick check: validate entity extraction accuracy on test datasets.
4. **Joint Entropy Reduction** - Required to understand how salience is enhanced; quick check: measure entropy changes before and after reduction.
5. **Abstractive Summarization Metrics** - Necessary for evaluating informativeness beyond ROUGE; quick check: verify human evaluation criteria are clearly defined.
6. **Transformer Architecture** - Fundamental for understanding where and how the proposed methods integrate; quick check: map proposed components to standard transformer blocks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Document -> Named Entity Extraction -> Cross-Attention -> Optimal Transport Attention -> Joint Entropy Reduction -> Output Summary

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows through named entity extraction, followed by the dual attention mechanisms (cross-attention and optimal transport attention), then through the joint entropy reduction layer before summary generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades increased computational complexity from optimal transport calculations against improved informativeness. The design prioritizes semantic richness over speed, potentially limiting real-time applications.

**Failure Signatures**: Models may over-emphasize named entities at the expense of fluency, or the optimal transport component may introduce artifacts if reference summaries contain noisy information.

**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study comparing full model against versions without optimal transport or joint entropy reduction, 2) Entity coverage analysis comparing named entity preservation rates, 3) Human evaluation of factual consistency alongside informativeness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance improvements vary significantly between CNN/Daily Mail and XSum datasets, suggesting limited generalizability
- Computational overhead of optimal transport-based attention is not discussed, which could impact practical deployment
- Claims about mining "extrinsic knowledge" remain speculative without rigorous analysis of what specific knowledge is captured

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation of optimal transport-based attention and accumulative joint entropy reduction is sound
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about superior informativeness based on human evaluation due to limited methodology details
- **Medium confidence**: Assertion about mining extrinsic knowledge as this is observation-based rather than rigorously analyzed

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate individual contributions of optimal transport attention versus accumulative joint entropy reduction
2. Perform detailed error analysis comparing information types captured by proposed approach versus baseline models
3. Evaluate approach on additional summarization datasets beyond CNN/Daily Mail and XSum to assess generalizability
