# Lifelong Learning with Behavior Consolidation for Vehicle Routing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21765
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21765
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed LLR-BC framework effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in neural VRP solvers while maintaining plasticity and improving zero-shot generalization across multiple task orders.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LLR-BC, a lifelong learning framework designed to address catastrophic forgetting in neural vehicle routing problem (VRP) solvers. The framework consolidates knowledge from previously learned tasks by aligning the solver's behavior with buffered experiences from past tasks, focusing specifically on low-confidence decisions. Through extensive experiments on CVRP and TSP across multiple task orders, LLR-BC demonstrates consistent improvements over baseline methods, effectively balancing the trade-off between remembering old tasks and learning new ones.

## Method Summary
LLR-BC tackles catastrophic forgetting by consolidating past task knowledge through behavior alignment. The framework uses two key components: Confidence-aware Experience Weighting (CaEW) that prioritizes important experiences from past tasks based on confidence scores, and Decision-seeking Behavior Consolidation (DsBC) that explicitly consolidates low-confidence decisions. The method maintains a buffer of experiences from previous tasks and uses them during training to prevent forgetting while maintaining plasticity for new tasks.

## Key Results
- LLR-BC consistently outperforms baseline methods in solving learned tasks across multiple VRP problems and task orders
- The framework maintains strong performance on previously learned tasks while effectively learning new ones
- Zero-shot generalization capabilities are improved compared to existing approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by focusing on consolidating low-confidence decisions from past tasks, which are typically the most critical for performance. By maintaining a buffer of past experiences and using confidence-aware weighting, the model can selectively reinforce important knowledge while remaining flexible for new learning. The behavior consolidation approach directly addresses the forgetting problem by ensuring that key decision patterns from previous tasks are preserved during new task training.

## Foundational Learning
- Catastrophic forgetting: The tendency of neural networks to rapidly forget previously learned information when trained on new tasks - needed because VRP solvers must learn multiple routing problems sequentially; quick check: compare performance on old tasks before/after training on new tasks
- Lifelong learning: The ability to learn multiple tasks sequentially without forgetting - needed because real-world VRP scenarios involve diverse problem instances; quick check: test performance across multiple task orders
- Confidence-based learning: Using model confidence scores to identify important training examples - needed to prioritize which past experiences to consolidate; quick check: analyze correlation between confidence scores and consolidation effectiveness
- Experience replay: Storing and reusing past training examples - needed to maintain access to previous task knowledge; quick check: evaluate impact of buffer size on performance
- Behavior alignment: Matching current model behavior to past experiences - needed to prevent forgetting while allowing plasticity; quick check: measure behavior divergence between tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input Task -> CaEW Module -> DsBC Module -> Solver Network -> Output Solution

**Critical path:** Task input flows through confidence weighting and behavior consolidation modules before reaching the solver network, with buffered experiences from past tasks being selectively incorporated based on confidence scores.

**Design tradeoffs:** The framework balances between consolidation strength (preventing forgetting) and plasticity (learning new tasks) through the CaEW module, with buffer size representing a key hyperparameter trade-off between memory efficiency and consolidation quality.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance on old tasks indicates insufficient consolidation, while degraded performance on new tasks suggests over-consolidation. Low confidence scores on previously mastered tasks may indicate forgetting.

**3 first experiments:**
1. Test LLR-BC on a simple sequence of two VRP tasks to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate performance degradation when buffer size is reduced to minimum
3. Compare CaEW-only versus DsBC-only variants to isolate component contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Fixed buffer size may become insufficient as the number of tasks grows indefinitely
- Computational overhead of maintaining and querying buffered experiences is not thoroughly analyzed
- Effectiveness on complex VRP variants with time windows or multiple objectives remains untested

## Confidence
- Core claims about mitigating catastrophic forgetting: High
- Claims about maintaining plasticity while preventing forgetting: High
- Claims about zero-shot generalization improvements: Medium
- Claims about scalability to unlimited tasks: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test LLR-BC on more diverse VRP variants (e.g., VRP with time windows, pickup and delivery) to assess generalizability
2. Analyze the trade-off between buffer size and performance to determine scalability limits
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of CaEW and DsBC components to overall performance
