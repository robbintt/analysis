# Towards High Supervised Learning Utility Training Data Generation: Data Pruning and Column Reordering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.10088
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10088
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** PRRO pipeline improves synthetic tabular data utility for supervised learning through data pruning and column reordering

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the persistent challenge of low supervised learning utility in synthetic tabular data generated by current synthetic data generators. The authors propose a novel pre-processing pipeline called Pruning and ReOrdering (PRRO) that tackles two main issues: class imbalance exaggeration and the overlooking of supervised learning-specific data relationships by generators. The PRRO pipeline consists of two key modules - Signal-based Data Pruning to balance class distributions and Column Conditional ReOrdering to align generator assumptions with SL model requirements.

The pipeline demonstrates significant improvements in synthetic data quality, with experimental results showing an average 26.74% improvement in synthetic replacement scenarios and 6.13% improvement in appendant scenarios across 22 diverse datasets. The approach particularly excels with imbalanced datasets, achieving 43% improvement in class distribution similarity. The authors provide comprehensive experimental validation using both CTTab and TGAN generators, making this a promising solution for enhancing the utility of synthetic tabular data in supervised learning applications.

## Method Summary
The PRRO pipeline addresses two critical issues in synthetic tabular data generation for supervised learning: class imbalance exaggeration and the overlooking of SL-specific data relationships. The first module, Signal-based Data Pruning, identifies and removes low signal-to-noise ratio observations to create a more balanced class distribution. This is achieved by computing signal-to-noise ratios for each class and pruning observations that fall below a threshold, ensuring the synthetic data maintains high predictive value while addressing class imbalance.

The second module, Column Conditional ReOrdering, reorganizes the feature relationships to better align with supervised learning assumptions. This involves analyzing the conditional dependencies between features and the target variable, then reordering columns to reflect these relationships more accurately. The pipeline processes data through both modules sequentially, first pruning imbalanced classes and then reordering features to enhance the synthetic data's utility for supervised learning tasks.

## Key Results
- PRRO pipeline achieves 26.74% average improvement in synthetic replacement scenarios and 6.13% improvement in appendant scenarios across 22 datasets
- Particularly effective for imbalanced datasets, showing 43% improvement in class distribution similarity
- Validated across both CTTab and TGAN synthetic data generators
- Demonstrates significant improvements in downstream supervised learning model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The PRRO pipeline works by addressing the fundamental mismatch between synthetic data generation assumptions and supervised learning requirements. By first pruning low signal-to-noise observations, the pipeline removes noisy data that can confuse learning algorithms while preserving the most informative samples. The column reordering then restructures feature relationships to better reflect the conditional dependencies that supervised learning models rely on, creating synthetic data that more closely resembles the original data's predictive structure.

## Foundational Learning

**Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Analysis**
- Why needed: Identifies observations with high predictive value versus random noise
- Quick check: Verify SNR computation correctly distinguishes informative from non-informative samples

**Class Distribution Balancing**
- Why needed: Prevents synthetic generators from exaggerating existing imbalances
- Quick check: Confirm pruned dataset maintains representative minority class samples

**Conditional Dependency Analysis**
- Why needed: Captures feature relationships relevant to supervised learning
- Quick check: Validate that reordered features preserve predictive relationships with target

**Synthetic Data Quality Metrics**
- Why needed: Quantifies improvements in data utility for downstream tasks
- Quick check: Ensure metrics align with actual model performance improvements

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Original Data -> Signal-based Pruning -> Column Reordering -> Synthetic Generation -> Validation

**Critical Path**
Data Preprocessing (Pruning + Reordering) -> Synthetic Generation -> Model Training -> Performance Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Pruning vs. Data Preservation: Balancing class balance improvement against information loss
- Reordering Complexity: Computational cost of dependency analysis vs. utility gains
- Generator Compatibility: Pipeline must work across different synthetic data generators

**Failure Signatures**
- Over-pruning leading to loss of important minority class patterns
- Incorrect reordering that breaks essential feature relationships
- Poor generalization to regression tasks or high-dimensional data

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Apply PRRO to a highly imbalanced binary classification dataset and measure class balance improvement
2. Compare downstream model performance using original vs. PRRO-processed synthetic data
3. Test PRRO pipeline with both CTTab and TGAN generators on the same dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to classification tasks, leaving regression effectiveness unclear
- Reliance on specific synthetic generators (CTTab and TGAN) may limit generalizability
- Computational overhead not explicitly discussed for large-scale applications

## Confidence
- **Medium** - Results based on 22 datasets but may not generalize to all data types
- **Medium** - Evaluation focuses on classification, effectiveness for regression unknown
- **Medium** - Impact on other data quality metrics not thoroughly investigated

## Next Checks
1. Test PRRO pipeline on additional datasets with different characteristics (regression tasks, high-dimensional data, or domain-specific data like healthcare/finance)
2. Conduct thorough analysis of computational cost and scalability of PRRO pipeline across varying dataset sizes
3. Evaluate impact of PRRO on downstream tasks beyond supervised learning, such as unsupervised learning or data mining tasks
