# RPC-Bench: A Fine-grained Benchmark for Research Paper Comprehension

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14289
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14289
- Reference count: 40
- RPC-Bench achieves 68.2% correctness-completeness on research paper comprehension, dropping to 37.46% under conciseness constraints

## Executive Summary
RPC-Bench is a large-scale benchmark for research paper comprehension built from review-rebuttal exchanges, featuring 15K human-verified QA pairs across 9 fine-grained categories. It introduces a taxonomy aligned with the scientific research workflow to assess models' ability to answer why, what, and how questions in scholarly contexts. An LLM-human interaction annotation framework supports scalable labeling and quality control. Using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, RPC-Bench evaluates correctness, completeness, and conciseness with high agreement to human judgment. Experiments show that even the strongest model (GPT-5) achieves only 68.2% correctness-completeness, dropping to 37.46% under conciseness constraints, highlighting significant gaps in precise academic paper understanding.

## Method Summary
RPC-Bench is built from review-rebuttal exchanges of high-quality computer science papers, containing 15K human-verified QA pairs across 9 categories. The benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 evaluating correctness, completeness, and conciseness (0-5 scale). Answers are limited to 3,000 characters and scored against reference answers using specific prompts. The test set contains 2,787 QA pairs across 200 computer science papers, with text inputs processed via MinerU and image inputs rendered via PyMuPDF at 200 DPI (first 15 pages).

## Key Results
- GPT-5 achieves 68.2% F1-like score on correctness-completeness, dropping to 37.46% when evaluated on conciseness
- Text-only inputs yield higher F1-like scores than image inputs, with 4.74-36.1% reduction across models
- Models perform better on simpler tasks (concept understanding, method discrimination) than deeper reasoning tasks (experimental analysis, claim verification)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Authentic review-rebuttal exchanges generate higher-quality, more realistic QA pairs than synthetic generation
- Mechanism: Peer reviews naturally probe weak points, ambiguities, and missing details in papers; author rebuttals provide grounded, authoritative answers that are verifiable against the final camera-ready paper
- Core assumption: Reviewer-author exchanges reflect genuine comprehension challenges readers face, rather than artificial scenarios
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "built from review–rebuttal exchanges of high-quality computer science papers, containing 15K human-verified QA pairs"; [section 3.1] "Collected 44.7K peer-reviewed papers with review–rebuttal pairs from OpenReview (2013–2024)"; [corpus] Related benchmarks (SPIQA, ArXivQA) use synthetic QA pairs; PeerQA uses real reviews but at much smaller scale (579 QA pairs vs. 61.3K)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Taxonomy aligned with research workflow (what → how → why) enables targeted diagnosis of comprehension failures
- Mechanism: Structuring questions by cognitive depth allows separate measurement of surface-level information retrieval (Concept Understanding), methodological reasoning (Method Mechanics), and causal/explanatory understanding (Experimental Analysis)
- Core assumption: Comprehension progresses through hierarchical stages where deeper reasoning depends on foundational concept understanding
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "fine-grained taxonomy aligned with the scientific research flow to assess models' ability to understand and answer why, what, and how questions"; [section 4.3] "models perform better on simpler tasks (e.g., concept understanding, method discrimination) than on deeper reasoning tasks"; [corpus] SciVer similarly evaluates multimodal scientific claim verification but uses different reasoning-type categories

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLM-as-a-Judge with separate dimension evaluation (correctness, completeness, conciseness) achieves high agreement with human evaluators
- Mechanism: Providing judges with paper context (title, abstract) grounds evaluation in domain knowledge; scoring dimensions independently prevents error propagation from one dimension to others
- Core assumption: Strong LLMs can approximate human judgment when given sufficient context and structured evaluation criteria
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "evaluates models on correctness-completeness and conciseness, with high agreement to human judgment"; [section 4.4] "average agreement of over 85%" between GPT-5/Gemini-3 judges and human annotators; [corpus] Corpus evidence for LLM-as-a-Judge reliability is sparse; this paper provides direct validation

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Review-rebuttal structure in academic peer review**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how reviews decompose into comment-response pairs is essential for the data transformation pipeline
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a single review might generate multiple independent QA pairs?

- Concept: **F1-like score (harmonic mean of precision and recall analogs)**
  - Why needed here: The benchmark uses F1-like as the primary metric; understanding how it balances correctness vs. completeness is critical for interpreting results
  - Quick check question: If a model achieves 90% correctness but 50% completeness, what is its F1-like score?

- Concept: **Multimodal document understanding (text + rendered pages)**
  - Why needed here: RPC-Bench evaluates both text-only and image-based inputs; results show consistent performance drops with image inputs (4.74–36.1% F1-like reduction)
  - Quick check question: Why might a VLM struggle with PDF-rendered pages despite having visual capabilities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection (OpenReview crawler → AMiner metadata matching → impact-aware sampling) → QA construction (GPT-4o decomposition → GLM-4-Plus/DeepSeek-V3 rewriting → quality filtering) → Annotation (Human verification with Cohen's Kappa ≥ 0.72 agreement) → Evaluation (Multi-judge LLM scoring on 3 dimensions → F1-like and Informativeness metrics)

- Critical path: Ensure all QA pairs are answerable solely from the camera-ready paper (not external URLs, not editorial issues) → Verify taxonomy assignment accuracy before annotation → Ground-truth answers must be traceable to paper content with section/figure references validated

- Design tradeoffs: Cost vs. quality (training set retains LLM-generated QA; validation/test sets are manually annotated) → Coverage vs. depth (9 categories enable fine-grained analysis but reduce per-category sample sizes) → Text vs. image inputs (text-only yields higher F1-like; image inputs test multimodal capabilities but suffer from compression losses)

- Failure signatures: Degenerative output (repetitive, non-informative text, e.g., VdocRAG's 19,867-character repeated response) → Hallucination (models claim information is absent when it exists in the paper) → Instruction-following failures (claim verification outputs not strictly "True"/"False")

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline text-only evaluation: Run GPT-4o or similar on test set with pure-text input; measure F1-like and Informativeness to establish floor performance
  2. Text vs. image comparison: For multimodal-capable models, compare text-only vs. page-image inputs (first 15 pages at 200 DPI); quantify F1-like gap
  3. Category-specific analysis: Evaluate model performance across all 9 categories; identify where performance drops most (likely Experimental Analysis and Claim Verification based on paper findings)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the RPC-Bench framework be effectively extended to evaluate cross-document reasoning and multi-paper synthesis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that "future work will extend the evaluation to cross-document reasoning and multi-paper synthesis, broadening the benchmark's applicability"
- Why unresolved: The current benchmark is specifically designed for single-article understanding and cannot assess a model's ability to reconcile conflicting results or synthesize information across different papers
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified benchmark dataset containing clusters of related papers with questions requiring evidence integration from multiple sources

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the RPC-Bench taxonomy and evaluation protocol transfer effectively to scientific domains outside of computer science?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the current release "primarily covers computer science" and identify "future expansion into additional areas such as the life sciences and social sciences" as an open direction
- Why unresolved: The specialized discourse, figure types (e.g., biological diagrams vs. loss curves), and terminology in other fields may require different comprehension skills not captured by the current CS-focused dataset
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating state-of-the-art models on a life-sciences version of the benchmark to see if performance rankings and failure modes remain consistent

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific architectural or training improvements are required to close the performance gap between text-only and vision-based paper comprehension?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Results show that for multimodal-capable models, replacing text inputs with page-image inputs consistently reduced F1-like scores by 4.74–36.1%, indicating "persistent weaknesses in visual reasoning over scholarly documents"
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the performance drop is caused by information loss during image compression, inferior OCR integration, or a fundamental inability to spatially reason over complex layouts like tables and figures
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing raw OCR text, rendered images, and layout-encoded inputs to isolate the bottleneck in current Vision Language Models

## Limitations
- Reliance on proprietary future models (GPT-5, Gemini-3) as reference judges, which may not be accessible to all researchers
- 200 DPI image rendering at 15 pages may not capture all visual elements crucial for certain paper comprehension tasks
- Generalizability of results across different CS subfields and paper types remains uncertain

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Taxonomy alignment with research workflow and authentic review-rebuttal exchanges for QA generation are well-supported by corpus evidence; model performance gaps are empirically grounded
- **Medium Confidence**: LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm shows strong initial validation but lacks extensive independent verification; scalability benefits are theoretically sound but not stress-tested
- **Low Confidence**: Specific impact of image quality parameters on multimodal performance is not thoroughly explored; generalizability across scientific domains remains uncertain

## Next Checks
1. **Judge Model Substitution Validation**: Replace GPT-5 and Gemini-3 with accessible SOTA models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5) and measure agreement degradation with human annotations to establish robustness of the evaluation framework

2. **Image Quality Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary DPI (100-600) and page limits (5-50) for a subset of papers to quantify the relationship between visual fidelity and F1-like performance, identifying critical thresholds for effective multimodal comprehension

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply RPC-Bench to papers from non-CS domains (biology, physics, social sciences) to assess whether the taxonomy alignment and performance patterns hold across different scientific writing styles and technical content types
