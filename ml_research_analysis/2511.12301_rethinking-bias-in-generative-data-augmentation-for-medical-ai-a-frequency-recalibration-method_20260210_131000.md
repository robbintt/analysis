# Rethinking Bias in Generative Data Augmentation for Medical AI: a Frequency Recalibration Method

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12301
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12301
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Frequency Recalibration (FreRec) method improves medical image classification accuracy by up to 5% accuracy points by addressing frequency misalignment between real and synthetic images

## Executive Summary
Generative data augmentation (GDA) using AI models can synthesize realistic medical images to address data scarcity, but its reliability is often underestimated. This study identifies frequency misalignment between real and synthetic images as a key factor undermining GDA reliability in medical AI. The proposed Frequency Recalibration (FreRec) method addresses this through two steps: Statistical High-frequency Replacement (SHR) for rough frequency alignment, and Reconstructive High-frequency Mapping (RHM) for fine-grained detail restoration. FreRec is a standalone post-processing step compatible with any generative model. Experiments on brain MRIs, chest X-rays, and fundus images show FreRec consistently improves classification accuracy compared to uncalibrated GDA, with classification improvements of up to 5% accuracy points across different disease detection tasks.

## Method Summary
The study identifies frequency misalignment between real and AI-synthesized medical images as a critical factor undermining GDA reliability. The proposed Frequency Recalibration (FreRec) method addresses this through two sequential steps: Statistical High-frequency Replacement (SHR) for rough frequency alignment, and Reconstructive High-frequency Mapping (RHM) for fine-grained detail restoration. SHR computes the FFT of synthetic images, selects top-k similar real images via SSIM, and replaces synthetic high-frequency components using Gaussian sampling based on real sample statistics. RHM then trains a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) exclusively on real images to reconstruct natural frequency patterns, using both pixel MSE and spectral MSE losses. The complete FreRec pipeline serves as a post-processing step compatible with any generative model.

## Key Results
- Classification accuracy improvements of up to 5% accuracy points across different disease detection tasks
- FreRec consistently outperforms uncalibrated GDA across three medical imaging modalities (brain MRIs, chest X-rays, fundus images)
- Improved reliability of GDA in downstream classification tasks using ResNet50, DenseNet, and ViT-B-16 backbones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by addressing the fundamental frequency misalignment between real and synthetic medical images. AI-generated images often have mismatched frequency distributions compared to real medical images, creating domain gaps that degrade classification performance. By replacing high-frequency components with statistics from real images (SHR) and then reconstructing natural frequency patterns through a learned autoencoder (RHM), the method realigns the spectral characteristics of synthetic images to match real ones, reducing distribution shift in the frequency domain.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Understanding how to decompose images into frequency components using FFT
   - Why needed: The core innovation relies on manipulating high-frequency components that contain fine details and texture information
   - Quick check: Verify FFT implementation correctly separates low and high frequencies using the mask ratio r=0.5

2. **Spectral Reconstruction**: Training autoencoders to reconstruct natural frequency patterns
   - Why needed: RHM uses both pixel and spectral losses to ensure reconstructed images maintain natural frequency characteristics
   - Quick check: Monitor spectral loss term to ensure output spectrum matches target real image spectrum

3. **SSIM-based Nearest Neighbor Retrieval**: Finding similar real images for statistical replacement
   - Why needed: SHR requires selecting top-k similar real images to compute replacement statistics
   - Quick check: Pre-compute embeddings for real data to speed up nearest neighbor search

4. **High-frequency Component Manipulation**: Isolating and replacing high-frequency details
   - Why needed: High frequencies contain texture and fine details critical for medical image classification
   - Quick check: Visualize spatial output after SHR to ensure structural integrity is maintained

5. **Frequency-enhanced Transformer Architecture**: Understanding the modified Restormer backbone
   - Why needed: RHM uses a specialized autoencoder with Frequency-enhanced Transformer blocks
   - Quick check: Verify FESA block implementation correctly combines global spatial and local frequency attention

6. **Distribution Alignment**: Bridging the domain gap between real and synthetic images
   - Why needed: The ultimate goal is to make synthetic images indistinguishable from real ones in feature space
   - Quick check: Use T-SNE visualization to confirm feature-space overlap after FreRec processing

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Real Images -> FFT Analysis -> SSIM Retrieval -> SHR Module -> RHM Autoencoder -> Recalibrated Synthetic Images -> Downstream Classifier

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is FFT analysis → SHR → RHM → Classifier training. Each step builds on the previous one, with RHM being particularly crucial as it reconstructs natural frequency patterns that SHR may have distorted.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead (nearest neighbor search, autoencoder training) for improved classification reliability. The lossy SHR step provides rough alignment but may introduce artifacts, which RHM must then correct. The frequency-only approach may miss other domain gaps (color, semantic content).

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Ghosting artifacts in SHR output indicate incorrect mask ratio or abrupt transitions
- Identity mapping in RHM suggests the autoencoder learned to ignore perturbations
- Classification performance not improving despite FreRec processing indicates implementation issues

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Implement FFT masking with ratio r=0.5 and visualize the effect on sample images
2. Build and test the SSIM-based nearest neighbor retrieval for a small synthetic batch
3. Construct the basic Restormer autoencoder architecture without FESA modifications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How can the Reconstructive High-frequency Mapping (RHM) module be adapted to achieve complete feature-space alignment for color medical images, such as fundus photographs?
2. Does frequency recalibration improve the reliability of Generative Data Augmentation (GDA) for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation or lesion detection?
3. Can the application of FreRec effectively mitigate "model collapse" in scenarios where models are recursively trained on generated content?

## Limitations
- The exact autoencoder training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs) remain unspecified
- The circular ring width parameter in Frequency-enhanced Spatial Attention is conceptually described but lacks precise numerical definition
- Computational overhead of SSIM-based nearest neighbor retrieval is not quantified for practical deployment

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core methodology of frequency misalignment identification and the two-step SHR+RHM approach is clearly described and experimentally validated
- Medium confidence: The classification accuracy improvements (up to 5% accuracy points) are well-supported, though the exact magnitude may vary with different implementation choices
- Medium confidence: The claim that FreRec is compatible with any generative model is logically sound but requires empirical validation across diverse architectures

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the Frequency-enhanced Spatial Attention block with specific circular ring width parameters to confirm spectral reconstruction performance
2. Conduct ablation studies removing either SHR or RHM to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains
3. Measure and report the computational overhead of the SSIM-based nearest neighbor retrieval step to assess practical deployment feasibility
