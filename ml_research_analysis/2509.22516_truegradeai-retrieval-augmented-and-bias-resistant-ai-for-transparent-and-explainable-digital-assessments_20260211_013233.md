# TrueGradeAI: Retrieval-Augmented and Bias-Resistant AI for Transparent and Explainable Digital Assessments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.22516
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22516
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Retrieval-augmented grading outperformed LLM-only baselines with Pearson 0.982, Spearman 0.985, Cohen's Kappa 0.688 on 10,000 NCERT QA pairs

## Executive Summary
TrueGradeAI introduces a retrieval-augmented, bias-resistant AI framework for transparent digital assessments. It captures natural handwriting via stylus input on tablets, uses transformer-based OCR for transcription, and applies a two-tier RAG pipeline to score responses with explicit, evidence-linked rationales. The system preserves handwritten authenticity while enabling scalable, explainable grading and reducing environmental and logistical burdens of paper-based exams. Validation on 10,000 NCERT QA pairs showed strong alignment with human grading, and retrieval-augmented scoring outperformed LLM-only baselines in stability and accuracy. By integrating explainability, audit trails, and bias mitigation, TrueGradeAI provides a transparent, auditable, and equitable alternative to traditional digital exam platforms.

## Method Summary
TrueGradeAI processes handwritten student responses captured via stylus on tablets through Microsoft TrOCR for transcription, then embeds text using gemini-embedding-001. A two-tier RAG system first checks responses against faculty-prepared solutions (RAG1) using a similarity threshold, falling back to textbook materials (RAG2) with HOT/COLD cache layers if needed. Gemini 2.5 Pro generates scores and rationales based on retrieved context, while audit trails and randomized script allocation reduce evaluator bias. The system preserves both pen-stroke data and page images for future multimodal extensions.

## Key Results
- Retrieval-augmented scoring outperformed LLM-only baselines in stability and accuracy
- Strong alignment with human grading (Pearson 0.982, Spearman 0.985, Cohen's Kappa 0.688)
- Two-tier RAG with cache layers improved explainability while maintaining latency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented grading produces more stable and accurate alignment with human evaluators than LLM-only scoring.
- Mechanism: The two-tier RAG architecture anchors evaluation in faculty-prepared solutions (RAG1) and supporting materials (RAG2). Student responses are semantically compared against indexed reference answers; if similarity exceeds threshold, the answer proceeds to LLM scoring with retrieved context. Cache layers (HOT for frequently-accessed facts, COLD for broader context) reduce latency while preserving retrieval depth.
- Core assumption: Faculty-prepared solutions accurately represent correct answers and grading criteria.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "retrieval-augmented scoring outperformed LLM-only baselines in stability and accuracy"
  - [Section 4.1-4.2] Describes RAG1/RAG2 initialization and cache-augmented retrieval workflow
  - [corpus] RAGXplain and RAGVUE papers confirm RAG evaluation benefits for explainability; corpus evidence for grading-specific RAG is limited
- Break condition: If reference answers are incomplete, outdated, or poorly aligned with questions, retrieval grounding may propagate errors rather than correct them.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Transformer-based OCR enables reliable transcription of stylus-captured handwriting for downstream semantic comparison.
- Mechanism: Handwritten responses captured via stylus are transcribed using TrOCR, which combines vision and text transformers. Both pen-stroke data and page images are preserved, enabling future multimodal extensions.
- Core assumption: Student handwriting is sufficiently legible and within the distribution TrOCR was trained on.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "uses transformer-based OCR for transcription"
  - [Section 2.2, 3.1] TrOCR adopted as OCR backbone; preserves pen-stroke data for multimodal extensions
  - [corpus] "From Handwriting to Feedback" paper evaluates VLMs/LLMs on handwritten answers, supporting viability but highlighting domain variability
- Break condition: Cursive, highly irregular, or multilingual scripts may degrade transcription quality, propagating errors into embedding and retrieval stages.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Randomized script allocation and audit trails reduce evaluator bias and enable accountability.
- Mechanism: Submitted scripts are anonymized and reshuffled before distribution to reviewers. Decision logs, confidence flags, and appeals workflows create an auditable trail. Calibration routines help align AI scoring with institutional standards.
- Core assumption: Anonymization effectively removes identity cues, and reviewers engage genuinely with the oversight process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "integrating explainability, audit trails, and bias mitigation"
  - [Section 3.2, Table 2] Randomized allocation, appeals dashboard, and audit trail functionalities
  - [corpus] Holistic Explainable AI paper emphasizes transparency beyond developers; direct evidence for bias reduction in grading is limited
- Break condition: If anonymization is incomplete (e.g., handwriting style reveals identity), or if appeals are not meaningfully reviewed, bias mitigation remains procedural rather than effective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how RAG1/RAG2, cache layers, and fallback mechanisms work is essential for debugging retrieval quality and latency.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a two-tier RAG with cache layers might outperform single-tier retrieval in both accuracy and latency?

- Concept: **Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition (TrOCR)**
  - Why needed here: The system relies on accurate transcription; understanding TrOCR's architecture helps diagnose handwriting recognition failures.
  - Quick check question: What types of handwriting variability might cause TrOCR performance to degrade, and how could multimodal signals help?

- Concept: **Inter-rater Reliability Metrics (Pearson, Spearman, Cohen's Kappa)**
  - Why needed here: Validation relies on these metrics to claim alignment with human grading.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper report both correlation (Pearson/Spearman) and agreement (Cohen's Kappa), and what different aspect does each capture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Student Portal: Biometric auth, stylus canvas, TrOCR transcription, encrypted storage
  - Teacher Portal: Randomized allocation, result management, appeals dashboard
  - RAG1: Faculty knowledge base (question-level chunks)
  - RAG2: Supporting materials (topic-level chunks)
  - Cache layers: HOT (frequently-accessed facts), COLD (broader context)
  - Embedding: gemini-embedding-001
  - LLM: Gemini 2.5 Pro for scoring and rationale generation

- Critical path:
  1. Student authentication → stylus input → TrOCR transcription
  2. Embedding → RAG1 similarity check (threshold ~20%)
  3. If below threshold → cache lookup (HOT → COLD) → RAG2 fallback
  4. LLM evaluation with retrieved context → score + rationale + audit log
  5. Teacher review via dashboard with confidence flags and appeals

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Latency vs. retrieval depth: HOT cache reduces latency but may miss rare facts; COLD/RAG2 increases accuracy at latency cost
  - Transparency vs. complexity: Two-tier RAG improves explainability but adds integration and debugging overhead
  - Handwriting preservation vs. processing cost: Storing both strokes and images supports future multimodal work but increases storage

- Failure signatures:
  - Low RAG1 similarity scores across many responses → possible misalignment between faculty answers and questions
  - High HOT cache misses → COLD cache may be undersized or embedding quality poor
  - Systematic score divergence from faculty → calibration drift or LLM prompt issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate TrOCR transcription accuracy on a sample of real student handwriting (measure WER/CER against manual transcription).
  2. Ablate RAG components (LLM-only vs. LLM+RAG1 vs. LLM+RAG1+RAG2) on a held-out QA subset to replicate Figure 8 results.
  3. Test cache sizing: vary HOT/COLD capacities and measure latency vs. retrieval quality tradeoffs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does incorporating multimodal handwriting features (stroke dynamics and temporal cues) significantly improve recognition robustness over the current image-only TrOCR approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that "incorporating multimodal handwriting features... may further improve recognition robustness across diverse scripts."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies solely on the TrOCR model for transcription, which processes images but does not yet utilize the temporal pen-stroke data captured by the tablets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring transcription error rates between the baseline TrOCR model and a multimodal model using the same dataset of diverse handwriting styles.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does TrueGradeAI maintain high correlation (Pearson > 0.98) and fairness metrics when deployed in cross-institutional field trials with varying grading standards?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "conducting field trials across multiple institutions will be essential for validating fairness, scalability, and long-term adoption."
- Why unresolved: Validation was limited to 10,000 NCERT QA pairs graded by two teachers within a specific curriculum context, leaving broader generalizability unconfirmed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Reporting agreement metrics (Pearson, Kappa) from diverse institutions to verify that the RAG pipeline generalizes beyond the initial NCERT dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the current pipeline accurately assess STEM responses containing complex mathematical notation or diagrams, which are absent from the text-heavy validation set?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The dataset is restricted to History, Political Science, and Geography. While the system captures "natural handwriting," the paper does not validate performance on non-textual visual elements (formulas/diagrams) essential for science exams.
- Why unresolved: The current transformer-based OCR and text-centric RAG pipeline may fail to parse or reason over non-linear visual information common in STEM fields.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the system's scoring accuracy on a dataset of STEM answers containing diagrams and equations against human expert grades.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on simulated handwritten responses rather than real student handwriting, limiting generalizability to actual exam conditions
- Cohen's Kappa of 0.688 indicates only moderate agreement with human grading, suggesting potential systematic biases
- Key implementation details like exact prompt engineering, similarity threshold logic, and cache promotion policies are not fully specified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The general architecture (TrOCR + two-tier RAG + LLM scoring) is clearly described and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The retrieval-augmented scoring outperforms LLM-only baselines, but exact replication requires undisclosed prompt and similarity threshold details
- **Medium confidence**: The handwriting transcription and preservation mechanism is feasible, but real-world handwriting variability could degrade performance
- **Low confidence**: The bias-resistance mechanism's effectiveness is inferred from procedural design rather than empirical bias measurement

## Next Checks
1. **Validate OCR accuracy**: Measure Character Error Rate (CER) on a held-out sample of real student handwriting transcriptions versus ground truth to quantify transcription reliability
2. **Replicate RAG ablation results**: Run controlled experiments comparing LLM-only, LLM+RAG1, and LLM+RAG1+RAG2 scoring on the same QA subset to confirm Figure 8's reported performance gains
3. **Test bias-reduction effectiveness**: Conduct a blind grading study where scripts with known but anonymized identity cues are evaluated, measuring inter-rater reliability and potential bias persistence
