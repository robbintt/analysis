# Enhancing Model Privacy in Federated Learning with Random Masking and Quantization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.18911
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18911
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: FedQSN achieves comparable performance to baseline methods while significantly improving model privacy protection through random masking and quantization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FedQSN, a federated learning approach that enhances model privacy protection through a novel combination of random masking and quantization techniques. The method addresses a critical gap in federated learning where model privacy protection has been largely overlooked, despite increasing concerns about intellectual property leakage. FedQSN creates a privacy-preserving proxy model that clients use for local training, preventing full model reconstruction while maintaining strong performance. The approach demonstrates that it's possible to achieve comparable accuracy to standard federated learning methods while substantially improving privacy guarantees.

## Method Summary
FedQSN employs a two-stage masking process combined with quantization to create a privacy-preserving proxy model. The server first applies a random mask to hide a subset of model parameters, then the client applies a client-specific random mask before quantization. The quantized masked model is transmitted to the client, where local training occurs using the proxy model. After training, clients send only their local gradients back to the server. This process ensures that clients never access the complete global model, preventing potential intellectual property leakage while still enabling effective collaborative learning. The method maintains model performance through careful parameter masking and quantization strategies that preserve essential model characteristics while obscuring sensitive information.

## Key Results
- FedQSN achieves comparable performance to baseline federated learning methods across multiple datasets and model architectures
- The method demonstrates significantly lower parameter similarity between global and proxy models, indicating effective privacy preservation
- Performance gap between global and proxy models validates the effectiveness of the privacy protection mechanism
- FedQSN shows notably better privacy protection compared to baseline approaches while maintaining model accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FedQSN works by creating a controlled information bottleneck between the server and clients. The random masking at both server and client levels ensures that no single party has access to complete model information, while quantization adds an additional layer of obfuscation. The proxy model serves as a functional approximation that enables effective local training without exposing the full model parameters. This dual-layer protection, combined with the gradient-only communication from clients, creates a robust privacy-preserving framework that prevents model reconstruction attacks while maintaining the collaborative learning benefits of federated learning.

## Foundational Learning

**Federated Learning**: A distributed machine learning approach where multiple clients train models collaboratively without sharing raw data. Why needed: Forms the foundation for understanding the privacy challenges in distributed model training. Quick check: Verify understanding of how federated learning differs from centralized training and its privacy benefits.

**Model Parameter Privacy**: Protection of model weights and architecture details from unauthorized access or reconstruction. Why needed: Central to understanding the motivation behind FedQSN and the privacy threats it addresses. Quick check: Assess knowledge of different attack vectors that can compromise model privacy in federated settings.

**Random Masking**: A technique where random subsets of model parameters are hidden or set to zero during transmission. Why needed: Key mechanism that FedQSN employs to prevent complete model reconstruction. Quick check: Understand how random masking affects model functionality and training dynamics.

**Quantization**: The process of reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from floating-point to lower-bit representations. Why needed: Works synergistically with masking to enhance privacy through information reduction. Quick check: Evaluate understanding of quantization's impact on both privacy and model performance.

**Gradient-based Attacks**: Methods that attempt to reconstruct training data or model information from gradient information. Why needed: Represents the primary threat model that FedQSN aims to mitigate. Quick check: Familiarize with common gradient reconstruction and inference attack techniques.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Server -> Random Mask -> Client-specific Random Mask -> Quantization -> Client Proxy Model -> Local Training -> Gradient Return -> Server

**Critical Path**: The essential flow involves server masking → client masking and quantization → local training → gradient return. This path represents the complete privacy-preserving training cycle.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method balances privacy protection against model performance, with the masking and quantization parameters serving as key tuning knobs. More aggressive masking provides better privacy but may impact performance, while lighter masking preserves performance but offers weaker privacy guarantees.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds, increased parameter similarity between global and proxy models, or successful model reconstruction attacks would indicate implementation failures or insufficient privacy protection.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate FedQSN against standard federated averaging on identical datasets and model architectures
2. Privacy analysis: Measure parameter similarity and attempt gradient-based reconstruction attacks
3. Ablation study: Test the individual contributions of random masking versus quantization to performance and privacy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Evaluation focuses primarily on parameter similarity metrics without comprehensive analysis of other attack vectors
- Experiments conducted on relatively small-scale federated scenarios that may not represent real-world conditions
- Limited scalability analysis and performance evaluation in highly heterogeneous client populations

## Confidence

**Privacy Claims**: Medium - Limited empirical validation beyond proposed similarity metrics
**Performance Claims**: High - Consistently achieves comparable results to baselines across multiple datasets
**Scalability Claims**: Low - Insufficient evidence from small-scale experimental scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comprehensive privacy attacks including gradient reconstruction and membership inference to quantify actual privacy leakage beyond parameter similarity metrics.

2. Evaluate FedQSN's performance and privacy trade-offs in large-scale federated scenarios with heterogeneous client populations and realistic communication constraints.

3. Perform ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of random masking and quantization to overall privacy and performance, helping identify optimal parameter configurations for different use cases.
