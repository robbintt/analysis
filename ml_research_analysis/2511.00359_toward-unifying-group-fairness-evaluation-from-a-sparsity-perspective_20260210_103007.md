# Toward Unifying Group Fairness Evaluation from a Sparsity Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.00359
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00359
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes a unified framework for evaluating group fairness using sparsity measures, particularly the PQ Index, showing reduced sparsity corresponds to higher fairness

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a unified framework for evaluating group fairness using sparsity measures, specifically the PQ Index. The authors theoretically connect sparsity indices to fairness metrics, demonstrating that reduced sparsity corresponds to higher fairness across both classification and regression tasks. They show that the PQ Index satisfies desirable properties for fairness measurement and establish theoretical relationships between sparsity measures and Maximum Pairwise Difference (MPD)-based fairness metrics. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that sparsity-based metrics align well with traditional MPD-based fairness measures while offering broader applicability and improved stability, particularly in intersectional fairness settings with many sensitive groups.

## Method Summary
The method reformulates group fairness metrics (Statistical Parity and Equalized Odds) using sparsity measures, specifically the PQ Index I_{1,2}(w) = 1 - d^{-1/2} × ‖w‖_1 / ‖w‖_2, where w is a vector of per-group metrics. For classification, this captures differences in selection rates or TPR/FPR across groups; for regression, it uses CDF-based approaches. The framework requires computing per-group metrics, applying exponential transformation when necessary to handle numerical instability from zeros or negatives, then calculating the PQ Index. The method supports both binary and multi-class settings, with aggregation strategies (max vs. mean) depending on the application. The approach aims to provide more stable evaluations under severe class imbalance and better capture subtle group disparities compared to MPD-based methods.

## Key Results
- Sparsity-based metrics (S-SP, S-EO) align well with traditional MPD-based fairness measures while offering broader applicability across classification and regression tasks
- The framework proves particularly robust in intersectional fairness settings with many sensitive groups, providing more stable evaluations than MPD-based approaches when class distributions are severely imbalanced
- Sparsity-based metric captures subtle group disparities overlooked by MPD, maintaining consistent trade-off patterns across different performance metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reduced sparsity corresponds to higher fairness.
- Mechanism: The PQ Index measures inequality in a vector's distribution. When applied to group-wise outputs (e.g., selection rates across sensitive groups), lower sparsity indicates more uniform outcomes across groups, which aligns with fairness goals like statistical parity.
- Core assumption: Fairness can be operationalized as equality of outcomes across groups (distributional justice / Rawls' principle), and inequality measures from economics transfer validly to ML fairness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "showing that reduced sparsity corresponds to higher fairness"
  - [section 3] "higher sparsity indicates lower fairness"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related work (Fairmetrics, trade-off reviews) discusses group fairness evaluation but not sparsity specifically.
- Break condition: If groups have legitimately different base rates and equal outcomes are not the fairness goal, sparsity-based metrics may give misleading signals.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PQ Index captures subtler disparities than Maximum Pairwise Difference (MPD).
- Mechanism: MPD only considers the largest and smallest components, ignoring intermediate groups. PQ Index incorporates all components via ℓₚ/ℓ_q norm ratios, making it sensitive to the full distribution.
- Core assumption: Capturing intermediate group disparities is normatively desirable and improves fairness evaluation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3, Theorem 3.6] "for two unit vectors with the same largest and smallest components, their relative sparsity, as measured by PQ Index, is determined by the values of their remaining components"
  - [section 5.3] "sparsity-based metric captures subtle group disparities overlooked by MPD"
  - [corpus] Not directly addressed in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: When only worst-case disparity matters (e.g., legal compliance focused on most disadvantaged group), MPD may be more appropriate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sparsity-based metrics provide more stable evaluation under severe class imbalance and many groups.
- Mechanism: With many intersectional groups, edge cases (e.g., empty classes) cause MPD to produce extreme values. Sparsity integrates over all groups, reducing variance from individual outliers.
- Core assumption: Stability under imbalance is desirable; the metric should not be dominated by rare group-class combinations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3] "S-SP provides a more stable evaluation by incorporating group distribution through sparsity"
  - [section 5.3] "SP can produce extreme values (e.g., the result of LinearPost 0.001 at a group size of 50), whereas S-SP provides a more stable evaluation"
  - [corpus] Intersectional fairness challenges noted in related work but not sparsity solutions specifically.
- Break condition: If small groups are legally or ethically critical and should dominate evaluation, stability may mask important harms.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: ℓₚ norms and norm ratios
  - Why needed here: PQ Index = 1 - d^(1/q - 1/p) × ‖w‖_p / ‖w‖_q. Understanding how p and q control sensitivity to large vs. small components is essential for tuning the metric.
  - Quick check question: If p=1 and q=2, does the index become more or less sensitive to a single large outlier compared to p=0.5, q=1?

- Concept: Gini Index as an inequality measure
  - Why needed here: The paper connects PQ Index to Gini (both satisfy 6 ideal sparsity properties). Gini provides intuition: it's piecewise linear and well-studied in economics.
  - Quick check question: Why does Gini satisfy "Robin Hood" property (redistribution reduces inequality) but MPD does not?

- Concept: Statistical Parity vs. Equalized Odds
  - Why needed here: The framework reformulates both using sparsity. SP ignores labels; EO conditions on Y. Understanding when to use each determines which S-* metric to apply.
  - Quick check question: A perfect classifier on data where Y depends on A—will it satisfy SP? Will it satisfy EO?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Per-group metric vector w = [m₁, ..., m_|A|] where mᵢ = E(f(X_{aᵢ}) = y) for SP or g(f(X_{aᵢ}), Y_{aᵢ}) for EO
  - Sparsity module: PQ Index I_{1,2}(w) = 1 - d^(-1/2) × ‖w‖₁ / ‖w‖₂
  - Aggregation: max over classes (classification) or sup over y (regression CDF-based SP)
  - Positivity transform: exp(w) or shift to avoid zeros/negatives

- Critical path:
  1. Compute per-group metric (accuracy, TPR, FPR, MSE, etc.)
  2. Handle numerical issues (zeros, negatives) via exponential transform
  3. Compute ‖w‖₁ and ‖w‖₂
  4. Return I_{1,2}(w); lower = more fair

- Design tradeoffs:
  - PQ Index vs. Gini: PQ is smooth (differentiable); Gini is piecewise linear. PQ may be easier to optimize directly.
  - p, q selection: Paper uses p=1, q=2. Closer p, q → smaller scale values, lower variance across splits (Figure 8).
  - max vs. mean for multi-class: Paper shows similar patterns (Figures 11-12), but max emphasizes worst class.

- Failure signatures:
  - Numerical instability when w contains zeros or very small values (RMSE, confusion matrix entries)
  - Extreme values with many intersectional groups when some groups have no samples for a class
  - Negative metric values (e.g., MSE for some groups) require transformation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce S-SP on UCI Adult with binary groups: compare trade-off curves to MPD-based SP across 3-5 bias mitigation methods.
  2. Test intersectional setting: construct 10-50 groups via gender × race × age bins; compare S-SP vs. SP stability as group count increases.
  3. Ablate positivity transform: run S-EO on LawSchool regression with and without exp(w); verify curve recovery for LinearPost and Rejection methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the proposed sparsity framework be adapted to create effective bias *mitigation* algorithms, rather than serving solely as an evaluation metric?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "Future research directions include developing fair algorithms that utilize PQI or other sparsity measures for bias mitigation."
- Why unresolved: The current work focuses exclusively on defining the metric and validating it against existing bias mitigation methods, without proposing a method to optimize the model using this metric directly.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of a training algorithm that minimizes the PQ Index as a loss component, demonstrating improved fairness-accuracy trade-offs compared to standard MPD-based constraints.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What theoretical or algorithmic alternatives exist to address the numerical instability of sparsity-based metrics without relying on heuristic transformations like exponentiation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The limitations section notes that "alternatives beyond heuristic approaches require further investigation" regarding the instability caused by negative, zero, or extremely small values in the input vector.
- Why unresolved: The PQ Index is sensitive to small values in the denominator of its norm ratio. The authors use an exponential transform as a patch, but this lacks formal justification as a general solution.
- What evidence would resolve it: A stability analysis identifying conditions under which the metric fails, or the proposal of a modified sparsity measure that is inherently robust to boundary values.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of sparsity-based fairness metrics degrade or hold when sensitive attributes are unavailable and must be estimated via proxy features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The ethics statement encourages "future work to explore fairness-aware learning under limited or uncertain demographic information," noting that real-world systems often lack access to these attributes.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical and experimental results assume perfect knowledge of the sensitive groups $A$, leaving the framework's robustness to noisy or proxy group estimations untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the correlation between S-SP/S-EO scores calculated using ground-truth attributes versus those calculated using inferred proxies on standard benchmarks.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes distributional equality is the appropriate fairness goal without addressing scenarios where group differences are legitimate (e.g., different base rates due to historical factors)
- The exponential transform heuristic for handling numerical instability is not precisely specified, potentially affecting reproducibility across different datasets and implementations
- While the framework claims broader applicability, experimental validation focuses heavily on statistical parity rather than exploring diverse fairness definitions or their combinations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Theoretical properties of PQ Index (Theorems 3.3-3.6) and basic experimental patterns showing sparsity metrics align with MPD-based measures
- **Medium Confidence:** Claims about superiority in intersectional fairness settings, given limited ablation studies on alternative aggregation methods
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability to domains outside tabular data or to fairness notions beyond group-level distributional equality

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce numerical stability claims** by running S-EO on LawSchool regression with and without exponential transform across different sparsity index parameterizations (p=1,q=2 vs p=2,q=3)
2. **Test sensitivity to legitimate group differences** by constructing synthetic datasets where group disparities reflect real-world base rate differences, then evaluate whether sparsity-based metrics produce misleading fairness signals
3. **Validate aggregation method sensitivity** by comparing max vs. mean aggregation in multi-class settings across 3-5 datasets, measuring variance in fairness scores and correlation with MPD under severe class imbalance
