# SeaExam and SeaBench: Benchmarking LLMs with Local Multilingual Questions in Southeast Asia

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.06298
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06298
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SeaExam and SeaBench effectively differentiate LLM performance on SEA language tasks compared to translated benchmarks, revealing higher performance variation and safety concerns.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces SeaExam and SeaBench, two novel benchmarks designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on Southeast Asian (SEA) language tasks using real-world scenarios from SEA regions. SeaExam is based on regional educational exams, covering subjects like local history and literature, while SeaBench focuses on multi-turn, open-ended tasks reflecting daily interactions in SEA communities. Experimental results demonstrate that these benchmarks more effectively discern LLM performance on SEA language tasks compared to translated benchmarks like MMLU and MT-bench. The findings highlight the need for improved safety measures in multilingual applications and underscore the importance of region-specific evaluation frameworks for LLMs.

## Method Summary
The authors developed SeaExam and SeaBench as complementary benchmarks to assess LLM performance on SEA language tasks. SeaExam was constructed using regional educational exam questions from SEA countries, focusing on subjects relevant to local curricula such as history, literature, and social studies. SeaBench was designed to evaluate multi-turn, open-ended interactions that reflect real-world scenarios in SEA communities, including customer service, healthcare consultations, and educational support. The benchmarks were tested across multiple LLMs using standardized evaluation metrics, with performance comparisons made against established benchmarks like MMLU and MT-bench to assess their effectiveness in differentiating model capabilities.

## Key Results
- SeaExam and SeaBench demonstrate higher standard deviations in model performance compared to translated benchmarks, indicating better differentiation of LLM capabilities.
- Open-ended questions in SeaBench prove more effective in distinguishing model capabilities than multiple-choice questions, with notable performance variations across different SEA languages within the same model.
- LLMs generally perform poorly on safety-related questions in both benchmarks, highlighting the need for enhanced safety measures in multilingual applications.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of SeaExam and SeaBench stems from their focus on authentic SEA language tasks and cultural contexts. Unlike translated benchmarks, these tools evaluate models on content that reflects the actual linguistic diversity and cultural nuances of Southeast Asian communities. The multi-turn nature of SeaBench tasks particularly challenges models to maintain context and demonstrate deeper understanding of regional communication patterns. The inclusion of safety-related questions across both benchmarks reveals systematic weaknesses in current LLMs' ability to handle culturally-specific scenarios appropriately.

## Foundational Learning
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly discuss the foundational learning principles behind the benchmark design. Based on the methodology, it appears the benchmarks leverage domain adaptation principles by grounding evaluations in region-specific content rather than relying on translated materials. The multi-turn task design in SeaBench suggests an emphasis on sequential learning and context retention capabilities.

## Architecture Onboarding
Unknown: The paper does not provide specific details about architectural onboarding considerations for implementing these benchmarks. However, the evaluation approach implies that models need robust multilingual processing capabilities and cultural awareness mechanisms to perform well across both benchmarks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can benchmark design better capture the full spectrum of linguistic diversity across Southeast Asian countries?
- What are the most effective methods for improving LLM safety measures in multilingual contexts?
- How do cultural nuances impact the interpretation and evaluation of model responses in region-specific benchmarks?

## Limitations
- The sample size and diversity of questions within SeaExam and SeaBench may not fully represent the linguistic complexity and regional variations across all Southeast Asian countries.
- The evaluation methodology relies on standardized testing formats that may not adequately reflect real-world language use and cultural nuances.
- The performance metrics used may not fully capture the nuances of multilingual capabilities and could be influenced by factors such as translation quality and cultural context.
- The benchmarks may not adequately account for code-switching and mixed-language scenarios common in Southeast Asian communication.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The overall effectiveness of SeaExam and SeaBench in differentiating LLM performance compared to translated benchmarks
- Medium confidence: The findings regarding safety-related question performance and the need for enhanced safety measures
- Medium confidence: The observations about performance variations across different SEA languages within the same model
- Low confidence: The generalizability of results to all Southeast Asian linguistic contexts due to potential sampling limitations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis of SeaExam and SeaBench questions to assess their cultural appropriateness and linguistic accuracy across all target SEA languages
2. Expand the benchmark datasets to include a more diverse range of regional dialects and minority languages within Southeast Asia
3. Implement a longitudinal study tracking LLM performance on SeaExam and SeaBench over time to evaluate improvements in multilingual capabilities and safety measures
4. Develop additional evaluation metrics that better capture cultural context and real-world communication patterns in SEA communities
5. Investigate the impact of code-switching and mixed-language scenarios on benchmark performance
