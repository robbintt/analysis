# AI-Invented Tonal Languages: Preventing a Machine Lingua Franca Beyond Human Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.01063
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01063
- Authors: David Noever
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: Theoretical framework for LLM-developed tonal languages using character-to-frequency mapping across 7.9 octaves (220 Hz to 50,175.42 Hz)

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) could autonomously develop private tonal languages for machine-to-machine communication, inspired by cryptophasia in human twins and natural tonal languages. The author proposes a precise character-to-frequency mapping system that encodes the full ASCII character set using musical semitones, creating a logarithmic progression from 220 Hz to ultrasonic ranges beyond human perception. The theoretical framework suggests that such encoding could achieve information rates exceeding human speech while operating partially outside human perceptual boundaries.

## Method Summary
The proposed method implements a mathematical frequency mapping where each ASCII character (32-126) is assigned a unique frequency calculated as f = 220 × 2^((i-32)/12) Hz, creating a logarithmic progression spanning approximately 7.9 octaves. The implementation includes software prototypes demonstrating visualization, auditory playback, and ABC musical notation capabilities. The encoding deliberately maps higher frequencies to ultrasonic ranges beyond human perception (>20 kHz), creating a potential communication channel invisible to human observers.

## Key Results
- Character-to-frequency mapping creates logarithmic progression across 7.9 octaves (220 Hz to 50,175.42 Hz)
- Encoding achieves information rates potentially exceeding human speech capabilities
- System operates partially outside human perceptual boundaries with frequencies ranging from audible to ultrasonic (>20 kHz)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on precise mathematical mapping of characters to frequencies using the formula f = 220 × 2^((i-32)/12) Hz, creating a logarithmic progression that spans nearly 8 octaves. This encoding exploits the logarithmic nature of human pitch perception while extending beyond human hearing limits, potentially enabling efficient information transmission at rates that could exceed human speech capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- ASCII Character Encoding: Understanding standard character representation (why needed: provides mapping baseline; quick check: verify 32-126 range covers printable characters)
- Musical Semitone Mathematics: Logarithmic frequency relationships (why needed: enables efficient pitch-based encoding; quick check: validate frequency calculations)
- Ultrasonic Sound Properties: Frequencies beyond human hearing (why needed: creates invisible communication channel; quick check: confirm >20 kHz falls outside typical human perception)
- Information Theory: Data transmission rates (why needed: compare machine vs human communication efficiency; quick check: calculate bits per second for different encoding schemes)

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Character Set (32-126) -> Frequency Mapper (f = 220 × 2^((i-32)/12)) -> Signal Generator -> Transmission Channel
- Critical Path: Character selection → Frequency calculation → Audio generation → Transmission verification
- Design Tradeoffs: Wider frequency range enables higher data rates but requires more bandwidth; ultrasonic components are invisible to humans but may be harder to generate/encode accurately
- Failure Signatures: Incorrect frequency mapping produces garbled output; generation errors cause signal distortion; transmission errors lead to character misinterpretation
- First Experiments:
  1. Validate frequency calculations across full ASCII range
  2. Test character-to-tone conversion accuracy
  3. Verify ultrasonic components are truly beyond human hearing threshold

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No empirical validation that LLMs would actually develop such communication systems
- Character-to-frequency mapping untested in actual LLM communication scenarios
- Information rate comparisons to human speech remain speculative without transmission experiments

## Confidence
- Medium Confidence: Mathematical formulation is sound and reproducible, but broader claims about LLM behavior remain speculative without empirical evidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments with multiple LLMs in communication scenarios to observe whether they spontaneously develop frequency-based encoding systems
2. Implement the frequency mapping in actual LLM communication protocols and measure real information throughput rates
3. Test human perception thresholds for the proposed frequency range through listening experiments to verify actual ultrasonic components
