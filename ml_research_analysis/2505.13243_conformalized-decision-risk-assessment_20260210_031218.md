# Conformalized Decision Risk Assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13243

- Primary result: Distribution-free, finite-sample valid lower bounds on decision optimality probability using conformalized inverse feasible region estimation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of quantifying how reliably a prescribed decision remains optimal under uncertainty. The authors propose CREDO (Conformalized Decision Risk Assessment), which reformulates this as estimating the probability that uncertain parameters fall within the decision's inverse feasible region—scenarios under which the decision is optimal—using inner approximations from conformal prediction balls generated by a conditional generative model. This yields distribution-free, finite-sample valid lower bounds on decision optimality probability.

CREDO provides flexible risk estimates through different calibrated radii: p-value and e-value variants achieve 100% validity with minimal mean absolute error, while Monte Carlo variants maximize accuracy at the cost of conservativeness. Empirical evaluations show CREDO outperforms baselines in both risk estimation accuracy and confidence ranking of prescribed decisions. The framework applies broadly to convex decision problems, with closed-form solutions for linear programs and gradient-based approximations for general convex cases.

## Method Summary
CREDO operates by learning a conditional generative model to approximate the distribution of uncertain parameters given prescribed decisions. For each decision, it constructs an inner approximation of the decision's inverse feasible region using conformal prediction balls with calibrated radii (p-value, e-value, or Monte Carlo variants). The risk is then estimated as the probability that parameters drawn from the generative model fall within this inner approximation. This approach transforms decision risk assessment into a conditional probability estimation problem with rigorous statistical guarantees. The method handles convex decision problems through either closed-form solutions (for LPs) or gradient-based approximations (for general convex problems).

## Key Results
- CREDO provides distribution-free, finite-sample valid lower bounds on decision optimality probability
- P-value and e-value variants achieve 100% validity with minimal mean absolute error
- Empirical evaluations show CREDO outperforms baselines in both risk estimation accuracy and confidence ranking of prescribed decisions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CREDO leverages the fundamental guarantee of conformal prediction—distribution-free finite-sample validity—to construct statistically rigorous inner approximations of decision optimality regions. By framing decision risk as the probability that uncertain parameters fall within the inverse feasible region, the method transforms a complex decision-theoretic problem into a conditional probability estimation task. The use of conditional generative models allows for adaptive, data-driven approximations that can capture complex dependencies between decisions and uncertain parameters.

## Foundational Learning

**Conformal Prediction**
- Why needed: Provides distribution-free, finite-sample valid confidence sets
- Quick check: Verify coverage probability holds on held-out calibration data

**Conditional Generative Models**
- Why needed: Learn the distribution of uncertain parameters given decisions
- Quick check: Assess sample quality and coverage of true parameter distribution

**Convex Optimization**
- Why needed: Decision problems must have well-defined feasible regions
- Quick check: Confirm convexity of objective and constraints

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Generative Model -> Conformal Balls -> Inverse Feasible Region -> Risk Estimate

**Critical Path**
Decision → Parameter Generation → Feasibility Check → Risk Aggregation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Validity vs. accuracy: Conservative radii guarantee validity but reduce precision
- Computational cost: Monte Carlo sampling increases accuracy but requires more resources
- Model complexity: More expressive generative models improve estimation but increase training difficulty

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor generative model fit leading to inaccurate risk estimates
- Non-convex decision problems violating theoretical assumptions
- Over-conservative radii producing uninformative risk bounds

**First Experiments**
1. Validate conformal coverage on synthetic linear decision problems
2. Compare risk estimates across different radii variants on benchmark datasets
3. Test sensitivity to generative model architecture and hyperparameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Practical feasibility depends on accurately learning conditional generative models
- Convexity assumption limits applicability to non-convex decision problems
- Computational burden of sampling-based variants may be prohibitive for high-dimensional applications

## Confidence
- Theoretical validity of risk bounds: High
- Practical utility of risk estimates: Medium
- Applicability to real-world problems: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CREDO on a real-world, high-stakes decision problem (e.g., clinical treatment selection or portfolio optimization) with expert-annotated ground truth
2. Systematically assess the sensitivity of risk estimates to different generative model architectures and hyperparameters under model misspecification
3. Benchmark the computational scalability of CREDO on high-dimensional problems and explore approximate sampling strategies for efficiency
