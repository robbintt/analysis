# SAGE: Spliced-Audio Generated Data for Enhancing Foundational Models in Low-Resource Arabic-English Code-Switched Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.22143
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22143
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieved 7.8% absolute WER improvement on code-switched benchmarks using small model vs larger multilingual models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of recognizing Arabic-English code-switched speech, particularly in low-resource settings where dialectal Arabic data is scarce. The authors propose a modified audio-splicing approach to generate artificial code-switched data by combining segments from monolingual Arabic and English sources. They introduce an experience replay-inspired fine-tuning strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting when training on the synthetic data. Additionally, they integrate an out-of-domain 3-gram language model to further improve performance. Experiments show that their approach, using a relatively small model, achieves a 7.8% absolute improvement in Word Error Rate on code-switched benchmarks and outperforms much larger multilingual models like USM and Whisper-large-v2 by 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively, on Arabic-English code-switched speech.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines audio-splicing and experience replay to enhance foundational models for Arabic-English code-switched speech recognition in low-resource settings. The audio-splicing technique generates artificial code-switched data by combining segments from monolingual Arabic and English sources, addressing the scarcity of dialectal Arabic data. An experience replay-inspired fine-tuning strategy is employed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training on the synthetic data. Additionally, an out-of-domain 3-gram language model is integrated to further improve recognition performance. The approach is evaluated using a relatively small model that achieves significant improvements over larger multilingual models on code-switched benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 7.8% absolute WER improvement on code-switched benchmarks
- Outperformed USM model by 5.5% on Arabic-English code-switched speech
- Outperformed Whisper-large-v2 by 8.4% on Arabic-English code-switched speech

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The audio-splicing approach generates synthetic code-switched data by combining segments from monolingual Arabic and English sources, effectively addressing the data scarcity problem in low-resource settings. The experience replay fine-tuning strategy prevents catastrophic forgetting when training on this synthetic data, maintaining performance on both languages. The integration of an out-of-domain 3-gram language model provides additional contextual information that helps resolve ambiguities in code-switched speech. By using a smaller model with these techniques, the approach achieves better performance than much larger multilingual models that were not specifically optimized for the code-switching task.

## Foundational Learning
- Audio-splicing: Why needed - to generate synthetic code-switched data; Quick check - verify segment boundary quality
- Catastrophic forgetting: Why needed - to maintain bilingual performance during fine-tuning; Quick check - compare baseline vs fine-tuned performance
- Experience replay: Why needed - to mitigate forgetting during training; Quick check - track performance stability across epochs
- Language model integration: Why needed - to provide contextual disambiguation; Quick check - measure impact on WER with/without LM
- Low-resource adaptation: Why needed - to handle dialectal Arabic scarcity; Quick check - compare performance with limited vs augmented data

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Monolingual Arabic audio -> Splicer -> Synthetic code-switched audio -> ASR Model -> Text output

Critical path: Audio input → Splicing module → Feature extraction → Recognition network → Language model integration → Final transcription

Design tradeoffs: Small model with augmentation vs large multilingual model without task-specific optimization

Failure signatures: Poor splicing quality at segment boundaries, catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, language model conflicts with ASR output

First experiments:
1. Validate splicing quality by listening to generated samples
2. Test baseline ASR performance on monolingual data before fine-tuning
3. Measure catastrophic forgetting by tracking performance degradation on source languages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Does not adequately address potential audio artifacts at segment boundaries
- Limited validation to single dataset (ACSA) without cross-validation on other code-switched speech corpora
- Lacks ablation studies showing relative contributions of individual components

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The methodology for audio-splicing and the general experimental framework are clearly described and reproducible
- Medium Confidence: The reported WER improvements on the ACSA benchmark are credible given the clear baseline comparisons
- Low Confidence: Claims about superiority over Whisper-large-v2 and USM without full details on their configurations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of audio-splicing, experience replay, and LM integration to the overall performance improvement
2. Test the approach on additional code-switched Arabic-English datasets beyond ACSA to verify generalizability of the results
3. Compare against fine-tuned versions of larger models (Whisper-large-v2, USM) specifically adapted for dialectal Arabic-English code-switching rather than their base multilingual configurations
