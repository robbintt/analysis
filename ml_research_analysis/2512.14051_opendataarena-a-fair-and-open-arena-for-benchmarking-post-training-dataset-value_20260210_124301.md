# OpenDataArena: A Fair and Open Arena for Benchmarking Post-Training Dataset Value

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.14051
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14051
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces OpenDataArena (ODA), a platform for systematically benchmarking the intrinsic value of post-training datasets in large language models (LLMs).

## Executive Summary
OpenDataArena addresses the critical gap of opaque data evaluation by providing a unified training-evaluation pipeline, multi-dimensional data scoring, interactive data lineage exploration, and an open-source toolkit. Extensive experiments covering over 120 datasets, 22 benchmarks, 600+ training runs, and 40 million processed data points reveal non-trivial insights about dataset value. The results demonstrate that data curation should prioritize response quality and domain-specific criteria, with domain divergence notably in code data requiring specialized evaluation.

## Method Summary
The method standardizes fine-tuning of base models (Llama3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B) on individual datasets using LLaMA-Factory with fixed hyperparameters (3 epochs, specific learning rates, batch size 4, DeepSpeed ZeRO-3, LoRA). Each dataset undergoes evaluation across 22 benchmarks via OpenCompass + vLLM, with answer verification using xVerify/Omni-Judge. Multi-dimensional scoring captures data quality metrics, while automated lineage tracing maps data provenance relationships through documentation parsing.

## Key Results
- Response quality (especially length) predicts downstream performance more reliably than instruction complexity
- Code data shows distinct correlation patterns, requiring specialized evaluation frameworks
- Benchmark contamination through data lineage threatens leaderboard integrity and propagates recursively
- General domain shows negative correlation between Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 rankings, indicating dataset saturation as models improve

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Controlled-Variable Attribution Through Standardized Pipelines
Standardizing all training parameters except the dataset isolates causal relationships between data characteristics and downstream performance. By fixing base model, hyperparameters, optimizer, LoRA configurations, and evaluation protocols, observed performance variance can be attributed to dataset quality rather than confounds.

### Mechanism 2: Response Quality Drives Learning Signal Density
Longer responses with explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning provide denser supervisory signals, enabling models to internalize problem-solving procedures rather than memorizing answer patterns. Response length correlates with downstream performance (0.81 in Math domain).

### Mechanism 3: Lineage Tracing Exposes Composition Redundancy and Contamination
Automated provenance tracing parses documentation to construct directed lineage graphs, revealing which datasets inherit from shared ancestors or incorporate evaluation benchmarks. This exposes hidden dependencies and contamination that inflate scores through memorization.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) vs. Alignment Stages**
  - Why needed here: ODA benchmarks post-training data for SFT specifically; understanding that this stage "sculpts base model behavior" is prerequisite to interpreting why response quality matters more than instruction complexity.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why SFT data quality affects final model behavior differently than pre-training data quality?

- **Concept: Spearman Rank Correlation for Non-Linear Relationships**
  - Why needed here: Correlation analysis uses Spearman correlation to connect quality metrics to performance; understanding rank-based correlation is necessary to interpret why response length (0.81 in Math) is considered "strong" while instruction complexity shows weak/flat relationships.
  - Quick check question: Why might Spearman be preferred over Pearson when correlating data quality scores with downstream benchmark performance?

- **Concept: Benchmark Contamination and Evaluation Integrity**
  - Why needed here: Lineage analysis reveals training data incorporating test benchmarks; understanding how contamination inflates scores through memorization vs. generalization is critical for interpreting leaderboard results.
  - Quick check question: If a dataset includes GSM8K examples, why would fine-tuning on it invalidate GSM8K evaluation results?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Input Layer → [Format Normalization, Domain Classification] → Data Evaluation Layer → [SFT Training (LLaMA-Factory), Benchmark Eval (OpenCompass), Multi-dimensional Scoring] → Data Analysis Layer → [Performance Aggregation, Correlation Analysis, Lineage Graph Construction] → Data Visualization Layer → [Leaderboard, Lineage Explorer, Comparison Charts]

- **Critical path:** Raw dataset → standardized training run (3 epochs, fixed hyperparams) → 22-benchmark evaluation → score aggregation → leaderboard ranking. The 600+ training runs and 10,000+ evaluation runs represent the bottleneck.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Comprehensiveness vs. Computational Cost: 22 benchmarks across 4 domains provides holistic assessment but requires massive compute
  - Standardization vs. Data-Specific Optimization: Fixed hyperparameters ensure fairness but may disadvantage datasets requiring different learning rates
  - Automation vs. Accuracy in Lineage: Automated parsing scales but misses undocumented sources

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Leaderboard gaming: Datasets incorporating benchmarks show inflated scores without real capability gains
  - Domain mismatch: Code data evaluated with general-domain heuristics produces misleading quality signals
  - Model-specific saturation: General domain shows negative correlation between Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 rankings

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce a single benchmark result: Take one dataset, run the standardized SFT pipeline, verify scores match leaderboard
  2. Validate a correlation claim: Sample 10 datasets with varying response lengths, plot Global Score vs. Avg Response Length, confirm positive trend
  3. Trace lineage for one dataset: Use the toolkit to trace a dataset's upstream sources, verify graph connectivity matches reported depth statistics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can training-free or training-light data valuation techniques (such as influence functions or core-set selection) accurately approximate data utility without the computational expense of full-scale fine-tuning?

### Open Question 2
How can a specialized evaluation framework be designed to accurately assess Code data quality, given that it exhibits distinct correlation patterns (e.g., negative correlation with response length) compared to Math and General domains?

### Open Question 3
How can the benchmarking pipeline be extended to systematically evaluate alignment data, specifically RLHF and DPO-style preference datasets, alongside standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data?

### Open Question 4
How can the recursive propagation of benchmark contamination through data lineage be automatically detected and neutralized to ensure the integrity of leaderboard evaluations?

## Limitations
- Standardized training conditions may not fully isolate dataset effects due to potential saturation effects and model-specific sensitivities
- Lineage analysis depends heavily on documentation quality, missing undocumented data sources
- Correlation analysis lacks direct validation against independent data quality measures

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Standardized training pipeline ensures fair dataset comparisons
- **Medium Confidence:** Response quality drives learning signal density
- **Medium Confidence:** Lineage tracing reveals redundancy and contamination
- **Low Confidence:** Domain-specific thresholds for data characteristics

## Next Checks

1. Test whether datasets showing negative correlation between Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 rankings maintain this pattern when evaluated on Llama3.1-8B to confirm saturation effects are model-independent.

2. Have human annotators evaluate a stratified sample of 20 datasets for response quality, instruction complexity, and reasoning depth to validate the automated scoring system's alignment with human judgment.

3. Train on datasets with known benchmark contamination, measure performance inflation on the contaminated benchmarks versus clean datasets, and assess whether this inflates general mathematical reasoning capabilities.
