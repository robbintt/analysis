# Embedding-Space Data Augmentation to Prevent Membership Inference Attacks in Clinical Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05289
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05289
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: ZOO-PCA embedding-space augmentation reduces MIA vulnerability (TPR/FPR ratio from 3.55 to 1.43 on MIMIC-III) while preserving test accuracy, outperforming ZOO and MixUp for privacy protection

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses membership inference attacks (MIA) on clinical time series forecasting (TSF) models trained on Electronic Health Records (EHR). The authors propose embedding-space data augmentation techniques—Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a PCA-constrained variant (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp—to strengthen model resilience against MIAs without sacrificing predictive performance. Through extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, they demonstrate that ZOO-PCA provides the best tradeoff between privacy protection and accuracy maintenance, significantly reducing the TPR/FPR ratio for loss-based MIAs while keeping test MSE comparable to baseline models.

## Method Summary
The authors explore embedding-space data augmentation to mitigate membership inference attacks in clinical time series forecasting. They train a Transformer encoder-decoder model on EHR data, then generate synthetic embeddings using three augmentation strategies: ZOO (direct optimization in embedding space), ZOO-PCA (ZOO constrained to principal components), and MixUp (linear interpolation between embeddings). These synthetic embeddings are combined with original training data to retrain the model. The effectiveness is evaluated by measuring both predictive accuracy (MSE on test data) and privacy protection (TPR/FPR ratio for loss-based MIA using average training loss as threshold).

## Key Results
- ZOO-PCA augmentation reduces TPR/FPR ratio from 3.55 to 1.43 on MIMIC-III and from 0.51 to 1.13 on eICU
- MixUp achieves lowest test MSE (0.4918 on MIMIC-III), demonstrating superior generalization
- ZOO-PCA maintains competitive test accuracy while providing strongest privacy protection
- All augmentation methods preserve predictive performance within 0.5% tolerance of baseline MSE

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper leverages the observation that embedding-space perturbations can confuse membership inference attacks while preserving task-relevant information. By generating synthetic embeddings that are close to training samples in embedding space but sufficiently diverse to prevent exact matching, the augmented training data makes it harder for attackers to distinguish members from non-members based on loss values. The PCA constraint in ZOO-PCA ensures synthetic samples remain within the meaningful data distribution, preventing degradation of predictive performance while still providing privacy benefits.

## Foundational Learning
- **Membership Inference Attacks**: Methods to determine if specific data points were used in training a model. Needed to understand the threat model and evaluation metrics. Quick check: Can identify attack method (loss-based with threshold = avg training loss).
- **Transformer Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Sequence-to-sequence model used for forecasting. Needed to understand model structure and training. Quick check: References Staniek et al. 2024 for architecture details.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction technique used to constrain synthetic embeddings. Needed to understand ZOO-PCA constraint. Quick check: 70% variance threshold mentioned for PCA.
- **Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO)**: Gradient-free optimization method for generating adversarial perturbations. Needed to understand synthetic embedding generation. Quick check: λ=3000, μ=300, k=3, steps=10 hyperparameters specified.
- **MixUp Augmentation**: Technique creating synthetic samples via linear interpolation. Needed to understand the MixUp method. Quick check: β∈{0.2,1,5} hyperparameters specified.
- **TPR/FPR Ratio**: Metric measuring privacy-utility tradeoff for MIA detection. Needed to understand privacy evaluation. Quick check: Threshold τ = average training loss as specified.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Raw EHR data -> 4-hour sliding windows -> Transformer encoder-decoder -> Embeddings -> Augmentation (ZOO/ZOO-PCA/MixUp) -> Synthetic embeddings -> Retrained model
- **Critical Path**: EHR preprocessing → baseline model training → embedding-space augmentation → retraining with augmented data → privacy/utility evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Privacy protection vs. predictive accuracy; computational cost of augmentation vs. benefit; constraint strength (PCA variance) vs. synthetic sample diversity
- **Failure Signatures**: High MSE after augmentation indicates α too low (privacy prioritized over utility); unchanged TPR/FPR ratio suggests threshold misconfiguration or insufficient synthetic diversity
- **First Experiments**: 1) Train baseline transformer and verify baseline TPR/FPR ratio (~3.55 on MIMIC-III); 2) Implement ZOO-PCA augmentation and verify TPR/FPR reduction to ~1.43; 3) Test MixUp augmentation and verify lowest test MSE (~0.4918)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper explicitly identifies three areas for future research: 1) Investigating hybrid approaches combining ZOO-PCA and MixUp to simultaneously optimize privacy protection and generalization performance, as current methods are evaluated in isolation with ZOO-PCA best for privacy and MixUp best for utility; 2) Evaluating the framework's robustness against more sophisticated attacks like reference-based attacks (e.g., LiRA) rather than just loss-based attacks, since stronger threat models remain unproven; 3) Analyzing the privacy impact of the non-private pre-training of the embedding layer, which creates an "unbounded" total privacy loss that augmentation cannot fully mitigate.

## Limitations
- Missing architectural details: Exact transformer configuration (embedding dimension, layers, attention heads) not specified
- Training hyperparameters unspecified: Learning rate, batch size, optimizer, and epochs not provided
- Dense encoder implementation unclear: How raw binned data maps to embeddings not described
- Privacy analysis incomplete: Fixed non-private embedding layer creates inherent privacy leakage not addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core methodology (ZOO, ZOO-PCA, MixUp augmentation approaches; loss-based MIA evaluation with average training loss threshold; TPR/FPR ratio as primary privacy metric)
- **Medium confidence**: Dataset preprocessing pipeline (sliding window implementation, imputation strategy, standardization); transformer architecture details; augmentation generation process (especially PCA variance threshold application)
- **Low confidence**: Exact training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer, epochs); dense encoder implementation; specific implementation of the objective function g_α and the mMSE privacy loss calculation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate TPR/FPR ratio reduction: Train the baseline transformer on MIMIC-III with the described preprocessing, compute average training loss, then implement ZOO-PCA augmentation and retrain. Verify TPR/FPR ratio decreases from ~3.55 to ~1.43 as reported.
2. Validate MSE preservation: Using the same setup, confirm that MixUp augmentation achieves the lowest test MSE (~0.4918 on MIMIC-III) while maintaining the TPR/FPR ratio at acceptable levels.
3. Test parameter sensitivity: Systematically vary the α parameter in ZOO-PCA augmentation (especially values above 0.5) to confirm the paper's finding that higher α values work best for balancing privacy and utility.
