# ASTRIDE: A Security Threat Modeling Platform for Agentic-AI Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04785
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04785
- Reference count: 32
- ASTRIDE is an automated threat modeling platform for AI agent-based systems that extends STRIDE with a new category for AI Agent-Specific Attacks.

## Executive Summary
ASTRIDE introduces an automated threat modeling platform specifically designed for AI agent-based systems, extending the classical STRIDE framework with a new "A" category for AI Agent-Specific Attacks. The platform leverages fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) trained on annotated system diagrams to detect security threats, including prompt injection, context poisoning, and unsafe tool invocation. A reasoning LLM then synthesizes outputs from multiple VLMs to generate comprehensive threat models. Evaluation demonstrates significant performance improvements through fine-tuning, with the platform showing promise for scalable, accurate, and explainable threat analysis in next-generation AI systems.

## Method Summary
ASTRIDE employs a multi-stage approach: first, three VLMs (Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, Pixtral-Vision, and Qwen2-VL) are fine-tuned using Unsloth with QLoRA quantization on a dataset of ~1,200 synthetically generated Mermaid diagrams annotated with threat vectors. These fine-tuned models form a consortium that independently processes input architecture diagrams to produce structured threat predictions. The outputs are then aggregated and passed to a reasoning LLM (OpenAI-gpt-oss) which synthesizes a final, validated threat model by reconciling any conflicting or incomplete assessments. The entire pipeline is orchestrated through LLM agents and deployed using Ollama for efficient runtime execution.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning VLMs on domain-specific diagrams significantly improves detection of AI-specific threats like prompt injection, context poisoning, and unsafe tool invocation
- Multi-VLM consortium approach provides more robust threat coverage than any single model
- QLoRA-based quantization enables efficient deployment on resource-constrained hardware while maintaining detection accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuning VLMs on domain-specific threat modeling diagrams substantially improves detection of AI-agent-specific threats compared to baseline models. Domain adaptation through supervised learning on annotated architecture diagrams teaches VLMs to recognize structural patterns (trust boundaries, data flows, component roles) and associate them with specific threat vectors. The model learns visual-semantic mappings between diagram elements and ASTRIDE threat categories. Core assumption: The visual patterns in system diagrams contain recoverable signals that correlate with security vulnerabilities, and these patterns are learnable from ~1,200 annotated examples.

### Mechanism 2
A consortium of multiple fine-tuned VLMs provides more robust threat coverage than any single model. Each VLM in the consortium (Llama-Vision, Pixtral-Vision, Qwen2-VL) processes the same diagram independently, producing structured threat predictions. Different model architectures capture different visual-semantic features, reducing the risk that any single model's blind spot results in missed threats. Core assumption: VLM prediction errors are partially uncorrelated across different model families trained on similar data.

### Mechanism 3
A reasoning LLM (OpenAI-gpt-oss) can synthesize conflicting VLM outputs into a coherent, validated threat model. The reasoning LLM receives aggregated VLM predictions as a structured prompt and performs cross-analysis to validate, reconcile, and rank threats. It applies contextual reasoning about system roles and trust boundaries that purely visual models may miss. Core assumption: The reasoning LLM possesses sufficient domain knowledge and reasoning capability to adjudicate between competing threat assessments without introducing its own systematic errors.

## Foundational Learning

- **STRIDE Threat Modeling Framework**: Why needed here: ASTRIDE extends STRIDE with a new "A" category. Understanding the original six categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) is prerequisite to grasping how AI-specific threats complement traditional vectors. Quick check question: Can you name the six STRIDE categories and give one example threat for each?

- **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Why needed here: ASTRIDE uses QLoRA via Unsloth for efficient fine-tuning and deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Understanding parameter-efficient fine-tuning is essential for reproducing the training pipeline. Quick check question: How does QLoRA reduce memory requirements compared to full fine-tuning, and what is the trade-off?

- **Vision-Language Model Architecture**: Why needed here: The core innovation relies on VLMs interpreting visual diagrams. Understanding how vision encoders connect to language models helps diagnose prediction failures and design better training data. Quick check question: What components does a typical VLM combine, and how does the vision encoder output connect to the language model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Lake (stores labeled diagrams) -> VLM Consortium (three fine-tuned models) -> LLM Agents (orchestrates VLM calls) -> Reasoning LLM (synthesizes final threat model)

- **Critical path**: Prepare annotated diagram dataset (Mermaid format → JSON with threat labels) → Fine-tune each VLM separately using QLoRA → Deploy quantized models to Ollama runtime → Configure LLM agents with custom prompts for threat extraction → Wire VLM outputs through agent layer to reasoning LLM

- **Design tradeoffs**: Consortium size vs. latency (more VLMs increase coverage but multiply inference time); Quantization vs. accuracy (QLoRA enables edge deployment but may reduce precision on subtle threat patterns); Synthetic vs. real diagrams (synthetic training data scales easily but may not capture real-world complexity)

- **Failure signatures**: High validation-to-training loss ratio (Figure 6 indicates overfitting; model memorizes training diagrams rather than generalizing); VLM outputs missing AI-specific threats (suggests insufficient training coverage of agent-specific attack patterns); Reasoning LLM produces generic mitigations (prompt may lack sufficient architectural context)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison: Run pre-fine-tuned VLMs on a held-out test diagram set; measure detection rates for each ASTRIDE category to establish improvement magnitude. 2) Ablation study: Remove one VLM from the consortium and measure impact on final threat model completeness; identifies which models contribute unique coverage. 3) Prompt sensitivity test: Vary the reasoning LLM prompt structure (with/without system metadata, with/without trust boundary definitions) and evaluate final output quality on a fixed diagram set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the traditional sense. However, several unresolved issues are implied:

1. What quantitative performance metrics (precision, recall, F1) does ASTRIDE achieve against expert-annotated ground truth across diverse diagram types?
2. How does ASTRIDE generalize to real-world, non-synthetically generated architecture diagrams from production AI agent systems?
3. To what extent does the observed overfitting (validation loss exceeding training loss) impact threat detection on out-of-distribution diagram formats?

## Limitations

- Reliance on synthetic training data may not capture the complexity and variability of real-world AI agent system architectures
- Effectiveness of reasoning LLM synthesis depends heavily on prompt engineering quality, which is not fully specified
- Performance on novel threat categories or emerging AI-specific attack vectors remains untested

## Confidence

- **Fine-tuning improves VLM threat detection**: High - Supported by direct before/after comparison showing coverage expansion from prompt injection-only to all three ASTRIDE-specific threats, with context-aware mitigations
- **Multi-VLM consortium provides robust coverage**: Medium - Theoretical rationale is sound and supported by architectural description, but empirical validation through ablation studies is absent
- **Reasoning LLM synthesizes coherent threat models**: Low-Medium - While the mechanism is described and qualitative examples are provided, there is no systematic evaluation of synthesis quality

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world diagram validation**: Apply ASTRIDE to a set of real enterprise AI agent architecture diagrams (not synthetically generated) and compare threat detection coverage and precision against manual expert analysis
2. **Ablation study on VLM consortium composition**: Systematically remove each VLM from the consortium and measure the impact on final threat model completeness and accuracy
3. **Cross-architecture threat generalization test**: Evaluate ASTRIDE on AI agent system diagrams from different application domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles) to assess performance on novel architectural patterns
