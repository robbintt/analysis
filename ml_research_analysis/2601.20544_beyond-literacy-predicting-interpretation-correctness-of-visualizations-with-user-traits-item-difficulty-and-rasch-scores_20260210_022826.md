# Beyond Literacy: Predicting Interpretation Correctness of Visualizations with User Traits, Item Difficulty, and Rasch Scores

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20544
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Logistic Regression with feature selection achieved median AUC 0.72 and median kappa 0.32 for predicting visualization interpretation correctness

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting whether a person will correctly interpret a data visualization before seeing it, a problem termed "Human Interpretation Correctness" (HIC). The authors operationalize this as a binary classification task using 22 features grouped into three categories: item difficulty (expert ratings and Rasch scores), human profile (demographics and experience), and human performance (prior correctness). They evaluate three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron—on a dataset of 1,083 participants answering 32 data visualization items, totaling 34,656 responses. The Logistic Regression model with feature selection performed best, achieving a median AUC of 0.72 and a median kappa of 0.32. Feature importance analysis revealed that Rasch difficulty scores were the strongest predictor, followed by expert ratings and prior correctness, which increased in relevance across sessions. Notably, demographic and contextual variables like country of birth and language were more predictive than self-reported experience. These results demonstrate the feasibility of anticipating misinterpretations and support the development of adaptive, personalized data visualization literacy assessments.

## Method Summary
The authors created a dataset of 1,083 participants who answered 32 data visualization items, generating 34,656 responses. They extracted 22 features across three families: Item Difficulty (ExpertDifficulty, RaschDifficulty), Human Profile (18 features including age, gender, education, DataVizExperience), and Human Performance (PercCorrect, MedianDifficulty). Rasch difficulty was computed using Winsteps 5.4 with leave-one-out approach to prevent leakage. The models were evaluated using 10×10-fold cross-validation on 32 item-specific datasets, with feature selection embedded in cross-validation via AttributeSelectedClassifier. AUC and Cohen's Kappa served as evaluation metrics.

## Key Results
- Logistic Regression with feature selection achieved median AUC of 0.72 and median kappa of 0.32
- RaschDifficulty was the dominant predictor across all sessions and question types
- Human Profile features (demographics, experience) provided minimal predictive value compared to psychometric measures
- PercCorrect (prior correctness) increased in importance across sessions, suggesting dynamic adaptation improves prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Psychometric Difficulty Dominance
The primary driver of interpretation correctness is the intrinsic difficulty of the item itself, not the user's static profile. The model leverages the Rasch model to separate item difficulty from person ability, creating a robust baseline probability of error that outweighs demographic variance. This assumes item difficulty is a stable, objective property that generalizes across different user cohorts.

### Mechanism 2: Sequential Performance Recalibration
Predictive accuracy improves as the system observes the user's interaction history. As the user progresses through sessions, the system shifts reliance from static item difficulty to dynamic user performance metrics, capturing interaction-dependent factors like fatigue or learning momentum.

### Mechanism 3: Linear Separability of Correctness
Correctness can be predicted effectively using linear decision boundaries rather than complex non-linear interactions. The relationship between features and the outcome is largely monotonic, allowing Logistic Regression to capture this effectively by penalizing noise and maximizing the log-likelihood of the linear combination.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Rasch Modeling (Item Response Theory)**
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on `RaschDifficulty` as the dominant feature. Without understanding how raw scores are transformed into logits (interval measures) and how person ability is separated from item difficulty, one cannot interpret the model's most critical input.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the Rasch model is preferred over simple "percentage correct" for measuring item difficulty?

- **Concept: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and AUC**
  - Why needed here: The authors explicitly reject raw Accuracy/Precision for AUC to avoid threshold dependency. Understanding the trade-off between True Positives and False Positives is required to interpret the reported 0.72 AUC.
  - Quick check question: Why does an AUC of 0.5 indicate random guessing, and what does an AUC of 0.72 practically mean for predicting user errors?

- **Concept: Feature Selection (CFS & Gain Ratio)**
  - Why needed here: The paper notes that "Profile information did not particularly support P-HIC." Understanding how algorithms like Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) filter out redundant attributes is key to understanding why the simpler model won.
  - Quick check question: How does CFS evaluate the "merit" of a subset of features compared to evaluating features in isolation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer (22 Features) -> Processing Core (Logistic Regression + CFS) -> Output Layer (Binary probability)
- **Critical path:** Item Calibration (Rasch) -> User Initialization -> Dynamic Update (PercCorrect) -> Prediction (LR) -> Selection (Optimal difficulty)
- **Design tradeoffs:** Interpretability vs. Complexity (chose LR over MLP/RF for transparency), Static vs. Dynamic Features (heavier reliance on dynamic features improves accuracy but creates cold-start problem)
- **Failure signatures:** High Kappa/Low AUC discrepancy (calibration issues), Flat prediction line in Session 1 (cold-start problem), Overfitting to Profile (violates fairness constraints)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation Study: Run LR model three times using only [Item Difficulty], only [Human Profile], and only [Human Performance]
  2. Temporal Stability Test: Train on Session 1 data, test on Session 8 data (and vice versa)
  3. Cold Start Simulation: Train on items 1-5, test on item 6 for all users to measure performance delta

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can incorporating dynamic behavioral signals (e.g., eye-tracking, interaction traces, response time) significantly improve prediction accuracy over current static features?
  - Basis: Authors state future work should extend P-HIC by incorporating richer signals such as response time, uncertainty, explanation quality, eye-tracking, and interaction traces.
  - Why unresolved: Current study relied exclusively on features measurable before user interacts with specific visualization item.
  - Evidence needed: Comparative study benchmarking current feature set against models with dynamic interaction features.

- **Question:** How does P-HIC model performance vary across diverse populations and alternative visualization taxonomies?
  - Basis: Dataset limited to English-speaking respondents with at most graduate degree; authors call for validating findings on broader populations and additional DV item sets.
  - Why unresolved: Specific demographic filters and fixed set of eight visualization types limit generalizability.
  - Evidence needed: Replication using dataset with non-English speakers, doctoral participants, and wider variety of visualization items.

- **Question:** Can advanced personalization policies (reinforcement learning, optimal stopping) outperform current static logistic regression approach in adaptive assessment?
  - Basis: Conclusion suggests evaluating alternative personalization policies, specifically mentioning reinforcement learning and optimal stopping.
  - Why unresolved: Study focused on establishing feasibility using established baselines rather than optimizing adaptive policy.
  - Evidence needed: A/B test comparing adaptive assessment using current LR model against system using reinforcement learning for item selection.

## Limitations

- Cold-start prediction accuracy is limited when no prior correctness data exists
- Generalizability to new visualization types beyond the eight studied remains untested
- Population representativeness is limited to Amazon Mechanical Turk participants

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** RaschDifficulty as dominant predictor is well-supported by multiple analyses
- **Medium Confidence:** Logistic Regression outperforming complex models is credible but varies by visualization type
- **Medium Confidence:** Demographic features being more predictive than experience is based on feature importance rankings

## Next Checks

1. **Cold-start validation:** Train and evaluate model on only first visualization item per user to quantify performance drop without prior correctness data
2. **Cross-dataset transfer:** Apply trained model to different visualization literacy dataset (e.g., PIAAC data) to test RaschDifficulty transferability
3. **Interactive simulation:** Implement simulated user with varying performance patterns to test model predictions and feature importance shifts across user types
