# CLIP is All You Need for Human-like Semantic Representations in Stable Diffusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08075
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08075
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CLIP's final layer drives human-like semantic understanding in Stable Diffusion, with diffusion acting as visual decoder

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether Stable Diffusion's internal representations contain human-like semantic understanding of objects during text-to-image generation. The authors apply probing techniques using ridge regression to predict semantic attributes for objects from intermediate representations, evaluating predictions against human annotations. They find that semantic understanding in Stable Diffusion primarily comes from CLIP rather than the diffusion process itself, with CLIP's output layer showing the strongest alignment with human judgment. The diffusion process acts as a visual decoder of CLIP's representation. Interestingly, non-spatial attributes are better represented than spatial ones, contrary to expectations. The authors also demonstrate that CLIP better disentangles attributes compared to later stages of the generation process, while later stages tend to entangle attributes that humans keep separate.

## Method Summary
The study probes internal representations of Stable Diffusion to predict human-rated semantic attributes from intermediate activations. The authors extract CLIP ViT-L/14 hidden layers (12 layers), U-Net bottleneck, and U-Net output across 50 DDIM sampling steps. For each noun, they run 50 DDIM sampling steps, collect intermediate representations, apply PCA with z-score normalization, then train per-attribute ridge regression with 5-fold nested cross-validation. The regression targets are human ratings (1-5) for 229 attributes across 1,000 concrete nouns. They evaluate predictions using RMSE and permutation-test p-values (threshold p<0.05) to assess significance. The entanglement analysis measures cosine similarity between regression weights and human response vectors to determine attribute relationships.

## Key Results
- CLIP's final layer achieves lowest RMSE (0.86) and highest significance for semantic predictions compared to all diffusion stages
- Diffusion stages (Diff-Bot_k and Diff-Out_k) show progressively worse alignment with human judgments as generation progresses
- Non-spatial attributes are significantly better represented than spatial attributes in all model components
- CLIP representations better disentangle attributes (lower cosine similarity) compared to diffusion stages, which entangle attributes more

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that CLIP's vision-language embeddings provide the semantic foundation for text-to-image generation, with the diffusion process primarily handling visual refinement rather than semantic encoding. The regression probes demonstrate that CLIP's final layer captures the most human-aligned semantic information, suggesting that language conditioning is the primary source of semantic understanding rather than learned visual representations. The progressive deterioration of alignment through diffusion stages indicates that the generative process prioritizes visual fidelity over semantic fidelity. The better performance on non-spatial attributes suggests that visual models naturally capture appearance-based features more effectively than spatial relationships, which may require explicit architectural design choices.

## Foundational Learning

**Ridge Regression**
- Why needed: To predict human semantic ratings from high-dimensional neural representations
- Quick check: Verify that regularization prevents overfitting and cross-validation ensures generalization

**Permutation Testing**
- Why needed: To establish statistical significance of prediction accuracy beyond chance
- Quick check: Confirm p-values remain below 0.05 threshold when labels are randomly shuffled

**Cosine Similarity for Entanglement**
- Why needed: To quantify how attributes are represented jointly or separately in different model components
- Quick check: Verify that higher similarity indicates more entangled representations

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Why needed: To reduce dimensionality while preserving variance in high-dimensional activations
- Quick check: Ensure explained variance ratio is sufficient after dimensionality reduction

**Nested Cross-Validation**
- Why needed: To tune hyperparameters without leaking information between training and testing
- Quick check: Confirm that inner loop selects optimal regularization and outer loop evaluates generalization

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
CLIP (Text Encoder) -> CLIP (Vision Encoder, 12 layers) -> U-Net (Bottleneck: Diff-Bot_k) -> U-Net (Output: Diff-Out_k) -> Generated Image

**Critical Path**
Text prompt → CLIP text encoder → CLIP vision encoder → CLIP final layer → U-Net cross-attention → U-Net denoising → Image generation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Language conditioning vs. visual learning: CLIP provides strong semantic priors but may limit model's ability to learn visual semantics independently
- Spatial vs. non-spatial attribute representation: Current architectures favor appearance-based features over spatial relationships
- Model size vs. semantic alignment: Larger CLIP variants show better alignment but increase computational cost

**Failure Signatures**
- High RMSE with non-significant p-values indicates poor semantic representation or misalignment between probe and targets
- Unexpectedly good diffusion-stage performance suggests CLIP conditioning may not be properly implemented
- Inconsistent entanglement patterns across attributes may indicate dataset bias or probe limitations

**First Experiments**
1. Test CLIP vs. diffusion-stage performance on a held-out validation set of attributes
2. Compare entanglement scores between CLIP and diffusion stages for specific attribute pairs
3. Analyze PCA variance explained ratios across different model components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: Do diffusion models trained without language conditioning develop human-like semantic alignment independent of a text encoder?
- Basis in paper: The authors state, "A future step in our investigation could be to apply our technique to [unconditional] models next, to see if they exhibit any alignment with humans."
- Why unresolved: The study found that alignment in Stable Diffusion is driven by CLIP; the internal semantic capacity of the diffusion U-Net itself remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Significant probing accuracy on unconditional diffusion models using a newly created dataset of image-attribute pairs.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: How can generative architectures be modified to better represent spatial attributes compared to non-spatial ones?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes spatial attributes are poorly represented and "motivates future research on designing models that bring in such spatial relationship explicitly."
- Why unresolved: Current models prioritize visual decoding over physical semantics, resulting in higher error rates for spatial versus non-spatial attributes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model architecture where probes for spatial attributes achieve accuracy equal to or greater than non-spatial attributes.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: Do other generative architectures, such as GANs, rely on their encoders for semantics similarly to how Stable Diffusion relies on CLIP?
- Basis in paper: The authors propose applying "our technique to a variety of models... to understand their respective differences in human alignment and reveal any favorable architecture biases."
- Why unresolved: The conclusion that the generation process acts merely as a "visual decoder" has only been tested on Stable Diffusion.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative probing experiments on GANs or alternative diffusion models to determine if semantic alignment degrades during the generative process.

## Limitations
- Analysis constrained to 1,000 concrete nouns with 229 pre-defined attributes, limiting generalizability to abstract concepts
- Regression-based probing cannot definitively establish causal relationships between representations and semantic processing
- Simplified cosine similarity measures may not capture complex interaction patterns in high-dimensional spaces

## Confidence

**Confidence Labels:**
- CLIP's dominance in semantic representation: **High**
- Diffusion as visual decoder of CLIP: **High**
- Non-spatial attributes better represented than spatial: **Medium**
- CLIP better disentangles attributes than later stages: **Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Test whether the semantic attribution pattern holds for novel objects and attributes not present in the original MTurk dataset.
2. Evaluate alternative probing methods (e.g., nonlinear probes, causal interventions) to verify the regression results and disentangle correlation from causation.
3. Analyze the impact of different text prompts (multi-word descriptions vs. single nouns) on CLIP vs. diffusion contributions to semantic representation.
