# Investigating Corporate Social Responsibility Initiatives: Examining the case of corporate Covid-19 response

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.03421
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03421
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: NLP methods (LDA, deep distributed representation models, TF-IDF, TextRank) identify CSR themes in corporate press releases, showing shifts from employee safety to community welfare during COVID-19, enabling efficient assessment of CSR practices.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing press releases from the top 15 NASDAQ-listed firms. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), deep distributed representation models, and text summarization methods (TF-IDF sentence ranking and TextRank), the authors identify and summarize key CSR themes. The research reveals that firms initially focused on employee safety and community relief in early 2020, later shifting to community and student welfare. These methods provide policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders with tools to efficiently assess and standardize CSR practices during crises.

## Method Summary
The study applies NLP methods to analyze CSR-related press releases. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and deep distributed representation models are used to identify topics in the press releases. Text summarization techniques, including TF-IDF sentence ranking and TextRank, are employed to condense large volumes of Amazon’s CSR reports. The analysis focuses on the top 15 NASDAQ-listed firms, tracking CSR themes over time during the pandemic.

## Key Results
- Firms initially focused on employee safety and community relief in early 2020.
- CSR focus shifted to community and student welfare in later months.
- NLP methods (LDA, deep models, TF-IDF, TextRank) effectively identify and summarize CSR themes, providing concise overviews of CSR efforts.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study leverages NLP techniques to process large volumes of unstructured text data from CSR press releases. LDA identifies latent topics by modeling word distributions, while deep distributed representation models capture semantic relationships. Text summarization methods condense information into key points, making it easier to track CSR trends over time. These methods enable efficient analysis of CSR activities during the pandemic, revealing shifts in corporate focus.

## Foundational Learning
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: A topic modeling technique that identifies hidden themes in text by analyzing word distributions. *Why needed*: To uncover underlying CSR themes in press releases. *Quick check*: Verify that LDA topics align with known CSR categories.
- **Deep Distributed Representation Models**: Neural network-based models that capture semantic relationships between words and phrases. *Why needed*: To enhance topic identification by understanding context. *Quick check*: Compare topic coherence scores with and without deep models.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: A statistical measure that ranks the importance of words in a document relative to a corpus. *Why needed*: To summarize key sentences in CSR reports. *Quick check*: Ensure summarized sentences capture the main CSR initiatives.
- **TextRank**: A graph-based algorithm for text summarization that ranks sentences based on their importance. *Why needed*: To provide alternative summaries of CSR reports. *Quick check*: Validate summaries against human-generated summaries.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Press Releases → NLP Preprocessing → LDA + Deep Models → Topic Identification → Summarization (TF-IDF, TextRank) → CSR Theme Analysis
**Critical Path**: Data Collection → NLP Preprocessing → Topic Modeling → Summarization → Analysis
**Design Tradeoffs**: Using only press releases from top 15 NASDAQ firms limits generalizability but ensures high-quality data. NLP methods are efficient but may miss nuanced CSR activities.
**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent topic identification due to domain-specific jargon, summarization errors from over-reliance on statistical measures.
**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Apply LDA to a broader set of CSR documents. 2) Compare deep model performance with traditional topic modeling. 3) Validate summaries with stakeholder feedback.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study focuses only on the top 15 NASDAQ-listed firms, limiting generalizability.
- NLP methods may miss nuanced CSR activities better captured through qualitative analysis.
- Potential biases in firm selection or press release content are not addressed.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: NLP methods (LDA, deep models, TF-IDF, TextRank) are valid and well-established for analyzing CSR press releases.
- **Medium Confidence**: These methods can efficiently assess and standardize CSR practices during crises, but require further validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The impact of these methods on real-world policy or regulatory frameworks is speculative.

## Next Checks
1. **Expand the Corpus**: Apply the same NLP methods to a broader set of CSR-related documents, including press releases from companies outside the top 15 NASDAQ-listed firms and across different sectors.
2. **Qualitative Validation**: Conduct qualitative interviews with stakeholders (e.g., employees, community members, CSR experts) to assess whether the themes identified by the NLP models align with their perceptions and experiences of CSR activities during the pandemic.
3. **Policy Impact Assessment**: Collaborate with policymakers or regulatory bodies to implement a pilot program that uses these NLP tools to monitor and standardize CSR practices during a crisis. Assess the effectiveness and challenges of such an approach.
