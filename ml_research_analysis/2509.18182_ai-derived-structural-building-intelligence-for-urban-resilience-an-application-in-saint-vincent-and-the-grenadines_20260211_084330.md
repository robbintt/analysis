# AI-Derived Structural Building Intelligence for Urban Resilience: An Application in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.18182
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18182
- Authors: Isabelle Tingzon; Yoji Toriumi; Caroline Gevaert
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: ConvNeXt-based deep learning models achieved F1 scores of 0.88 for roof pitch and 0.83 for roof material classification in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

## Executive Summary
This study presents an AI-driven workflow for automated rooftop attribute classification using high-resolution satellite imagery in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The research compares geospatial foundation models with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models, finding that ConvNeXt-based architectures outperform alternatives for both roof pitch and material classification. The resulting nationwide building classification maps provide critical structural intelligence for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction in this climate-vulnerable small island developing state.

The study demonstrates that incorporating training data from neighboring Caribbean SIDS improves roof pitch classification but not roof material classification, likely due to regional variations in roofing materials. However, the authors note limitations for individual building-level vulnerability assessments since critical structural attributes cannot be captured from satellite imagery alone. This work represents a significant advancement in using AI for large-scale structural building intelligence in data-scarce regions.

## Method Summary
The research employed a comparative approach testing three model types: geospatial foundation models, shallow classifiers, and deep learning models (specifically ConvNeXt architectures) for rooftop attribute classification. The study utilized high-resolution satellite imagery from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to train and validate these models across two classification tasks: roof pitch and roof material identification. Transfer learning experiments incorporated training data from neighboring Caribbean SIDS to assess model generalizability. Performance was evaluated using F1 scores, with deep learning models achieving superior results compared to alternative approaches.

## Key Results
- ConvNeXt deep learning models achieved F1 scores of 0.88 for roof pitch classification
- ConvNeXt models achieved F1 scores of 0.83 for roof material classification
- Transfer learning from neighboring Caribbean SIDS improved roof pitch classification but not roof material classification
- Nationwide building classification maps were successfully generated for urban resilience planning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ConvNeXt architecture's superior performance stems from its modern design principles that optimize feature extraction and classification accuracy for satellite imagery. The model's ability to capture hierarchical spatial patterns and architectural features enables more accurate differentiation between roof types and materials. Transfer learning effectiveness for roof pitch but not material classification suggests that pitch characteristics are more regionally consistent across Caribbean SIDS, while material choices vary based on local availability, cost, and cultural preferences.

## Foundational Learning
- **ConvNeXt Architecture**: Modern vision transformer with convolutional design principles; needed for high-performance satellite imagery classification; quick check: compare with ViT and ResNet baseline performance
- **Transfer Learning**: Knowledge transfer from related domains; needed to leverage limited training data in SIDS; quick check: measure performance gains from neighboring country data
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall; needed for balanced classification performance evaluation; quick check: ensure class balance in test sets
- **Geospatial Foundation Models**: Pre-trained models for Earth observation; needed for zero-shot classification capability; quick check: validate on unseen geographic regions
- **Roof Pitch Classification**: Geometric measurement of roof slope; needed for structural vulnerability assessment; quick check: correlate with wind load resistance
- **Roof Material Classification**: Identification of construction materials; needed for fire and thermal vulnerability assessment; quick check: validate against material durability standards

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Satellite Imagery -> Preprocessing -> ConvNeXt Backbone -> Classification Head -> F1 Score Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Image preprocessing and normalization → Feature extraction through ConvNeXt layers → Classification decision boundaries → Performance evaluation metrics

**Design Tradeoffs**: Deep learning models require substantial training data and computational resources but achieve superior accuracy; foundation models offer zero-shot capability but lower precision; shallow classifiers are computationally efficient but less accurate for complex visual patterns

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on buildings with complex roof geometries; misclassification of similar-looking materials under different lighting conditions; reduced accuracy for small or partially obscured buildings

**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing transfer learning components, 2) Cross-validation across different Caribbean SIDS regions, 3) Sensitivity analysis varying image resolution and preprocessing parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Geographic limitation to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines constrains generalizability to other regions
- Inability to capture critical structural attributes necessary for individual building vulnerability assessments
- Absence of ground-truth validation against physical structural data
- Regional variations in roofing materials limit transfer learning benefits for material classification

## Confidence
- Model performance comparison: High
- Regional transfer learning benefits: Medium
- Structural vulnerability assessment applicability: Low
- Nationwide classification accuracy: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct field validation studies to verify satellite-derived classifications against actual building structural attributes across multiple Caribbean SIDS
2. Test model transferability to non-Caribbean small island developing states with different architectural traditions and roofing materials
3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of derived building intelligence for actual disaster impact scenarios through retrospective analysis of past extreme weather events
