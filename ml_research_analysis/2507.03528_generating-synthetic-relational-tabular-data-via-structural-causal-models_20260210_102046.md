- Generates synthetic relational tabular data using structural causal models without requiring real-world data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel method for generating synthetic relational tabular data using structural causal models (SCMs). Unlike existing approaches that rely on real-world data to extract statistical patterns, this framework independently constructs multiple interconnected tables with complex dependencies. The method uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model both intra-table correlations and inter-table relationships through shared key columns. The approach is particularly well-suited for training tabular foundation models and creating benchmarks, as it can produce large quantities of data with various statistical properties while accurately mimicking real-world relational database structures.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a framework that generates synthetic relational tabular data through structural causal models without requiring real-world data. The method constructs multiple interconnected tables using directed acyclic graphs to model both intra-table correlations and inter-table relationships via shared key columns. The framework independently builds these tables while maintaining realistic statistical dependencies. The approach demonstrates generation of a dataset with 100,000 rows in the main table and 500 rows in an additional table, showing that the additional table contains information not present in the main table but influences its target columns. This validates the realistic nature of the inter-table dependencies created by the method.

## Key Results
- Successfully generates relational tabular data using structural causal models without real-world data
- Creates realistic inter-table dependencies where additional tables influence target columns in main tables
- Demonstrates generation of 100,000 rows in main table with 500 rows in additional table
- Framework suitable for training tabular foundation models and creating benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging structural causal models to capture both the statistical patterns within individual tables and the causal relationships between tables through shared key columns. By using directed acyclic graphs to represent these dependencies, the framework can generate data that preserves realistic correlations while maintaining independence from real-world datasets. The causal structure ensures that information flows appropriately between tables, creating dependencies that mirror real relational databases.

## Foundational Learning
- **Structural Causal Models (SCMs)**: Mathematical framework for causal inference that represents variables as functions of their direct causes plus noise; needed to capture causal relationships between tables; quick check: verify noise terms maintain independence assumptions
- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**: Graph structure without cycles where edges represent causal dependencies; needed to model both intra-table and inter-table relationships; quick check: ensure no cycles exist in the constructed graph
- **Relational Database Schema**: Structure defining how multiple tables relate through primary and foreign keys; needed to understand inter-table dependencies; quick check: validate key relationships preserve referential integrity
- **Tabular Foundation Models**: AI models trained on large amounts of tabular data for downstream tasks; needed to understand the target application; quick check: verify generated data preserves statistical properties relevant for model training
- **Causal Inference**: Statistical framework for determining cause-and-effect relationships; needed to ensure generated dependencies are meaningful; quick check: validate that interventions in one table appropriately affect related tables

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Data Generation Engine -> SCM Builder -> DAG Constructor -> Table Generator -> Dependency Validator

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from defining the relational schema to generating the final synthetic dataset. The SCM Builder constructs causal models for each table, the DAG Constructor maps inter-table relationships, and the Table Generator produces the actual data while the Dependency Validator ensures realistic statistical properties are maintained.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The method trades computational complexity for independence from real-world data. While this approach avoids data privacy concerns and enables unlimited data generation, it requires careful specification of causal relationships and may be computationally intensive for large-scale implementations. The independence from real data means the method must rely on domain expertise to specify appropriate causal structures.

**Failure Signatures**
Failure occurs when generated data exhibits unrealistic statistical properties, when inter-table dependencies don't reflect realistic business logic, or when the computational requirements become prohibitive for large-scale implementations. Key indicators include poor performance of models trained on generated data, violations of referential integrity, or failure to capture domain-specific patterns.

**First Experiments**
1. Generate a small synthetic dataset (10,000 rows) and validate that basic statistical properties match expectations
2. Test inter-table dependencies by verifying that changes in one table appropriately affect related tables
3. Compare the performance of a simple ML model trained on generated data versus real data on a benchmark task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited validation on large-scale datasets; current demonstration uses only 100,000 rows in main table
- Unclear computational complexity and runtime requirements for enterprise-level implementations
- Limited assessment of whether generated data captures nuanced statistical properties of real-world relational databases
- No evaluation of performance on complex schemas with hundreds of interconnected tables

## Confidence
- Core methodology using SCMs and DAGs: High
- Practical applicability and scalability: Medium
- Claim about mimicking real-world relational database structures: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on a real-world relational database schema with at least 10 interconnected tables and millions of rows to evaluate scalability and computational requirements
2. Compare generated data statistics against real data across multiple dimensions: join distributions, key relationship patterns, and temporal correlations if applicable
3. Implement a user study where data scientists attempt to distinguish between real and synthetically generated relational datasets to assess the realism of the generated data
