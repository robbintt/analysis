# Generating Spatial Synthetic Populations Using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network: A Case Study with EU-SILC Data for Helsinki and Thessaloniki

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.16080
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16080
- Authors: Vanja Falck
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: WGANs effectively generate high-dimensional synthetic populations from EU-SILC census data with excellent statistical validity, though they under-represent fringe profiles.

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) can effectively generate high-dimensional synthetic populations from EU-SILC census data for urban applications. The approach successfully creates synthetic populations for Helsinki and Thessaloniki by training WGANs on national microdata and balancing using either EU-SILC weights or aggregated statistics. The synthetic populations achieved excellent statistical validity, with strong Pearson's correlation coefficients, R-squared values, and low SRMSE scores. Bland-Altman analysis confirmed good overall fit between synthetic and original data. However, the study identified a critical challenge: WGANs tend to under-represent fringe profiles, particularly evident in the variable self-perceived health. This under-representation poses discrimination risks for vulnerable groups in agent-based simulations. The findings suggest that while WGANs offer a computationally tractable solution for high-dimensional synthetic population generation, careful validation and potential mitigation strategies are needed to ensure fair representation of all population segments.

## Method Summary
The study employs WGANs to generate spatial synthetic populations using EU-SILC census data for Helsinki and Thessaloniki. The method involves training WGANs on national microdata and balancing the synthetic populations using either EU-SILC weights or aggregated statistics. The synthetic populations are then validated against original data using statistical metrics including Pearson's correlation coefficients, R-squared values, and SRMSE scores. Bland-Altman analysis is also applied to assess overall fit. The approach is designed to handle the high dimensionality of census data while maintaining computational tractability for urban applications.

## Key Results
- WGANs achieved excellent statistical validity with strong Pearson's correlation coefficients and R-squared values for synthetic populations
- Bland-Altman analysis confirmed good overall fit between synthetic and original data
- WGANs successfully generated high-dimensional synthetic populations that balanced using EU-SILC weights or aggregated statistics
- Critical challenge identified: under-representation of fringe profiles, particularly in self-perceived health variable, posing discrimination risks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
WGANs work for synthetic population generation because they can learn complex, high-dimensional distributions through adversarial training, where the generator learns to produce realistic samples while the discriminator learns to distinguish real from synthetic data. The Wasserstein distance metric provides more stable training than traditional GANs by offering meaningful gradients even when the distributions are far apart. This allows the model to capture the complex relationships between multiple demographic variables in census data while maintaining computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Wasserstein Distance** - Why needed: Provides stable gradients for training generative models on complex distributions. Quick check: Verify that the critic network implements the Lipschitz constraint through weight clipping or gradient penalty.
2. **EU-SILC Data Structure** - Why needed: Understanding the high-dimensional, hierarchical nature of census microdata is crucial for appropriate model design. Quick check: Confirm variable types (categorical vs. continuous) and their relationships before training.
3. **Bland-Altman Analysis** - Why needed: Detects systematic biases between synthetic and real data that correlation metrics might miss. Quick check: Plot the difference between synthetic and real values against their average to identify consistent over/under-estimation patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Real Data -> Discriminator -> Wasserstein Distance -> Generator Loss -> Generator -> Synthetic Data

**Critical Path**: Generator (neural network) -> Synthetic population generation -> Statistical validation (correlation, R², SRMSE) -> Bland-Altman analysis

**Design Tradeoffs**: WGANs offer computational tractability for high-dimensional data but may sacrifice accurate representation of rare population segments. The choice between EU-SILC weighting and aggregated statistics affects balancing accuracy versus computational efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Under-representation of fringe profiles (especially in health variables), simultaneous over-representation of typical values, hidden distortions not captured by shallow validation metrics.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Train WGAN on a subset of variables to verify basic functionality before scaling to full high-dimensional dataset
2. Compare synthetic population distributions against real data using simple statistical tests (KS test, chi-square) for individual variables
3. Perform sensitivity analysis by varying the number of training epochs to identify optimal stopping point before mode collapse occurs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can deep generative models be modified to eliminate the under-representation of fringe profiles while maintaining high alignment with aggregated demographic statistics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author identifies an "urgent need for further investigation lies in representing fringe group profiles" and highlights the trade-off where WGAN-imputing fits demographics well but distorts fringe health variables.
- Why unresolved: Neural networks inherently generate more frequent examples and suppress rare examples (fringe profiles), leading to potential discrimination in agent-based modeling.
- What evidence would resolve it: A generative model that maintains Pearson's R² > 0.97 for demographics while showing no significant deviation in Bland-Altman plots for variables like self-perceived health (PH010).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can neural manifold clustering or diffusion probabilistic methods better preserve deep statistical structures in high-dimensional synthetic populations than WGANs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "Future work should explore... neural manifold clustering techniques... used in imaging to preserve deeper statistical structures."
- Why unresolved: While promising in imaging, these techniques have not been tested for their ability to maintain complex variable relationships in tabular EU-SILC data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative benchmarks showing these techniques reduce the "hidden" distortion effects observed in WGAN-generated populations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What validation metrics can reliably detect the simultaneous over-representation of typical values and under-representation of fringe values in high-featured synthetic data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that "misrepresentations caused by simultaneous over- and under-representations go under the radar" of shallow metrics like SRMSE and Pearson's correlation.
- Why unresolved: There are currently no standardized methods to validate internal validity regarding specific variable distortions in high-dimensional datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validation framework that quantifies distortion for specific minority subgroups more effectively than the current Bland-Altman plot application.

## Limitations
- Under-representation of fringe population profiles, particularly in self-perceived health variable, poses discrimination risks for agent-based simulations
- Limited generalizability due to testing only on Helsinki and Thessaloniki, which may not represent diverse urban contexts
- Validation approach may not capture long-term emergent behaviors in complex simulations

## Confidence
- High confidence in the WGAN's ability to generate statistically valid synthetic populations (correlation coefficients, R-squared values)
- Medium confidence in the generalizability of results across different urban contexts
- Medium confidence in the discrimination risk assessment, given the limited number of variables examined

## Next Checks
1. Test WGAN performance on synthetic population generation for additional cities with different demographic characteristics and urban structures
2. Conduct longitudinal agent-based simulations to evaluate how under-representation of fringe profiles affects long-term outcomes
3. Implement and evaluate mitigation strategies (e.g., re-weighting, enhanced training objectives) to improve representation of vulnerable population segments
