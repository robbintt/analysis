# Term2Note: Synthesising Differentially Private Clinical Notes from Medical Terms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.10882
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10882
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Achieves strong structural, syntactic, and semantic fidelity to real clinical data with micro F1 up to 55.46 and AUC up to 80.81 on ICD coding, while maintaining formal differential privacy guarantees

## Executive Summary
Term2Note introduces a privacy-preserving framework for generating synthetic clinical notes by conditioning section-wise generation on differentially private medical terms. The method achieves strong structural, syntactic, and semantic fidelity to real clinical data, with KL divergence as low as 0.15 in text length and Jaccard scores exceeding 0.5 for clinical term overlap. On a downstream ICD coding task, models trained on Term2Note synthetic notes achieve micro F1 scores up to 55.46 and AUC up to 80.81, closely matching performance on real data. Human evaluation shows clinical experts prefer Term2Note outputs over baselines in over 52% of pairwise comparisons, even under full privacy constraints. The method consistently outperforms DP baselines such as AUG-PE and FastDP, demonstrating its potential as a viable privacy-preserving alternative for sharing clinical notes.

## Method Summary
Term2Note is a two-stage differentially private framework that generates synthetic clinical notes by first extracting and privatizing medical terms, then generating section-wise note content conditioned on these terms. The method uses regex-based SECSPLIT to segment notes into standardized sections, QuickUMLS to extract SNOMED CT terms, and MedEmbed-large for term embeddings. TERMGEN (GPT-2-Large) reconstructs synthetic terms from perturbed embeddings, while NOTEGEN (Llama-3.2-1B or Gemma-3-1B) generates section text conditioned on these terms using DP-SGD via FastDP. A quality maximizer scores k candidates per note by perplexity and selects the lowest. The approach leverages parallel composition to provide granular privacy control between term and note generation.

## Key Results
- Achieves KL divergence as low as 0.15 for text length distribution matching
- Jaccard scores exceed 0.5 for clinical term overlap between synthetic and real notes
- DownstreaMEDIC coding task achieves micro F1 up to 55.46 and AUC up to 80.81
- Human experts prefer Term2Note outputs over baselines in over 52% of pairwise comparisons
- Consistently outperforms DP baselines AUG-PE and FastDP across all evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Section-wise Decomposition
Clinical notes are segmented into ≤6 standardized sections via regex-based SECSPLIT, with each section generated conditionally on prior sections. This localizes DP noise impact per-section rather than accumulating across entire long-form documents, reducing generation complexity under DP constraints while preserving structural fidelity.

### Mechanism 2: Fine-grained Term Conditioning
Instead of coarse diagnosis codes, generation is conditioned on fine-grained SNOMED CT terms extracted via QuickUMLS and perturbed under DP. This preserves richer clinical semantics than ICD code conditioning, improving downstream utility and semantic fidelity.

### Mechanism 3: Parallel Composition
Separate DP mechanisms for terms (TERMGEN) and notes (NOTEGEN) enable granular privacy control without compounding privacy loss. By parallel composition, overall privacy is (max(εn, εt), max(δn, δt)) rather than the sum, allowing independent tuning of term vs. note privacy.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Differential Privacy (ε, δ)-DP**
Why needed: Term2Note's entire value proposition rests on formal privacy guarantees. You must understand how ε bounds information leakage and how composition affects overall privacy.
Quick check: If you run TERMGEN with εt=5 and NOTEGEN with εn=8 on the same patient's data sequentially, what is the total privacy loss? (Answer: not max—this would be sequential composition; Term2Note uses parallel composition because they operate on disjoint data splits.)

**Concept: SNOMED CT / UMLS Clinical Terminology**
Why needed: TERMEXT extracts SNOMED CT concepts; understanding the hierarchy and coverage helps diagnose term extraction failures.
Quick check: Why might QuickUMLS fail to extract terms from a medication section containing brand-name drugs not in UMLS? (Answer: UMLS coverage gaps; brand names may not map to SNOMED CT concepts.)

**Concept: Conditional Autoregressive Generation**
Why needed: NOTEGEN generates sections conditionally on prior context and term lists; understanding teacher forcing vs. free generation helps debug coherence issues.
Quick check: What happens to section coherence if you generate section 4 without conditioning on sections 1-3? (Answer: Loss of narrative continuity; potential contradictions in patient history or treatment plan.)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** SECSPLIT (regex-based) → TERMEXT (QuickUMLS) → EMB (MedEmbed-large) → [DPRP* if εt<∞] → TERMGEN (GPT-2-Large) → synthetic terms → NOTEGEN (Llama-3.2-1B or Gemma-3-1B) → concatenate sections → Quality Maximiser (Asclepius-Llama3-8B) → final synthetic note

**Critical path:** Raw note → SECSPLIT → TERMEXT → EMB → [DPRP* if εt<∞] → TERMGEN → synthetic terms → NOTEGEN (per section, autoregressive) → concatenate sections → Quality Maximiser → final synthetic note

**Design tradeoffs:**
- εt vs. εn allocation: Lower εt improves term privacy but reduces semantic coherence (cosine similarity drops from 0.82 to 0.61); lower εn degrades fluency and factual consistency
- k candidates for quality maximiser: Higher k improves selection but increases inference cost linearly (paper uses k=4 for Term2Note, k=7 for AUG-PE)
- Section granularity: More sections = finer-grained DP but higher coordination burden; paper's 6-section taxonomy balances structure and tractability

**Failure signatures:**
- Section omission/truncation: NOTEGEN generates incomplete sections—check logit bias on EOS token; adjust frequency/repetition penalty
- Term hallucination: Synthetic terms diverge from clinical reality—verify TERMGEN training on Dpublic; check DPRP* noise scale σemb
- Incoherent narrative: Sections contradict each other—inspect conditioning on prior sections; may need stronger context window or explicit consistency prompts
- DP utility collapse: F1/AUC drop sharply at ε<5—reduce noise via larger batch sizes or more gradient accumulation; consider pretraining on public clinical corpora

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Reproduce fidelity metrics on Dtest with ε=8, εt=∞: Verify KL divergence ≤0.4 for length, Jaccard ≥0.38 for unary terms. If failed, check SECSPLIT regex against your note format.
2. Ablate DPRP*: Compare term cosine similarity with εt=∞ (should be ~0.82) vs. εt=8 (should be ~0.61). Confirm synthetic terms remain clinically plausible via manual review.
3. Downstream utility sanity check: Train Clinical-Longformer on synthetic notes (ε=5), evaluate on Dtest-test. Target micro F1 ≥48. If below, increase NOTEGEN training epochs or reduce DP noise via larger physical batch size.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1: Clinical Fact Consistency**
Can Term2Note be extended to ensure clinical fact consistency and reduce internal contradictions in generated notes? The current framework focuses on structural, syntactic, and semantic fidelity but does not explicitly model or enforce consistency of clinical facts across sections. An enhanced version with explicit consistency-checking module could be evaluated on clinical fact consistency benchmarks.

**Open Question 2: Stronger Privacy Attacks**
How robust is Term2Note's privacy guarantee under stronger adversarial attacks, such as canary-based membership inference? Current empirical evaluation relies on distance-based MIA; canary-based attacks provide a more rigorous worst-case privacy lower bound that remains untested.

**Open Question 3: Multiple Reference-free Metrics**
Can combining multiple reference-free quality metrics improve the DP quality maximiser beyond perplexity alone? Perplexity is a proxy for fluency but may not capture all aspects of clinical note quality; combining diverse RF metrics could yield better selection than perplexity alone.

## Limitations

- Privacy parameter calibration uncertainty: The exact sensitivity calculation for the privacy accountant is not detailed, leaving uncertainty about whether claimed (ε,δ)-DP guarantees are conservative or potentially under-approximate actual privacy loss.
- Generalization to other clinical note formats: The regex-based section detection may fail on clinical notes with different structures (progress notes, radiology reports) beyond discharge summaries.
- Term extraction robustness: QuickUMLS performance depends heavily on UMLS coverage, with no addressing of scenarios containing rare conditions, novel drug combinations, or terminology outside SNOMED CT/UMLS coverage.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Section-wise generation improves structural fidelity (KL divergence evidence is robust); NOTEGEN outperforms AUG-PE and FastDP baselines (direct experimental comparison); human evaluation shows Term2Note preference >52% (statistically significant at p<0.05).
- **Medium Confidence:** Semantic fidelity via MAUVE and clinical term overlap (Jaccard scores depend on QuickUMLS extraction quality, which is not independently validated); downstream utility on ICD coding (performance depends on Clinical-Longformer model quality and task definition).
- **Low Confidence:** Absolute privacy guarantees (sensitivity and composition proofs are summarized but not fully detailed); TERMGEN term reconstruction quality under varying εt (only tested at εt=8, not the full range).

## Next Checks

1. Test SECSPLIT on non-discharge note formats - Apply Term2Note to radiology reports and progress notes from MIMIC-IV to verify section detection robustness across clinical note types.
2. Measure QuickUMLS recall on rare clinical concepts - Create a gold standard of rare disease and medication mentions not in UMLS, then measure extraction accuracy to quantify the term generation failure mode.
3. Validate DP-SGD privacy accountant - Replicate the sensitivity calculation and privacy amplification analysis independently, verifying that the reported (ε,δ) values account for subsampling and parallel composition correctly.
