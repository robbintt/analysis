# An Analysis of Layer-Freezing Strategies for Enhanced Transfer Learning in YOLO Architectures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05490
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Moderate freezing strategies reduce GPU memory usage by up to 28% while maintaining or improving mAP@50 scores

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates layer-freezing strategies in YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures for resource-constrained object detection. The research addresses a critical gap in understanding how different freezing configurations impact performance, efficiency, and training dynamics across diverse datasets. Through experiments on four infrastructure-monitoring datasets with varying characteristics, the study demonstrates that moderate freezing strategies achieve optimal balance between computational efficiency and detection accuracy, with GPU memory savings up to 28% compared to full fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The research employs freezing varying numbers of backbone blocks (4, 9, or 22/23) during transfer learning from COCO-pretrained models, compared against fine-tuning and training from scratch. Experiments use four infrastructure-monitoring datasets with different characteristics including extreme class imbalance and small object detection challenges. The methodology involves disabling all data augmentations, using SGD optimizer with specific hyperparameters (momentum 0.937, weight decay 5e-4), 1000 epochs maximum with early stopping, batch size 16, and linear learning rate decay from 0.01 to 0.0001. Training is conducted on NVIDIA RTX A4000 16GB GPU with PyTorch 2.0.1 and CUDA 12.6.

## Key Results
- Moderate freezing strategies (FR1: 4 blocks; FR2: 9 blocks) achieve optimal balance, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 28% while maintaining or improving mAP@50 scores
- Optimal freezing strategies depend on dataset properties—full fine-tuning works best for heavily augmented single-class detection, while backbone freezing excels for multi-class scenarios with common objects
- Gradient analysis reveals distinct convergence patterns for different freezing approaches, validating effectiveness of moderate freezing strategies
- FR3 (aggressive freezing) fails on heavily augmented datasets due to capacity collapse, while succeeding on standard infrastructure datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Moderate layer freezing preserves general-purpose visual features while allowing adaptation to domain-specific characteristics
- **Mechanism:** Early network blocks (0-3) and backbone capture domain-agnostic features (edges, textures). Freezing these layers acts as a strong prior, preventing overwriting of robust COCO-pretrained features with noise from smaller datasets. This constrains optimization space to Neck and Head layers
- **Core assumption:** Source domain (COCO) shares fundamental visual similarities with target domain
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "freezing the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features," Section 3.1 describes blocks 0-3 capturing fundamental visual representations
- **Break condition:** Target domains with specialized textures or sensor modalities fundamentally different from COCO may prevent necessary low-level adaptation

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Freezing layers stabilizes training dynamics by reducing gradient variance and concentrating optimization pressure on task-specific layers
- **Mechanism:** Reducing trainable parameters decreases loss landscape complexity. Moderate freezing results in lower coefficients of variation in gradient norms compared to training from scratch, suggesting more direct convergence path
- **Core assumption:** Pre-trained weights provide initialization point close enough to optimal solution for target task
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "gradient analysis corroborates these findings," Section 6.2 shows From Scratch has ~87-99% Coefficient of Variation while Fine-tuning and moderate freezing drop to ~16-35%
- **Break condition:** Excessive freezing creates bottleneck where remaining trainable layers have insufficient capacity to minimize loss

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Freezing layers reduces GPU memory consumption by eliminating need to store intermediate activations for frozen layers during backpropagation
- **Mechanism:** During backpropagation, activations must be stored to compute gradients. If layer is frozen, gradients are not computed, and its activations do not need to be retained for weight updates
- **Core assumption:** Memory consumption driven primarily by activation storage for gradient computation
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "reduce GPU memory consumption by up to 28% compared to full fine-tuning," Section 6.1 shows consistent lower GPU usage for higher block freezes
- **Break condition:** Efficiency gain diminishes if bottleneck is input data pipeline or Head is disproportionately large relative to frozen backbone

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Hierarchical Feature Learning in CNNs**
  - **Why needed here:** Strategy relies on premise that early layers extract generic features while later layers combine into specific objects. Understanding helps diagnose why freezing backbone works for common objects but fails for fine-grained texture tasks
  - **Quick check question:** If target dataset consists of abstract art or medical X-rays, would freezing first 4 blocks of COCO-pretrained model likely help or hurt performance?

- **Concept: Gradient Flow and L2 Norm**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper uses L2 norm evolution to validate training stability. "Healthy" training shows initial spike followed by stabilization. Understanding allows monitoring if freezing strategy is starving network of learning capacity
  - **Quick check question:** During training, you observe gradient L2 norm rapidly drops to near zero and stays there. What does this imply about model's capacity or learning rate?

- **Concept: The "Domain Shift" Problem**
  - **Why needed here:** Effectiveness of freezing directly correlated with "distance" between source dataset (COCO) and target dataset. Bird's Nest failure highlights how heavy augmentation or texture-specific tasks can break transfer learning assumptions
  - **Quick check question:** Why did aggressive FR3 strategy fail on Bird's Nest dataset (augmented) but succeed on InsPLAD (standard infrastructure)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Image -> Backbone (Extract features) -> Neck (Fuse multi-scale features) -> Head (Predict BBox + Class)
- **Critical path:** Freezing interrupts gradient flow back to frozen layers, requiring unfrozen layers to compensate for any feature mismatch
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - FR1 (4 blocks): Best for "High Shift" scenarios. Minimal memory savings, maximum adaptability. Useful when target domain is small but distinct
  - FR2 (9 blocks/Backbone): Best for "Low Shift/Efficiency" scenarios. High memory savings, robust for common objects. Default recommended starting point
  - FR3 (22+ blocks): Best for "Extreme Resource Constraints." Risk of "capacity collapse" on complex tasks
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Capacity Collapse: mAP@50 drops to near zero while training loss decreases normally
  - Gradient Starvation: Gradient L2 norm ratio (Frozen/Fine-tuned) drops below 0.6 early in training
  - Forgetting: mAP drops significantly if critical low-level features were in frozen layers and are incompatible with new task
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Establish Baseline: Run full Fine-Tuning (no freezing) to determine upper bound of accuracy
  2. Test Robustness: Run FR2 (Backbone freeze). If mAP drops < 2%, accept as standard operating procedure to gain ~30% efficiency
  3. Stress Test Capacity: Run FR3 (Aggressive freeze) on small subset of data. If accuracy crashes, identified "capacity floor" for dataset complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can adaptive freezing algorithms that dynamically adjust frozen parameters based on real-time training dynamics outperform static configurations analyzed in this study?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors state future research should develop "adaptive freezing algorithms that dynamically adjust frozen parameters based on training dynamics," whereas this work tested only static schedules
- **Why unresolved:** Study limited scope to pre-defined static freezing regions (FR1-FR3) fixed throughout training process
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative benchmarks showing dynamic strategies yield higher mAP or faster convergence than static FR2 backbone freeze

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do reported GPU memory savings and performance trade-offs persist when deployed on embedded edge platforms (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) rather than desktop GPUs?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Discussion identifies "absence of edge device validation" as limitation restricting applicability to real-world UAV deployments
- **Why unresolved:** All experimental validation conducted on NVIDIA RTX A4000, which differs significantly in architecture and power constraints from edge inference hardware
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Inference latency and energy consumption metrics from frozen YOLO models running on embedded hardware during field operations

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can layer freezing be effectively combined with quantization or pruning to further optimize models for resource-constrained environments without severe accuracy loss?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Conclusion suggests exploring "hybrid optimizations like quantization and pruning" to build upon efficiency gains demonstrated by freezing alone
- **Why unresolved:** Study isolated layer freezing as sole optimization technique and did not investigate interactions with model compression methods
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments applying INT8 quantization to frozen models, analyzing additive or multiplicative effects on memory reduction and mAP

## Limitations
- Generalizability of freezing strategies beyond infrastructure monitoring remains untested across domains with extreme domain shift
- Gradient analysis relies on batch-averaged L2 norms that may mask layer-specific convergence issues
- Paper's assertion that FR3 failure stems solely from aggressive augmentation oversimplifies interaction between dataset size, augmentation intensity, and model capacity

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Moderate freezing strategies (FR1/FR2) consistently reduce GPU memory by 20-28% while maintaining or improving mAP scores across multiple datasets and architectures
- **Medium confidence:** Claim that freezing preserves general-purpose features while enabling domain adaptation assumes visual similarity between COCO and target domains
- **Low confidence:** Paper's assertion that FR3 failure on Bird's Nest stems solely from aggressive augmentation oversimplifies interaction between dataset size, augmentation intensity, and model capacity

## Next Checks
1. Test FR1/FR2 strategies on dataset with minimal visual overlap to COCO (medical X-rays or synthetic data) to validate domain-shift hypothesis
2. Implement layer-specific gradient monitoring to identify which frozen blocks contribute most to capacity collapse in FR3 scenarios
3. Compare freezing strategies against other efficiency techniques (quantization, pruning) on identical hardware to establish relative performance trade-offs
