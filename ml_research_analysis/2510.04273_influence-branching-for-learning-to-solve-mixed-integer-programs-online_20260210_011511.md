# Influence branching for learning to solve mixed-integer programs online

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04273
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04273
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Influence branching achieves average speedups between -0.02 and -0.06 over SCIP baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces influence branching, a graph-based variable selection heuristic for solving mixed-integer programs (MIPs) online. The method uses influence graphs to identify the most influential variables for branching during early iterations of the branch-and-bound algorithm. Influence branching is optimized online using Thompson sampling to rank graph representations of MIP structure based on computational speedup. The approach demonstrates results comparable to state-of-the-art online learning methods while maintaining strong generalization capabilities across different instance types.

## Method Summary
The influence branching method constructs influence graphs to represent MIP structure, where nodes correspond to variables and edges capture dependencies between them. During the branch-and-bound process, the algorithm identifies the most influential variables near the root node by analyzing these graphs. Thompson sampling is employed to optimize the ranking of different graph representations online, selecting the configuration that maximizes computational speedup relative to the SCIP baseline. The method is designed to adapt to variations in constraint matrices, constraint vectors, and objective coefficients, enabling effective performance across diverse instance series.

## Key Results
- Average speedups range from -0.02 to -0.06 across various public instance series
- Convergence scores reach at least 60% across all tested series, indicating performance superior to random selection
- The method generalizes well to more general online frameworks with variations in problem structure
- Results are comparable to state-of-the-art online learning methods for MIP solving

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Influence branching leverages the inherent structure of MIP instances by constructing influence graphs that capture variable dependencies. By focusing branching decisions on the most influential variables near the root node, the method aims to reduce the search space more effectively than random selection. The online learning component using Thompson sampling allows the algorithm to adapt to different instance characteristics and optimize the graph representation selection process dynamically during solving.

## Foundational Learning

- Branch-and-bound algorithm: Why needed - core solving framework; Quick check - understanding tree search mechanics
- Thompson sampling for bandits: Why needed - online optimization mechanism; Quick check - grasping exploration-exploitation tradeoff
- Graph theory and influence metrics: Why needed - basis for variable selection; Quick check - computing node centrality measures
- SCIP optimization suite: Why needed - baseline solver and API; Quick check - familiarity with SCIP's callback system

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: MIP instance -> Influence graph construction -> Thompson sampling ranking -> Variable selection -> Branch-and-bound

Critical path: The method constructs influence graphs from the MIP instance, uses Thompson sampling to rank graph representations based on historical performance, selects the highest-ranked representation, identifies influential variables from that representation, and uses these variables for branching decisions in the branch-and-bound tree.

Design tradeoffs: The approach trades computational overhead from influence graph construction and Thompson sampling updates against potential speedup gains from better variable selection. The online learning framework requires maintaining statistics across instances but enables adaptation to different problem characteristics.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may manifest as convergence scores below 50%, indicating the method performs worse than random selection. Excessive computational overhead relative to speedup gains suggests the influence graph construction or Thompson sampling updates are too costly for the instance class.

First experiments:
1. Implement influence graph construction on small MIPs and verify influence metrics align with intuition
2. Test Thompson sampling ranking on a fixed set of graph representations to validate the bandit algorithm
3. Compare variable selection quality against SCIP's default branching rules on benchmark instances

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reported speedups are modest, ranging only from -0.02 to -0.06
- Performance falls short of oracle benchmarks despite reaching 60% convergence scores
- Computational overhead from graph construction and Thompson sampling may offset gains on smaller instances
- Limited evaluation on real-world industrial MIP instances beyond benchmark sets

## Confidence
- High confidence: General methodology description and experimental setup
- Medium confidence: Computational results and convergence analysis
- Low confidence: Claims about practical significance and real-world applicability

## Next Checks
1. Test influence branching on larger, real-world MIP instances from industrial applications to assess practical impact beyond benchmark sets
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of Thompson sampling versus other bandit algorithms in the online learning framework
3. Evaluate the computational overhead introduced by influence graph construction and Thompson sampling updates relative to the achieved speedup gains
