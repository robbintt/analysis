# FAQNAS: FLOPs-aware Hybrid Quantum Neural Architecture Search using Genetic Algorithm

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10062
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10062
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: FLOPs-aware HQNN design achieves competitive accuracy with reduced computational cost on benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search framework for designing efficient hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs). The method formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and computational cost, explicitly incorporating FLOPs into the search objective using a genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed, revealing Pareto-optimal solutions where high accuracy can be sustained at low or moderate FLOPs.

## Method Summary
FAQNAS frames HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing classification accuracy against total FLOPs (classical + quantum). The search space encodes the quantum circuit's architecture, including gate types and connectivity patterns, while the classical component is fixed to a single dense layer whose size scales with the number of qubits. FLOPs are defined as the computational cost of simulating the quantum layer on classical hardware, making the metric hardware-agnostic. NSGA-II evolves populations of candidate HQNNs, selecting for Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy and FLOPs. The quantum component's FLOP count correlates strongly with accuracy gains, while classical FLOPs remain essentially constant across the search space, creating a clear path for reducing overall computational cost by simplifying quantum circuits without sacrificing performance.

## Key Results
- Quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed across the search space
- Pareto-optimal solutions show high accuracy can be sustained at low or moderate FLOPs
- FLOPs-aware search produces competitive accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FAQNAS works by explicitly quantifying and optimizing the computational cost of quantum circuit simulation during architecture search. By incorporating FLOPs as a primary objective alongside accuracy, the framework prevents over-provisioned designs that would perform well but at prohibitive computational expense. The genetic algorithm efficiently explores the trade-off space, discovering architectures where quantum circuit complexity can be reduced without sacrificing accuracy. This FLOPs-awareness creates a practical design principle for NISQ-era quantum-classical computing where simulator-based exploration must balance performance against computational feasibility.

## Foundational Learning

### Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing
- Why needed: Understanding the fundamental model where quantum circuits process features and classical layers perform final classification
- Quick check: Verify that the quantum layer implements a parameterized quantum circuit and the classical layer is a standard dense network

### Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
- Why needed: The methodology applies evolutionary algorithms to automatically discover optimal network architectures rather than manual design
- Quick check: Confirm NSGA-II is being used for multi-objective optimization across accuracy and FLOPs

### Quantum FLOPs
- Why needed: The paper defines FLOPs specifically as the classical computational cost of simulating quantum circuits, not as operations on actual quantum hardware
- Quick check: Understand that lower simulator FLOPs generally correspond to smaller, shallower quantum circuits

### Multi-objective Optimization
- Why needed: The framework must balance competing objectives (accuracy vs computational cost) rather than optimizing for a single metric
- Quick check: Verify Pareto optimality is being used to identify solutions that cannot be improved in one objective without worsening another

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Quantum Circuit -> Classical Dense Layer -> Classification Output

### Critical Path
Quantum circuit parameterization and depth directly determine the FLOPs and accuracy, making this the critical path for optimization.

### Design Tradeoffs
- Quantum circuit complexity vs. accuracy: More complex circuits generally yield higher accuracy but at increased computational cost
- Classical layer size vs. expressivity: Fixed classical layer scales with qubits, limiting flexibility but simplifying search

### Failure Signatures
- Over-provisioned designs: High FLOPs with minimal accuracy gains
- Under-parameterized circuits: Low FLOPs but significantly reduced accuracy

### First Experiments to Run
1. Replicate the MNIST experiments to verify the FLOPs-accuracy trade-off curves
2. Compare Pareto fronts between FLOPs-aware and FLOPs-agnostic search strategies
3. Test transferability of discovered architectures across different dataset types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the minimization of simulator-derived quantum FLOPs correlate with reduced execution time and noise resilience on real quantum hardware?
- Basis in paper: The paper defines "Quantum FLOPs" strictly as the computational cost of simulating the quantum layer on classical hardware, while claiming this metric serves as a "hardware-agnostic efficiency metric" for future quantum-classical integration.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation is entirely simulator-based; on real Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, the execution bottleneck involves decoherence times and quantum volume, which are not captured by classical FLOP counts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Deployment of the Pareto-optimal architectures discovered by FAQNAS onto physical QPUs to measure the correlation between low simulator FLOPs and actual hardware latency/fidelity.

### Open Question 2
How does the FLOPs-accuracy trade-off evolve when the classical architecture is variable rather than fixed to a single layer?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that "classical FLOPs remain largely fixed," which is a direct result of the methodological choice to use a single classical hidden layer scaling only with the number of qubits.
- Why unresolved: Restricting the search to the quantum components prevents the framework from discovering if a deeper classical pre-processor could achieve the same accuracy with a significantly cheaper (lower FLOP) quantum circuit.
- What evidence would resolve it: Expanding the genetic algorithm's search space to include classical depth and layer types as genes, observing if the Pareto front shifts toward hybrid models with more complex classical and simpler quantum components.

### Open Question 3
Do the dataset-specific FLOPs saturation points identified in this study generalize to high-dimensional, real-world data?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge in Footnote 1 that "The use of larger datasets is generally infeasible due to the prohibitive computational overhead associated with simulating quantum circuits," limiting the study to relatively small benchmarks like MNIST and Iris.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the finding that "quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements" holds true for complex, high-dimensional data (e.g., medical imaging or text) where classical feature extraction might be the primary bottleneck.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying FAQNAS to a complex dataset using a more powerful computing cluster or approximation techniques to determine if the relationship between quantum FLOPs and accuracy follows the same plateau pattern.

## Limitations
- Study limited to small benchmark datasets due to computational overhead of quantum circuit simulation
- Results based entirely on simulator-based evaluation, not validated on real quantum hardware
- Fixed classical architecture prevents exploration of potentially more efficient hybrid designs

## Confidence
- High: Effectiveness of FLOPs-awareness in balancing accuracy and computational cost for tested datasets
- Medium: Generalizability to larger-scale problems or real quantum hardware

## Next Checks
1. Test the FLOPs-aware HQNN design on larger, more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 or ImageNet) to evaluate scalability and robustness.
2. Conduct experiments on real quantum hardware to assess the impact of noise and decoherence on the proposed approach.
3. Compare the performance of FAQNAS with other multi-objective optimization techniques (e.g., Bayesian optimization or reinforcement learning) to validate the choice of NSGA-II.
