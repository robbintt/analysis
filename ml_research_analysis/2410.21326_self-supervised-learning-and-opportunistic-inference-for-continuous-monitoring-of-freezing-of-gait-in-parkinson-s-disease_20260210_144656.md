# Self-Supervised Learning and Opportunistic Inference for Continuous Monitoring of Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.21326
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21326
- Reference count: 40
- 7.25% higher precision and 4.4% better accuracy than supervised models using only 40% labeled data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LIFT-PD, a self-supervised learning framework for detecting freezing of gait (FoG) in Parkinson's disease patients using a single waist-worn accelerometer. The method employs masked signal reconstruction for pre-training on unlabeled data, followed by fine-tuning with a novel Differential Hopping Windowing Technique (DHWT) to handle data imbalance and gait variability. An opportunistic inference module reduces power consumption by activating the model only during active movement. Experiments show LIFT-PD achieves 7.25% higher precision and 4.4% better accuracy than supervised models while using only 40% of the labeled training data. The system also reduces inference time by up to 67%, enabling practical, long-term in-home monitoring.

## Method Summary
LIFT-PD uses a two-phase self-supervised learning approach: pre-training with masked signal reconstruction and fine-tuning with a novel Differential Hopping Windowing Technique (DHWT). The system processes 3-second accelerometer windows at 40Hz, employing a 5-layer 1D CNN encoder with 20% masking for pre-training. DHWT applies 75% overlap for FoG windows and 50% for non-FoG to address class imbalance. An opportunistic inference module with Model Activation Module (MAM) activates the model only when movement exceeds a threshold, reducing power consumption by 67%. The system is evaluated using Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation on the tDCS FoG dataset containing 40 PD patients with 1,132 FoG episodes.

## Key Results
- 7.25% higher precision and 4.4% better accuracy than supervised models
- 40% reduction in labeled training data requirement
- 67% reduction in inference time through opportunistic activation
- Precision: 89.06%, Accuracy: 90.6%, AUC: 0.96, F1-score: 0.89

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages self-supervised pre-training to extract robust gait patterns from unlabeled data, addressing the challenge of limited labeled FoG episodes. DHWT balances the class distribution by applying different overlap strategies for FoG and non-FoG windows. The opportunistic inference module significantly reduces computational load by only activating during active movement, making continuous monitoring feasible on resource-constrained devices. The combination of these techniques allows LIFT-PD to achieve superior performance with substantially less labeled data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Self-supervised learning**: Pre-trains models on unlabeled data to learn general patterns before fine-tuning on labeled data. Why needed: Reduces dependency on scarce labeled FoG data. Quick check: Compare performance with and without pre-training.
- **Differential Hopping Windowing**: Applies varying overlap percentages for different classes to balance dataset. Why needed: Addresses severe class imbalance in FoG detection. Quick check: Verify FoG:non-FoG ratio approaches 55:45 after segmentation.
- **Model Activation Module (MAM)**: Threshold-based mechanism that activates inference only during significant movement. Why needed: Reduces power consumption for continuous monitoring. Quick check: Measure inference time reduction across different thresholds.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Accelerometer Data -> Pre-processing (Resample, DHWT) -> Masked Reconstruction Pre-training -> Fine-tuning (LOGO CV) -> MAM-based Opportunistic Inference

Critical Path: Data acquisition → DHWT segmentation → Self-supervised pre-training → Fine-tuning → Opportunistic inference

Design Tradeoffs: Fixed 3s window provides context but may miss short episodes; 20% masking balances reconstruction difficulty; 40% labeled data reduces annotation burden but may limit performance.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance on short episodes (<6s); false positives during tremors/dyskinesia; MAM threshold too low causing constant activation; threshold too high missing subtle FoG events.

Three First Experiments:
1. Test MAM threshold sensitivity (0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2g) to verify the 67% inference time reduction claim
2. Compare DHWT with uniform windowing to quantify class imbalance handling
3. Evaluate short episode detection (<6s) with adaptive windowing vs fixed 3s window

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the presence of confounding motor symptoms, such as resting tremors, dyskinesia, or bradykinesia, impact the specificity and false positive rate of LIFT-PD?
- Can a dataset-agnostic calibration technique be developed to replace the current dataset-specific threshold optimization for the Opportunistic Inference Module?
- To what extent does adaptive windowing (e.g., 2.5s) or boundary-aware smoothing improve detection rates for short FoG episodes (<6s) compared to the fixed 3-second window?

## Limitations
- Performance in the presence of confounding motor symptoms (tremors, dyskinesia) not evaluated
- Dataset-specific threshold optimization may not generalize across varying conditions
- Short FoG episodes (<6s) have lower detection rates due to window boundary issues

## Confidence
- High Confidence: SSL methodology and overall performance improvements over supervised models
- Medium Confidence: Opportunistic inference power savings claim due to unknown MAM threshold
- Low Confidence: Absolute numerical results without access to exact dataset splits

## Next Checks
1. Test multiple MAM threshold values (0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2g) and report which achieves the stated 67% inference time reduction
2. Verify class balance after applying DHWT by checking the FoG:non-FoG ratio across all groups in LOGO CV
3. Replicate the SSL pre-training + fine-tuning pipeline with 40% labeled data and compare precision/accuracy against supervised baseline
