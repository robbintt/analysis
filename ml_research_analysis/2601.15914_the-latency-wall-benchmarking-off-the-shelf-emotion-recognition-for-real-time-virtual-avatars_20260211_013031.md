# The Latency Wall: Benchmarking Off-the-Shelf Emotion Recognition for Real-Time Virtual Avatars

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.15914
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15914
- Authors: Yarin Benyamin
- Reference count: 3
- One-line primary result: No off-the-shelf emotion recognition model combination meets both sub-140ms latency and adequate accuracy requirements for real-time virtual avatars.

## Executive Summary
This study benchmarks off-the-shelf computer vision models for real-time emotion recognition on virtual avatars, targeting accessibility for autism therapy. A two-stage pipeline (face detection + emotion classification) was evaluated on CPU-only hardware against a 140 ms latency budget. While face detection on stylized avatars was robust (100% accuracy), emotion classification failed to meet real-time constraints: even the fastest configuration exceeded the latency budget by 1.9×, and classification accuracy remained below random chance (<23%). General-purpose Vision Transformers proved too slow and ineffective on virtual characters. YOLOv11n was optimal for detection, but no model combination satisfied both latency and accuracy requirements. The findings highlight a "Latency Wall" and the need for lightweight, domain-specific architectures to enable accessible, real-time emotion recognition in therapeutic VR settings.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated a two-stage pipeline: face detection followed by emotion classification. Detection used YOLOv8/v11/v12 (Medium and Nano) and MTCNN; classification used CLIP (ViT-B/16, ViT-L/14), SigLIP2 (Base, So400m), and ViT-FER (trpakov/vit-face-expression). All models ran in zero-shot/pre-trained mode on CPU-only hardware (Intel i7-1265U, 32GB RAM). The UIBVFED dataset provided stylized virtual avatar faces; FER-2013 served as a control for human faces. Seven emotion classes were evaluated: ["ANGER", "DISGUST", "FEAR", "JOY", "NEUTRAL", "SADNESS", "SURPRISE"]. The 140ms latency budget derived from scaling neurotypical VR thresholds for autism therapy applications.

## Key Results
- Detection accuracy on stylized avatars: 100% across all YOLO variants
- Fastest pipeline (YOLOv11n + ViT-FER): 247ms total latency, 1.9× over budget
- Classification accuracy on avatars: <23% (below random chance), with SigLIP achieving only 4.24%
- ViT-FER accuracy: 27.42% on avatars vs 63.64% on human faces, confirming domain gap

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: A two-stage modular pipeline (face detection → emotion classification) enables localized, identity-preserving emotion inference on individual faces within multi-face scenes.
- **Mechanism**: Stage 1 (YOLO) produces bounding boxes for all faces; Stage 2 (ViT/CLIP) classifies emotions on cropped regions. Decoupling allows independent optimization of detection speed vs. classification accuracy.
- **Core assumption**: Detection and classification have sufficiently different computational profiles that specialized architectures outperform end-to-end solutions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "A two-stage pipeline (face detection + emotion classification) was evaluated"
  - [section 2.2]: "enables localized emotion inference at the individual face level... Rather than relying on end-to-end image-level classification"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct support; Paper 30073 discusses face-tracking emotion recognition in VR but doesn't compare pipeline architectures.
- **Break condition**: If end-to-end models demonstrate lower total latency with comparable accuracy, or if single-face scenes eliminate the need for localization.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: General-purpose Vision Transformers trained on photorealistic human faces exhibit a "domain gap" on stylized virtual avatars, causing accuracy to degrade to near-random levels.
- **Mechanism**: CLIP/SigLIP learn image-text alignments from natural images; ViT-FER learns human facial features from FER-2013. Stylized avatars with exaggerated proportions violate these learned distributions, producing misaligned embeddings.
- **Core assumption**: Stylized avatars share sufficient feature structure with human faces for zero-shot or transfer learning to be viable.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "classification accuracy remained below random chance (<23%)"
  - [section 3.1.2]: "SigLIP (4.24%) performed worse than random chance... ViT-FER... low accuracy confirms a substantial domain gap"
  - [corpus]: Paper 30073 notes "emotional facial expressions are highly individual," supporting generalization challenges, but not specific to stylized domains.
- **Break condition**: If fine-tuning on avatar data closes the gap significantly, or if avatar styles converge toward photorealism.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The 140ms motion-to-photon latency budget derives from scaling neurotypical VR latency thresholds (≈70ms) by the extended temporal binding window observed in autism (2× neurotypical).
- **Mechanism**: Neurotypical binding window ≈300ms; ASD ≈600ms. Neurotypical VR degrades at ≈70ms latency. Proportional scaling yields 70ms × 2 = 140ms threshold.
- **Core assumption**: Perceptual binding window scales linearly with acceptable system latency across populations.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency"
  - [section 1]: "This threshold is not a clinically validated requirement but a conservative engineering heuristic informed by prior work"
  - [corpus]: Paper 72546 addresses on-device latency reduction for emotion recognition but doesn't reference ASD-specific timing constraints.
- **Break condition**: If clinical validation shows different thresholds, or if the proportional scaling assumption proves invalid.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Motion-to-Photon (MTP) Latency
  - **Why needed here**: The entire benchmark is structured against a 140ms budget. Without understanding MTP, you cannot evaluate feasibility.
  - **Quick check question**: Given 54ms detection + 10ms rendering, what maximum classification time meets a 140ms budget? (Answer: 76ms)

- **Concept**: Zero-Shot Classification
  - **Why needed here**: The paper evaluates CLIP/SigLIP without fine-tuning. Understanding why they were selected (and why they failed) requires grasping zero-shot mechanics.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does CLIP classify emotions via cosine similarity between image and text embeddings rather than a dedicated classifier head?

- **Concept**: Domain Shift / Distribution Mismatch
  - **Why needed here**: ViT-FER achieved 63.64% on human faces but only 27.42% on avatars. This gap is the central finding.
  - **Quick check question**: If training and deployment distributions differ significantly, what two strategies can address the gap? (Answer: Fine-tuning on target domain; domain adaptation techniques)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Input Frame → [YOLO Detection: 54-83ms] → Bounding Box → [Crop] → [ViT/CLIP: 150-3000ms] → Emotion Label

- **Critical path**: Classification latency dominates (150-3000ms) vs. detection (54-83ms). Even the fastest config (YOLOv11n + ViT-FER = 247ms) exceeds the 130ms AI budget by 1.9×.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - YOLOv11n vs. YOLOv8n: v11n fastest on avatars (54ms) but collapses on human faces (21.59%); v8n is the "hybrid" choice (80.79% on human, 57ms).
  - Zero-shot vs. fine-tuned: Zero-shot enables rapid deployment but sacrifices domain accuracy.
  - Model scale: Nano variants are 4-8× faster but may miss edge cases.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Latency Wall**: Total AI >130ms (observed minimum: 247ms)
  - **Domain Collapse**: Accuracy <23% on stylized avatars
  - **Resolution Trap**: MTCNN slows to 78ms on high-res inputs
  - **Architecture Instability**: YOLOv11n/v12n accuracy drops 65-80 percentage points from virtual to human faces

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Profile per-stage latency on target CPU to confirm classification is the bottleneck (expected: >70% of budget).
  2. Fine-tune ViT-FER on UIBVFED subset to quantify accuracy recovery from domain adaptation.
  3. Apply INT8 quantization to ViT-FER and measure latency/accuracy trade-off for budget compliance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the 140 ms latency threshold derived from scaling neurotypical temporal binding windows accurately predict therapeutic efficacy for individuals with ASD?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "This threshold is not a clinically validated requirement but a conservative engineering heuristic informed by prior work, not a medical or therapeutic guarantee."
- Why unresolved: The threshold was calculated by doubling neurotypical values based on one study (Foss-Feig et al., 2010) but never empirically validated in VR therapy contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies with ASD participants measuring perceived contingency and therapeutic outcomes at varying latency levels.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can domain-specific fine-tuning of lightweight models achieve both acceptable accuracy and sub-140 ms latency on virtual avatars?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work must prioritize distilling these heavy architectures into lightweight, domain-specific CNNs to bridge the gap between high-fidelity perception and real-time social contingency."
- Why unresolved: All models were evaluated in zero-shot or pre-trained settings; no fine-tuning on stylized avatar data was attempted.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking fine-tuned Nano/CNN architectures on UIBVFED with latency-optimized training objectives.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would quantization or model compression techniques enable Vision Transformers to meet real-time constraints without catastrophic accuracy loss?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Authors recommend "techniques such as knowledge distillation and quantization" in Section 4.2 but did not evaluate any optimization methods.
- Why unresolved: All benchmarks used full-precision CPU inference without testing INT8/FP16 quantization, pruning, or distilled variants.
- What evidence would resolve it: Latency and accuracy benchmarks of quantized ViT-FER or distilled CLIP variants on identical hardware.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Why do newer YOLO architectures (v11n, v12n) catastrophically fail on low-resolution human faces while maintaining 100% accuracy on stylized avatars?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 3 shows YOLOv11n dropping to 21.59% accuracy on FER-2013 while Table 1 shows 100% on UIBVFED; this domain reversal is unexplained.
- Why unresolved: The paper documents the phenomenon but offers no analysis of architectural differences causing this specialization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Layer-wise feature analysis comparing YOLOv8n and YOLOv11n on both domains to identify failure modes.

## Limitations

- Evaluation limited to single CPU platform (Intel i7-1265U), which may not represent therapeutic VR hardware diversity
- Zero-shot approach inherently sacrifices accuracy compared to fine-tuned models for stylized avatars
- 140ms latency threshold lacks clinical validation specific to autism therapy contexts

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The detection accuracy results and latency measurements for face detection are robust, as they rely on direct model outputs and controlled benchmarking.
- **Medium Confidence**: The emotion classification accuracy findings are credible but could vary significantly with fine-tuning or domain adaptation.
- **Low Confidence**: The clinical relevance of the 140ms latency threshold is uncertain without direct validation in ASD therapy contexts.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct fine-tuning experiments on UIBVFED to quantify potential accuracy improvements and assess the domain gap recovery.
2. Benchmark the pipeline on a range of CPU and low-power GPU platforms to evaluate hardware generalization.
3. Perform clinical trials with ASD participants to validate the 140ms latency threshold and its impact on therapy effectiveness.
