# SocialNav-MoE: A Mixture-of-Experts Vision Language Model for Socially Compliant Navigation with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.14757
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14757
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** SocialNav-MoE achieves 0.506 BERTScore-F1 and 1.709 FPS using only 5.74B parameters vs. 175-200B in large model baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficient vision language models for socially compliant robot navigation in human-populated environments. Current large-scale VLMs are computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. The authors propose SocialNav-MoE, a Mixture-of-Experts VLM that incorporates reinforcement fine-tuning with a novel semantic similarity reward function. Experiments on the SNEI dataset demonstrate the model achieves a favorable balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency, outperforming large model baselines in both semantic similarity metrics and inference speed while using significantly fewer parameters.

## Method Summary
SocialNav-MoE employs a three-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning initialized from LLaVA-1.5-58K with Phi-2-2.7B backbone and frozen SigLIP vision encoder, reinforcement fine-tuning with group-based sequential policy optimization and semantic similarity reward using BERTScore-F1, and MoE fine-tuning with 4 experts and top-k=1 routing on alternating FFN layers. The model is trained on the SNEI dataset (325 images, 265 train, 60 test) augmented to 530 samples through non-geometric transformations. The multi-turn conversation format includes perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation turns.

## Key Results
- **Semantic similarity performance:** BERTScore-F1 of 0.506 vs. 0.254-0.387 in large model baselines
- **Inference efficiency:** 1.709 FPS vs. 0.087-0.212 FPS in baselines
- **Parameter efficiency:** 5.74B parameters vs. 175-200B in baseline models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SocialNav-MoE leverages MoE architecture to selectively activate computation only when needed, dramatically reducing inference costs while maintaining accuracy. The reinforcement fine-tuning with semantic similarity reward (SSR) aligns model outputs with human-like navigation decisions by optimizing for BERTScore-F1 rather than just task completion. The three-stage training pipeline allows progressive refinement: SFT establishes basic navigation capabilities, RFT optimizes for social compliance through semantic rewards, and MoE fine-tuning further improves efficiency through expert specialization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Socially compliant navigation:** Robot movement that respects human comfort zones and social norms in shared spaces
  - *Why needed:* Essential for human-robot interaction in real-world environments
  - *Quick check:* Model should maintain appropriate distances from humans and navigate around groups naturally
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):** Architecture where different "experts" handle different input types, with a gating network routing inputs
  - *Why needed:* Enables selective computation to reduce inference costs while maintaining accuracy
  - *Quick check:* Router entropy should be high (multiple experts utilized) and load balancing loss should be small
- **Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT):** Training method that optimizes for reward functions rather than supervised targets
  - *Why needed:* Allows optimization for complex, multi-objective goals like social compliance
  - *Quick check:* Reward distribution should be stable and not saturate at extremes during training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Image -> SigLIP Encoder (frozen) -> MoE Layers -> Phi-2-2.7B Language Backbone -> Output Text

**Critical Path:** Vision encoder → MoE routing → Language model → Text generation for navigation decisions

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- **Expert count vs. data:** 4 experts chosen based on dataset size (530 samples); more experts could improve specialization but require more data
- **Top-k routing:** Top-k=1 minimizes computation but may limit flexibility; top-k=2 was tested but degraded performance
- **Frozen vision encoder:** Reduces training complexity but limits adaptation to navigation-specific visual features

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Low router entropy indicates expert collapse (single expert dominates)
- High load balancing loss suggests uneven expert utilization
- Reward hacking in RFT if SSR saturates at extremes

**First Experiments:** 
1. Verify MoE routing produces high router entropy (>0.8) across experts
2. Confirm RFT training stability with SSR rewards in reasonable range (0.3-0.8)
3. Measure inference FPS on target hardware to verify efficiency claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can SocialNav-MoE maintain its semantic similarity and inference efficiency advantages when deployed on physical robotic platforms in real-world human-populated environments? All experiments were conducted in simulation; real environments introduce sensor noise and dynamic human behavior not present in dataset evaluation.

**Open Question 2:** How can the inherent ambiguity in defining universally valid social navigation norms be systematically addressed for robust model training and evaluation? Social norms are context-dependent and culturally variable, making evaluation inherently subjective when deviations from ground truth may represent equally valid alternative interpretations.

**Open Question 3:** How does SocialNav-MoE generalize to other social navigation datasets and unseen environmental contexts beyond SNEI? The model's performance on different scene types, crowd densities, cultural contexts, and annotation styles remains untested.

**Open Question 4:** What is the optimal expert count and routing strategy configuration for varying data regimes in MoE-based social navigation? The current 530-image training set may be insufficient to support larger expert pools, and whether scaling data enables better utilization of additional experts remains unknown.

## Limitations
- **Dataset size constraint:** Training on only 530 augmented samples raises concerns about generalization and potential overfitting
- **Simulation-only evaluation:** All experiments conducted on the SNEI dataset without real-world robot deployment validation
- **Implementation detail gaps:** Limited specifics on MoE architecture, router initialization, and exact SSR function formulation

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Efficiency gains (5.74B vs. 175-200B parameters) and inference speed improvements (1.709 vs. 0.087-0.212 FPS) are technically plausible given MoE architecture. Three-stage training pipeline is well-established.

**Medium Confidence:** Absolute performance metrics (BERTScore-F1=0.506) are difficult to verify without dataset access. Baseline comparisons are limited by significant architectural differences.

**Low Confidence:** Generalization capability to unseen environments and dynamic human behaviors is unclear due to limited dataset size and urban scenario focus.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Access and Replication:** Obtain SNEI dataset or equivalent to validate multi-turn prompt format and ground-truth annotations. Replicate data augmentation pipeline to expand training set to 530 samples.

2. **MoE Architecture Implementation:** Implement MoE layer substitution on alternating FFN layers with 4 experts and top-k=1 routing. Validate expert load balancing and routing entropy during training to ensure proper utilization.

3. **SSR Function and RFT Stability:** Implement semantic similarity reward (SSR) function using BERTScore-F1 and integrate with GSPO for reinforcement fine-tuning. Monitor reward distribution and training stability, adjusting learning rate and KL penalty coefficient β as needed.
