# Amorphous Fortress Online: Collaboratively Designing Open-Ended Multi-Agent AI and Game Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.05632
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05632
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Web-based platform for collaborative design of multi-agent AI environments with FSM-based agents and community content creation

## Executive Summary
Amorphous Fortress Online is a web-based platform enabling collaborative design of open-ended multi-agent AI environments through finite-state machine agents and community-driven content creation. The system allows users to design entities with FSM behaviors, create fortress layouts, and share their creations with others. During a short post-release study period, the platform received 174 plays and 33 fortress submissions from six authors, with 34.38% of fortresses being remixed from others. The platform aims to support future AI research in reinforcement learning, recommendation systems, and generative models using user-submitted data.

## Method Summary
The platform combines interactive editors for designing entities with FSM behaviors and fortress layouts, a backpack feature for saving and reusing entity definitions, and a play screen with an X-ray feature for visualizing agent behavior. Users can create, share, and remix fortress designs within a community-driven ecosystem. The system supports transparent finite-state machine agents that can be visually inspected during gameplay, enabling educational and research applications in AI behavior understanding.

## Key Results
- Platform received 174 plays and 33 fortress submissions during short study period
- 34.38% of submitted fortresses were remixed from existing designs
- System supports interactive FSM-based agent design with visualization capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The platform leverages collaborative design principles and transparent AI behavior visualization to create an engaging environment for both casual users and AI researchers. By allowing users to create, share, and remix fortress designs, the system builds a growing database of thematically diverse AI environments. The FSM-based agent system provides a balance between simplicity and expressiveness, making it accessible to non-experts while still supporting complex behaviors.

## Foundational Learning
- Finite State Machines: Why needed - Provides intuitive way to design agent behaviors; Quick check - Can users create basic patrol and attack patterns?
- Collaborative Content Creation: Why needed - Builds sustainable ecosystem of user-generated content; Quick check - What percentage of content is user-generated vs. platform-provided?
- Visual Behavior Inspection: Why needed - Enables understanding of AI decision-making; Quick check - Can users predict agent behavior from FSM diagrams?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: User Interface -> FSM Editor -> Fortress Designer -> Play Engine -> Community Repository
Critical Path: Design entity -> Create fortress layout -> Test in play mode -> Share with community
Design Tradeoffs: Simplicity vs. expressiveness in FSM design, real-time visualization vs. performance overhead
Failure Signatures: Performance degradation with large agent populations, user confusion with complex FSMs, low remix rates indicating poor sharing mechanisms
First Experiments:
1. Create simple entity with two-state FSM (patrol/attack) and place in empty fortress
2. Design fortress with 10+ agents and observe emergent behaviors
3. Remix existing fortress and modify agent behaviors to create new variant

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Short study period (approximately 3 days) may not reflect typical usage patterns
- Limited scale with only 174 plays and 33 fortress submissions
- Lack of detailed technical specifications for FSM implementation and scalability

## Confidence
- Platform Implementation: High
- User Engagement Metrics: Medium (limited sample period)
- Technical Scalability: Low (insufficient technical details)
- Community Sustainability: Low (short study duration)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal study over 3-6 months to assess sustained user engagement and content generation patterns
2. Perform stress testing with larger environments containing 100+ agents to evaluate performance limitations
3. Compare user retention and content quality with established platforms like RoboWorld or NetLogo to establish competitive advantages
