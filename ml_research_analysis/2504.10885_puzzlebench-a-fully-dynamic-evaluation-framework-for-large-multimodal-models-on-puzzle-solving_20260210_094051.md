# PuzzleBench: A Fully Dynamic Evaluation Framework for Large Multimodal Models on Puzzle Solving

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.10885
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10885
- Reference count: 40
- Current LMMs struggle with fine-grained visual recognition and image understanding in puzzle-solving tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PuzzleBench, a dynamic evaluation framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that addresses the limitations of static benchmarks through automatically generated puzzle-solving tasks. The framework employs Open-ended Visual Puzzle Generation (OVPG) to continuously refresh datasets using random sampling, puzzle rule design, and visual content generation modules. Built on this foundation, PuzzleBench includes 11,840 VQA samples across six puzzle tasks targeting visual recognition, logical reasoning, and context understanding capabilities. Comprehensive experiments with 14 LMMs reveal significant performance gaps, with the best model achieving only 51.9% average accuracy, highlighting substantial room for improvement in current multimodal systems.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a three-module framework called Open-ended Visual Puzzle Generation (OVPG) that enables fully dynamic evaluation of LMMs. The framework consists of random sampling for task selection, puzzle rule design for generating specific challenges, and visual content generation for creating corresponding images. This dynamic approach produces six distinct puzzle tasks organized into three competency categories: visual recognition (Icon Connect, Hanzi Matrix), logical reasoning (Word Search, Grid Sum), and context understanding (Jigsaw, Difference Hunt). The resulting PuzzleBench contains 11,840 VQA samples that can be continuously refreshed to prevent data contamination while providing comprehensive assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities.

## Key Results
- PuzzleBench comprises 11,840 VQA samples across six puzzle tasks targeting three core LMM competencies
- Current LMMs demonstrate significant limitations in fine-grained visual recognition and image understanding
- Proprietary models like Gemini-2.0-Flash achieve the highest performance at 51.9% average accuracy
- The dynamic framework effectively mitigates data contamination issues through complete dataset regeneration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating an adaptive evaluation system that generates novel puzzle instances on-demand rather than relying on fixed datasets. This approach addresses the fundamental challenge of benchmark staleness and data contamination in LMM evaluation. By using random sampling combined with rule-based puzzle generation and automated visual content creation, the system produces diverse, fresh tasks that test specific multimodal reasoning capabilities while maintaining consistent difficulty calibration. The puzzle format naturally isolates visual recognition, logical reasoning, and context understanding skills, providing granular insights into model limitations that traditional benchmarks may miss.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal reasoning: Understanding how models integrate visual and textual information for problem-solving
  - Why needed: Core capability for LMMs to solve complex real-world tasks
  - Quick check: Can the model identify relationships between visual elements and textual clues?

- Visual puzzle generation: Automated creation of structured visual challenges with consistent rules
  - Why needed: Enables scalable, dynamic evaluation without manual annotation
  - Quick check: Are generated puzzles solvable by humans and follow logical patterns?

- Dynamic benchmarking: Continuous dataset refreshment to prevent data contamination
  - Why needed: Ensures fair evaluation of model capabilities without memorization effects
  - Quick check: Does performance vary significantly across different puzzle generations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Random Sampling -> Puzzle Rule Design -> Visual Content Generation -> VQA Sample Output

**Critical Path**: The evaluation pipeline follows: task selection (random sampling) → puzzle rule instantiation (rule design) → image generation (visual content) → question-answer pair creation (VQA output)

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Complete dynamism vs. consistent difficulty calibration
- Automated generation vs. human-curated quality control
- Broad task coverage vs. deep specialization in specific reasoning types

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Inconsistent puzzle difficulty across generations
- Visual artifacts that make puzzles unsolvable
- Ambiguous questions that don't align with visual content

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test puzzle solvability by human evaluators on randomly generated samples
2. Measure variability in task difficulty across multiple generation runs
3. Validate visual quality and clarity of generated puzzle images

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalization of puzzle-based task results to broader multimodal reasoning capabilities remains unclear
- Framework's random sampling may introduce variability in task difficulty across generations
- Lack of detailed analysis on which specific visual features or reasoning patterns are most challenging for models

## Confidence
- Major claims about LMM limitations: Medium
- Framework's effectiveness in preventing data contamination: Medium
- Understanding of specific reasoning deficiencies: Medium
- Overall methodology soundness: High

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-rater reliability studies on task difficulty calibration to ensure consistent evaluation standards across different puzzle generations
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the contribution of visual versus reasoning components to model performance
3. Test model performance on a held-out set of manually curated puzzles to validate that the observed limitations are not artifacts of the generation process
