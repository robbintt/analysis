# GenAI in Entrepreneurship: a systematic review of generative artificial intelligence in entrepreneurship research: current issues and future directions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.05523
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05523
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Systematic review of 83 peer-reviewed articles identifies five thematic clusters showing how GenAI enhances entrepreneurial cognition, education, innovation, and decision-making while raising ethical concerns around data privacy, bias, and transparency.

## Executive Summary
This systematic literature review analyzes 83 peer-reviewed articles to explore how generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) are reshaping entrepreneurship. Using TF-IDF vectorization, PCA, and hierarchical clustering, the study identifies five thematic clusters: Digital Transformation & Behavioral Models, GenAI-Enhanced Education & Learning Systems, Sustainable Innovation & Strategic AI Impact, Business Models & Market Trends, and Data-Driven Technological Trends in Entrepreneurship. The review reveals that GenAI functions as an external enabler that lowers structural barriers to entrepreneurship while enhancing opportunity recognition and decision-making capabilities. However, significant ethical concerns around data privacy, bias, and transparency persist, requiring careful regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with protection.

## Method Summary
The study systematically searched Web of Science and Scopus databases using combinations of entrepreneurship-related terms (entrepreneur*, startup, start-up) with GenAI terms (GPT, ChatGPT, LLM, BERT, DALL-E, etc.) across Business, Management, Economics, and Decision Sciences subject areas. After screening for English-language peer-reviewed articles and reviews through March 06, 2025, 83 articles were selected. Text analysis employed TF-IDF vectorization on keyword lists, followed by PCA for dimensionality reduction, and hierarchical clustering to identify five thematic clusters. The methodology prioritizes visual interpretability through dendrogram visualization, though specific hyperparameters remain unspecified.

## Key Results
- GenAI reduces structural barriers to entrepreneurship by lowering startup costs and accelerating development cycles
- LLMs enhance entrepreneurial cognition by improving opportunity recognition, self-efficacy, and strategic decision-making
- BERT models and sentiment analysis improve predictive accuracy in entrepreneurial finance and crowdfunding outcomes
- Five thematic clusters emerge: Digital Transformation & Behavioral Models, GenAI-Enhanced Education & Learning Systems, Sustainable Innovation & Strategic AI Impact, Business Models & Market Trends, and Data-Driven Technological Trends

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GenAI functions as an "external enabler" that lowers structural barriers to entrepreneurship by reducing startup costs, accelerating development cycles, and automating task-based workflows.
- Mechanism: GenAI compresses the resource-to-output pipeline by substituting capital-intensive activities (e.g., prototyping, market research, content creation) with prompt-driven generation, effectively shifting the production function for early-stage ventures.
- Core assumption: Entrepreneurs can effectively translate GenAI outputs into usable business artifacts without excessive post-processing or domain expertise; quality degradation from AI-generated content does not outweigh efficiency gains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: GenAI and LLMs have "significant effects on industry and business dynamics" through "impact on the preconditions for entrepreneurship"
  - [section 1]: "Technologies can lower entry barriers, reduce startup costs, and accelerate the development cycle of new ventures"
  - [corpus]: Related work on GenAI in enterprise architecture (arxiv:2510.22003) identifies similar enabling dynamics but notes evidence remains scattered
- Break condition: If post-editing costs of AI outputs exceed marginal gains, or if outputs introduce legal/IP risks that negate efficiency benefits, the enabling mechanism inverts to a liability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GenAI enhances entrepreneurial cognition by augmenting opportunity recognition, self-efficacy, and strategic decision-making through interactive knowledge synthesis.
- Mechanism: LLMs provide on-demand, context-aware feedback that functions as a cognitive scaffold—reducing uncertainty in early ideation phases and expanding the perceived feasibility of entrepreneurial action. This operates through iterative human-AI dialogue that externalizes and refines tacit reasoning.
- Core assumption: The cognitive benefits of GenAI interaction persist beyond the immediate session and transfer to actual entrepreneurial behavior; AI-generated insights do not systematically mislead or create false confidence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GenAI enhances entrepreneurial cognition, education, innovation, and decision-making"
  - [section 4.2]: Studies show ChatGPT "enhances opportunity recognition, entrepreneurial knowledge, and self-efficacy, all of which contribute to stronger entrepreneurial intentions"
  - [corpus]: GenAI and creativity meta-analysis (arxiv:2505.17241) examines similar cognitive augmentation but emphasizes empirical evidence remains scattered
- Break condition: If technostress, digital fatigue, or AI-related anxiety outweigh cognitive benefits, adoption may suppress rather than enhance entrepreneurial intention (paper notes technostress weakens the ChatGPT-intention link).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GenAI enables data-driven decision-making by extracting predictive signals from unstructured text, improving outcomes in entrepreneurial finance and market analysis.
- Mechanism: NLP models (e.g., BERT, LLMs) transform qualitative data (pitch narratives, crowdfunding descriptions, sentiment) into quantifiable features that predict success metrics, shifting decision processes from intuition-based to data-informed.
- Core assumption: Historical patterns in textual data generalize to future outcomes; model predictions capture causal signals rather than spurious correlations or artifacts of training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.6]: "LLMs offer diverse applications... BERT models to predict crowdfunding outcomes... machine-assessed linguistic features are stronger predictors of funding success"
  - [section 4.6]: "Positive sentiment, when accurately extracted from financial text, correlates strongly with firm survival"
  - [corpus]: Related GenAI-IoT survey (arxiv:2504.07635) discusses predictive applications but corpus lacks direct validation of entrepreneurship-specific predictive mechanisms
- Break condition: If models overfit to historical contexts that shift (e.g., post-GenAI market dynamics), or if sentiment extraction fails on domain-specific language, predictive value degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **External Enablers Theory (Kimjeon & Davidsson 2022)**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly frames GenAI/LLMs as "external enablers"—environmental factors outside entrepreneur control that facilitate venture emergence. Understanding this theoretical lens is prerequisite to interpreting how the paper conceptualizes GenAI's role beyond mere tool use.
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish between an "external enabler" (environmental condition) and an "internal capability" (firm-level resource) in the context of GenAI adoption?

- Concept: **TF-IDF Vectorization + PCA + Hierarchical Clustering Pipeline**
  - Why needed here: The study's methodology combines these techniques to identify thematic clusters. Understanding what each step preserves or discards is necessary to evaluate whether the five clusters represent meaningful structure or artifacts of dimensionality reduction.
  - Quick check question: Why might PCA-based clustering on TF-IDF vectors conflate semantically distinct papers that share frequent but generic terms?

- Concept: **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)**
  - Why needed here: Multiple reviewed studies apply TAM and TPB to explain GenAI adoption behaviors. These frameworks are referenced as dominant theoretical lenses; understanding their constructs (perceived usefulness, behavioral control, subjective norms) is necessary to interpret findings on adoption barriers and intentions.
  - Quick check question: What construct from TPB would you expect to mediate the relationship between GenAI self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intention?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Input layer**: Entrepreneurial prompts (business plans, market queries, prototyping requests) + unstructured data (pitch decks, reviews, financial text)
  - **Processing layer**: LLM/GenAI models (GPT-4, BERT variants, domain-specific fine-tunes) + NLP pipelines (sentiment analysis, feature extraction)
  - **Output layer**: Generated artifacts (content, code, designs) + decision-support signals (success predictions, risk scores)
  - **Governance layer**: Data privacy controls, IP guardrails, bias mitigation, transparency logging (currently underdeveloped per paper)

- Critical path:
  1. Prompt engineering quality → determines output relevance and actionability
  2. Human-AI collaboration design → determines whether outputs augment or replace judgment
  3. Post-processing validation → determines whether AI-generated artifacts meet legal/ethical standards
  4. Feedback integration → determines whether decision-support signals improve over time

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Automation vs. oversight**: Full automation reduces costs but increases hallucination/risk exposure; human-in-the-loop improves quality but limits scalability
  - **Accessibility vs. centralization**: Paper warns GenAI may lower innovation costs but increase entry barriers due to "data centralization" (section 4.6); open-source models democratize access but may lack performance
  - **Speed vs. verifiability**: Rapid prototyping accelerates iteration but complicates IP attribution and provenance tracking

- Failure signatures:
  - **Overreliance cascade**: Entrepreneurs accept AI-generated strategies without critical evaluation, leading to homogeneous business models across an ecosystem
  - **Technostress-induced abandonment**: High perceived effort combined with anxiety causes disengagement despite perceived usefulness (paper notes this paradox)
  - **Predictive drift**: Models trained on pre-GenAI market data produce misleading success predictions in post-GenAI environments

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Prompt-engineering benchmark**: Test whether structured prompts (role specification, output format constraints, domain context) significantly improve relevance of GenAI-generated business artifacts vs. free-form prompts across 20 entrepreneurs.
  2. **Cognitive-load measurement**: Compare self-efficacy, decision confidence, and technostress levels between entrepreneurs using GenAI for opportunity recognition vs. traditional research methods; measure intention persistence at 2-week follow-up.
  3. **Predictive validity test**: Replicate the BERT-based crowdfunding prediction approach (section 4.6) on a held-out dataset from 2024-2025; assess whether linguistic features remain predictive after ChatGPT's widespread adoption changed pitch-deck norms.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can regulatory frameworks be designed to secure ethical concerns and prevent misuse while simultaneously facilitating business experimentation and further technology development?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state there is a lack of research addressing the "goal conflicts" in developing frameworks that balance regulation with the need for "economy-wide learning" and innovation.
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that while ethical guidelines exist, they must be adapted to entrepreneurial landscapes without obstructing the technology's potential.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative policy analysis or proposed frameworks that successfully demonstrate a balance between strict ethical compliance and sustained startup innovation rates.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does sustained interaction with GenAI influence entrepreneurial cognition, strategic behavior, and venture performance over the long term?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Table 1 notes that existing research employs cross-sectional survey methodologies, limiting insights into how cognitive mechanisms and behaviors evolve longitudinally.
- Why unresolved: Current studies focus primarily on initial adoption intentions rather than the long-term trajectory of entrepreneurial decision-making aided by AI.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal panel studies tracking entrepreneurs' cognitive shifts and firm performance metrics over multiple years of GenAI integration.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What pedagogical designs can effectively balance GenAI-assisted learning with the cultivation of original thinking and creative problem-solving?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The review identifies a need to assess designs that balance GenAI assistance with the risk that "overreliance... may inhibit original thinking" (Cluster 2).
- Why unresolved: The integration of GenAI in education is rapid, but the specific trade-offs between AI-assisted efficiency and the development of independent entrepreneurial competencies (like ambiguity tolerance) are not yet understood.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental studies comparing learning outcomes, specifically creativity and innovation scores, between students using standard curricula versus those using specifically balanced GenAI-integrated curricula.

## Limitations
- Methodological pipeline (TF-IDF → PCA → hierarchical clustering) lacks specification of critical hyperparameters, making exact replication uncertain
- Article selection may have excluded relevant work published after March 2025 or from non-English journals
- Clustering approach provides no quantitative validation of cluster coherence or stability

## Confidence
- **High**: GenAI's role as an external enabler lowering structural barriers (supported by multiple theoretical frameworks and corpus alignment)
- **Medium**: Enhancement of entrepreneurial cognition through interactive knowledge synthesis (evidence scattered, technostress presents counterforce)
- **Low**: Predictive validity of GenAI-extracted signals in entrepreneurial finance (limited empirical validation, potential for spurious correlation)

## Next Checks
1. **Methodological replication test**: Reconstruct the TF-IDF-PCA-clustering pipeline with specified hyperparameters on the same 83-article corpus; compare cluster assignments and stability across parameter variations
2. **Longitudinal effect validation**: Track 50 entrepreneurs using GenAI for opportunity recognition vs. 50 using traditional methods; measure self-efficacy, intention persistence, and actual venture creation at 3- and 6-month intervals
3. **Predictive generalization test**: Apply BERT-based linguistic feature extraction to crowdfunding pitch data from 2024-2025; assess whether pre-2024 trained models maintain predictive accuracy after GenAI adoption altered pitch norms
