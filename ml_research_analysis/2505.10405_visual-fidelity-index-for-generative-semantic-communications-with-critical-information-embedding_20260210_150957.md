# Visual Fidelity Index for Generative Semantic Communications with Critical Information Embedding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.10405
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10405
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GVIF-optimized hybrid Gen-SemCom outperforms JPEG2000 and VAE-only schemes in PSNR/FID while reducing transmitted bits

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a hybrid generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) system for wireless image transmission that combines text prompts with critical image features. The key innovation is a semantic filtering approach using Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to identify and transmit only semantically important image features, reducing transmission overhead. A novel Generative Visual Information Fidelity (GVIF) metric quantifies perceptual quality by measuring mutual information between distorted and original features under a Human Visual System (HVS) noise model. The system optimizes transmission by jointly selecting source coding parameters and filtering thresholds to maximize GVIF under latency constraints, achieving higher PSNR in critical regions and lower FID scores compared to traditional compression methods.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a VAE encoder with hyperprior for source coding, ResNet-50 CAM for semantic importance scoring, and a diffusion-based inpainting model for generation. Features are filtered based on CAM importance scores before entropy coding. The GVIF metric, derived from mutual information under Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) modeling, guides optimization of the filtering threshold and VAE model selection to maximize perceptual fidelity under latency constraints. The approach is evaluated on ImageNet validation images with various channel SNR conditions.

## Key Results
- GVIF metric correlates with both mask PSNR and transmitted feature volume, providing reliable quality assessment
- Proposed system achieves higher PSNR in critical regions and lower FID scores compared to JPEG2000 and standard VAE-based coding
- Performance degrades gracefully with decreasing channel SNR, avoiding the cliff effect seen in VAE-only approaches
- Optimal filtering threshold increases as channel SNR decreases, demonstrating adaptive rate-fidelity trade-offs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** CAM selectively preserves semantically relevant features while discarding background information, reducing transmission overhead without proportional quality loss
- **Mechanism:** ResNet-50 backbone generates feature maps; class-specific weights produce spatial importance matrix $I^k = \sum_c w^k_c f_c$. Features with $I_{ij} \geq \alpha$ are retained; others zeroed. Filtered latent $\tilde{y}$ is quantized and entropy-coded
- **Core assumption:** CNN spatial consistency preserves object localization in latent space; CAM importance correlates with perceptual criticality
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states CAM identifies semantically important features; Section III-A details CAM implementation; Related work arXiv:2509.21394 uses generative AI for semantic transmission without explicit CAM filtering
- **Break condition:** CAM mislocalization (multi-object scenes, domain shift) causes pruning of relevant regions, degrading mask PSNR and GVIF without recovery

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** GVIF quantifies perceptual quality via normalized mutual information between distorted and reference features under HVS noise model
- **Mechanism:** Features follow GSM: $y_{ijc} = \theta_{ijc} \cdot u_{ijc}$ with $u_{ijc} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Distortion from VAE compression scales $\beta_{ijc} \leq 1$; filtering zeroes non-critical features. HVS adds Gaussian noise $\gamma^2$. GVIF = $\frac{\sum_{(i,j,c)\in P} \log_2(1 + \frac{(\bar{\beta}_{ijc}\bar{\theta}^r_{ijc})^2}{\gamma^2})}{\sum_{(i,j,c)\in U} \log_2(1 + \frac{(\bar{\theta}^r_{ijc})^2}{\gamma^2})}$
- **Core assumption:** GSM accurately models latent feature statistics; HVS noise model approximates perceptual limits; features in $P$ preserved identically by diffusion
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract describes GVIF as quantifying mutual information; Section IV-B provides full derivation with GSM and HVS models; Section VI-B shows GVIF correlates with mask PSNR; Related metrics (FID, KID) measure distributional similarity, not per-sample MI
- **Break condition:** Feature statistics deviate from GSM (adversarial/non-natural imagery) or $\gamma^2$ poorly models HVS for specific content, breaking GVIF correlation with perceptual quality

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Joint optimization of VAE source coder $\Phi$ and filtering threshold $\alpha$ maximizes expected GVIF under latency constraints, adapting to channel SNR
- **Mechanism:** Problem: $\max_{\alpha,\Phi} \mathbb{E}_x[V(\Phi,\alpha;x)]$ s.t. $R(\Phi,\alpha)/(B\log_2(1+\text{SNR})) \leq T_{\max}$. Solved via: (1) fix $\Phi$, optimize $\alpha$ using zero-order gradient descent with penalty function; (2) select $\Phi^*$ from pre-trained models maximizing $\mathbb{E}_x[V(\Phi,\alpha^*(\Phi);x)]$
- **Core assumption:** Pre-trained VAE models span sufficient rate-distortion trade-offs; GVIF and rate are approximately smooth in $\alpha$ for large grid sizes; zero-order optimization converges despite non-convexity
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states GVIF optimization outperforms JPEG2000 and VAE benchmarks; Section V-B details two-step algorithm with complexity $O(|\Gamma_t|gW_yH_yC_y)$; Section VI-C shows GVIF correlates positively with channel SNR; Related work arXiv:2511.08416 discusses diffusion models in SemCom but lacks explicit joint rate-fidelity optimization via MI-based metrics
- **Break condition:** Latency constraint infeasible for any $\Phi$ (very low SNR, stringent $T_{\max}$) or high variance in $\alpha$-gradient estimates (small batches), yielding suboptimal or unstable $(\Phi^*,\alpha^*)$

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Class Activation Mapping (CAM)**
  - Why needed here: Provides spatial importance scores for semantic filtering; alternative segmentation methods are computationally expensive
  - Quick check question: Given feature maps $f \in \mathbb{R}^{W_f \times H_f \times C_f}$ and class weights $w^k_c$, how do you compute $I^k$, and what does a high $I^k_{ij}$ indicate?

- **Concept: Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Hyper Prior**
  - Why needed here: Source coding backbone; hyper prior models latent PMF for entropy coding, enabling rate estimation $R$
  - Quick check question: In the hyper prior model, what role does the side information $\hat{s}$ play in estimating $P_{\hat{y}|\hat{s}}$, and why is this critical for rate-distortion optimization?

- **Concept: Diffusion-based Conditional Inpainting**
  - Why needed here: Receiver-side generation; anchors transmitted critical pixels while synthesizing remaining regions from noise and prompt
  - Quick check question: In Eq. (10), what three conditioning signals does the UNet $U_{\theta,t}$ receive, and how does the mask $\bar{m}$ enforce preservation of critical pixels during reverse diffusion?

- **Concept: Mutual Information under Gaussian Scale Mixture Model**
  - Why needed here: Underpins GVIF metric; MI quantifies information flow through HVS channel given feature statistics
  - Quick check question: If features $y_{ijc}$ follow GSM with variance $\theta_{ijc}^2$, and HVS adds noise $\gamma^2$, what is $I(g_{ijc}^d; y_{ijc}^r | \theta^r, \beta)$ for a single preserved feature element?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Image $x \rightarrow$ VAE encoder $\rightarrow$ CAM importance $I$ $\rightarrow$ semantic filter ($\alpha$) $\rightarrow$ hyper prior $\rightarrow$ entropy coding $\rightarrow$ channel transmission $\rightarrow$ entropy decoding $\rightarrow$ VAE decoder $\rightarrow$ diffusion denoiser $\rightarrow$ output $\tilde{x}$
- **Critical path:** Image $x \rightarrow$ VAE encoder $\rightarrow$ CAM importance $I$ $\rightarrow$ semantic filter ($\alpha$) $\rightarrow$ hyper prior $\rightarrow$ entropy coding $\rightarrow$ channel transmission $\rightarrow$ entropy decoding $\rightarrow$ VAE decoder $\rightarrow$ diffusion denoiser $\rightarrow$ output $\tilde{x}$. GVIF computation requires reference coder $\Phi_r$ to extract $\bar{\theta}^r$
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Threshold $\alpha$: Higher $\alpha$ reduces bitcount (faster transmission, lower latency) but lowers GVIF and mask PSNR; experiments show GVIF drops sharply as $\alpha \to 1$
  - VAE coder $\Phi$ selection: Lower distortion $D(\Phi)$ (higher rate) improves quality but increases latency; pre-trained lookup table (19 models, PSNR 27–40 dB) trades off rate-distortion
  - Diffusion steps $T$: More steps improve generation quality but increase receiver compute latency (fixed at 31 in experiments, no fine-tuning)
  - Assumption: Side information $b_P$ (mask) overhead is negligible after run-length encoding; verify for very sparse $P$
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low GVIF with high mask PSNR: CAM mislocalizes semantic regions; critical features pruned; check CAM heatmap alignment with ground-truth objects
  - High latency under moderate SNR: $\alpha$ optimization converged to low value (many features); verify constraint (31a) and penalty parameter $p$
  - Diffusion hallucinates incorrect details in non-critical regions: Prompt $q$ underspecified or ambiguous; diffusion prior dominates; check text extraction quality
  - Entropy coding inefficiency (bitcount >> expected): Hyper prior variance estimates $\theta$ inaccurate; check $L_2$ training or distribution shift
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **GVIF calibration:** On ImageNet validation subset, compute GVIF for varying $\alpha$ (0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and two VAE coders (high/low rate); plot GVIF vs. mask PSNR and vs. FID. Verify monotonic relationship per Fig. 9(a) and Fig. 11(b)
  2. **Channel-adaptive optimization sweep:** For SNR values from -2 dB to 23 dB (per Fig. 9(a)), run Algorithm 1 with $T_{\max}=20$ms; record $(\Phi^*, \alpha^*)$, GVIF, and latency. Confirm $\alpha$ increases as SNR decreases, and GVIF degrades gracefully (no cliff effect vs. VAE-only baseline)
  3. **Ablation: CAM vs. random filtering:** Replace CAM-based $P$ with random selection of equivalent cardinality; compare GVIF, mask PSNR, and FID. Expect CAM to outperform in semantic regions, validating importance modeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Video extension:** Future research could extend the hybrid Gen-SemCom framework to video applications to maintain temporal consistency while utilizing critical information embedding
- **Diverse prompt modalities:** Integration with diverse prompt modalities, such as layout-aware mechanisms, could advance the fidelity of generated visual content compared to text-only prompts
- **Multi-object scene performance:** How semantic filtering performance scales in complex scenes containing multiple overlapping objects compared to single-label examples remains unexplored

## Limitations

- GVIF metric assumes Gaussian Scale Mixture statistics for latent features and Gaussian noise for HVS modeling, which may not hold for synthetic or adversarial content
- CAM-based semantic filtering relies on consistent spatial alignment between feature maps and image regions, which may fail in multi-object scenes or domain-shifted data
- Two-step optimization assumes sufficient diversity in pre-trained VAE models; insufficient model bank or stringent latency constraints may prevent finding feasible solutions

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Hybrid architecture combining VAE source coding with diffusion-based conditional inpainting is well-established
- **High confidence:** CAM filtering mechanism is standard and validated in related semantic communication literature
- **Medium confidence:** GVIF metric derivation from mutual information under GSM and HVS models is mathematically sound but needs empirical validation across diverse content types
- **Medium confidence:** Joint optimization framework is theoretically valid but convergence guarantees are limited due to non-convexity and zero-order gradient descent

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization test:** Evaluate the system on non-ImageNet datasets (e.g., COCO, Cityscapes) to assess CAM filtering robustness and GVIF metric validity for diverse semantic content and image statistics

2. **HVS model sensitivity analysis:** Vary the Gaussian noise parameter $\gamma^2$ in GVIF computation to determine its impact on metric rankings and identify if different content types require content-specific noise modeling

3. **Complexity vs. latency trade-off verification:** Measure actual encoding/decoding times on representative hardware (CPU/GPU) to confirm that the GVIF-optimal $(\Phi^*,\alpha^*)$ pairs meet the stated latency constraints under realistic channel conditions
