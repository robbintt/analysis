  data generation in linear regression. The authors show that when an adversary controls
  the seed of the generative model, a single synthetic data point can leak as much

# Privacy Amplification Through Synthetic Data: Insights from Linear Regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.05101
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05101
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Privacy amplification through synthetic data depends critically on randomization in the generative process

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates privacy amplification through synthetic data generation in linear regression settings. The authors demonstrate that when synthetic data is generated from random inputs rather than controlled seeds, releasing a limited number of synthetic points can provide stronger privacy guarantees than directly releasing model parameters. The privacy loss scales favorably with the number of released synthetic points and input dimension, offering theoretical support for differentially private generative models as a privacy-preserving approach.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes privacy amplification in linear regression by examining how synthetic data generation affects information leakage. The authors compare two scenarios: when an adversary controls the generative model's seed versus when synthetic data is generated from random inputs. Through theoretical analysis, they establish bounds on privacy loss under different conditions and derive scaling relationships between privacy guarantees, the number of synthetic points released, and the dimensionality of the data.

## Key Results
- Privacy amplification of order O(1/d) for one-dimensional outputs
- Privacy amplification of order O(√n/d) for multiple outputs with dimension n
- Single synthetic data point from controlled seed can leak as much information as model release
- Differentially private generative models provide post-processing guarantees for large-scale releases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind privacy amplification in synthetic data generation relies on the randomization inherent in the generation process. When synthetic data is created from random inputs rather than deterministic seeds, the information leakage is diffused across multiple data points rather than concentrated in single releases. This diffusion effect creates a privacy amplification phenomenon where the adversary's ability to reconstruct sensitive information is limited by the randomness in the generation process.

## Foundational Learning
- Differential Privacy (DP): Mathematical framework for quantifying privacy loss; needed to establish rigorous privacy guarantees; quick check: verify ε-DP definition and properties
- Synthetic Data Generation: Process of creating artificial data that preserves statistical properties; needed to understand the generation mechanism; quick check: confirm synthetic data preserves regression relationships
- Privacy Amplification: Phenomenon where privacy guarantees improve through certain mechanisms; needed to quantify the benefit of synthetic releases; quick check: validate amplification bounds hold under assumptions
- Linear Regression: Statistical model relating inputs to outputs; needed as the analytical framework; quick check: ensure linearity assumptions are met
- Adversarial Analysis: Threat modeling approach assuming worst-case adversaries; needed to establish security guarantees; quick check: verify adversary capabilities match assumptions

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Synthetic Data Generator -> Privacy Loss Function -> Theoretical Bounds
Critical path: Random input generation -> Model inference -> Synthetic data release -> Privacy analysis
Design tradeoffs: Deterministic vs. random seed generation; number of synthetic points vs. privacy loss; input dimension vs. amplification factor
Failure signatures: Privacy loss exceeding theoretical bounds; non-linear relationships violating assumptions; seed control by adversary
First experiments: 1) Verify O(1/d) scaling for univariate outputs, 2) Test O(√n/d) scaling for multivariate outputs, 3) Measure actual privacy loss under controlled seed scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes linear regression settings, limiting generalizability to complex neural architectures
- White-box adversary model assuming seed control represents an extreme threat scenario
- Practical privacy-utility tradeoffs not fully explored in real-world generative models

## Confidence
- Theoretical validity: High
- Practical applicability: Medium
- Generalizability to non-linear models: Low

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation using actual differentially private generative models (e.g., DP-GANs, DP-VAEs) to test whether theoretical amplification bounds hold in practice
2. Extension of analysis to non-linear regression and other statistical models to assess generalizability
3. Evaluation of practical privacy-utility tradeoffs by measuring actual reconstruction risk when releasing synthetic data from different DP generative models
