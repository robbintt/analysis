# Bayesian Parametric Matrix Models: Principled Uncertainty Quantification for Spectral Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.12406
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12406
- Authors: Mohammad Nooraiepour
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces B-PMMs for uncertainty quantification in spectral learning with exceptional calibration (ECE < 0.05) across tested dimensions

## Executive Summary
This work introduces Bayesian Parametric Matrix Models (B-PMMs), a framework for principled uncertainty quantification in spectral learning methods used in scientific computing. The approach extends parametric matrix models to provide uncertainty estimates while preserving spectral structure and computational efficiency. B-PMMs address the fundamental challenge of quantifying uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail due to geometric constraints of spectral decomposition.

The framework combines adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized matrix perturbation bounds, structured variational inference using manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors, and finite-sample calibration guarantees. Experimental validation across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 demonstrates exceptional uncertainty calibration with perfect convergence rates, while maintaining favorable computational scaling.

## Method Summary
B-PMMs extend parametric matrix models to incorporate Bayesian uncertainty quantification while preserving the spectral structure essential for scientific computing applications. The framework introduces three key innovations: adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized perturbation bounds that maintain computational tractability, structured variational inference using manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition, and finite-sample calibration guarantees that ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. The method achieves near-optimal uncertainty quantification rates for spectral learning problems and provides reliable uncertainty estimates even in near-degenerate regimes where traditional approaches fail.

## Key Results
- Exceptional uncertainty calibration (Expected Calibration Error < 0.05) across all tested matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500
- Perfect convergence rates maintained while providing uncertainty quantification
- Favorable computational scaling with near-optimal uncertainty quantification rates for spectral learning problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by recognizing that standard Bayesian approaches fail for spectral learning due to the non-Euclidean geometry of the eigenvalue-eigenvector space. B-PMMs overcome this by using manifold-aware variational inference that respects the Stiefel manifold structure of eigenvectors while maintaining tractable posterior approximations. The adaptive spectral decomposition component allows the model to adjust its uncertainty estimates based on local spectral properties, while the regularized perturbation bounds provide finite-sample guarantees that scale appropriately with matrix dimension and spectral gap.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spectral decomposition geometry**: Understanding that eigenvalues and eigenvectors live on non-Euclidean manifolds is crucial because standard Gaussian priors on matrix entries violate these geometric constraints. Quick check: Verify that eigenvectors satisfy orthogonality constraints and belong to the Stiefel manifold.
- **Matrix perturbation theory**: Essential for bounding uncertainty in eigenvalue problems since small perturbations can cause large changes in spectral properties. Quick check: Compute condition numbers for test matrices to assess sensitivity.
- **Variational inference on manifolds**: Required because standard VI assumes Euclidean parameter spaces while spectral decompositions require manifold-constrained distributions. Quick check: Confirm that posterior distributions respect manifold constraints.
- **Parametric matrix models**: Foundation for understanding how to extend deterministic spectral methods to probabilistic frameworks. Quick check: Implement basic parametric matrix factorization to verify understanding.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data → Adaptive Spectral Decomposition → Manifold-Aware VI → Uncertainty Quantification → Output

**Critical Path**: The inference pipeline flows from observed data through adaptive spectral decomposition, which feeds into the structured variational inference module that produces calibrated uncertainty estimates. The perturbation bounds module provides regularization and guarantees throughout.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead (manifold-aware inference is more expensive than standard VI) for significantly improved uncertainty calibration and theoretical guarantees. The adaptive decomposition adds complexity but enables better performance in near-degenerate regimes.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor calibration when spectral gaps are small, computational bottlenecks for very large matrices, and potential overfitting when the number of parameters exceeds the effective sample size in the spectral domain.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test calibration on synthetic matrices with known eigenvalues across varying spectral gaps
2. Benchmark computational scaling from 10x10 to 500x500 matrices
3. Compare uncertainty estimates against ground truth in controlled perturbation experiments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the extension of B-PMMs to non-parametric settings, the theoretical characterization of optimal perturbation bounds for specific scientific computing applications, and the development of scalable approximations for extremely large-scale problems where full spectral decomposition becomes prohibitive.

## Limitations
- Practical scalability beyond 500x500 matrix dimensions remains unverified with limited empirical validation at larger scales
- Claims of "near-optimal uncertainty quantification rates" lack formal theoretical justification linking to established lower bounds
- Performance in truly near-degenerate eigenvalue scenarios where spectral decomposition becomes numerically unstable remains unverified

## Confidence
- High confidence: Adaptive spectral decomposition methodology and structured variational inference framework
- Medium confidence: Computational scaling claims and manifold-aware posterior distributions
- Low confidence: Universal applicability claims and near-degenerate regime performance guarantees

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical scalability tests on matrices exceeding 1000x1000 dimensions to verify computational complexity claims
2. Perform ablation studies removing manifold constraints to quantify their contribution to uncertainty quantification performance
3. Test the framework on multiple real-world scientific datasets with known uncertainty patterns to validate calibration claims across diverse applications
