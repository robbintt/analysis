# Beyond the Black Box: Identifiable Interpretation and Control in Generative Models via Causal Minimality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10720
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10720
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Causal minimality constraints enable interpretable concept graphs and component-wise control in diffusion models, with successful application to Stable Diffusion and Flux achieving competitive unlearning performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the interpretability challenge in deep generative models by establishing a principled framework for identifiable interpretation and control. The authors leverage causal minimality - the principle that nature prefers the simplest causal explanation - to endow latent representations with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. By introducing hierarchical selection models where higher-level concepts emerge from constrained composition of lower-level variables, they demonstrate that sparsity or compression constraints can recover the true latent variables of the data-generating process. The framework enables extraction of innate hierarchical concept graphs from leading generative models, offering insights into internal knowledge organization and providing levers for fine-grained model steering.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models that better capture complex dependencies in data generation. They establish that under causal minimality conditions (manifested as sparsity or compression constraints), learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. The framework applies these constraints to leading generative models, enabling the extraction of innate hierarchical concept graphs. These causally grounded concepts serve as levers for fine-grained model steering, paving the way for transparent, reliable systems. The method is validated through empirical application to text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion and Flux, demonstrating successful concept graph extraction and competitive performance on model unlearning tasks.

## Key Results
- Successful extraction of hierarchical concept graphs from Stable Diffusion and Flux models
- Achievement of competitive model unlearning performance while maintaining generation quality (FID: 17.81 baseline vs 0.25 with method)
- Demonstration of causally grounded concepts as levers for fine-grained model steering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging causal minimality to identify the simplest causal explanation that fits the data. By imposing sparsity or compression constraints on hierarchical selection models, the method ensures that learned representations align with the true latent structure of the data-generating process. This alignment enables interpretable decomposition of concepts and provides component-wise control over the generative process.

## Foundational Learning
- Causal minimality principle: The simplest causal explanation that fits the data is preferred; needed to establish identifiability of latent representations; quick check: verify that the proposed model satisfies minimality conditions
- Hierarchical selection models: Higher-level concepts emerge from constrained composition of lower-level variables; needed to capture complex dependencies in data generation; quick check: confirm hierarchical structure in extracted concept graphs
- Sparsity/compression constraints: Mathematical conditions ensuring minimality; needed to guarantee equivalence between learned and true latent variables; quick check: measure constraint satisfaction during training

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data -> Hierarchical Selection Model -> Latent Variables -> Generated Output
Critical path: Input data passes through hierarchical layers with sparsity constraints to produce interpretable latent representations
Design tradeoffs: Balance between model expressiveness and interpretability through constraint strength
Failure signatures: Over-constrained models may fail to capture complex dependencies; under-constrained models may not achieve interpretability
First experiments: 1) Apply framework to autoregressive language models for text generation; 2) Test on non-visual modalities like audio or molecular generation; 3) Vary constraint strength to quantify interpretability-generation quality tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges uncertainties regarding the generalizability of causal minimality conditions across diverse generative architectures and data modalities. It remains unclear how well the sparsity/compression constraints will translate to domains such as audio, video, or structured data beyond text-to-image models.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation to text-to-image models (Stable Diffusion and Flux)
- Unclear generalizability of sparsity/compression constraints to non-visual modalities
- Theoretical guarantees depend on assumptions about data-generating process that may not hold in practice

## Confidence
High confidence in the core theoretical framework establishing causal minimality as a basis for interpretable generative models
Medium confidence in empirical results showing concept graph extraction and model unlearning performance
Low confidence in claims about generalizability across all generative model types and data domains without further validation

## Next Checks
1) Apply the framework to autoregressive language models and evaluate concept hierarchy extraction for text generation tasks
2) Test the sparsity/compression constraints on diffusion models for non-visual modalities (e.g., audio or molecular generation) to assess cross-domain applicability
3) Conduct ablation studies varying the strength of minimality constraints to quantify the trade-off between interpretability gains and generation quality across different model architectures
