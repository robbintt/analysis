# To Augment or Not to Augment? Diagnosing Distributional Symmetry Breaking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01349
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01349
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces a metric to quantify distributional symmetry breaking in datasets, where transformed data points (e.g., rotations) are not equally likely under the data distribution.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a metric to quantify distributional symmetry breaking in datasets, where transformed data points (e.g., rotations) are not equally likely under the data distribution. The method uses a two-sample classifier test to distinguish between original and augmented data, providing an interpretable measure of symmetry breaking. Experiments on benchmark datasets (MNIST, ModelNet40, QM9, QM7b, MD17, OC20) reveal high degrees of canonicalization in point cloud datasets. Theoretical analysis shows that data augmentation can sometimes harm performance when invariant and non-invariant features are strongly correlated, particularly in over-parameterized regimes. The results suggest that the effectiveness of equivariant methods depends on the dataset and task, motivating further study of when and why different augmentations benefit learning.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce a metric to quantify distributional symmetry breaking, which occurs when transformed data points (e.g., rotations) are not equally likely under the data distribution. The method employs a two-sample classifier test to distinguish between original and augmented data, providing an interpretable measure of symmetry breaking. This metric is then used to analyze various benchmark datasets and understand the impact of symmetry breaking on model performance.

## Key Results
- High degrees of canonicalization detected in point cloud datasets
- Data augmentation can harm performance when invariant and non-invariant features are strongly correlated
- Effectiveness of equivariant methods depends on dataset and task characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by measuring how well a classifier can distinguish between original data and augmented versions, which directly quantifies distributional symmetry breaking. When the classifier performs well, it indicates that the augmentation changes the distribution in a way that can be detected, suggesting the original data distribution is not symmetric under those transformations. This provides an interpretable measure that can guide decisions about which augmentations to use and whether invariant architectures are appropriate.

## Foundational Learning
- Distributional symmetry: Understanding when data transformations preserve the underlying data distribution - needed to identify when standard augmentations are appropriate
- Two-sample testing: Statistical methods for determining if two datasets come from the same distribution - needed to quantify symmetry breaking
- Equivariant architectures: Neural network designs that explicitly respect known symmetries - needed to understand when such methods are beneficial
- Canonicalization: The tendency of datasets to have preferred orientations or configurations - needed to explain observed symmetry breaking patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Original Data -> Augmentation Pipeline -> Two-Sample Classifier -> Symmetry Breaking Metric

**Critical Path:** Data augmentation → Two-sample classifier training → Metric computation → Performance analysis

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method balances computational cost (training a classifier) against interpretability and diagnostic power. While more expensive than simple augmentation statistics, it provides actionable insights about symmetry breaking that simpler metrics cannot capture.

**Failure Signatures:** The metric may fail when: (1) the augmentation space is too limited to capture relevant symmetries, (2) the two-sample classifier lacks sufficient capacity or data, or (3) the relationship between symmetry breaking and performance is non-monotonic due to complex feature correlations.

**First Experiments:**
1. Apply the symmetry breaking metric to a simple synthetic dataset with known symmetries
2. Compare symmetry breaking measures across different augmentation strategies on a benchmark dataset
3. Correlate symmetry breaking metrics with downstream task performance across multiple datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical validation relies heavily on synthetic experiments and relatively small-scale benchmark datasets
- Theoretical analysis focuses on linear models and specific correlation structures
- Two-sample classifier test assumes access to diverse augmentations and sufficient samples

## Confidence

**High confidence in:** Mathematical formulation of distributional symmetry breaking and its measurement via two-sample testing

**Medium confidence in:** Synthetic experiment results demonstrating performance degradation under symmetry breaking

**Low confidence in:** Generalizability of conclusions to real-world large-scale applications

## Next Checks

1. Test the symmetry breaking metric on larger-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet, molecular dynamics simulations) to validate scalability and practical utility

2. Conduct ablation studies varying augmentation strategies to quantify their impact on the symmetry breaking measure and downstream performance

3. Extend theoretical analysis to nonlinear models and realistic correlation structures to better understand limitations in over-parameterized regimes
