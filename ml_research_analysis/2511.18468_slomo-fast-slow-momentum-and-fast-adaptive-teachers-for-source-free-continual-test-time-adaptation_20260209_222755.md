# SloMo-Fast: Slow-Momentum and Fast-Adaptive Teachers for Source-Free Continual Test-Time Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.18468
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18468
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves state-of-the-art mean error rate of 34.7% across 11 CTTA scenarios on 5 datasets, outperforming existing methods by at least 1.5%

## Executive Summary
SloMo-Fast introduces a dual-teacher framework for continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) that addresses the challenge of long-term forgetting when models encounter evolving target domains without access to source data. The method employs a Fast-Teacher that quickly adapts to new domains and a Slow-Teacher that retains long-term knowledge through gradual updates, enabling both adaptability and generalization. SloMo-Fast generates class prototypes dynamically from high-confidence test features, eliminating the need for source data while preserving domain-specific knowledge.

## Method Summary
SloMo-Fast is a dual-teacher framework for source-free CTTA that decouples adaptation speed from knowledge retention. The method uses a Fast-Teacher (T1) updated via Exponential Moving Average to capture immediate domain shifts, and a Slow-Teacher (T2) updated via contrastive optimization to maintain long-term invariance. Class prototypes are generated from high-confidence test features filtered by entropy and sensitivity criteria, enabling contrastive learning without source data. The framework achieves parameter efficiency by updating only 4.9% of parameters (Batch Normalization layers) while maintaining competitive performance across 11 diverse CTTA scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art mean error rate of 34.7% across 11 CTTA scenarios on 5 datasets
- Outperforms existing methods by at least 1.5% in mean error rate
- Introduces Cyclic-TTA benchmark where domains repeat over time, demonstrating robust adaptation to recurring distribution shifts
- Parameter-efficient design updates only 4.9% of parameters while maintaining competitive efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Plasticity-Stability Decoupling via Dual Teachers
- **Claim:** Separating adaptation speed from knowledge retention mitigates the trade-off between fitting new domains and remembering old ones
- **Mechanism:** Fast-Teacher (T1) updated via EMA captures immediate domain shifts; Slow-Teacher (T2) updated via contrastive optimization maintains long-term invariance
- **Core assumption:** Rapid EMA updates capture domain-specific features without destabilizing global feature space, while slow contrastive updates prevent catastrophic forgetting
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states T1 adapts while T2 retains knowledge; section 3.1 describes T1 EMA update; variational CTTA work identifies error accumulation as key failure mode

### Mechanism 2: Source-Free Prototyping via Dual-Criterion Filtering
- **Claim:** Reliable class prototypes can be generated dynamically during testing without source data
- **Mechanism:** Class-specific priority queues store features from T1 admitted only if entropy is low AND prediction sensitivity is high
- **Core assumption:** High-confidence (low entropy) and robust-to-perturbation (high sensitivity) predictions likely correspond to correct pseudo-labels
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.2 describes dual-criteria filtering; figure 5 shows distinct prototype clusters; conformal uncertainty work validates reliability filtering importance

### Mechanism 3: Contrastive Generalization Enforcement
- **Claim:** Aligning Slow-Teacher features with generated prototypes preserves class topology across sequential domains
- **Mechanism:** T2 trained using contrastive loss that pulls its feature representations closer to corresponding class prototypes
- **Core assumption:** Prototypes from T1 provide better generalization anchors than immediate batch statistics
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.2 describes contrastive learning with prototypes; table 2 shows removing L_CL increases error rates from 14.88% to 16.04% on CIFAR10-C

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
  - **Why needed here:** Updates Fast-Teacher (T1) and smooths Student updates
  - **Quick check question:** How does smoothing factor α determine memory of previous domains in T1?

- **Concept: Symmetric Cross Entropy (SCE)**
  - **Why needed here:** Used for self-training loss between student and teachers to handle noisy pseudo-labels
  - **Quick check question:** Why might standard Cross-Entropy fail in CTTA where pseudo-labels are unreliable?

- **Concept: Prediction Sensitivity / Robustness**
  - **Why needed here:** PLPD metric crucial for "Sensitivity Criterion" to filter out features that are merely "lucky" guesses
  - **Quick check question:** How does augmenting input x_t test stability of model's prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input -> Student -> T1 (EMA) -> Priority Queues (Entropy+Sensitivity filtering) -> Prototypes -> T2 (Contrastive) -> Student (SCE) -> Ensemble Output

- **Critical path:** 1) Student processes batch 2) T1 extracts features/pseudo-labels 3) Features filtered by Entropy & Sensitivity into Priority Queues 4) Prototypes computed from Queues 5) T2 aligns to Prototypes via Contrastive Loss 6) Student aligns to both T1 and T2 via SCE

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - SloMo-Fast vs. SloMo-Fast*: BN-only update (4.9% params) vs full update (better accuracy, higher compute)
  - Queue Size: Too small loses diversity vs Too large has stale prototypes

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Collapse of Prototypes: If accuracy drops, check if Priority Queues filling up or containing only single class
  - Teacher Divergence: If T1 and T2 disagree significantly, Student receives conflicting gradients

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablate Sensitivity Criterion: Run with only Entropy filtering to verify PLPD term improves prototype quality
  2. Cyclic-TTA Validation: Test on proposed benchmark to verify T2 remembers previous domains better than baselines
  3. Parameter Efficiency Test: Compare SloMo-Fast (BN-only) vs SloMo-Fast* on resource-constrained setting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but the authors discuss limitations including the need for more extensive testing on the Cyclic-TTA benchmark and potential issues with extreme domain shifts where both filtering criteria might be satisfied by incorrect predictions.

## Limitations
- Performance relies heavily on quality of pseudo-labels from Fast-Teacher, with limited validation of what happens when both filtering criteria are satisfied by incorrect predictions
- Parameter efficiency gain comes with performance penalty that isn't thoroughly quantified across all datasets
- Cyclic-TTA benchmark only tested on CIFAR10-C, requiring extension to more complex datasets to strengthen forgetting-alleviation claims

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** Dual-teacher architecture design, mathematical formulation of losses, and general performance improvement over baselines (1.5% error reduction) are well-supported by results and ablation studies

**Medium Confidence:** Claims about long-term knowledge retention and cyclic domain adaptation are supported but could benefit from more extensive testing; parameter efficiency claims are accurate but trade-offs need more systematic analysis

**Low Confidence:** Exact impact of stochastic restoration and specific augmentation strategies for PLPD calculation are not fully detailed, making it difficult to assess individual contributions

## Next Checks
1. Monitor queue entropy distributions during adaptation to verify dual-criteria filtering prevents contamination while maintaining queue diversity

2. Validate Cyclic-TTA benchmark on ImageNet-C with more than 3 cycles to rigorously test long-term forgetting prevention and adaptation speed on repeated domains

3. Test on datasets with severe domain shifts (e.g., natural to synthetic) to identify failure modes when both entropy and sensitivity criteria might be satisfied by incorrect predictions
