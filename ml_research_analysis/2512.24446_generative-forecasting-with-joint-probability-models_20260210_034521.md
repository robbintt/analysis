# Generative forecasting with joint probability models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24446
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24446
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Joint generative models achieve superior short-term predictive skill and long-range statistical consistency on chaotic systems compared to conventional conditional next-step models

## Executive Summary
This paper reframes chaotic dynamical systems forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. The authors introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and demonstrate that this approach captures nonlinear temporal dependencies, represents multistep trajectory segments, and produces next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. On two canonical chaotic systems (Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation), joint generative models show improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behavior than conventional conditional next-step models.

## Method Summary
The authors propose learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows rather than traditional next-step conditional forecasting. This joint generative approach enables capturing nonlinear temporal dependencies and multistep trajectory segments. The framework is model-agnostic, allowing various generative models to be trained on windowed state sequences. Forecasts are obtained through marginalization of the learned joint distribution. The method includes intrinsic uncertainty quantification through ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift metrics, enabling assessment of forecast robustness and reliability without ground truth access.

## Key Results
- Joint generative models demonstrate improved short-term predictive skill on Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations
- Unconditional joint models achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behavior than conditional next-step models
- Multiple regression of three uncertainty metrics explains up to 84% of forecast error variance in ensemble settings
- The approach preserves attractor geometry and better reproduces tail event statistics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The joint generative approach captures the full temporal dependency structure within short windows rather than approximating it through sequential conditional predictions. By learning the joint distribution directly, the model represents multistep trajectory segments as coherent units, avoiding error accumulation that plagues traditional autoregressive methods. The marginalization process for forecasting naturally incorporates uncertainty from all lagged states, providing more robust predictions. The intrinsic uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, autocorrelation, Wasserstein drift) offer interpretable measures of forecast reliability without requiring ground truth validation.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Joint probability distributions in chaotic systems**
   - Why needed: Traditional conditional forecasting fails to capture full temporal dependencies in chaotic dynamics
   - Quick check: Verify that the joint model learns consistent marginal distributions matching the true system statistics

2. **Wasserstein distance for distribution comparison**
   - Why needed: Standard metrics like MSE don't capture distributional shifts in chaotic systems
   - Quick check: Confirm Wasserstein drift correlates with forecast degradation over time

3. **Marginalization for generative forecasting**
   - Why needed: Direct sampling from joint distribution enables next-step prediction without sequential error accumulation
   - Quick check: Validate that marginalized forecasts match the conditional distributions learned by standard models

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input window -> Joint generative model -> Learned joint distribution -> Marginalization -> Forecast output

Critical path: Data preprocessing (windowing) -> Model training (joint distribution learning) -> Forecast generation (marginalization) -> Uncertainty quantification (ensemble metrics)

Design tradeoffs: The window size balances computational complexity against temporal dependency capture; larger windows provide more context but increase model complexity and training difficulty.

Failure signatures: Poor forecast skill indicates insufficient model capacity or inadequate window size; unrealistic uncertainty estimates suggest model collapse or mode averaging issues.

Three first experiments:
1. Train and evaluate on Lorenz-63 with varying window sizes to identify optimal temporal context
2. Compare joint generative forecasts against ground truth attractor geometry using principal component analysis
3. Measure uncertainty metric evolution over forecast horizon to validate intrinsic reliability assessment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness on higher-dimensional, non-autonomous, or partially observed systems remains untested
- Computational efficiency of marginalization for real-time applications is not discussed
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter choices (window size, model architecture) requires further exploration

## Confidence
- Joint generative approach performance on studied chaotic systems: High
- Unconditional models dominating conditional approaches: Medium (limited comparative variants)
- Uncertainty quantification without ground truth access: Medium (real-world validation needed)

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on higher-dimensional chaotic systems (e.g., Lorenz-96, coupled oscillator networks) to evaluate scalability and generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies varying window size, model capacity, and training data quantity to quantify sensitivity and identify optimal configurations
3. Apply the method to partially observed or noisy real-world datasets (e.g., weather, climate, or financial time series) to assess robustness in practical forecasting scenarios with incomplete information
