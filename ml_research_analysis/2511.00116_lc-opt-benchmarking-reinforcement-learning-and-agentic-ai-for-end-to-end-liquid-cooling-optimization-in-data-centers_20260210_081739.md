# LC-Opt: Benchmarking Reinforcement Learning and Agentic AI for End-to-End Liquid Cooling Optimization in Data Centers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.00116
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00116
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** RL controllers achieve 95.63% blade-group temperature compliance and 21% cooling tower power reduction

## Executive Summary
LC-Opt introduces a reinforcement learning benchmark for liquid cooling optimization in data centers, extending Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Frontier supercomputer digital twin with RL control interfaces. The environment enables scalable multi-agent RL control of cooling tower setpoints and blade-group valve actuation via a Gymnasium interface, supporting both centralized and decentralized action execution. Benchmarking centralized action with a multi-head policy achieved 95.63% blade-group temperature compliance and reduced cooling tower power consumption by 21% compared to baseline rule-based control. The framework also supports policy distillation into decision trees and LLMs for interpretable, explainable control actions, fostering trust and simplifying system management.

## Method Summary
LC-Opt extends a digital twin of ORNL's Frontier supercomputer with RL control interfaces through a Gymnasium-compatible environment. The framework supports multi-agent reinforcement learning for controlling cooling tower setpoints and blade-group valve actuation. Centralized and decentralized action execution modes are available, with the benchmarking conducted using a multi-head policy approach. The environment includes simulation of liquid cooling dynamics, temperature monitoring across blade groups, and power consumption metrics. Policy distillation capabilities enable conversion of learned policies into decision trees and large language models for interpretable control.

## Key Results
- Achieved 95.63% blade-group temperature compliance in simulation
- Reduced cooling tower power consumption by 21% compared to baseline rule-based control
- Demonstrated successful policy distillation into decision trees and LLMs for interpretable control

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the detailed digital twin representation of Frontier's liquid cooling system to provide realistic state observations and reward signals for RL agents. The Gymnasium interface standardizes interaction, enabling use of established RL algorithms. Multi-agent architectures allow distributed decision-making across cooling subsystems, while the centralized multi-head policy approach demonstrated superior performance in temperature compliance and energy efficiency. Policy distillation bridges the gap between black-box RL models and human-interpretable control logic.

## Foundational Learning
- **Digital Twin Modeling** - Why needed: Accurate simulation of physical systems is essential for safe RL training without risking real infrastructure; Quick check: Compare simulated vs. actual temperature response curves under various load conditions
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** - Why needed: Cooling systems involve multiple interdependent subsystems requiring coordinated control; Quick check: Verify reward convergence when agents share vs. maintain separate reward structures
- **Gymnasium Interface Standardization** - Why needed: Enables compatibility with established RL libraries and algorithms; Quick check: Test framework with different RL algorithm implementations (PPO, DQN, etc.)
- **Policy Distillation** - Why needed: Transforms complex RL policies into interpretable forms for human oversight and trust; Quick check: Measure accuracy loss when converting RL policy to decision tree or LLM format
- **Centralized vs. Decentralized Control** - Why needed: Different architectural approaches offer tradeoffs in coordination complexity vs. scalability; Quick check: Compare system performance and training stability between control paradigms
- **Temperature Compliance Metrics** - Why needed: Critical KPI for data center cooling effectiveness and hardware reliability; Quick check: Validate compliance calculations against industry standards (ASHRAE guidelines)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Digital Twin Environment -> RL Agent(s) -> Action Execution Interface -> Physical Simulation -> State Observation -> Reward Calculation -> Agent Update

**Critical Path:**
RL Agent Policy Evaluation -> Action Selection -> Cooling System Actuation -> Temperature Response Simulation -> State Update -> Reward Computation -> Policy Gradient Update

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Centralized multi-head policies provide superior coordination and performance but may face scalability challenges with system size, while decentralized approaches offer better scalability but require careful reward shaping to maintain system-wide optimization.

**Failure Signatures:**
Temperature excursions indicate inadequate control authority or reward function misalignment; Oscillatory control behavior suggests hyperparameter tuning issues or insufficient exploration; Energy consumption spikes may reveal inefficient policy learning or inappropriate reward weighting.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Baseline comparison: Run identical cooling scenarios with rule-based control vs. RL policy to establish performance differential
2. Centralized vs. decentralized ablation: Test both control architectures under identical conditions to quantify coordination benefits
3. Policy distillation validation: Compare decision tree and LLM distilled policies against original RL policy for accuracy and interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmarking conducted on digital twin rather than physical hardware, introducing uncertainty about real-world performance
- Evaluation focused primarily on temperature compliance and cooling tower power consumption, with limited analysis of water usage, total cost of ownership, or reliability
- 21% power reduction achieved with centralized action execution, but comparative analysis between centralized and decentralized approaches is limited

## Confidence

**Temperature compliance achievement (95.63%):** High - Direct measurement from simulation environment with clear methodology

**21% cooling tower power reduction:** Medium - Based on digital twin results with limited comparative scope

**Policy distillation effectiveness for interpretability:** Low - Briefly mentioned without detailed validation or performance metrics

## Next Checks

1. Deploy RL controllers on physical liquid-cooled hardware to validate digital twin performance and identify simulation-to-reality gaps

2. Conduct A/B testing between centralized and decentralized multi-agent approaches across diverse workload patterns and environmental conditions

3. Perform comprehensive lifecycle cost analysis including water consumption, maintenance overhead, and reliability impacts to validate economic benefits beyond energy savings
