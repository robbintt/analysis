# BIPPO: Budget-Aware Independent PPO for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning Services

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08142
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08142
- Authors: Anna Lackinger; Andrea Morichetta; Pantelis A. Frangoudis; Schahram Dustdar
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Budget-aware independent PPO achieves 45% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 with lower variance than traditional PPO and heuristic baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BIPPO, a novel federated learning approach that uses independent PPO agents for each client to optimize energy-efficient client selection in IoT systems. The method addresses the challenge of maintaining performance in non-IID environments while managing heterogeneous device constraints and resource budgets. BIPPO demonstrates superior accuracy, stability, and energy efficiency compared to existing approaches, with particular strength in handling dynamic client participation scenarios.

## Method Summary
BIPPO employs independent PPO agents for each client in federated learning systems, enabling personalized energy-efficient client selection strategies. Unlike traditional PPO which uses a centralized agent or IPPO which coordinates all clients, BIPPO allows each client to learn its own policy independently. This design maintains scalability as computational complexity remains constant regardless of client count, while providing stable performance when clients join or leave the system without requiring complete retraining. The approach balances accuracy and energy consumption through budget-aware client selection in heterogeneous IoT environments.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 45% higher mean accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to traditional PPO, IPPO, and heuristic baselines
- Maintains lower variance in accuracy across different runs, indicating more stable performance
- Demonstrates constant computational complexity regardless of client count, making it scalable to 48+ clients
- Shows superior performance in dynamic environments where clients can join or leave without requiring complete retraining
- Consumes only negligible proportion of total energy budget while maintaining high performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BIPPO's independent PPO approach allows each client to develop personalized energy-efficient selection strategies that adapt to local conditions while maintaining global system performance. By decoupling client policies, the method avoids the communication overhead and coordination complexity of centralized approaches while preserving the benefits of reinforcement learning. The budget-aware mechanism ensures that energy constraints are respected while optimizing for accuracy, and the independence of client policies provides resilience to dynamic changes in the system.

## Foundational Learning
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed machine learning where clients train models locally and share updates - needed for understanding the core problem space and communication patterns
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes policies while maintaining stability through clipped objective functions - needed to understand the baseline methods BIPPO improves upon
- **Non-IID Data Distributions**: When clients have different data distributions that don't follow the same pattern - needed to understand the challenge BIPPO addresses in real-world scenarios
- **Client Selection Strategies**: Methods for choosing which devices participate in each training round - needed to grasp the core optimization problem BIPPO solves
- **MAC (Multiply-Accumulate Operations)**: Metric for computational complexity and energy estimation - needed to evaluate the energy efficiency claims
- **Independent vs Coordinated RL**: Trade-offs between decentralized and centralized reinforcement learning approaches - needed to understand BIPPO's architectural choice

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Client Devices -> Independent PPO Agents -> Local Training -> Global Model Update -> Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Client selection policy → Local training execution → Model aggregation → Performance feedback → Policy update

**Design Tradeoffs**: Independent policies provide scalability and stability but may miss coordination opportunities for better energy efficiency; centralized approaches offer better coordination but suffer from communication overhead and retraining requirements when clients change.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor accuracy indicates insufficient exploration of client selection strategies; high energy consumption suggests budget constraints are too loose or selection policies need refinement; instability when clients join/leave indicates insufficient generalization of independent policies.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Benchmark BIPPO against FedAvg on CIFAR-10 with 10, 24, and 48 clients to verify scalability claims
2. Test dynamic client scenarios by simulating 30% client churn during training to validate stability improvements
3. Measure actual energy consumption on heterogeneous IoT devices versus MAC-based estimates to validate energy efficiency claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability beyond 48 clients remains unproven, with no experimental validation for industrial-scale IoT deployments
- Assumption of independent client policies may not hold in highly dynamic environments where coordination could yield better energy efficiency
- Computational overhead of running separate PPO agents per client lacks rigorous quantification across different hardware profiles
- Energy efficiency claims based primarily on MAC calculations rather than actual power measurements across diverse device types
- Stability claims under client churn based on controlled simulations that may not capture real IoT deployment stochasticity

## Confidence
- High confidence in comparative performance improvements over baselines on standard datasets with statistical significance measures
- Medium confidence in energy-efficient performance claims due to reliance on MAC calculations versus actual power measurements
- Medium confidence in stability under client churn based on controlled simulation patterns
- Low confidence in scalability claims beyond tested scenarios without larger-scale experimental validation

## Next Checks
1. Deploy BIPPO in a physical IoT testbed with heterogeneous devices to measure actual energy consumption versus simulated MAC counts
2. Test scalability by evaluating performance with 100+ clients to verify the claimed constant computational complexity
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the independent policy assumption to quantify the trade-off between coordination overhead and energy efficiency gains
