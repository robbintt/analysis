# G$^2$VLM: Geometry Grounded Vision Language Model with Unified 3D Reconstruction and Spatial Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21688
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21688
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Unified vision-language model achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance while maintaining competitive 3D reconstruction capabilities

## Executive Summary
G2VLM is a unified vision-language model that bridges spatial 3D reconstruction and high-level spatial reasoning by integrating a geometric perception expert with a semantic perception expert in a Mixture-of-Experts architecture. The model learns 3D geometry from 2D images and enhances spatial reasoning through shared self-attention, interleaved reasoning, and in-context learning. Experimental results show G2VLM achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on depth, point, and camera pose estimation tasks, while outperforming existing spatial reasoning models on comprehensive benchmarks like SPAR-Bench, MindCube, and OmniSpatial. Specifically, G2VLM-SR surpasses GPT-4o by 18.5 points on SPAR-Bench, demonstrating superior spatial understanding despite its small 2B parameter size.

## Method Summary
G2VLM employs a Mixture-of-Transformer-Experts architecture with two specialized experts: a geometric perception expert (DINOv2 encoder + 28 LLM layers) and a semantic perception expert (Qwen2-VL-2B). Both experts share QKV self-attention while maintaining separate FFNs. The model uses a two-stage training approach: Stage 1 trains the geometric expert on 3D-annotated datasets (100K+20K iterations), then Stage 2 freezes the geometric expert and trains the semantic expert on spatial understanding data with cross-entropy loss only. Geometry predictions are made through lightweight transformer heads for local points, camera poses, and global points, while semantic outputs are generated through standard text de-tokenization.

## Key Results
- Achieves depth estimation performance comparable to specialized models (Abs Rel ~0.297 on Sintel)
- Outperforms GPT-4o by 18.5 points on SPAR-Bench spatial reasoning benchmark
- Demonstrates strong point cloud reconstruction on Co3Dv2 dataset
- Shows effective camera pose estimation despite simplified architectural design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Shared self-attention between geometric and semantic experts enables mutual improvement across both reconstruction and reasoning tasks. The Mixture-of-Transformer-Experts architecture routes tokens through specialized FFN layers (geometric vs. semantic) while sharing QKV self-attention, allowing geometric features to be attended to by semantic tokens during inference. Core assumption: Geometric representations learned through explicit 3D supervision provide signal not accessible through language-based training alone.

### Mechanism 2
Dual-encoder design (DINO + Qwen/CLIP) provides complementary visual representations that benefit both low-level geometry and high-level reasoning. DINO self-supervised features encode dense spatial structure suited for 3D reconstruction; CLIP/Qwen features encode semantic content. Both streams flow through shared attention, allowing cross-modal grounding. Core assumption: Single-encoder approaches lack sufficient low-level geometric signal or high-level semantic grounding.

### Mechanism 3
Two-stage training with frozen geometric expert during joint training preserves geometry capability while enabling semantic expert to learn geometric feature utilization. Stage 1 trains geometric expert from scratch on 3D-annotated data. Stage 2 freezes geometric expert and trains semantic expert with CE loss only, forcing in-context learning of geometric features without corrupting pretrained geometry. Core assumption: The semantic expert can learn to query geometric representations through attention without requiring gradient flow into the geometric expert.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feed-forward visual geometry models (DUSt3R, VGGT, π3)
  - Why needed here: G2VLM's geometric expert architecture and loss functions directly inherit from this line of work; understanding point map regression, camera pose estimation, and multi-view reconstruction is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why DUSt3R predicts pixel-aligned 3D point maps rather than using explicit depth + pose optimization pipelines?

- Concept: Mixture-of-Experts routing with shared layers
  - Why needed here: The MoT architecture differs from standard MoE by sharing self-attention across experts while isolating FFNs; this design choice enables cross-expert communication.
  - Quick check question: How does Mixture-of-Transformer-Experts differ from standard Mixture-of-Experts routing (e.g., Switch Transformer)?

- Concept: The two-streams hypothesis (ventral/dorsal pathways)
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly draws architectural inspiration from this neuroscience framework; semantic expert ~ ventral "what" pathway, geometric expert ~ dorsal "where" pathway.
  - Quick check question: What computational advantages might separate processing streams provide over unified representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: N RGB images → processed by two parallel vision encoders
  - DINO encoder → linear projection → geometric perception expert (28 layers)
  - Qwen2-VL encoder → semantic perception expert (28 layers)
  - Both experts share QKV self-attention, have separate FFNs
  - Geometric expert outputs → lightweight transformer geometry heads (local points, camera poses, global points)
  - Semantic expert outputs → text de-tokenizer → language response

- Critical path: Geometric expert pretraining (100K + 20K iterations) → freeze geometric expert → joint training with spatial understanding data (16K iterations) → inference with interleaved reasoning capability

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Global attention vs. frame-wise attention: Global attention chosen for LLM compatibility and better geometry/reasoning interplay, though may be less efficient for long video sequences
  - CE-only joint training vs. VG+CE: CE-only sacrifices some spatial reasoning performance for scalability (no 3D annotations needed for stage 2); VG+CE variant (G2VLM-SR) achieves better performance but requires 3D data
  - No register tokens, no camera tokens: Simplified design for permutation equivariance and LLM compatibility, but may sacrifice some geometric precision

- Failure signatures:
  - Training instability with large-scale models (explicitly noted as limitation)
  - Loss spikes from noisy 3D annotations (mitigated by loss clipping at 10)
  - Degraded geometry if geometric expert is not frozen during joint training

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce single-frame depth estimation on Sintel/NYU-V2 to validate geometric expert pretraining; verify Abs Rel metric matches reported ~0.297
  2. Ablate encoder design: train with single CLIP encoder for both experts vs. dual encoder to confirm ~5-10% geometry degradation
  3. Run spatial reasoning inference with and without geometric expert attention masking disabled; compare SPAR-Bench scores to quantify interplay contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the training instability observed in large-scale versions of the model be resolved to allow G2VLM to scale effectively beyond its current size? Basis: The Conclusion states training instability with large-scale models requires advanced optimization techniques and significant computational resources. This challenge arises when attempting to scale the unified architecture to larger sizes, preventing exploration of the model's full potential. Evidence: Successful training of a 7B or larger variant without degradation in geometric fidelity or language capabilities, utilizing novel optimization techniques.

### Open Question 2
Can a training strategy be developed that combines the high performance of the "VG + CE Loss" approach with the data scalability of the "CE Loss Only" approach? Basis: Section 3.3 notes "VG + CE Loss" yields strongest results but "requires a large-scale 3D annotated dataset... which limits its scalability," while "CE Loss Only" preserves geometry but may underperform on complex spatial reasoning tasks. Evidence: A training method achieving equivalent performance to "VG + CE" baseline on spatial reasoning benchmarks while utilizing only the abundant 2D data available to "CE Loss Only" strategy.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does the removal of specific architectural priors, such as register tokens and camera tokens, limit the theoretical performance ceiling of the geometric perception expert? Basis: Section 3.1 states authors "simplify some designs such as not incorporating register tokens... and remove the camera token designs," yet Table 1a shows G2VLM performs notably worse on Camera Pose Estimation (AUC@30) compared to VGGT (74.81 vs 88.59). Evidence: An ablation study reintroducing camera tokens or register tokens to isolate their contribution to the accuracy gap in camera pose estimation relative to specialized models like VGGT.

## Limitations
- Training instability with large-scale models requires advanced optimization techniques and significant computational resources
- Performance trade-off between the data-hungry "VG + CE Loss" approach and the scalable but potentially underperforming "CE Loss Only" approach
- Architectural simplifications (no register tokens, no camera tokens) may limit geometric precision compared to specialized models

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Depth and point cloud reconstruction performance metrics (Sintel, NYU-V2, Co3Dv2) are well-established benchmarks with clear evaluation protocols
- **Medium confidence**: Spatial reasoning improvements over GPT-4o on SPAR-Bench are credible given controlled comparison, but 18.5-point gap should be interpreted cautiously
- **Low confidence**: The claim that geometric features "directly enhance" semantic reasoning through shared attention is the weakest link - evidence shows correlation but not necessarily causation

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on geometric expert freezing**: Run Stage 2 training with trainable geometric expert (CE+CE variant) and compare both geometry and reasoning performance to verify that freezing is necessary for preserving geometric capability while enabling semantic learning

2. **Feature importance analysis**: Use attention visualization or feature attribution methods to quantify whether semantic expert's attention weights on geometric tokens actually encode geometric information versus random noise, particularly on spatial reasoning queries

3. **Generalization stress test**: Evaluate G2VLM on novel object categories (e.g., ScanNet objects not seen during pretraining) to determine whether the geometric expert's representations are category-specific or learn generalizable 3D priors
