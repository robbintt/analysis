# Systematic Optimization of Open Source Large Language Models for Mathematical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.07238
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07238
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Achieves 29.4% computational cost reduction and 23.9% inference speed improvement while maintaining accuracy through inference-time parameter optimization

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a systematic optimization framework for deploying large language models in mathematical reasoning tasks, addressing critical production constraints around computational efficiency, cost, and inference speed. The authors develop a multi-objective optimization approach that tunes inference parameters—temperature, reasoning steps, planning intervals, and nucleus sampling—across five state-of-the-art open source models. Through extensive experimentation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, the framework achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining solution accuracy. The research identifies universal optimization patterns, including the consistent benefits of lower temperature (0.1-0.4) and reduced reasoning steps (4-6), applicable across diverse model architectures. These findings provide actionable configurations for efficient, accurate, and scalable deployment of LLMs in real-world mathematical reasoning applications.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a three-phase optimization approach: baseline establishment with default parameters, smart grid search over 300 possible configurations reduced to 8-15 per model through strategic sampling, and iterative refinement around promising configurations. The optimization targets inference parameters P={temperature, reasoning steps, planning intervals, top-p} using a multi-objective function f(θ,M) = α·Accuracy + β·Efficiency + γ·Speed with weights α=0.4, β=0.4, γ=0.2. Performance is evaluated on 50 curated problems from GSM8K, measuring accuracy, cost-of-pass (tokens per correct answer), and inference time. Paired t-tests with α=0.05 and bootstrap confidence intervals validate improvements across five diverse models.

## Key Results
- Achieved 29.4% average computational cost reduction and 23.9% inference speed improvement while maintaining accuracy
- DeepSeek-V3 achieved highest accuracy (98%) but Mixtral-8x22B demonstrated most cost-effective performance (361.5 tokens per accurate response)
- Universal optimization patterns identified: lower temperature (0.1-0.4) and reduced reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency across all models
- 60% of top configurations employed ≤6 reasoning steps, showing focused reasoning often outperforms exhaustive exploration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Lower temperature settings (0.1-0.4) improve mathematical reasoning precision while reducing computational waste. Temperature controls the sharpness of the probability distribution over tokens, making the model more deterministic at lower values. For mathematical reasoning with typically one correct answer, reduced randomness decreases arithmetic errors and hallucinated steps. Core assumption: mathematical problems converge on narrow, correct solution paths rather than requiring creative exploration.

### Mechanism 2
Limiting reasoning steps to 4-6 maintains accuracy while reducing token consumption and latency. The data suggests many mathematical problems can be solved with focused, concise reasoning chains. Excessive steps often represent redundant verification or unproductive exploration rather than genuine reasoning depth. Core assumption: optimal solutions for tested problems do not require exhaustive step-by-step decomposition.

### Mechanism 3
Multi-objective optimization with weighted accuracy (α=0.4), efficiency (β=0.4), and speed (γ=0.2) yields production-ready configurations. Smart grid search samples promising parameter combinations rather than exhaustively testing all 300 possibilities, balancing exploration with computational tractability. Core assumption: the weight ratios (40/40/20) reflect production priorities where accuracy and efficiency matter more than raw speed.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Inference-time vs. Training-time Optimization**
  - Why needed here: This paper exclusively tunes inference parameters—no weights are modified. Understanding this distinction prevents confusion with fine-tuning or RL approaches.
  - Quick check question: Does changing temperature modify the model's learned parameters?

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The "reasoning steps" parameter directly controls CoT depth. Understanding CoT helps interpret why bounded steps can maintain accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What does a 4-step reasoning chain sacrifice compared to a 12-step chain on a complex algebra problem?

- **Concept: Nucleus Sampling (Top-p)**
  - Why needed here: The paper optimizes top-p alongside temperature. Top-p truncates the token distribution to the top cumulative probability mass, controlling diversity differently than temperature.
  - Quick check question: If temperature=0.1 and top-p=0.98, which parameter dominates the sampling behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  BaseAgent (model interface) -> ReActAgent (reasoning orchestration, Think-Act-Observe loops) -> AdaptivePlanner (dynamic plan revision at interval I) -> CostTracker (real-time token/time monitoring) -> ModelManager (unified inference pipeline)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Establish baseline performance with default configurations (Section 3.3, Phase 1)
  2. Run smart grid search over P = {T, S, I, P} with 8 configurations per model (Section 3.3, Phase 2)
  3. Evaluate on curated benchmark, compute Cost-of-Pass metric
  4. Iteratively refine around promising configurations (Section 3.3, Phase 3)
  5. Validate with paired t-tests, α=0.05 (Section 3.7)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Accuracy vs. Cost: DeepSeek-V3 achieves 98% accuracy but at higher token cost than Mixtral-8x22B (361.5 tokens/accurate response)
  - Speed vs. Accuracy: Yi-Lightning gains 33% speed but at 70.1% accuracy vs. DeepSeek-V3's 98%
  - Search thoroughness vs. Compute budget: 8 configs vs. 300 exhaustive—may miss global optimum

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Over-constrained steps (S=4) on complex problems → truncated solutions, accuracy drops
  - Temperature too low (T<0.1) → repetitive outputs, failure to explore alternative approaches
  - Planning interval mismatch → unnecessary re-planning overhead or insufficient adaptation
  - Assumption: The paper does not report failure modes explicitly; these are inferred from the parameter ranges tested.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce baseline vs. optimized comparison for one model (e.g., Mixtral-8x22B) on 20 GSM8K problems to validate the 24.8% cost reduction claim.
  2. Ablate temperature: Fix all other parameters, test T ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} to verify the 0.1-0.4 superiority on your specific problem distribution.
  3. Stress-test reasoning step bounds: Apply S=4 and S=12 to a held-out set of harder problems (e.g., MATH dataset) to identify where the 4-6 step heuristic breaks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can dynamic parameter adaptation systems that adjust temperature, reasoning steps, and planning intervals based on real-time problem complexity outperform the static optimized configurations found in this study?
  - Basis in paper: Section 6.3 states "Dynamic Parameter Adaptation represents an opportunity to develop systems that automatically adjust parameters for different problem complexities and contexts, potentially achieving efficiency gains that are even better."
  - Why unresolved: The current framework uses fixed optimal configurations per model; no adaptive parameter adjustment during inference was tested.

- **Open Question 2:** Would the discovered universal optimization patterns (low temperature 0.1-0.4, reduced reasoning steps 4-6) generalize to other mathematical benchmarks beyond the GSM8K subset used in this study?
  - Basis in paper: The paper evaluated only 50 problems from GSM8K; Section 3.5 mentions the dataset but does not test on other benchmarks like MATH, AIME, or competition-level problems.
  - Why unresolved: Limited benchmark diversity makes it unclear whether findings apply to harder mathematical reasoning tasks or different problem distributions.

- **Open Question 3:** Can multi-model ensemble approaches combining complementary strengths (e.g., DeepSeek-V3's accuracy with Yi-Lightning's speed) achieve superior performance compared to single-model optimized deployments?
  - Basis in paper: Section 6.3 states "Multi-Model Ensemble Optimization could leverage the strengths of different optimized models which are complementary, combining DeepSeek-V3's accuracy with Yi-Lightning's speed for overall performance being the most superior."
  - Why unresolved: No ensemble experiments were conducted; each model was optimized independently.

## Limitations

- **Benchmark Scope Uncertainty:** The study's optimization patterns are validated on GSM8K, a curated grade-school math dataset. While findings suggest universal applicability, optimal temperature (0.1-0.4) and reasoning step (4-6) ranges may not generalize to advanced mathematical domains like competition mathematics or formal proofs.

- **Multi-Objective Weight Sensitivity:** The paper claims α=0.4, β=0.4, γ=0.2 weights are "determined through preliminary experiments" but does not report these preliminary results or sensitivity analysis. Different production contexts may require different weightings, yet the framework's adaptability to such scenarios remains unverified.

- **Computational Cost Attribution:** While the framework achieves 29.4% cost reduction, the paper does not decompose savings by parameter change. Without this breakdown, practitioners cannot optimize their tuning efforts efficiently.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The 29.4% average computational cost reduction is well-supported by paired t-tests (α=0.05) and bootstrap confidence intervals across five diverse models.
- Temperature (0.1-0.4) and reasoning step (4-6) ranges consistently improve efficiency without accuracy loss on GSM8K.
- DeepSeek-V3's 98% accuracy and Mixtral-8x22B's cost-effectiveness (361.5 tokens/accurate response) are empirically validated.

**Medium Confidence:**
- The universal applicability of the identified optimization patterns across different model architectures.
- The sufficiency of 8-15 sampled configurations per model to find near-optimal solutions within the 300-combination space.
- The multi-objective weightings (α=0.4, β=0.4, γ=0.2) reflect optimal production priorities.

**Low Confidence:**
- Generalization to more complex mathematical reasoning tasks beyond GSM8K.
- Applicability to encoder-decoder or domain-specific mathematical models not tested.
- The exact mechanism by which temperature and reasoning steps interact to produce efficiency gains.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Dataset Validation:** Apply the optimized configurations to the MATH dataset (competition mathematics) and IMO-AG-30 (International Mathematical Olympiad problems). Compare accuracy retention and cost reduction against GSM8K results to quantify domain generalization limits.

2. **Parameter Attribution Analysis:** Conduct an ablation study isolating each parameter's contribution to the 29.4% cost reduction. For each model, test configurations varying only one parameter at a time (e.g., fix S=6, vary only T∈[0.1,0.5]) to identify the primary drivers of efficiency gains.

3. **Weight Sensitivity Testing:** Systematically vary the multi-objective weights (α, β, γ) across a grid (e.g., α∈{0.2,0.4,0.6}, β∈{0.2,0.4,0.6}, γ∈{0.1,0.2,0.3}) and evaluate performance on a held-out validation set. Identify whether the claimed 40/40/20 weighting is robust or context-dependent.
