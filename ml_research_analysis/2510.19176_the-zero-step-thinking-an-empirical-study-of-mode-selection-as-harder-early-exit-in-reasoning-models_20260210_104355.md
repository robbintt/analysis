- This paper introduces Mode Selection as a harder variant of Early Exit in reasoning models, showing that prompt-based methods often fail due to limited classification capabilities while internal states-based methods perform better but still exhibit instability.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates Mode Selection as a challenging variant of Early Exit in reasoning models, where the goal is to determine whether a model should use Long-CoT (THINKING) or Short-CoT (NOTHINKING) before explicit reasoning begins. Through extensive experiments across four benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME25, and GPQA-D) using three model scales (1.5B, 7B, and 32B), the study reveals that prompt-based methods often fail due to limited classification capabilities when provided with minimal information. In contrast, internal states-based methods, which leverage model internal signals, generally perform better but still exhibit instability. The findings indicate that existing methods relying solely on model-provided information are insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. The study also demonstrates that as model size increases, the effectiveness of Mode Selection diminishes, with NOTHINKING sometimes producing longer outputs than THINKING, suggesting that LRMs may have internalized the reasoning process and struggle to bypass it effectively.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates Mode Selection through nine baselines: THINKING, NOTHINKING, FLASHTHINK, PROMPTCONF, DYNASOR-COT, PRE-JUDGE, PROBECONF, DEER, and ENTROPY. These methods decide between Long-CoT (THINKING) and Short-CoT (NOTHINKING) modes using either prompt-based classification or internal model states. Experiments use DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen models (1.5B/7B/32B) on GSM8K (1,319 problems), MATH-500 (500 problems), AIME25 (30 problems), and GPQA-D (198 questions). The evaluation measures accuracy, token count, NOTHINKING Ratio (NR), ROC-AUC, Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and Brier score. Zero-shot CoT with temperature 0.6 and max 16,384 tokens is used, with prompt templates including "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." PROBECONF uses pre-trained MLP probing from MATH-500, while FLASHTHINK employs Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as verification model.

## Key Results
- Prompt-based methods (FLASHTHINK) consistently fail at zero-step mode selection, achieving 0% NR across all scenarios due to insufficient information in fake thoughts
- Internal states-based methods (PROBECONF, DEER) generally outperform prompt-based approaches, with PROBECONF achieving +6.7 accuracy improvement on AIME25 with 23.8% token reduction for 1.5B model
- As model size increases from 1.5B to 32B, Mode Selection effectiveness diminishes, with NOTHINKING sometimes generating more tokens than THINKING on AIME25 and MATH-500 datasets
- Performance gaps between methods narrow across model scales, indicating that larger models struggle to effectively bypass internalized reasoning processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Mode Selection can be formalized as a variant of Early Exit operating at zero reasoning steps, sharing the same Exit(·) abstraction but with strictly less information.
- **Mechanism:** Both Early Exit and Mode Selection use a monitor function Exit(Q, context) to decide whether to truncate reasoning. Early Exit applies this iteratively with Exit(Q, T_<i) using actual reasoning trajectory T_<i. Mode Selection applies Exit(Q, T^fake_0) using only pre-defined fake thoughts (e.g., "Okay, I think I have finished thinking."), providing no question-specific reasoning signal.
- **Core assumption:** The same monitoring mechanisms developed for iterative exit decisions can transfer to static, pre-reasoning decisions despite the severe information asymmetry.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Mode Selection must make this decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as zero-step thinking."
  - [section 3.2] "Early Exit iteratively performs Exit(Q, T_<i) at each reasoning step, while Mode Selection executes Exit(Q, T^fake_0) by replacing dynamically generated [Thoughts] with pre-defined [Fake Thoughts]."
  - [corpus] Related work on Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks (arxiv:2505.18088) demonstrates early-exit mechanisms trade depth for confidence adaptively—a principle this paper extends to reasoning depth.
- **Break condition:** When the model's internal representations at zero-step contain insufficient signal about problem difficulty; empirical results show this occurs frequently for prompt-based methods (FLASHTHINK achieves 0% mode switching across all scenarios).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Internal model states (hidden representations, output logits) encode more reliable signals for mode selection than prompt-based classification because they preserve latent difficulty assessments that cannot be verbalized.
- **Mechanism:** Methods like PROBECONF extract hidden states h_i from the last token position at fake thought boundaries and feed them to trained MLP classifiers. DEER computes confidence from output logits over induced trial answers. These internal signals bypass the bottleneck of forcing explicit verbalized judgments with minimal context.
- **Core assumption:** Hidden states at the zero-step position contain meaningful representations of problem difficulty or solvability, even before any reasoning has occurred.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.2] "Internal States Tell More Than Language...signals from the model's internal states provide more reliable indicators for selecting the appropriate mode."
  - [table 1] PROBECONF achieves +6.7 accuracy improvement on AIME25 with 23.8% token reduction for 1.5B model; DEER achieves +0.3 accuracy with 7.6% token reduction on GSM8K for 32B model.
  - [corpus] Confidence-gated training (arxiv:2509.17885) validates that intermediate layer confidence correlates with prediction quality—a structural parallel to zero-step hidden state probing.
- **Break condition:** Threshold sensitivity varies unpredictably across tasks and model scales (section 5.1 shows performance gaps narrow from 1.5B to 32B; NOTHINKING can paradoxically generate more tokens than THINKING on some datasets).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Prompt-based methods fail at zero-step mode selection because classification requires reasoning context that fake thoughts cannot provide.
- **Mechanism:** FLASHTHINK uses a separate verification model π_φ to judge thought sufficiency. At zero-step, the verification prompt receives only the question and fake thoughts, lacking any actual reasoning trajectory to evaluate. This forces conservative decisions (always continue thinking).
- **Core assumption:** The paper assumes the failure stems from "limited classification capabilities when provided with minimal information"—implying the verifier cannot distinguish problem difficulty from question text alone.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification capabilities when provided with minimal information."
  - [section 4.2] "Due to the limited information available from fake thoughts T^fake_0, FLASHTHINK consistently determines that LRMs must continue reasoning, leading to a 0% NR rate across all scenarios."
  - [corpus] Corpus does not contain direct studies on zero-context classification failure; this mechanism lacks external validation.
- **Break condition:** When questions contain explicit difficulty markers in their text (e.g., "AIME" or "PhD-level"), prompt-based methods might recover; the paper does not isolate this factor.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper assumes familiarity with how LRMs generate intermediate reasoning steps (T_1, ..., T_n) auto-regressively, and how truncating this process affects output quality. Without this, the distinction between Early Exit (mid-process truncation) and Mode Selection (pre-process truncation) is unclear.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why appending " \
" tokens terminates reasoning in models like DeepSeek-R1?

- **Concept: Calibration Metrics (ECE, Brier Score, ROC-AUC)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper evaluates mode selection quality using Expected Calibration Error, Brier score, and ROC-AUC to assess whether confidence scores C_i correlate with actual NOTHINKING correctness. Understanding these metrics is essential to interpret why "existing evaluation metrics are insufficient."
  - **Quick check question:** If a method has low ECE but poor accuracy, what does this imply about its confidence estimates?

- **Concept: Hidden State Probing**
  - **Why needed here:** PROBECONF trains MLP classifiers on hidden states to predict answer correctness. The paper assumes readers understand that layer activations can encode task-relevant information beyond output tokens.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would the last token's hidden state at a fake thought boundary contain useful signal about problem difficulty?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - **THINKING mode:** [Prompt] + \
 + [Generated Thoughts] + \
 + [Conclusion]
  - **NOTHINKING mode:** [Prompt] + \
 + [Fake Thoughts] + \
 + [Conclusion]
  - **Exit(Q, context):** Unified decision function; takes question + context, returns boolean for mode/exit
  - **Monitor implementations:**
    - Prompt-based: External verifier (FLASHTHINK) or self-generated confidence (PROMPTCONF)
    - Internal states-based: Hidden state probing (PROBECONF), logit entropy (ENTROPY), induced answer confidence (DEER)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Question Q arrives
  2. Construct NOTHINKING prompt with fake thoughts T^fake_0
  3. Apply Exit(Q, T^fake_0) using chosen monitor method
  4. If exit signal s_i = true: generate conclusion directly
  5. If s_i = false: switch to THINKING mode, generate full reasoning

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Threshold selection:** Paper manually selects optimal λ per method/dataset; no universal threshold works (section 5.1 shows curves shift dramatically across model scales)
  - **Prompt-based vs. Internal states:** Prompt-based requires no training but fails at zero-step; internal states require probe training but capture richer signal
  - **Fake thought design:** Empty (\
) vs. explicit completion ("Okay, I think I have finished thinking.")—paper uses the latter but does not ablate

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Always-THINKING (NR ≈ 0%):** Threshold too high or monitor never confident at zero-step (FLASHTHINK pattern)
  - **Accuracy collapse with token reduction:** Threshold too low, forcing NOTHINKING on hard problems (NOTHINKING baseline: -13.0 accuracy on GSM8K for 1.5B)
  - **Paradoxical token increase:** On 32B models, NOTHINKING generates more tokens than THINKING on AIME25/MATH-500—model "restarts" reasoning after fake thoughts

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce threshold sweep (Figure 2):** For DEER on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, sweep λ ∈ {0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0} on GSM8K; plot accuracy vs. token count curve to verify Pareto frontier shape.
  2. **Ablate fake thought design:** Compare empty  \
 vs. explicit completion on MATH-500 using PROBECONF; measure accuracy gap and NR variance.
  3. **Test calibration correlation:** For PROBECONF on 7B model, compute Pearson correlation between confidence C_i and NOTHINKING per-sample correctness; verify whether Brier score (Table 2) aligns with ROC-AUC (Figure 3b).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we design robust monitoring mechanisms that overcome the information bottleneck of "zero-step" thinking to perform reliable Mode Selection?
- Basis: [explicit] The authors conclude that "existing methods... are insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection" and highlight the "need for more robust approaches that better exploit model internal mechanisms."
- Why unresolved: Current prompt-based methods fail due to minimal information, and internal states-based methods struggle with instability, leaving a gap in effective zero-step decision-making.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that maintains high ROC-AUC and low calibration error on "zero-step" inputs without relying on reasoning trajectories.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What evaluation metrics can accurately assess Mode Selection performance and explain the underlying causes of method success or failure?
- Basis: [explicit] The analysis shows that "existing evaluation metrics are insufficient for fully assessing and explaining the underlying reasons behind the performance of different methods," specifically noting the disconnect between confidence scores and accuracy in smaller models.
- Why unresolved: Standard metrics like ROC-AUC, ECE, and Brier score failed to consistently correlate with performance across the 1.5B and 7B models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new metric framework that correlates strongly with task accuracy and token reduction across all model scales (1.5B–32B).

### Open Question 3
- Question: What mechanistic factors cause large reasoning models (e.g., 32B) to "restart" reasoning when forced into NoThinking mode, leading to increased token usage?
- Basis: [inferred] In Section 5.1, the authors observe that for the 32B model, NoThinking sometimes generates *more* tokens than Thinking, hypothesizing that forcing fake thoughts may cause the model to restart its internal reasoning process.
- Why unresolved: The paper documents this counter-intuitive behavior but does not identify the specific internal representations or attention mechanisms driving this failure mode.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mechanistic interpretability study (e.g., attention head analysis) identifying the circuits activated by fake thoughts in large models versus small models.

## Limitations
- The study focuses on mathematical reasoning tasks and may not generalize to other domains or larger frontier models
- Performance evaluation relies on manually selected optimal thresholds, which may not reflect practical deployment scenarios
- The paper does not explore hybrid approaches that could combine strengths of prompt-based and internal-state methods
- The counter-intuitive behavior of larger models (NOTHINKING generating more tokens than THINKING) is documented but not fully explained

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The empirical observation that prompt-based methods (particularly FLASHTHINK) fail at zero-step mode selection due to insufficient information in fake thoughts is well-supported by consistent 0% NR rates across all tested scenarios. The comparison framework between Early Exit and Mode Selection is logically sound and clearly articulated.

- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that internal state-based methods generally outperform prompt-based approaches is supported by the data, but the performance differences vary substantially across datasets and model scales. The paper acknowledges instability but does not fully characterize when and why these methods succeed or fail. The analysis of why larger models show diminished returns and sometimes paradoxical behavior (NOTHINKING generating more tokens than THINKING) is suggestive but not definitively explained.

- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that Mode Selection represents a fundamentally "harder" variant of Early Exit is primarily definitional rather than empirically proven. While the paper demonstrates that Mode Selection is more challenging under current methods, it does not establish that this difficulty is inherent to the task structure rather than a limitation of existing approaches.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Evaluate the same mode selection methods on a diverse set of reasoning tasks (e.g., code generation, scientific reasoning, or commonsense reasoning benchmarks) to assess whether the observed performance patterns generalize beyond mathematical problem-solving.

2. **Hybrid Method Exploration:** Implement and test hybrid approaches that combine prompt-based and internal-state signals (e.g., using prompt confidence as a prior and internal states as refinement) to determine if this addresses the limitations of pure methods.

3. **Real-Time Threshold Adaptation:** Develop and evaluate an adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts based on observed performance rather than requiring manual optimization per dataset, to better reflect practical deployment constraints.
