core_contribution: This paper introduces Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts
  (GS-MoE), a novel approach for weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD)
  that addresses the limitations of current methods in detecting complex, real-world
  anomalies. The key innovations are (1) Temporal Gaussian Splatting (TGS), which
  uses Gaussian kernels to create a more complete representation of anomalies along
  the temporal dimension, allowing the model to learn from subtle, low-scoring anomalous
  snippets that traditional methods overlook, and (2) a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
  where each expert is specialized to capture specific anomaly types, with a gate
  model integrating these predictions with coarse-level features to leverage anomaly

# Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06318
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06318
- Reference count: 40
- GS-MoE achieves 91.58% AUC on UCF-Crime, outperforming previous methods by 3.56%

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel approach for weakly-supervised video anomaly detection that addresses the limitations of current methods in detecting complex, real-world anomalies. The key innovations are Temporal Gaussian Splatting (TGS), which uses Gaussian kernels to create a more complete representation of anomalies along the temporal dimension, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is specialized to capture specific anomaly types. GS-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.58% AUC on UCF-Crime, outperforming previous methods by 3.56%, and demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence (82.89% AP) and MSAD (87.72% AUC) datasets.

## Method Summary
GS-MoE combines Temporal Gaussian Splatting with a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to address the challenges of weakly-supervised video anomaly detection. The Temporal Gaussian Splatting component uses Gaussian kernels to represent temporal information, allowing the model to learn from subtle, low-scoring anomalous snippets that traditional methods overlook. The MoE architecture consists of multiple expert models, each specialized to capture specific anomaly types, with a gate model that integrates these predictions with coarse-level features to leverage anomaly correlations. This approach enables the model to detect complex anomalies like shoplifting and burglary more effectively than existing methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91.58% AUC on UCF-Crime, outperforming previous methods by 3.56%
- Demonstrates 82.89% AP on XD-Violence dataset
- Shows 87.72% AUC on MSAD dataset
- Achieves up to 24.3% improvement over baselines on specific anomaly categories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GS-MoE works by addressing two fundamental limitations of existing weakly-supervised video anomaly detection methods. First, Temporal Gaussian Splatting captures temporal patterns more effectively than traditional approaches by representing time intervals with Gaussian kernels, allowing the model to learn from subtle temporal anomalies that would otherwise be missed. Second, the Mixture-of-Experts architecture enables specialization, where each expert focuses on detecting specific types of anomalies, while the gate model intelligently combines these specialized predictions with broader contextual features. This dual approach allows GS-MoE to detect both subtle and complex anomalies that previous methods struggle with.

## Foundational Learning
- Temporal Gaussian Splatting: Gaussian kernels used to represent temporal information along the time axis
  - Why needed: Traditional temporal pooling methods often miss subtle anomalies or fail to capture complex temporal patterns
  - Quick check: Verify that Gaussian representations can effectively model varying anomaly durations and intensities

- Mixture-of-Experts architecture: Multiple specialized models combined through a gating mechanism
  - Why needed: Single model approaches cannot capture the diverse nature of different anomaly types
  - Quick check: Ensure each expert can specialize effectively without overfitting to specific anomaly patterns

- Weak supervision learning: Training with only video-level labels rather than frame-level annotations
  - Why needed: Frame-level annotations are expensive and impractical for large-scale surveillance applications
  - Quick check: Validate that video-level supervision provides sufficient signal for effective anomaly detection

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Video frames -> Temporal Gaussian Splatting -> Multiple Expert Models -> Gate Model -> Anomaly Detection Output

Critical Path: The most critical components are the Temporal Gaussian Splatting layer and the gate model. TGS must effectively represent temporal information for the experts to learn meaningful patterns, while the gate model must correctly integrate specialized expert predictions with coarse features.

Design Tradeoffs: The MoE architecture trades increased model complexity and computational cost for improved detection accuracy and specialization. The number of experts must be balanced against computational constraints and the diversity of anomalies in the target domain.

Failure Signatures: The model may fail when anomalies are extremely subtle (below the sensitivity threshold of TGS), when anomalies share too many characteristics with normal events, or when the gate model incorrectly weights expert predictions due to insufficient training data.

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study removing TGS to quantify its contribution to overall performance
2. Single expert baseline comparison to demonstrate MoE benefits
3. Varying the number of experts to find optimal balance between specialization and computational efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalization capability across diverse anomaly detection scenarios beyond tested datasets remains uncertain
- Computational efficiency and scalability of the MoE component for real-time surveillance applications not thoroughly analyzed
- Performance on extremely subtle or rare anomalies with very brief durations not fully characterized

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- The overall methodology and architectural innovations are technically sound
- The reported performance improvements on tested datasets are statistically significant
- The ablation study results consistently validate the importance of TGS and MoE components

Medium Confidence:
- The claim that class-specific fine-grained representations are essential for detecting subtle anomalies requires validation on more diverse datasets
- The model's effectiveness for complex anomalies like shoplifting and burglary may not generalize to all anomaly types
- The practical deployment feasibility is suggested but not thoroughly validated

Low Confidence:
- The model's performance in real-time surveillance scenarios with computational constraints
- The generalizability to anomalies not present in the training datasets
- The robustness to adversarial examples or intentionally obfuscated anomalies

## Next Checks

1. Cross-dataset Transferability Test: Evaluate GS-MoE's performance when trained on one dataset and tested on completely different anomaly detection datasets not seen during training, to assess true generalization capabilities.

2. Computational Efficiency Analysis: Conduct detailed benchmarking of training time, inference speed, and resource utilization across different hardware configurations to determine practical deployment feasibility in real-time surveillance systems.

3. Anomaly Duration Robustness Test: Systematically vary the duration of anomalous events in synthetic test scenarios to determine the minimum anomaly duration GS-MoE can reliably detect, and identify potential failure modes for extremely brief anomalies.
