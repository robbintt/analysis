core_contribution: This paper provides the first theoretical explanation for why state-of-the-art
  OOD detection methods fail catastrophically on single-domain datasets through the

# Domain Feature Collapse: Implications for Out-of-Distribution Detection and Solutions
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04034
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04034
- Reference count: 40
- Single-domain datasets cause domain feature collapse, making OOD detection fail catastrophically

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the concept of "domain feature collapse" - a fundamental limitation of supervised learning on single-domain datasets that explains why state-of-the-art OOD detection methods fail on such data. Through information-theoretic analysis, the authors prove that models trained on single domains inevitably discard domain-specific information (achieving I(x_d; z) = 0) because they can rely solely on class-specific features. This leads to catastrophic OOD detection performance, with models achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST. The authors validate their theory through Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving domain information (I(x_d; z) > 0) through domain filtering resolves this failure mode.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets designed to evaluate OOD detection performance. They propose domain filtering as a solution - using pretrained representations to identify and filter out domain-specific features before fine-tuning on target datasets. This approach preserves I(x_d; z) > 0 by maintaining domain information in the learned representations. The method is evaluated across multiple single-domain datasets including medical imaging and MNIST variants, comparing performance against standard fine-tuning approaches. The key insight is that when pretrained models are frozen during fine-tuning, domain feature collapse is avoided, leading to significantly improved OOD detection performance.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art OOD detection methods achieve only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST due to domain feature collapse
- Domain filtering with frozen pretrained representations prevents domain feature collapse and improves OOD detection
- Theoretical proof shows supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces I(x_d; z) = 0 when domain features are discarded

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Domain feature collapse occurs because models trained on single-domain data learn to rely exclusively on class-specific features, completely discarding domain information. When I(x_d; z) = 0, the model has no way to distinguish between in-domain and out-of-domain samples since all domain-specific cues are lost. By preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering with frozen pretrained representations, the model maintains discriminative features that can differentiate between domains. This allows the model to detect when test samples come from different distributions than the training data, enabling effective OOD detection even on single-domain datasets.

## Foundational Learning
- Information Theory: Understanding mutual information (I(x_d; z)) is crucial for quantifying domain feature preservation
  - Why needed: Provides the theoretical framework for measuring domain information in representations
  - Quick check: Verify that I(x_d; z) > 0 indicates domain information is preserved

- Out-of-Distribution Detection: Concepts of FPR@95 and OOD detection metrics
  - Why needed: Evaluates the practical impact of domain feature collapse on real-world applications
  - Quick check: Compare OOD detection performance before and after domain filtering

- Pretrained Representations: Understanding how frozen vs fine-tuned models affect feature learning
  - Why needed: Explains why freezing pretrained models prevents domain feature collapse
  - Quick check: Test OOD detection with frozen vs fine-tuned pretrained models

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Input -> Pretrained Model (frozen) -> Domain Filter -> Classifier
- Critical Path: Data → Pretrained Encoder → Domain Filtering → Task-Specific Head
- Design Tradeoffs: Frozen pretrained models preserve domain features but may limit task adaptation
- Failure Signatures: Low OOD detection performance indicates domain feature collapse
- First Experiments:
  1. Evaluate standard fine-tuning on single-domain dataset for OOD detection
  2. Apply domain filtering with frozen pretrained representations
  3. Measure I(x_d; z) to confirm domain information preservation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, focusing instead on providing a theoretical explanation and practical solution for domain feature collapse in single-domain datasets.

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework assumes domain feature collapse always occurs when I(x_d; z) = 0, which may not hold for all single-domain scenarios
- The effectiveness of domain filtering relies heavily on the quality and domain relevance of pretrained representations
- Empirical validation is limited to specific single-domain datasets, potentially limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- High confidence in the theoretical framework explaining domain feature collapse through information theory
- Medium confidence in the empirical validation of domain filtering as a solution, given the limited scope of tested datasets
- Low confidence in the generalizability of the findings to all single-domain datasets and pretrained models

## Next Checks
1. Test the domain filtering approach on a broader range of single-domain datasets, including those with more complex domain-class relationships
2. Evaluate the robustness of the solution across different pretrained model architectures and their impact on OOD detection performance
3. Investigate the trade-offs between preserving I(x_d; z) and maintaining class-specific feature discrimination in scenarios with overlapping domain and class information
