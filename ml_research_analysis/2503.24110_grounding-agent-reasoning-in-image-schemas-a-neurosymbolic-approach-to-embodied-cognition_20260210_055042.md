# Grounding Agent Reasoning in Image Schemas: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Embodied Cognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.24110
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24110
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposes a formal framework for grounding agent reasoning in image schemas using neurosymbolic systems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a formal framework for grounding agent reasoning in image schemas—recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. The authors argue that existing AI systems struggle to capture the embodied conceptual structures humans naturally use to understand and interact with their environment. Their solution involves translating natural language into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, creating a neurosymbolic system that grounds agents' understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. The framework combines symbolic languages with neural architectures, using a non-monotonic quantified equilibrium logic system with evaluable functions to represent spatial relationships and temporal dynamics.

## Method Summary
The method involves translating natural language descriptions into formal image schema representations using a neurosymbolic system. The core formalism employs Quantified Equilibrium Logic with evaluable functions, implementing Declarative Spatial Reasoning (DSR) for spatial constraints and temporal operators for dynamic aspects. A two-stage approach uses LLMs: first to generate initial formalizations, then to fine-tune a specialized translation model on curated datasets pairing natural language with formal representations. The system aims to enable more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.

## Key Results
- Proposes a formal framework for grounding agent reasoning in image schemas using neurosymbolic systems
- Demonstrates how qualitative spatial relations can be computed via parametric constraints in DSR
- Presents a comprehensive treatment of conceptual primitives and their formalization, though complete implementation remains future work

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Qualitative Spatial Relations as Conceptual Grounding
- Claim: Translating natural language into qualitative spatial and temporal relations enables agents to reason with embodied conceptual structures rather than statistical correlations.
- Mechanism: The Declarative Spatial Reasoning (DSR) framework represents objects via parametric functions and defines spatial relations as polynomial constraints. For example, `inside(a, c)` becomes `(xa - xc)² + (ya - yc)² < rc²`.
- Core assumption: Human conceptual understanding is fundamentally structured by image schemas derived from sensorimotor experience.
- Break condition: If image schemas cannot be adequately formalized as first-order logical expressions with evaluable functions.

### Mechanism 2: Non-Monotonic Default Reasoning for Embodied Commonsense
- Claim: Default negation enables efficient encoding of embodied commonsense regularities such as gravity and inertia without explicit enumeration of all exceptions.
- Mechanism: Uses Quantified Equilibrium Logic with default negation to model behaviors like gravity: `□(∀x (¬∃y on(x, y) → moveDown(x)))`.
- Core assumption: Default behaviors derived from physical experience are reliably encodeable as logical defaults.
- Break condition: If the default logic produces unintended stable models or computational complexity scales poorly.

### Mechanism 3: LLM-Mediated Neural-to-Symbolic Translation
- Claim: Fine-tuned LLMs can reliably map natural language descriptions to formal image schema representations.
- Mechanism: A two-stage approach: (1) leverage LLM reasoning capabilities to generate initial formal characterizations, (2) fine-tune a specialized translation model on curated datasets.
- Core assumption: There exists sufficient training data to learn the mapping from linguistic constituents to schema roles and temporal structures.
- Break condition: If the translation model fails to generalize to novel linguistic constructions or produces ill-formed logical expressions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Quantified Equilibrium Logic / Answer Set Programming
  - Why needed here: The formalism uses non-monotonic Quantified Equilibrium Logic with evaluable functions; Clingo (ASP solver) is proposed for implementation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why `¬∃y on(x, y) → moveDown(x)` uses default negation rather than classical negation, and what stable models this program yields?

- **Concept**: Image Schemas and Conceptual Primitives
  - Why needed here: The framework decomposes image schemas into conceptual primitives (OBJECT, CONTAINER, PATH, CONTACT, UMPH, etc.) with specific formal treatments.
  - Quick check question: Which conceptual primitives are required to formalize the SOURCE_PATH_GOAL image schema, and how do they combine?

- **Concept**: Declarative Spatial Reasoning (DSR) Framework
  - Why needed here: DSR provides the mechanism for representing objects parametrically and defining spatial relations as polynomial constraints.
  - Quick check question: Given a point object a with coordinates (xa, ya) and a circular container c with center (xc, yc) and radius rc, write the DSR constraint for `inside(a, c)`.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Natural language descriptions -> Fine-tuned LLM translation -> Formal image schema representations (Quantified Equilibrium Logic + DSR) -> Clingo reasoning engine -> Grounded inferences

- **Critical path**: 1) Curate training dataset from [39, 41], psychological experiments, expert annotations 2) Implement formalization of conceptual primitives in ASP-compatible syntax 3) Fine-tune neural translation model to output well-formed formal expressions 4) Validate outputs against gold-standard annotations 5) Evaluate on downstream tasks

- **Design tradeoffs**: Expressiveness vs. tractability of full first-order temporal logic; data quality vs. scale between expert and LLM-generated annotations; symbolic precision vs. neural robustness

- **Failure signatures**: Translation model outputs syntactically invalid logic; reasoning engine returns no or exponentially many models; analogical mapping fails due to insufficient force-dynamic primitives; default reasoning produces unintended behaviors

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Unit test conceptual primitive formalizations with small scenes 2) Translation accuracy benchmark on held-out sentences from structured databases 3) Analogical mapping validation using solar system/atomic system example

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How can large language models be effectively fine-tuned to reliably map natural language descriptions into the non-monotonic quantified equilibrium logic formalism?
  - Basis: Section 5 states this is "a critical challenge" with proposed two-stage approach but complete implementation remains future work.
  - Why unresolved: Neural architecture for semantic parsing into the formalism is described conceptually but not implemented or validated.
  - Resolution: A trained model demonstrating quantifiable accuracy on translating sentences to formal representations.

- **Open Question 2**: What evaluation metrics beyond exact match can effectively assess a system's ability to identify correct image schemas, assign roles appropriately, and maintain proper temporal structures?
  - Basis: Section 5 states "evaluation of such a system requires going beyond simple accuracy metrics" but mentions partial matching metrics without defining them.
  - Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the need for new metrics but provides no specific proposals.
  - Resolution: A validated evaluation framework with defined metrics correlating with performance on downstream embodied reasoning tasks.

- **Open Question 3**: Can the proposed formalism handle the full compositional complexity of image schemas when multiple conceptual primitives interact?
  - Basis: Section 4 demonstrates individual primitives and simple combinations, but complex interactions lack worked examples.
  - Why unresolved: The paper shows decomposition but does not demonstrate scalability to the full range of compositional structures.
  - Resolution: Formal characterizations of complex image-schematic scenarios validated against human judgment.

## Limitations
- The complete formalization of all image schemas remains unspecified; only fragments are detailed
- No concrete implementation or evaluation results are provided—the work is primarily conceptual
- Neural architecture details for the translation component are absent, making reproduction difficult

## Confidence
- **High**: The conceptual framework for image schema formalization and the role of embodied cognition in human reasoning
- **Medium**: The feasibility of combining ASP-based spatial reasoning with neural translation for NL-to-formal mapping
- **Low**: Practical scalability of the non-monotonic reasoning approach and generalization of neural translation to novel language

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test DSR formalization for basic spatial relations (point-in-circle, contact) to verify computational tractability
2. Conduct a pilot study mapping 50-100 natural language sentences to formal image schema representations using current LLM capabilities
3. Design a small-scale analogical reasoning benchmark (3-5 domain pairs) to validate structural similarity detection via image schema formalizations
