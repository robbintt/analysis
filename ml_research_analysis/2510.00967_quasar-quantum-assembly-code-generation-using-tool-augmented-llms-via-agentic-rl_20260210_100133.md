# QUASAR: Quantum Assembly Code Generation Using Tool-Augmented LLMs via Agentic RL

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00967
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00967
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 99.31% syntactic validity (Pass@1) on quantum assembly code generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces QUASAR, a novel framework that leverages tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) with agentic reinforcement learning to generate quantum assembly code. The key innovation addresses the challenge of producing syntactically correct and semantically meaningful quantum circuits, which is particularly difficult due to the complexity of parameterized gates and the limited quantum domain knowledge in standard LLMs. QUASAR employs an external quantum verification tool combined with a hierarchical reward mechanism that evaluates syntactic correctness, distributional alignment, expectation value accuracy, and optimization efficiency.

Evaluated on a 4B parameter model, QUASAR demonstrates remarkable performance with 99.31% validity in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10 metrics, significantly outperforming leading industrial LLMs and various baselines. The framework successfully generates practical ansatz patterns and parameter initializations for quantum optimization algorithms, bridging the gap between classical code generation techniques and the specialized requirements of quantum circuit synthesis.

## Method Summary
QUASAR employs a tool-augmented LLM architecture enhanced with agentic reinforcement learning to generate quantum assembly code. The framework integrates an external quantum verification tool that provides feedback on generated circuits, enabling the LLM to learn from actual quantum simulation results rather than just textual patterns. A hierarchical reward mechanism evaluates generated code across multiple dimensions: syntactic correctness (valid gate operations and structure), distributional alignment with training data, expectation value accuracy (measured through quantum simulation), and optimization efficiency metrics. The agentic RL component allows the model to iteratively refine its outputs based on this multi-faceted feedback, progressively improving both the correctness and practical utility of generated quantum circuits.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.31% syntactic validity in Pass@1 metric and 100% in Pass@10
- Outperforms leading industrial LLMs in both syntax and semantic performance
- Successfully generates practical ansatz patterns and parameter initializations for quantum optimization algorithms
- Demonstrates effective learning of quantum domain-specific knowledge through tool-augmented reinforcement learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from combining three critical elements: tool augmentation provides ground-truth quantum simulation feedback, hierarchical rewards create a structured learning signal across multiple evaluation dimensions, and agentic RL enables iterative refinement of generated code. This multi-pronged approach addresses both the syntactic complexity of quantum assembly language and the semantic requirements for functional quantum circuits, allowing the LLM to overcome its inherent limitations in quantum domain knowledge.

## Foundational Learning

**Quantum Circuit Syntax** - Understanding gate operations, qubit ordering, and measurement sequences in quantum assembly languages. *Why needed:* Without proper syntax, generated code cannot be executed on quantum hardware or simulators. *Quick check:* Can the model generate valid single- and multi-qubit gate sequences?

**Parameterized Gates** - Handling rotation angles and parameterized operations in quantum circuits. *Why needed:* Most practical quantum algorithms require parameterized gates for optimization and variational approaches. *Quick check:* Does the model correctly place and format parameterized gates in circuit descriptions?

**Expectation Value Calculation** - Computing measurement outcomes and quantum state overlaps. *Why needed:* Semantic correctness requires evaluating whether generated circuits produce desired quantum states. *Quick check:* Can the model generate circuits whose simulated expectation values match target values?

**Reinforcement Learning with Tool Feedback** - Iteratively improving outputs based on external tool evaluations. *Why needed:* Direct quantum simulation provides more reliable feedback than text-based metrics alone. *Quick check:* Does the model's performance improve across training iterations with tool feedback?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM Generator -> Quantum Verification Tool -> Reward Calculator -> RL Agent -> LLM Generator

**Critical Path**: The most critical path is LLM output → Quantum verification → Expectation value calculation → Reward update → Policy improvement, as this loop directly determines whether generated circuits are both syntactically valid and semantically meaningful.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency (requiring quantum simulations for each generated circuit) for accuracy and practical utility. While this makes training more expensive than text-only approaches, it ensures generated code can actually run on quantum hardware rather than just appearing syntactically correct.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include syntactically valid but semantically meaningless circuits (high syntax rewards but low expectation value rewards), reward hacking through pattern memorization without understanding, and optimization getting stuck in local minima due to sparse reward signals in the quantum domain.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Generate simple single-qubit rotation circuits and verify against known quantum states
2. Test parameterized two-qubit gate sequences for basic entanglement patterns
3. Evaluate performance on a small set of standard quantum ansatz patterns with known optimal parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations

- Evaluation limited to a single 4B parameter model and 10 specific ansatz patterns, raising questions about generalizability
- Computationally expensive simulation steps for expectation value estimation may limit scalability to larger qubit counts
- Does not address realistic quantum hardware noise or error mitigation strategies
- Tool-augmented approach creates dependency on external quantum verification tools, potentially introducing brittleness

## Confidence

High confidence in syntactic validity improvements (99.31% Pass@1 demonstrates clear empirical success). Medium confidence in semantic performance gains due to limited generalizability testing and absence of ablation studies on reward components. The controlled experimental conditions and well-defined benchmarks support the core claims, but uncertainty remains about relative advantage against larger frontier models and performance in realistic hardware conditions.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate QUASAR on a broader range of quantum algorithms and circuit depths beyond the current ansatz library to test generalizability
2. Test scalability by benchmarking on models with 10B+ parameters and circuits with >20 qubits to assess computational limits
3. Incorporate realistic noise models and error mitigation strategies to assess robustness in near-term quantum hardware conditions
