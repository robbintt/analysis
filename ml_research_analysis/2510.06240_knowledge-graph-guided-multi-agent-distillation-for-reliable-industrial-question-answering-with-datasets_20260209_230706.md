# Knowledge Graph-Guided Multi-Agent Distillation for Reliable Industrial Question Answering with Datasets

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.06240
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06240
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: KG-MASD improves accuracy by 2.4–20.1% over baselines in industrial QA

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of deploying reliable industrial question-answering (QA) systems by proposing a Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD) framework. The core idea is to integrate structured knowledge graph priors into the multi-agent distillation process, formulating it as a Markov Decision Process to ensure convergence and enhance reliability. By combining collaborative reasoning with knowledge grounding, KG-MASD generates high-confidence instruction-tuning data and distills reasoning depth and verifiability into compact student models. Experiments on an industrial QA dataset show that KG-MASD improves accuracy by 2.4–20.1% over baselines and significantly enhances reliability, enabling trustworthy AI deployment in safety-critical industrial scenarios.

## Method Summary
The KG-MASD framework integrates knowledge graph priors into a multi-agent distillation process by formulating it as a Markov Decision Process. The system uses multiple specialized agents that collaborate through structured reasoning, with knowledge graph grounding ensuring factual consistency. High-confidence responses generated by this collaborative process are used to create instruction-tuning datasets for distilling reasoning capabilities into compact student models. The framework explicitly balances accuracy with reliability through verifiability checks and confidence scoring mechanisms.

## Key Results
- KG-MASD achieves 2.4-20.1% accuracy improvement over baseline models on industrial QA datasets
- The framework demonstrates significant reliability enhancement in safety-critical scenarios
- Compact student models successfully retain reasoning depth and verifiability from larger teacher models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from combining structured knowledge priors with collaborative multi-agent reasoning. The knowledge graph provides factual grounding that prevents hallucination and ensures consistency, while the MDP formulation enables systematic exploration of reasoning paths. The distillation process transfers not just answers but also the reasoning methodology, creating models that can verify their own outputs. The confidence-based filtering ensures only high-quality, verifiable responses are used for training, creating a positive feedback loop that improves both accuracy and reliability.

## Foundational Learning

**Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)** - Mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Needed to formalize the multi-agent collaboration process and ensure theoretical convergence guarantees. Quick check: Verify that the state transitions and reward functions are properly defined and lead to optimal policy convergence.

**Knowledge Graph Integration** - Techniques for incorporating structured semantic relationships into neural models. Essential for providing factual grounding and preventing hallucinations in industrial QA scenarios. Quick check: Assess the coverage and quality of the knowledge graph relative to the industrial domain requirements.

**Knowledge Distillation** - Process of transferring knowledge from large teacher models to smaller student models while preserving capabilities. Critical for creating deployable industrial systems with reduced computational requirements. Quick check: Measure the fidelity of knowledge transfer and whether reasoning capabilities are preserved in compressed models.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Knowledge Graph -> Multi-Agent Reasoning System -> Confidence Scoring -> Instruction-Tuning Data -> Student Model Distillation

**Critical Path**: The knowledge graph provides grounding information to specialized agents, which collaborate to generate answers. These answers are evaluated for confidence and verifiability, then used to create training data for the student model distillation phase.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead during inference for improved reliability and accuracy. Using multiple specialized agents increases complexity but enables more nuanced reasoning. The knowledge graph grounding adds latency but significantly reduces hallucination risk.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when knowledge graph coverage is incomplete for specific industrial domains, when agent collaboration fails to converge, or when confidence scoring underestimates uncertainty in complex scenarios.

**First Experiments**:
1. Ablation study removing knowledge graph grounding to isolate its contribution to accuracy improvements
2. Cross-domain evaluation testing generalizability to different industrial contexts
3. Adversarial testing with edge cases and out-of-distribution queries common in industrial settings
