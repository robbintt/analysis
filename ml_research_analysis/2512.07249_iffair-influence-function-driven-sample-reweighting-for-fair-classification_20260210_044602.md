# IFFair: Influence Function-driven Sample Reweighting for Fair Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.07249
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07249
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Improves fairness metrics without conflicts while maintaining or improving utility

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses bias in machine learning classification models against unprivileged groups through a novel pre-processing approach called IFFair. The method uses influence functions to quantify each training sample's impact on group fairness and dynamically reweights samples to mitigate bias without modifying data, network structure, or decision boundaries. Experiments on 7 real-world datasets and 4 fairness metrics demonstrate that IFFair achieves better trade-offs between fairness and utility compared to previous pre-processing methods.

## Method Summary
IFFair employs influence functions to measure how individual training samples affect group fairness metrics. The approach calculates the influence of each sample on the model's fairness performance and assigns dynamic weights accordingly. These weights are then used during training to emphasize samples that contribute positively to fairness while de-emphasizing those that perpetuate bias. The method is designed to work with both logistic regression and deep neural networks without requiring architectural modifications or changes to decision boundaries.

## Key Results
- Improves demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity, and error rate parity across 7 datasets
- Achieves better fairness-utility trade-offs compared to existing pre-processing methods
- Maintains or improves original utility metrics while enhancing fairness
- Demonstrates generalizability across both logistic regression and deep neural network architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging influence functions to identify which training samples most significantly impact fairness metrics. By dynamically reweighting these samples during training, IFFair can steer the model toward more equitable decision boundaries without explicit fairness constraints or architectural changes. The approach effectively prioritizes samples that help reduce bias while diminishing the influence of samples that contribute to unfairness.

## Foundational Learning

**Influence Functions**: Mathematical tools for measuring how individual training samples affect model parameters and predictions; needed to quantify sample-level impact on fairness, verified by checking gradient-based influence calculations.

**Group Fairness Metrics**: Statistical measures including demographic parity, equalized odds, and equality of opportunity; essential for evaluating bias mitigation effectiveness, validated by computing metrics across protected groups.

**Sample Reweighting**: Training technique that assigns different importance weights to samples; required for implementing dynamic sample importance based on fairness impact, confirmed by observing weight distribution changes during training.

**Pre-processing Methods**: Data transformation techniques applied before model training; provides context for comparing IFFair against other bias mitigation approaches, established by reviewing literature on bias correction techniques.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data → Influence Function Calculator → Sample Weight Generator → Weighted Training Process → Fair Model

**Critical Path**: The core pipeline flows from data input through influence function computation to sample reweighting and final model training. The influence function calculation represents the computational bottleneck but is essential for identifying fairness-impacting samples.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity for fairness improvements, as influence functions are expensive to compute. However, this cost is incurred only during pre-processing rather than throughout training, and the approach avoids architectural modifications that might limit model expressiveness.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may occur when influence function estimates are inaccurate, when group definitions are ambiguous, or when the fairness-utility tradeoff becomes unfavorable. Computational resource constraints may also limit scalability to very large datasets.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Verify influence function calculations on a small dataset with known sample impacts
2. Test sample reweighting effectiveness on a simple logistic regression problem
3. Validate fairness metric improvements on a benchmark dataset with clear demographic groups
