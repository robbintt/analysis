# Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning with Dynamic Mixup Augmentation for Class-Imbalanced Expert Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.13987
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13987
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** QCL-MixNet significantly outperforms 20 baselines in macro-F1 and recall on 18 imbalanced tabular datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of class imbalance in tabular data for expert systems by introducing QCL-MixNet, a novel framework that combines quantum-inspired feature learning, dynamic mixup augmentation, and hybrid contrastive loss. The approach captures complex feature interactions through quantum-inspired entanglement layers while intelligently interpolating samples using kNN-guided dynamic mixup to better represent minority classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over 20 baselines across 18 imbalanced datasets, with ablation studies confirming the essential contribution of each component.

## Method Summary
QCL-MixNet employs quantum-inspired entanglement layers to capture complex feature interactions in tabular data, followed by kNN-guided dynamic mixup augmentation that intelligently interpolates samples based on class-aware sampling strategies. The framework integrates a hybrid contrastive loss function that combines focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning, triplet loss, and variance regularization to produce robust embeddings. The model processes tabular features through quantum-inspired layers that model non-linear relationships, applies dynamic mixup to generate synthetic samples for minority classes, and optimizes using the multi-component loss function that addresses both class imbalance and feature discrimination.

## Key Results
- QCL-MixNet significantly outperforms 20 baseline methods in macro-F1 and recall metrics across 18 imbalanced tabular datasets
- The hybrid loss function integrating focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning, triplet loss, and variance regularization proves more effective than single-component alternatives
- Ablation studies confirm each component's critical contribution, with quantum-inspired layers and dynamic mixup showing particularly strong impacts on minority class performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The quantum-inspired entanglement layers effectively capture complex, non-linear feature interactions that traditional linear models miss, enabling better representation of minority class patterns. The kNN-guided dynamic mixup intelligently generates synthetic samples that are both diverse and class-representative, avoiding the pitfalls of random interpolation. The hybrid contrastive loss simultaneously addresses class imbalance through focal reweighting while improving intra-class compactness and inter-class separation through supervised contrastive learning and triplet loss components.

## Foundational Learning
- **Quantum-inspired entanglement layers**: Needed to model complex non-linear feature interactions in tabular data; check by measuring feature interaction capture through ablation studies
- **Dynamic mixup augmentation**: Required for intelligent minority class oversampling without introducing noise; verify by comparing against random mixup approaches
- **Hybrid contrastive loss**: Essential for balancing class imbalance handling with feature discrimination; validate through loss component ablation experiments
- **kNN-guided sampling**: Necessary for class-aware sample selection during mixup; test by comparing against uniform sampling strategies
- **Focal reweighting**: Critical for emphasizing hard-to-classify samples; assess by measuring impact on minority class precision
- **Variance regularization**: Important for preventing overfitting to minority class patterns; evaluate through generalization gap analysis

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Tabular Features -> Quantum-Inspired Entanglement Layers -> Dynamic Mixup Augmentation -> Hybrid Contrastive Loss -> Classification Output

**Critical Path:** Input features flow through quantum-inspired layers for feature interaction modeling, then undergo kNN-guided dynamic mixup augmentation, followed by hybrid contrastive loss optimization that balances multiple objectives.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The quantum-inspired layers provide superior feature interaction modeling but increase computational complexity; dynamic mixup improves minority class representation but introduces hyperparameter sensitivity; the hybrid loss offers comprehensive optimization but requires careful balancing of multiple components.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation may occur with very small datasets where quantum-inspired layers overfit, or when kNN-guided mixup fails to find meaningful neighbors in sparse feature spaces. The hybrid loss may also suffer from component imbalance if hyperparameters are not properly tuned.

**First Experiments:** (1) Run ablation studies removing quantum-inspired layers while maintaining other components, (2) Test the framework on datasets with varying imbalance ratios to assess robustness boundaries, (3) Compare kNN-guided dynamic mixup against random mixup strategies to isolate the sampling strategy's contribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational overhead of quantum-inspired entanglement layers may limit scalability to very large datasets or real-time applications
- kNN-guided dynamic mixup introduces additional hyperparameter complexity requiring careful tuning for different domains
- The focus on tabular data limits generalizability to other data modalities where these specific techniques may not translate directly

## Confidence

**High:** Empirical performance improvements over 20 baselines, effectiveness of hybrid contrastive loss formulation, ablation study results confirming component contributions

**Medium:** Theoretical expressiveness analysis, as it relies on assumptions about feature space characteristics that may not hold universally

**Low:** Long-term stability and generalization of quantum-inspired components when applied to completely novel domain types

## Next Checks
- Evaluate QCL-MixNet on datasets with severe class imbalance ratios (>1000:1) to test robustness boundaries
- Conduct ablation studies removing quantum-inspired layers while maintaining other components to isolate their specific contribution
- Test the framework on time-series tabular data where temporal dependencies might interact differently with the proposed learning strategy
