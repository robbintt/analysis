# Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) for Attacking Quantum Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.08202
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08202
- **Reference count**: 11
- **Primary result**: First comprehensive study of Trojan attacks on fully quantum neural networks using quantum properties for noise injection and interference manipulation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive study of Trojan attacks on fully quantum neural networks (QNNs) without relying on classical-quantum hybrid architectures. The authors introduce Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) that exploit fundamental quantum computing properties - unitary transformations for noise injection, and Hadamard gates for interference-based state manipulation. Three distinct QuPT classes are proposed: Class-A uses noise accumulation through repeated unitary operations, Class-B adds controlled triggering via ancilla qubits, and Class-C leverages Hadamard-induced interference to maximally distort quantum states. Tested on a QNN binary classifier for MNIST digits 0 and 1, the attacks demonstrate severe performance degradation: Class-C QuPTs reduce accuracy from 70% to 50% in ideal simulations (28.57% drop) and from 65% to 50% in noisy IonQ Aria-1 simulations (23.08% drop), with complete destruction of precision, recall, and F1-score in both cases. The study establishes a new threat model based on configuration file manipulation in quantum compilation, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in QNN security that must be addressed as quantum machine learning systems become more prevalent.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) as a novel attack methodology targeting fully quantum neural networks. The attack exploits three fundamental quantum computing properties: unitary transformations for controlled noise injection, ancilla qubits for conditional triggering, and Hadamard gates for quantum interference-based state manipulation. Three distinct QuPT classes are implemented: Class-A introduces noise accumulation through repeated unitary operations, Class-B adds controlled triggering mechanisms using ancilla qubits, and Class-C leverages Hadamard-induced interference to maximally distort quantum states. The attacks are tested on a QNN binary classifier trained to distinguish MNIST digits 0 and 1, with performance evaluated on both ideal simulations and noisy IonQ Aria-1 hardware simulations. The methodology demonstrates how configuration file manipulation during quantum compilation can serve as an attack vector for compromising QNN integrity.

## Key Results
- Class-C QuPTs reduce QNN accuracy from 70% to 50% in ideal simulations (28.57% drop) and from 65% to 50% in noisy IonQ Aria-1 simulations (23.08% drop)
- Complete destruction of precision, recall, and F1-score metrics in both ideal and noisy simulations
- QuPT attacks exploit fundamental quantum properties (unitary transformations, Hadamard interference, ancilla qubits) rather than classical vulnerabilities
- Demonstrates new threat model based on configuration file manipulation during quantum compilation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The QuPT attacks work by exploiting fundamental quantum mechanical properties that are essential to QNN operation. Class-A QuPTs inject noise through controlled accumulation of unitary transformations, gradually corrupting the quantum state during circuit execution. Class-B QuPTs add conditional triggering mechanisms using ancilla qubits, allowing the attack to activate only when specific input patterns are detected. Class-C QuPTs leverage quantum interference effects induced by Hadamard gates to maximally distort quantum states, causing catastrophic classification failures. These attacks are particularly effective because they target the quantum information processing pipeline at a fundamental level, rather than relying on classical software vulnerabilities. The manipulation of configuration files during quantum compilation provides a practical attack vector that can be implemented without direct access to the quantum hardware.

## Foundational Learning
- **Quantum Unitary Transformations**: Why needed - Essential for implementing controlled noise injection in Class-A QuPTs; Quick check - Verify that unitary operations accumulate noise without collapsing quantum states
- **Quantum Interference via Hadamard Gates**: Why needed - Core mechanism for Class-C QuPTs to maximally distort quantum states; Quick check - Confirm that Hadamard-induced interference produces the claimed state corruption effects
- **Ancilla Qubit Manipulation**: Why needed - Enables conditional triggering in Class-B QuPTs for targeted attacks; Quick check - Validate that ancilla-based control flows correctly trigger the Trojan payload
- **Quantum State Tomography**: Why needed - Required to verify quantum state corruption during QuPT attacks; Quick check - Measure fidelity loss between clean and Trojan-infected quantum states
- **QNN Circuit Compilation**: Why needed - Understanding compilation process reveals configuration file attack vectors; Quick check - Trace how configuration changes propagate to circuit execution
- **Quantum Noise Modeling**: Why needed - Essential for evaluating Class-A QuPTs in realistic hardware conditions; Quick check - Compare noise accumulation rates across different quantum hardware models

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: QNN Layers -> Trojan Injection Points -> Configuration Files -> Quantum Circuit Execution
**Critical Path**: Input Encoding → QNN Layers → Trojan Payload → Output Measurement → Classification Result
**Design Tradeoffs**: The attacks balance between stealth (minimal impact on clean inputs) and effectiveness (maximum degradation on trigger inputs), with Class-C offering the strongest interference at the cost of more complex circuit modifications
**Failure Signatures**: Sharp accuracy drops from ~70% to ~50%, complete loss of precision/recall/F1-score, and specific quantum state corruption patterns observable through tomography
**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Verify unitary noise accumulation rates in Class-A across different circuit depths, 2) Test Hadamard interference strength in Class-C against varying input amplitudes, 3) Evaluate ancilla control reliability in Class-B across different trigger patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses exclusively on binary classification of MNIST digits 0 and 1, limiting generalizability to more complex quantum learning tasks
- Assumes practical feasibility of configuration file manipulation during quantum compilation without addressing real-world security controls
- Does not comprehensively analyze how quantum noise injection behaves across different circuit depths and noise models
- IonQ Aria-1 hardware simulations provide only approximations of real quantum device behavior

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical description of QuPT attack mechanisms and implementation methodology
- **Medium confidence**: Experimental results showing performance degradation for the specific binary classification task
- **Low confidence**: Claims about severity of security implications for production quantum computing systems

## Next Checks
1. Test QuPT attacks on multi-class classification problems (e.g., all MNIST digits) to assess attack effectiveness beyond binary classification
2. Implement real-time monitoring of quantum state evolution during QuPT attack execution to verify claimed quantum interference effects
3. Evaluate attack resilience of QNNs when deployed on actual quantum hardware with realistic error rates, rather than simulator-based noisy environments
