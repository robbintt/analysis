# M-DocSum: Do LVLMs Genuinely Comprehend Interleaved Image-Text in Document Summarization?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.21839
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21839
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces M-DocSum-Bench benchmark for evaluating LVLMs' interleaved image-text document summarization abilities, with proposed M-DocSum-7B model achieving state-of-the-art performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces M-DocSum-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate Large Vision-Language Models' (LVLMs) ability to understand and summarize interleaved image-text documents. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on question-answering or single-page documents, M-DocSum-Bench requires models to generate interleaved image-text summaries from 500 high-quality arXiv papers, evaluating their understanding, reasoning, localization, and summarization capabilities within complex multimodal contexts. The benchmark employs a reference-based generation task, with summaries divided into four paragraphs, each optionally accompanied by a reference image.

The authors propose M-DocEval, a fine-grained metric that assesses textual content, visual reference accuracy, and instruction following. Experimental results reveal that leading LVLMs struggle to maintain coherence and accurately integrate information in long interleaved contexts, often exhibiting confusion between similar images and lacking robustness. Notably, the proposed M-DocSum-7B, developed through progressive two-stage training (instruction-tuning and DPO), achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to larger and closed-source models, demonstrating the potential of LVLMs for improved interleaved image-text understanding.

## Method Summary
The M-DocSum-Bench framework consists of a reference-based generation task where models must create interleaved image-text summaries from 500 arXiv papers. Each summary is structured into four paragraphs, with optional reference images provided for each section. The evaluation employs M-DocEval, a fine-grained metric assessing three aspects: textual content accuracy, visual reference precision, and instruction-following compliance. The M-DocSum-7B model is developed through a progressive two-stage training approach, combining instruction-tuning on the benchmark data with direct preference optimization (DPO) refinement.

## Key Results
- Leading LVLMs struggle with coherence and accurate information integration in long interleaved contexts
- Models frequently exhibit confusion between similar images, indicating limitations in visual differentiation
- M-DocSum-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance through progressive two-stage training, outperforming larger and closed-source models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its focus on interleaved multimodal content generation rather than simple question-answering or single-page analysis. By requiring models to produce structured summaries with integrated visual references, M-DocSum-Bench forces LVLMs to demonstrate genuine comprehension of how textual and visual elements interact within document contexts. The progressive training methodology of M-DocSum-7B, combining instruction-tuning with preference optimization, allows the model to learn both task-specific capabilities and refined output quality through iterative improvement.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal reasoning**: Understanding how text and images relate and complement each other in document contexts
  - Why needed: Documents often contain information that is distributed across both modalities
  - Quick check: Can the model correctly associate specific text content with relevant images?

- **Long-context processing**: Maintaining coherence across extended interleaved text-image sequences
  - Why needed: Real documents contain hundreds of interleaved elements requiring sustained attention
  - Quick check: Does summary maintain logical flow across all four paragraphs?

- **Visual reference localization**: Identifying and accurately positioning relevant images within textual summaries
  - Why needed: Effective summaries must integrate visual evidence at appropriate points
  - Quick check: Are reference images correctly aligned with their corresponding textual content?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input parser -> multimodal encoder -> context processor -> summary generator -> visual ref locator
- **Critical path**: Document input → multimodal understanding → content extraction → structured summary generation → image-text interleaving
- **Design tradeoffs**: Reference-based evaluation vs. open-ended summarization (ensures consistency but limits creativity)
- **Failure signatures**: Confusion between similar images, loss of coherence in longer contexts, incorrect image-text associations
- **3 first experiments**:
  1. Test model's ability to correctly match simple image-text pairs from short documents
  2. Evaluate performance on single-paragraph summaries before progressing to full four-paragraph tasks
  3. Assess visual reference accuracy by comparing generated image selections against ground truth references

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation framework's robustness is uncertain as M-DocEval metrics lack extensive validation against human judgments for interleaved image-text tasks
- Reference-based generation approach assumes optimal reference images, potentially limiting assessment of models' independent visual content selection
- Progressive two-stage training methodology lacks detailed ablation studies to isolate instruction-tuning vs. DPO contributions
- arXiv paper corpus may not fully represent diversity of real-world interleaved document scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Leading LVLMs struggle with coherence and accurate integration in long interleaved contexts
- **Medium confidence**: M-DocSum-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance (requires external validation)
- **Medium confidence**: Models exhibit confusion between similar images (limited quantitative metrics)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing M-DocEval scores with human assessments of summary quality and relevance
2. Perform cross-dataset validation by testing M-DocSum-7B on established multimodal summarization benchmarks
3. Implement ablation studies isolating effects of instruction-tuning and DPO stages in the training pipeline
