core_contribution: This paper proposes a preconditioned version of the noise-free
  sampling method called the Preconditioned Backwards Regularized Wasserstein Proximal
  (PBRWP) method. The core idea is to use a preconditioning matrix to accelerate the
  convergence of the original BRWP method.

# Preconditioned Regularized Wasserstein Proximal Sampling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.01685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01685
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Preconditioned Backwards Regularized Wasserstein Proximal (PBRWP) method accelerates convergence through preconditioning matrix derived from Cole-Hopf transformation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Preconditioned Backwards Regularized Wasserstein Proximal (PBRWP) method, which accelerates sampling convergence by incorporating a preconditioning matrix into the original BRWP framework. The preconditioning is derived through a Cole-Hopf transformation applied to coupled anisotropic heat equations, resulting in a kernel formulation. The method shows theoretical convergence guarantees for quadratic potentials and demonstrates practical acceleration on both log-concave and non-log-concave examples, including Bayesian neural network training.

## Method Summary
The PBRWP method extends the BRWP sampling approach by introducing a preconditioning matrix that accelerates convergence. The core innovation involves deriving this preconditioning through a Cole-Hopf transformation on coupled anisotropic heat equations, which yields a kernel formulation for the preconditioned regularized Wasserstein proximal operator. The method interprets its diffusion component as a modified self-attention block similar to transformer architectures. For quadratic potentials, the paper provides non-asymptotic convergence analysis with explicit bias characterization, showing the bias depends on regularization strength but not step-size.

## Key Results
- Preconditioning accelerates convergence compared to original BRWP method
- Bias is explicitly characterized and shown to depend on regularization, not step-size
- Method demonstrates particle-level stability on various toy examples
- Competitive performance on Bayesian total-variation regularized image deconvolution
- Better performance on non-convex Bayesian neural network training with variable preconditioning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Cole-Hopf transformation on coupled anisotropic heat equations provides a principled way to derive the preconditioning matrix, which accelerates the convergence of the underlying Wasserstein proximal operator. The diffusion component, interpreted as a modified self-attention block, helps capture complex dependencies in the target distribution.

## Foundational Learning
- **Wasserstein Proximal Operator**: Essential for understanding the sampling framework; check by verifying understanding of optimal transport and proximal mappings.
- **Cole-Hopf Transformation**: Key mathematical tool for deriving preconditioning; verify by working through the transformation on simple heat equations.
- **Regularization in Sampling**: Critical for stability and convergence; test by examining how regularization affects bias and convergence rates.
- **Preconditioning Matrices**: Fundamental for accelerating iterative methods; validate by implementing preconditioned gradient descent on simple problems.
- **Coupled Anisotropic Heat Equations**: Underlie the mathematical derivation; confirm by solving simple anisotropic diffusion problems.
- **Self-Attention Mechanisms**: Provide intuition for the diffusion component; check by comparing with standard transformer attention implementations.

**Critical Path**: Preconditioning Matrix Construction → PBRWP Iteration → Sample Generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Preconditioning matrix complexity vs. computational efficiency
- Regularization strength vs. bias in convergence
- Fixed vs. variable preconditioning across iterations

**Failure Signatures**:
- Divergence when preconditioning matrix is poorly conditioned
- Slow convergence with inadequate regularization
- Particle collapse in high dimensions without proper diffusion

**First Experiments**:
1. Test on simple Gaussian distributions to verify correctness
2. Compare convergence rates with and without preconditioning
3. Evaluate stability on multi-modal distributions

## Next Checks

1. Extend convergence analysis to non-quadratic potentials through numerical experiments examining preconditioning effects on bias and convergence rates.

2. Implement comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art sampling methods (SGLD, HMC) across diverse problems including high-dimensional and non-convex cases.

3. Develop practical guidelines for preconditioning matrix construction with heuristics for high-dimensional scenarios, validated through systematic ablation studies.
