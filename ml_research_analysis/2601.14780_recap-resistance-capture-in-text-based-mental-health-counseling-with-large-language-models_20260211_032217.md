# RECAP: Resistance Capture in Text-based Mental Health Counseling with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14780
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14780
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: RECAP achieves 91.25% F1 for detecting resistance vs collaboration and 66.58% macro-F1 for fine-grained resistance classification in text-based counseling

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RECAP, a computational framework for detecting and classifying client resistance in text-based mental health counseling. Resistance behaviors are subtle, diverse, and critical to address for effective therapy, yet challenging to identify in written communication. RECAP leverages the PsyFIRE taxonomy to identify 13 types of resistance alongside collaborative interactions, achieving strong performance on a dataset of 23,930 annotated counseling utterances. The framework demonstrates potential for improving counselors' understanding and intervention strategies through real-time feedback.

## Method Summary
RECAP employs a two-stage approach using full-parameter fine-tuning of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the ClientResistance dataset. The method detects resistance versus collaboration in a binary classification step, then classifies into 13 fine-grained resistance types in a second stage. Training incorporates human-authored rationales as auxiliary supervision, improving interpretability and performance. The framework uses conversation history as context to capture sequential dynamics of therapeutic interventions, and outperforms leading LLM baselines by over 20 percentage points.

## Key Results
- Binary resistance/collaboration detection achieves 91.25% F1
- Fine-grained resistance classification reaches 66.58% macro-F1
- Outperforms leading prompt-based LLM baselines by over 20 points
- Applied to real-world data and counselor study, showing prevalence and impact of resistance on therapeutic relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Rationale-augmented fine-tuning improves fine-grained resistance classification performance.
- Mechanism: Training with both behavior labels and human-authored explanations provides auxiliary supervisory signal, forcing the model to learn reasoning patterns rather than surface correlations alone.
- Core assumption: The explanations encode valid reasoning patterns transferable to unseen cases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RECAP, a two-stage framework that detects resistance and fine-grained resistance types with explanations"
  - [section 6.2] Table 5 shows FPFT with rationales achieves 66.58 macro-F1 vs 61.72 without rationales on fine-grained classification
  - [corpus] Neighbor work "Psy-Insight" uses similar explainable datasets for mental health counseling
- Break condition: If rationales are inconsistent, noisy, or reflect annotator bias rather than genuine reasoning, the auxiliary signal may degrade rather than improve generalization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Task-specific annotated data with expert annotation dramatically outperforms general LLM prompting for resistance detection.
- Mechanism: Resistance expressions are subtle, domain-specific, and context-dependent. General-purpose LLMs lack exposure to the distribution of client resistance utterances and the interactional context in which they occur.
- Core assumption: The annotation taxonomy (PsyFIRE) captures behaviorally meaningful distinctions and annotators apply it consistently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "outperforming leading prompt-based LLM baselines by over 20 points"
  - [section 6.1] Zero-shot GPT-4o achieves ~47% macro-F1 on fine-grained classification vs RECAP's 66.58%
  - [corpus] "OnCoCo 1.0" similarly shows fine-grained counseling classification requires domain-specific datasets
- Break condition: If the training distribution diverges significantly from deployment (e.g., different cultural context, platform norms), performance may not transfer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Modeling resistance as a response to counselor interventions, rather than as isolated client behavior, improves detection accuracy.
- Mechanism: Resistance is theoretically defined as a client's non-collaborative response to a specific therapeutic intervention. Providing conversation history as input allows the model to infer what the client is responding to, rather than relying solely on the client utterance's surface form.
- Core assumption: The relevant context is contained within the provided dialogue history window.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ignores the sequential dynamics of therapeutic interventions" cited as limitation of prior work
  - [section 3.2] Each resistance category is illustrated as a response to a specific counselor suggestion
  - [corpus] Neighbor work "Trust Modeling in Counseling Conversations" also emphasizes interactional dynamics
- Break condition: If the critical context lies beyond the provided history window, or if resistance emerges from cumulative interaction patterns not captured in recent turns, this mechanism may miss important signals.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Fine-grained multi-class text classification with class imbalance**
  - Why needed here: The 13 resistance subtypes have highly uneven frequencies (e.g., Disagreeing: 1,698 samples vs Unwillingness: 384 samples). Macro-F1 rather than accuracy is the appropriate metric.
  - Quick check question: Given a 13-class problem where one class has 5x the examples of another, would accuracy or macro-F1 better reflect balanced performance?

- Concept: **Full-parameter fine-tuning vs. parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: The ablation study shows FPFT substantially outperforms LoRA for this task (+15 macro-F1). Understanding when this tradeoff matters is critical for resource planning.
  - Quick check question: If you have limited GPU memory but need maximum accuracy on a specialized domain task, what factors determine whether LoRA is acceptable?

- Concept: **Cross-entropy loss over structured outputs (classification + generation)**
  - Why needed here: RECAP jointly trains on discrete labels and free-text rationales. The loss must handle both output types simultaneously.
  - Quick check question: How would you modify a standard language modeling loss to prioritize classification accuracy while still training the rationale generation capability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input (conversation history + target utterance) -> Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct Backbone -> Joint Classification Token + Autoregressive Rationale Generation

- Critical path:
  1. Data preparation: Format each sample as (history, target utterance, label, rationale)
  2. Prompt engineering: Define role, task, taxonomy, and output format (see Tables 8-9 in appendix)
  3. Training: 5-fold cross-validation, early stopping on validation loss
  4. Inference: Deterministic decoding (temperature=0) for reproducible outputs

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **FPFT vs LoRA**: FPFT gives +10-15 F1 but requires 8x A100 GPUs; LoRA is deployable on smaller hardware but sacrifices performance
  - **Binary vs two-stage**: Detecting resistance first (binary) then subtyping (13-class) simplifies the second stage but adds latency
  - **Rationale inclusion**: Training with rationales improves F1 but doubles annotation cost and training time

- Failure signatures:
  - Low recall on "Ignoring" categories (Inattention, Sidetracking): Model misses implicit resistance lacking overt negation cues
  - Confusion between Pessimism and Disagreeing: Model fails to distinguish emotional withdrawal from reasoned objection
  - Over-prediction of Collaboration when resistance is subtle: Check if context window captures relevant counselor intervention

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline reproduction**: Run zero-shot GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on held-out fold to verify baseline numbers from Table 4
  2. **Ablation on context window**: Vary the number of historical turns provided as input; measure impact on fine-grained F1
  3. **Cross-dataset validation**: Apply the trained RECAP model to the independent CounselingWAI dataset (as done in Section 7) and verify correlation with working alliance scores (expected ρ ≈ -0.22)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the PsyFIRE taxonomy and RECAP model generalize to non-Chinese counseling contexts without significant performance degradation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that the taxonomy was "developed and validated exclusively within Chinese counseling contexts" and note that "meaningful cultural variations still exist."
- Why unresolved: Linguistic and cultural norms dictate how resistance is expressed (e.g., directness vs. indirectness), and the model was trained solely on Mandarin data.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of RECAP's transfer learning performance on English or multilingual counseling datasets (e.g., text-based therapy logs from Western platforms) using the same taxonomy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does real-time RECAP feedback improve long-term clinical outcomes, such as client retention and symptom reduction, in live counseling sessions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The proof-of-concept study (Section 7) used a "scenario-based response task" rather than live interaction. While the authors demonstrate improved counselor understanding in a lab setting, they have not yet validated the tool's impact on actual session dynamics or dropout rates.
- Why unresolved: Improvements in simulated counselor responses do not guarantee better therapeutic outcomes in complex, real-world clinical environments where AI feedback might distract or bias the counselor.
- What evidence would resolve it: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) where counselors use RECAP during live sessions, measuring client retention rates and Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) scores over a full course of therapy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework be enhanced to distinguish between affect-driven resistance (emotional withdrawal) and cognition-driven resistance (rational disagreement)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The error analysis (Section 6.3) highlights that the model struggles to differentiate these states, often mislabeling emotional hopelessness ("My life is over") as rational disagreement.
- Why unresolved: The current taxonomy groups these distinct psychological states under broad categories (like Denying), leading to potential misinterpretations of client intent.
- What evidence would resolve it: A fine-grained error analysis on a held-out test set where annotations explicitly distinguish between "affective" and "cognitive" resistance, followed by taxonomy refinement and retraining.

## Limitations
- The taxonomy and model are developed and validated exclusively within Chinese counseling contexts, limiting cross-cultural generalizability
- The binary resistance/collaboration distinction may oversimplify cases where clients exhibit mixed behaviors within single utterances
- Real-world clinical impact on therapeutic outcomes remains to be validated through longitudinal studies

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The binary classification performance (F1: 91.25%) and the superiority of full-parameter fine-tuning over prompting-based approaches are well-supported by direct comparisons in Table 4.

**Medium Confidence:** The fine-grained classification results (macro-F1: 66.58%) are promising but may be inflated by the specific annotation scheme and Chinese counseling context. The claim that rationale-augmented training improves performance is supported but requires verification across different domains.

**Low Confidence:** The practical impact on counselor training and intervention effectiveness, while demonstrated in the proof-of-concept study, lacks longitudinal validation and may be subject to selection bias in the 62-counselor sample.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Cultural Validation:** Test RECAP on English-language counseling datasets to verify performance portability across linguistic and cultural contexts.
2. **Longitudinal Impact Study:** Conduct a randomized controlled trial measuring whether counselors using RECAP show improved therapeutic alliance scores over multiple sessions compared to control groups.
3. **Context Window Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary the number of conversation history turns provided as input to determine the optimal context window for capturing resistance behavior.
