# Pay Attention to What and Where? Interpretable Feature Extractor in Vision-based Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.10071
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10071
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: IFE produces clear, consistent, and highly interpretable attention masks outperforming CNN and S3TA baselines in spatial preservation while maintaining data efficiency on ATARI games

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the spatial preservation problem in CNN-based Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning where attention masks are misaligned with visual objects due to overlapping convolutions. The proposed Interpretable Feature Extractor (IFE) uses a dual-module approach: Human-Understandable Encoding (HUE) with non-overlapping convolutions and soft attention for spatially accurate masks, followed by Agent-Friendly Encoding (AFE) with overlapping convolutions for efficient learning. The method is integrated into Fast and Data-efficient Rainbow and A3C-LSTM frameworks and evaluated on 57 ATARI games, demonstrating superior spatial preservation and interpretability compared to traditional CNN and S3TA baselines.

## Method Summary
The Interpretable Feature Extractor (IFE) consists of two sequential modules: HUE and AFE. HUE employs non-overlapping convolutions and soft attention mechanisms to generate spatially accurate attention masks that preserve object boundaries, addressing the spatial preservation problem in traditional CNNs. The AFE module then processes these features using standard overlapping convolutions for efficient reinforcement learning. This dual-encoding approach is integrated into existing DRL frameworks including Fast and Data-efficient Rainbow and A3C-LSTM, maintaining data efficiency while improving interpretability. The architecture is evaluated across 57 ATARI games, demonstrating clear, consistent attention masks that better align with visual objects compared to baseline methods.

## Key Results
- IFE produces clear, consistent, and highly interpretable attention masks outperforming traditional CNN and S3TA baselines
- Spatial preservation improvements demonstrated through visual inspection of attention masks on ATARI games
- Data efficiency comparable to CNN baselines while maintaining superior interpretability
- Versatility demonstrated through integration with multiple DRL frameworks (Fast and Data-efficient Rainbow, A3C-LSTM)
- Partial transferability shown in continual learning settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-module design enables spatial preservation through HUE's non-overlapping convolutions and soft attention, which maintain object boundary alignment. This creates spatially accurate feature representations that the subsequent AFE module can process efficiently without losing interpretability. The soft attention mechanism in HUE acts as a spatial filter, emphasizing relevant regions while suppressing irrelevant background, directly addressing the misalignment problem inherent in traditional CNN architectures. By separating spatial accuracy (HUE) from learning efficiency (AFE), the architecture achieves both interpretability and performance.

## Foundational Learning

**Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Combines deep neural networks with reinforcement learning to learn optimal policies from raw sensory input. Needed because standard RL requires hand-engineered features; quick check: agent receives state, outputs action, receives reward.

**Attention Mechanisms**: Focus computational resources on relevant parts of input data. Needed because visual scenes contain irrelevant information; quick check: soft attention produces weighted feature maps highlighting important regions.

**Spatial Preservation**: Maintaining spatial relationships between visual features and objects. Needed because CNNs with overlapping convolutions distort spatial information; quick check: attention masks should align with object boundaries.

**Convolutional Neural Networks**: Learn hierarchical feature representations through local receptive fields. Needed because they excel at image processing; quick check: filters detect edges, textures, then higher-level features.

**Softmax Function**: Converts raw scores to probability distributions. Needed for attention weight normalization; quick check: outputs sum to 1, representing relative importance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Image -> HUE (Non-overlapping Convolutions + Soft Attention) -> AFE (Overlapping Convolutions) -> DRL Agent

**Critical Path**: The HUE module's soft attention mechanism is critical as it generates spatially accurate attention masks that enable the subsequent AFE processing to maintain interpretability while preserving learning efficiency.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The dual-module approach trades computational overhead for spatial preservation and interpretability. HUE uses non-overlapping convolutions (slower but spatially accurate) while AFE uses standard overlapping convolutions (faster but potentially spatially distorted). This design maintains data efficiency while improving interpretability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor attention mask quality indicates HUE module issues, such as inadequate soft attention weighting or inappropriate non-overlapping convolution parameters. Learning degradation suggests AFE module problems, possibly from insufficient feature extraction capacity or suboptimal integration with the DRL framework.

**First Experiments**: 1) Visualize attention masks from HUE module alone to verify spatial preservation quality, 2) Compare AFE output features with standard CNN features to ensure no learning degradation, 3) Conduct ablation study removing soft attention to quantify its contribution to interpretability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to quantify interpretability improvements objectively rather than through visual inspection
- Whether the computational overhead of dual-module encoding is justified in resource-constrained settings
- How IFE performs in more complex visual environments beyond ATARI games
- Whether the spatial preservation benefits generalize to other DRL algorithms and visual domains

## Limitations
- Computational overhead from dual-module approach not thoroughly characterized
- Evaluation confined to ATARI games with simple visual environments
- Spatial preservation improvements primarily assessed through qualitative inspection rather than rigorous quantitative metrics
- Standardized measurement criteria for attention mask interpretability lacking

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Architectural design of IFE and integration with DRL frameworks is well-documented and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical performance improvements in spatial preservation supported by visual evidence, though quantitative metrics could be more comprehensive
- **Medium confidence**: Data efficiency claims reasonable given comparable results to CNN baselines, but detailed ablation studies on computational overhead are lacking

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive computational overhead analysis comparing training time, memory usage, and inference latency between IFE and standard CNN baselines across multiple hardware configurations
2. Develop and apply standardized quantitative metrics for attention mask interpretability (e.g., spatial alignment scores, object detection overlap metrics) to enable objective comparison across methods
3. Evaluate IFE's performance and spatial preservation capabilities in more complex visual domains beyond ATARI, such as 3D environments or real-world image datasets, to assess generalizability
