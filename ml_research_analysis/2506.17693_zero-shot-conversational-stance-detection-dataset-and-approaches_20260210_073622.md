# Zero-Shot Conversational Stance Detection: Dataset and Approaches

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.17693
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17693
- Reference count: 37
- First large-scale zero-shot conversational stance detection dataset (ZS-CSD) with 17,063 samples across 280 diverse targets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ZS-CSD, the first large-scale zero-shot conversational stance detection dataset containing 17,063 conversation samples across 280 diverse targets spanning noun phrases and claims. The dataset addresses limitations of prior work by including speaker context and interaction information. The authors propose SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive learning model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with an F1-macro score of 43.81% on the mixed-target setting, outperforming fine-tuning and LLM baselines. Despite being the best-performing approach, the moderate performance highlights the significant challenge of zero-shot conversational stance detection, particularly for claim-type targets.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce a novel zero-shot conversational stance detection task where models must predict stance toward unseen targets. They propose SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive learning model that leverages speaker context, target information, and interaction patterns from conversations. The model employs contrastive learning to learn meaningful representations that can generalize to unseen targets. The dataset collection process spans two social media platforms (Twitter and Reddit) and includes diverse targets categorized as either noun phrases or claims. The zero-shot setting is particularly challenging as models cannot rely on target-specific training data.

## Key Results
- ZS-CSD dataset contains 17,063 conversation samples across 280 diverse targets
- SITPCL achieves F1-macro score of 43.81% on mixed-target setting
- SITPCL outperforms both fine-tuning approaches and LLM baselines
- Significant performance gap exists between noun phrase targets and claim targets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed SITPCL model works by leveraging speaker context and interaction patterns through prototypical contrastive learning. The model learns to identify stance-relevant features in conversational contexts that are transferable across different targets. By incorporating speaker information and conversation dynamics, the model can capture the nuanced ways stance is expressed in dialogue. The contrastive learning framework helps the model learn robust representations that generalize to unseen targets by focusing on the underlying patterns of stance expression rather than memorizing target-specific features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Prototypical Contrastive Learning**: Why needed - To learn transferable representations for unseen targets; Quick check - Verify contrastive loss properly separates stance classes
- **Speaker Context Integration**: Why needed - Conversational stance heavily depends on speaker dynamics; Quick check - Test performance drop when removing speaker features
- **Target-Aware Representations**: Why needed - Different target types (noun vs claims) require different processing; Quick check - Compare performance across target categories
- **Conversation Interaction Modeling**: Why needed - Stance is often expressed through conversational dynamics; Quick check - Evaluate with sequential vs. non-sequential modeling

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
ZS-CSD Dataset -> Target Encoding -> Speaker Context Encoder -> Conversation Encoder -> Prototypical Contrastive Loss -> Stance Prediction

**Critical Path**
Input conversation and target → Speaker context extraction → Conversation encoding → Target-aware representation → Prototypical contrastive learning → Zero-shot stance prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**
The model prioritizes generalization over target-specific performance by using contrastive learning instead of fine-tuning. This enables zero-shot capability but limits absolute performance compared to supervised approaches. The choice to include both noun phrases and claims as targets increases dataset diversity but introduces additional complexity in modeling different target types.

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance on claim-type targets suggests the model struggles with abstract or complex target representations
- Performance degradation on targets with limited conversational context
- Inability to capture subtle stance expressions in short conversations
- Domain shift issues when applied to platforms beyond Twitter and Reddit

**First Experiments**
1. Baseline comparison: Test SITPCL against simple fine-tuning approaches on seen targets
2. Ablation study: Remove speaker context features to measure their impact on performance
3. Cross-target validation: Test model performance on noun phrases vs claims separately

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Moderate absolute performance (43.81% F1-macro) indicates significant room for improvement
- Performance gap between noun phrase and claim targets suggests limitations in handling complex target types
- Results may not generalize beyond Twitter and Reddit domains
- No extensive validation of speaker context and interaction information benefits through ablation studies

## Confidence

**Confidence Labels:**
- Dataset novelty and scale: High
- SITPCL model architecture validity: Medium
- Performance superiority claims: Medium
- Generalizability to other domains: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain validation by testing SITPCL on conversational data from platforms beyond Twitter and Reddit (e.g., Facebook, online forums) to assess generalizability
2. Perform detailed error analysis comparing noun phrase vs claim target performance to identify specific linguistic features that contribute to the performance gap
3. Implement temporal validation by testing model performance on conversation data from different time periods to assess robustness to evolving discourse patterns around the same targets
