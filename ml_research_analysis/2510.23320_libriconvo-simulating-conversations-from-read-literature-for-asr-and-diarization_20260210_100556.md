# LibriConvo: Simulating Conversations from Read Literature for ASR and Diarization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.23320
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23320
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Introduces LibriConvo, a simulated multi-speaker conversational dataset for speaker diarization and ASR

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LibriConvo, a novel simulated multi-speaker conversational dataset designed for speaker diarization and automatic speech recognition (ASR). The dataset addresses the critical challenge of training and evaluating systems on realistic conversational data by synthesizing dialogues with semantic coherence and natural timing. The method leverages utterances from LibriTTS organized by book, incorporates temporal statistics and room impulse responses from CallHome, and applies pause compression to create more natural conversational flow. The resulting dataset contains 240.1 hours of audio across 1,496 dialogues with 830 unique speakers, split into speaker-disjoint subsets for robust evaluation.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a methodology to simulate realistic conversations by combining read speech from LibriTTS with temporal patterns derived from CallHome conversational data. Utterances are organized by book to ensure semantic coherence, then concatenated with timing adjustments based on real conversational statistics. Room impulse responses are applied to simulate different acoustic environments, and pause compression is used to eliminate unnaturally long silences. The process creates speaker-disjoint training, development, and test sets with consistent gender distribution. The resulting dataset aims to provide a controlled yet realistic environment for developing and benchmarking speaker diarization and ASR systems.

## Key Results
- Sortformer model outperforms pyannote in diarization tasks on the LibriConvo dataset
- Fine-tuned fastconformer-ctc-xlarge achieves 7.29% WER for ASR
- Dataset contains 240.1 hours of audio across 1,496 dialogues with 830 unique speakers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by creating a controlled simulation environment that captures key characteristics of natural conversation while maintaining the advantages of synthetic data generation. By organizing utterances by book, the system ensures semantic coherence between speakers. The incorporation of CallHome-derived temporal statistics provides realistic turn-taking patterns and pause durations. The application of room impulse responses adds acoustic variability that mimics real-world environments. Pause compression addresses the inherent difference between read speech and spontaneous conversation, creating more natural flow without introducing artificial timing artifacts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Speaker diarization**: The task of identifying "who spoke when" in audio recordings - needed to evaluate multi-speaker conversation systems and requires understanding of clustering and segmentation techniques
- **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**: Converting spoken language into text - fundamental for transcription tasks and requires knowledge of acoustic modeling and language modeling
- **Room Impulse Response (RIR)**: The acoustic fingerprint of how sound propagates in an environment - needed to simulate realistic acoustic conditions and requires understanding of signal processing
- **Pause compression**: Technique to reduce unnaturally long silences in read speech - essential for creating conversational flow and requires knowledge of temporal alignment
- **Semantic coherence**: Ensuring related content flows naturally between speakers - important for realistic dialogue simulation and requires understanding of discourse modeling
- **Speaker-disjoint splits**: Partitioning data so speakers don't overlap between sets - critical for unbiased evaluation and requires careful dataset curation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** LibriTTS utterances -> Book-based organization -> CallHome temporal statistics -> RIR application -> Pause compression -> Dialogue synthesis

**Critical Path:** The core pipeline involves extracting utterances from LibriTTS, organizing them by book for semantic coherence, applying temporal statistics from CallHome for realistic timing, adding acoustic variation through RIRs, and compressing pauses to create natural conversational flow.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades perfect naturalness for controllability and reproducibility. Using read speech ensures high audio quality but may lack spontaneous conversational features. The simulation allows for precise control over speaker characteristics and acoustic conditions but may not capture all real-world variations. Speaker-disjoint splits enable robust evaluation but limit the diversity of speaker interactions.

**Failure Signatures:** Potential issues include unnatural prosody from read speech, timing artifacts from pause compression, and limited representation of real conversational dynamics like backchannels and interruptions. The system may struggle with highly overlapping speech or non-standard speaking styles not present in the training data.

**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate diarization performance on LibriConvo using both pyannote and Sortformer models to establish baseline comparisons
2. Test ASR performance with fastconformer-ctc-xlarge on the synthesized dialogues across different acoustic conditions
3. Analyze the impact of pause compression threshold variations on both diarization and ASR performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The use of read speech from LibriTTS may not fully capture spontaneous conversational features like disfluencies and natural prosody
- Temporal alignment based on CallHome statistics may not represent the full variability of natural turn-taking and overlaps
- Fixed pause compression threshold of 0.3s could introduce artifacts or unnatural timing patterns

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Creation methodology and dataset statistics (240.1 hours, 1,496 dialogues, 830 speakers)

**Medium Confidence:**
- Baseline diarization and ASR results, as they depend on simulated data quality
- Claim that Sortformer outperforms pyannote, requiring validation on real-world datasets

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate baseline models on real conversational datasets like CallHome or DIHARD to assess performance transfer from simulated to real data
2. Conduct a perceptual study to assess the naturalness and conversational quality of the synthesized dialogues, comparing them against human judgments
3. Analyze the impact of different pause compression thresholds and temporal alignment strategies on model performance to optimize the simulation process for more realistic conversational patterns
