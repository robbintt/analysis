- Primary result: Novel multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible counterfactual explanations for PPG-based regression models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the need for interpretable explanations in continuous-time series regression models, particularly in biomedical applications using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Existing counterfactual explanation methods are often limited to classification tasks and do not adequately handle the physiological morphology and continuous nature of biomedical time series. The authors propose EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework that generates physiologically plausible and diverse counterfactual explanations for time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models.

EvoMorph combines interpretable PPG morphology descriptors with plausible edit operators, using NSGA-III to optimize multiple objectives including morphological proximity, prediction target control, and artifact suppression. The method was evaluated on three PPG datasets for heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation estimation, compared against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. EvoMorph successfully generated novel counterfactuals that maintained physiological plausibility while achieving target prediction changes, producing hundreds of diverse alternatives per test instance. The framework also demonstrated utility for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to model prediction stability and data density.

## Method Summary
EvoMorph employs a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-III) to generate counterfactual explanations for continuous-time series regression models. The framework encodes PPG signals using interpretable morphological descriptors and applies physiologically plausible edit operators to create perturbations. The optimization process simultaneously minimizes morphological distance from the original signal, controls prediction target changes, and suppresses artifacts. The method uses a reference dataset to constrain plausible edits and employs NSGA-III to generate diverse Pareto-optimal solutions. Evaluation on three PPG-based regression tasks demonstrated the framework's ability to produce novel, physiologically plausible counterfactuals while maintaining interpretability through morphological descriptors.

## Key Results
- EvoMorph successfully generated physiologically plausible counterfactuals across three different PPG-based regression tasks (heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation)
- The method produced hundreds of diverse counterfactual explanations per test instance, demonstrating the framework's ability to explore the counterfactual space effectively
- EvoMorph showed utility for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to model prediction stability and data density

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging interpretable morphological descriptors of PPG signals combined with physiologically plausible edit operators. The multi-objective evolutionary optimization balances three key objectives: maintaining morphological similarity to the original signal, achieving desired prediction changes, and avoiding artifact introduction. By using NSGA-III, the framework can explore diverse counterfactual solutions rather than converging to a single local optimum. The reference dataset constrains edits to physiologically plausible regions, while the morphological descriptors ensure that generated counterfactuals remain interpretable in terms of clinically meaningful signal features.

## Foundational Learning

**Physiological Signal Morphology**: Understanding the characteristic features of PPG signals (peaks, troughs, dicrotic notches) is essential for generating plausible counterfactuals. Quick check: Can you identify key PPG morphological features in sample signals?

**Multi-objective Optimization**: NSGA-III balances competing objectives (morphology preservation, prediction control, artifact suppression) to generate diverse solutions. Quick check: Can you explain the Pareto front concept and why it matters for counterfactual diversity?

**Evolutionary Algorithms**: The framework uses genetic operators (mutation, crossover) adapted for time-series data to explore the counterfactual space. Quick check: How do evolutionary algorithms differ from gradient-based optimization for counterfactual generation?

**Interpretable Descriptors**: Converting raw signals to morphological features (amplitude, width, slope) enables domain-expert assessment of plausibility. Quick check: What are the trade-offs between using raw vs. transformed representations for counterfactual generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: PPG Signal -> Morphological Descriptor Extraction -> Evolutionary Population Initialization -> NSGA-III Optimization (Morphology Distance, Prediction Control, Artifact Suppression) -> Counterfactual Generation -> Plausibility Assessment

**Critical Path**: The core workflow follows: signal encoding → evolutionary optimization → Pareto-optimal counterfactual selection. The most computationally intensive step is the NSGA-III optimization, which iteratively evaluates population fitness across all objectives.

**Design Tradeoffs**: EvoMorph prioritizes physiological plausibility and diversity over computational efficiency. The evolutionary approach enables exploration of diverse counterfactuals but is more computationally expensive than gradient-based methods. The use of interpretable descriptors sacrifices some representational power for domain-expert comprehensibility.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Counterfactuals with extreme morphological changes indicate poor constraint of edit operators
- Lack of diversity in generated solutions suggests premature convergence of evolutionary algorithm
- High artifact scores reveal insufficient artifact suppression in objective function
- Failure to achieve target prediction changes indicates poor control over prediction objective

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify morphological descriptor extraction produces consistent features across different PPG signals
2. Test evolutionary operators on synthetic signals to ensure physiologically plausible perturbations
3. Evaluate NSGA-III convergence on simple two-objective problems before adding third objective

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method is currently restricted to time-series regression with continuous target variables, making it inapplicable to discrete classification tasks without substantial modifications
- The focus on PPG signals creates uncertainty about performance on other physiological signals like ECG, EEG, or accelerometry data
- The evaluation relies heavily on domain-expert qualitative assessment for physiological plausibility, lacking standardized quantitative metrics for measuring this critical objective

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The framework's ability to generate physiologically plausible counterfactuals while maintaining prediction control is well-supported by the empirical results across three different PPG-based regression tasks
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that EvoMorph provides interpretable explanations is reasonable given the morphological descriptors used, but the actual interpretability benefit to end-users remains largely theoretical without user studies
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability to non-PPG biomedical signals and other continuous regression domains is speculative, as the method's performance on different signal morphologies and physiological contexts is untested

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Signal Validation**: Test EvoMorph on non-PPG continuous regression tasks (e.g., ECG-based heart rate variability, EEG-based cognitive load estimation) to evaluate morphological operator transferability and physiological plausibility preservation across different signal types

2. **Quantitative Plausibility Metrics**: Develop and validate quantitative measures for physiological plausibility that correlate with expert assessments, enabling automated evaluation and comparison across different counterfactual generation methods

3. **Computational Benchmarking**: Perform systematic benchmarking of EvoMorph's computational cost (runtime, memory usage) against gradient-based counterfactual methods on identical tasks, including analysis of scalability with sequence length and number of generated counterfactuals
