# Toward Efficient Spiking Transformers: Synapse Pruning Meets Synergistic Learning-Based Compensation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.01992
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01992
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves >77% compression ratio with maintained accuracy on ImageNet-100 using 90% pruning sparsity and sLIF compensation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the high computational and memory demands of spiking transformers (STs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The authors propose a two-pronged approach: (1) tailored synapse pruning strategies (unstructured L1P for sparse weight matrices and structured DSP for low-rank representations) and (2) a synergistic learning-based compensation mechanism via an enhanced sLIF neuron model that jointly optimizes synaptic and intrinsic plasticity. The pruning strategies are applied to ST blocks, and the resulting lightweight models are fine-tuned using synergistic learning. Experiments on diverse datasets (ImageNet-100, CIFAR-10, CIFAR10-DVS, and ADE20K) demonstrate significant parameter reductions and computational overhead decreases, with the proposed methods achieving competitive or improved performance compared to existing ST-based models.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines tailored synapse pruning with synergistic learning-based compensation. First, pre-trained ST models undergo pruning using either L1P (unstructured, removes small weights) or DSP (structured, removes redundant dimensions via DVA metric). Then, standard LIF neurons are replaced with sLIF neurons featuring learnable membrane time constants and firing thresholds. The models are fine-tuned using spatio-temporal backpropagation to jointly optimize weights, τ, and u_th. The pruning and compensation work synergistically to maintain performance while achieving significant parameter reduction.

## Key Results
- 90% pruning sparsity achieved >77% compression ratio on ImageNet-100 while maintaining high accuracy
- L1P maintains 94.72% accuracy at 20% sparsity vs 90.74% for random pruning; 67.93% at 80% sparsity vs 29.03% random
- DSP maintains 81.33% at 40% sparsity vs 62.26% random; structured removal outperforms unstructured random at moderate sparsity
- sLIF achieves 88.86%/74.93% (L1P 95%/99%) vs LIF at 81.80%/64.60%, maintaining baseline firing rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: L1P Weight Pruning
- **Claim:** Pruning weights with smallest L1-norm values reduces model parameters while preserving representational capacity
- **Mechanism:** L1P computes element-wise absolute values, ranks them, and zeros out the bottom p% based on a sparsity threshold
- **Core assumption:** Weight magnitude correlates with functional importance; low-magnitude weights contribute minimally to network output
- **Evidence anchors:** Table VI shows L1P maintains 94.72% accuracy at 20% sparsity vs 90.74% for random pruning; performance degrades beyond 80-90% sparsity

### Mechanism 2: DSP Dimensional Pruning
- **Claim:** Removing embedding dimensions with lowest aggregated L1-norm significance scores creates compact low-rank representations
- **Mechanism:** DSP computes Dimension Value Assessment (DVA) scores by summing L1-norms across input dimensions for each output dimension
- **Core assumption:** Not all embedding dimensions contribute equally; some dimensions are redundant for the task
- **Evidence anchors:** Table VI shows DSP maintains 81.33% at 40% sparsity vs 62.26% random; extreme dimension reduction (<20%) causes representation collapse

### Mechanism 3: sLIF Compensation
- **Claim:** Joint optimization of synaptic weights and intrinsic neuronal parameters restores firing rates and gradient flow after pruning-induced input distribution shifts
- **Mechanism:** sLIF neurons treat τ and u_th as learnable parameters, enabling firing on weaker inputs through adjusted excitability
- **Core assumption:** Pruning reduces input currents, shifting distributions below firing thresholds; neurons can compensate by adapting excitability parameters
- **Evidence anchors:** Table VII shows sLIF achieves 88.86%/74.93% (L1P 95%/99%) vs LIF at 81.80%/64.60%; Figure 12a shows sLIF maintains baseline firing rates

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron dynamics**
  - **Why needed here:** sLIF extends LIF with learnable intrinsic parameters; understanding membrane potential decay, spike generation, and reset mechanisms is essential
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how membrane potential accumulates input current, decays over time, and resets after firing in a discrete-time LIF model?

- **Concept: Transformer self-attention and weight matrix roles**
  - **Why needed here:** Pruning targets U_q, U_k, U_v projection matrices and MLP layers; knowing what each matrix computes clarifies why dimensional pruning affects representation capacity
  - **Quick check question:** What do the Q, K, V projections compute in scaled dot-product attention, and why does reducing their dimensionality affect attention patterns?

- **Concept: Surrogate gradient training for SNNs**
  - **Why needed here:** sLIF requires backpropagation through non-differentiable spike functions; surrogate gradients enable gradient flow through discrete spike generation
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't standard backpropagation train spiking neurons directly, and how do surrogate gradients approximate the derivative of the spike function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** ST Block (SSA module + MLP module) -> L1P/DSP Pruning -> sLIF Neuron Replacement -> Synergistic Fine-tuning

- **Critical path:**
  1. Start with pre-trained Spikformer baseline
  2. Apply L1P (unstructured) or DSP (structured) pruning at target sparsity level
  3. Replace all LIF neurons with sLIF neurons
  4. Fine-tune with joint optimization of weights, τ, and u_th (50 epochs typical)
  5. Validate firing rates maintained

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **L1P vs DSP:** L1P preserves more accuracy at high sparsity but requires sparse matrix libraries; DSP enables direct hardware acceleration but causes earlier degradation
  - **Sparsity selection:** 60-80% offers best accuracy/size balance; 90%+ for extreme edge deployment
  - **Fine-tuning epochs:** 20-30 epochs sufficient for sLIF convergence, vs 40+ for LIF-only

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Firing rate collapse:** If neurons become silent after pruning, τ or u_th initialization may be poor
  - **Gradient vanishing:** If loss plateaus early, surrogate gradient window may not align with membrane potential distribution
  - **Attention degradation:** If visualizations show scattered/unfocused attention, dimension reduction may be too aggressive

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sparsity sweep on CIFAR-10:** Test L1P and DSP at p ∈ {20%, 40%, 60%, 80%} with sLIF compensation; compare accuracy and parameter counts against baselines
  2. **Ablate compensation mechanisms:** Run DSP at p=95% with (a) LIF-only, (b) learnable τ only, (c) learnable u_th only, (d) sLIF; compare against Table VII
  3. **Firing rate monitoring:** Log per-layer firing rates during fine-tuning at p=90%; confirm sLIF restores rates to baseline while LIF declines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can a dynamic importance metric be developed to assign non-uniform pruning sparsity across different ST blocks to maximize performance retention?
  - **Basis:** Authors state applying same pruning sparsity uniformly overlooks varying contributions of different blocks
  - **Why unresolved:** Current method requires predefined global sparsity level ignoring layer-wise sensitivity
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Sensitivity analysis revealing distinct optimal sparsity thresholds for shallow vs deep ST blocks

- **Open Question 2:** How does the sLIF-based compensation mechanism interact with non-transformer architectures in hybrid spiking models?
  - **Basis:** Conclusion identifies extending compression strategy to hybrid models integrating convolutional blocks and transformer blocks
  - **Why unresolved:** Synergistic learning strategy validated exclusively on standard ST blocks
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments applying pruning and sLIF pipeline to hybrid architectures demonstrating consistent parameter reduction

- **Open Question 3:** Do low-rank representations from DSP provide tangible efficiency gains over unstructured L1P sparse matrices on physical neuromorphic hardware?
  - **Basis:** While noting structured pruning facilitates improved hardware accessibility, efficiency results rely on theoretical power consumption models
  - **Why unresolved:** Unstructured sparse matrices often fail to accelerate standard hardware due to irregular memory access
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks on physical neuromorphic chips comparing inference latency and actual energy consumption of DSP vs L1P models

## Limitations

- **Sparse matrix operations for L1P not validated on hardware:** Theoretical compression may not translate to runtime gains
- **DSP structural constraints may limit generalization:** Tasks requiring high-dimensional embeddings may suffer
- **Synergistic learning stability not examined:** Across diverse learning rate schedules or architectures

## Confidence

- **High:** Pruning effectiveness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 (robust across sparsity levels, clear baseline comparisons)
- **Medium:** sLIF compensation mechanism (firing rate restoration shown but long-term stability unclear)
- **Low:** ADE20K semantic segmentation results (only reported for DSP, limited ablation studies)

## Next Checks

1. Measure actual inference latency and memory usage on target edge hardware (not just parameter counts)
2. Test generalization to out-of-distribution inputs and novel downstream tasks
3. Evaluate robustness to noisy or corrupted input data
