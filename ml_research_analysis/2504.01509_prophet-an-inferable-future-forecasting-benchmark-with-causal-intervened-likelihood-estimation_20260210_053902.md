# PROPHET: An Inferable Future Forecasting Benchmark with Causal Intervened Likelihood Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.01509
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01509
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces PROPHET benchmark with 612 inferable questions using Causal Intervened Likelihood (CIL) to ensure questions can be supported by sufficient news articles

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PROPHET, an inferable future forecasting benchmark designed to address the challenge of ensuring prediction questions can be answered using available evidence. The key innovation is the Causal Intervened Likelihood (CIL) metric, which quantifies how strongly each news article supports answers to prediction questions using causal inference principles. CIL is computed using temporal assumptions and LLM-based estimations of interventional probabilities. The benchmark construction process filters real-world prediction questions using CIL, resulting in 612 inferable questions (L1) and 43 non-inferable questions (L2). Experiments validate CIL's effectiveness in improving forecasting performance, with agentic RAG methods showing consistent gains over naive approaches.

## Method Summary
The PROPHET benchmark addresses the challenge of evaluating future forecasting systems by ensuring prediction questions have sufficient supporting evidence. The core innovation is the Causal Intervened Likelihood (CIL) metric, which measures the strength of support that news articles provide for answering forecasting questions. CIL is computed using two temporal assumptions: articles published within 7 days of the question date are more relevant, and articles published before the question date are more supportive. LLMs estimate interventional probabilities to quantify this support. The benchmark construction involves filtering real-world prediction questions from existing forecasting datasets using CIL scores, resulting in two levels: L1 with 612 inferable questions and L2 with 43 non-inferable questions. The methodology includes naive and agentic RAG approaches for evaluation, with agentic methods incorporating iterative evidence gathering and answer refinement.

## Key Results
- CIL metric shows statistical significance in improving forecasting performance (p=0.0264) when top-CIL articles are used
- Most questions have 400-800 relevant articles, but CIL values are often near zero, indicating limited supportive evidence
- Agentic RAG methods consistently outperform naive approaches across both levels of the benchmark
- PROPHET provides a reproducible framework for evaluating future forecasting systems with quantifiable inferability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Causal Intervened Likelihood (CIL) metric works by applying causal inference principles to quantify how news articles support forecasting answers. By estimating interventional probabilities, CIL captures the causal relationship between evidence and outcomes rather than just correlations. The temporal assumptions ensure that more recent and pre-question articles receive appropriate weight, reflecting their higher relevance to the forecasting task. This approach provides a principled way to filter questions that can actually be answered from available evidence, making the benchmark more meaningful for evaluating forecasting systems.

## Foundational Learning
**Causal Inference**: Understanding cause-effect relationships between variables
- Why needed: CIL relies on causal reasoning rather than simple correlations
- Quick check: Can distinguish between correlation and causation in evidence-article relationships

**Interventional Probability**: Probability of outcomes under specific interventions
- Why needed: CIL estimates how evidence changes the probability of outcomes
- Quick check: Can compute P(Y|do(X)) from observational data

**Temporal Relevance Weighting**: Assigning different weights based on publication timing
- Why needed: Recent and pre-question articles are more relevant to forecasting
- Quick check: Can implement temporal decay functions for evidence weighting

**LLM-based Causal Reasoning**: Using large language models for causal probability estimation
- Why needed: CIL requires estimating complex causal relationships
- Quick check: Can generate consistent causal probability estimates across similar scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: News Articles -> CIL Computation -> Question Filtering -> Benchmark Levels (L1/L2) -> RAG Evaluation -> Performance Metrics

**Critical Path**: Question -> Article Retrieval -> CIL Scoring -> Evidence Selection -> RAG Processing -> Answer Generation -> Accuracy Measurement

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- CIL computation accuracy vs. computational cost of LLM-based causal reasoning
- Question quantity vs. inferability quality in benchmark construction
- Temporal assumptions universality vs. domain-specific calibration needs

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Low CIL scores despite available evidence indicating temporal assumption violations
- Inconsistent RAG performance suggesting inadequate evidence selection
- High variance in CIL estimates revealing LLM reliability issues

**First Experiments**:
1. Test CIL computation with synthetic datasets where ground truth causal relationships are known
2. Compare CIL-based filtering with human expert judgment on question inferability
3. Evaluate RAG performance sensitivity to different temporal window sizes in CIL computation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the text provided.

## Limitations
- Reliance on LLMs for causal probability estimation introduces potential biases and variability
- Temporal assumptions may not generalize across all forecasting domains
- Relatively small number of non-inferable questions (43) may limit statistical power for certain analyses
- Focus on news articles may not capture all relevant information types for future forecasting

## Confidence

**CIL metric validity**: Medium - Theoretical foundation is sound but empirical validation relies heavily on LLM-based measurements
**Benchmark construction methodology**: High - Filtering process and statistical measures are clearly defined and reproducible
**Experimental results demonstrating CIL effectiveness**: High - Statistical significance is demonstrated with appropriate controls

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human expert validation of CIL-assigned inferability scores to assess alignment between automated and human judgments
2. Test CIL metric robustness across different LLM models and prompting strategies to evaluate sensitivity to implementation choices
3. Evaluate benchmark performance on diverse forecasting domains beyond news-based questions to assess generalizability
