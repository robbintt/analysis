core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of designing effective reward
  structures for autonomous cyber defense agents using large language models (LLMs)
  in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks. The core method involves using
  an LLM (Claude Sonnet 4) to generate context-aware reward designs for attack and
  defense agents based on their behavioral characteristics, which are then used to
  train DRL-based autonomous cyber defense policies in a high-fidelity simulation
  environment (Cyberwheel).

# Large Language Model-Based Reward Design for Deep Reinforcement Learning-Driven Autonomous Cyber Defense

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16483
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16483
- Reference count: 6
- Key outcome: LLM-guided reward designs enable effective defense strategies in DRL-based autonomous cyber defense

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an innovative approach to designing reward structures for autonomous cyber defense agents using large language models (LLMs) in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks. The method leverages Claude Sonnet 4 to generate context-aware reward designs based on behavioral characteristics of attack and defense agents, which are then used to train DRL policies in the Cyberwheel simulation environment. The approach creates diverse agent personas with corresponding reward structures, demonstrating that LLM-guided reward designs can produce effective defense strategies against both stealthy and aggressive attackers.

## Method Summary
The research employs a novel methodology where an LLM (Claude Sonnet 4) is prompted to generate reward designs for different attack and defense agent personas based on their behavioral characteristics. These reward structures are then implemented to train DRL-based autonomous cyber defense policies within the Cyberwheel high-fidelity simulation environment. The approach involves creating multiple defender personas (baseline, proactive-v2, etc.) and attacker types (aggressive, stealthy), each with tailored reward functions designed by the LLM. The trained policies are evaluated against various attack scenarios to assess their effectiveness in terms of delay metrics and detection capabilities.

## Key Results
- LLM-guided reward designs lead to effective defense strategies in autonomous cyber defense
- The proactive-v2 defender shows superior performance against both stealthy and aggressive attackers
- An effective policy involves switching between baseline and proactive-v2 defender personas depending on the encountered attacker type
- Achieves up to 95th percentile delays of 18 time steps against stealthy attackers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the LLM's ability to understand and generate context-aware reward structures that capture the nuanced behaviors of different attacker and defender personas. By prompting the LLM to design rewards based on specific behavioral characteristics, the system can create more sophisticated and adaptive reward functions than traditional hand-crafted approaches. The LLM can consider multiple factors simultaneously, including the trade-offs between detection speed and stealthiness, which are critical in cyber defense scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL): Why needed - core framework for training autonomous cyber defense agents; Quick check - agents learn optimal policies through trial and error in simulation
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Why needed - generate sophisticated, context-aware reward designs; Quick check - LLM can understand and create nuanced reward structures based on behavioral descriptions
- Cyberwheel Simulation Environment: Why needed - provides high-fidelity cyber defense scenarios for training and evaluation; Quick check - realistic network environment with various attack vectors and defensive capabilities
- Reward Design in RL: Why needed - crucial for shaping agent behavior and learning outcomes; Quick check - properly designed rewards lead to desired agent behaviors and strategies

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
LLM (Claude Sonnet 4) -> Reward Design Generation -> DRL Agent Training -> Cyberwheel Simulation -> Performance Evaluation

Critical Path:
1. Define attacker and defender personas with behavioral characteristics
2. Prompt LLM to generate reward designs for each persona
3. Implement reward structures in DRL training framework
4. Train agents in Cyberwheel simulation
5. Evaluate performance against various attack scenarios

Design Tradeoffs:
- LLM-guided rewards vs. hand-crafted rewards: LLM approach offers more nuanced and context-aware designs but introduces potential LLM-specific biases
- Simulation fidelity vs. computational cost: Higher fidelity environments provide more realistic training but require more computational resources
- Defender complexity vs. training time: More sophisticated defender strategies require longer training
