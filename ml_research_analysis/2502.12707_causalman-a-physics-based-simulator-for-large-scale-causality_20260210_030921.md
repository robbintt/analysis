core_contribution: This paper introduces CausalMan, a physics-based simulator designed
  for large-scale causality benchmarking. Motivated by the absence of realistic causal
  models with known data generating processes, the simulator is modeled after a real-world
  production line and incorporates diverse mechanisms including linear and non-linear
  relationships, discrete mode changes, and conditional dependencies.

# CausalMan: A physics-based simulator for large-scale causality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.12707
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12707
- Reference count: 40
- Large-scale causal benchmark simulator based on realistic manufacturing processes

## Executive Summary
CausalMan introduces a physics-based simulator for benchmarking causal inference and discovery at scale. Built to mimic real-world manufacturing processes, it includes complex mechanisms such as nonlinear relationships, discrete mode switches, and conditional dependencies. Two large datasets are generated—Small (157 variables, 53 observable) and Medium (605 variables, 186 observable)—with known ground-truth interventional distributions. Evaluation of state-of-the-art causal models shows significant underperformance, highlighting the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical scalability.

## Method Summary
CausalMan is a physics-based simulator that generates large-scale synthetic data with known causal mechanisms, modeled after a real production line. It produces observational and interventional data with hybrid variable types and complex dependencies, including linear, nonlinear, and conditional mechanisms. Two benchmark datasets are derived: CausalMan Small (157 variables, 53 observable) and Medium (605 variables, 186 observable). Preprocessing involves ordinal encoding of categoricals and min-max normalization to [-1, 1]; CBNs additionally quantize continuous variables to 20 bins. Baseline causal models tested include Bayesian Networks, Neural Causal Models, CAREFL, CNF, and VACA, evaluated using MSE, JSD, MMD, SHD, and SID metrics.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art causal models fail to accurately estimate treatment effects or recover causal graphs on large-scale realistic data
- Simple regression baselines sometimes outperform complex causal models in ATE/CATE estimation
- Most models face computational tractability issues at scale, with CBNs requiring prohibitive memory and NCMs facing excessive training costs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The simulator leverages realistic physics-based process modeling to generate synthetic data with complex, known causal structures. By incorporating real-world phenomena like mode switches and conditional dependencies, it creates a challenging testbed that exposes limitations in current causal inference methods under realistic assumptions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Physics-based simulation** (why needed: generates realistic data with known ground truth) - quick check: validate simulated process dynamics match intended physical behaviors
- **Causal sufficiency violation** (why needed: reflects real-world latent confounding) - quick check: verify ground truth includes latent variables affecting multiple observed nodes
- **Hybrid data types** (why needed: real-world data is mixed continuous/discrete) - quick check: confirm preprocessing handles both types correctly
- **Nonlinear mechanisms** (why needed: simple linear models fail in realistic scenarios) - quick check: inspect structural equations for nonlinear terms
- **Interventional benchmarking** (why needed: enables rigorous evaluation against ground truth) - quick check: validate intervention definitions produce expected distributional changes
- **Structural evaluation metrics** (why needed: assesses causal discovery accuracy) - quick check: confirm SHD and SID calculations match standard definitions

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Simulator Engine -> Data Generator -> Preprocessing Pipeline -> Causal Model -> Evaluation Metrics
- **Critical path**: Simulator generates data → Preprocessing normalizes/quantizes → Model trains/infers → Metrics compare predictions to ground truth
- **Design tradeoffs**: CBNs offer interpretability but exponential memory growth; NCMs are expressive but computationally prohibitive; flow-based methods scale but lack expressiveness
- **Failure signatures**: CBNs crash with OOM on high-in-degree nodes; NCMs fail to converge with NaN/inf outputs; flow methods produce inaccurate estimates despite tractable scaling
- **First experiments**: 1) Download and inspect CausalMan Small schema and intervention definitions 2) Preprocess a subset and verify normalization/quantization 3) Run CAREFL on observational split and compare ATE estimates to ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can causal inference and discovery models achieve high accuracy in large-scale, realistic scenarios where standard assumptions (e.g., causal sufficiency, linearity) are violated?
- Can causal methods be designed to scale computationally to hundreds of variables without facing the dichotomy of exponential memory growth (CBNs/NCMs) or insufficient expressiveness (Normalizing Flows)?
- How do current causal models perform on complex counterfactual queries within realistic manufacturing simulations?

## Limitations
- Dataset and implementation URLs are anonymized, preventing direct access to resources
- Evaluation focused on simpler interventional tasks; complex counterfactual queries were not tested due to model limitations
- Results may be sensitive to preprocessing choices and implementation details not fully specified

## Confidence
- Claims about model inadequacy: High
- Claims about scalability challenges: Medium
- Claims about absolute performance rankings: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Verify the causal structure of CausalMan Small by reconstructing the DAG from the provided intervention definitions and checking consistency with ground truth interventional distributions
2. Run CAREFL/CNF on CausalMan Small with the exact hyperparameters and preprocessing steps; compare ATE MSE and JSD against the reported results to confirm reproducibility
3. Test the CBN implementation on a subset of CausalMan Small (e.g., 10% of variables) to confirm quantization-induced memory explosion, and document RAM usage and runtime scaling
