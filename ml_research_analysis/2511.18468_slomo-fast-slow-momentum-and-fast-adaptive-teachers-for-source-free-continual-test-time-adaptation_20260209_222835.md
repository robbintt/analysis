# SloMo-Fast: Slow-Momentum and Fast-Adaptive Teachers for Source-Free Continual Test-Time Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18468
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18468
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 11 diverse CTTA scenarios on five datasets with mean error rate of 34.7%

## Executive Summary
SloMo-Fast introduces a dual-teacher framework for continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) that addresses the challenge of long-term forgetting when models encounter evolving target domains without access to source data. The method employs a Fast-Teacher that quickly adapts to new domains and a Slow-Teacher that retains long-term knowledge through gradual updates, enabling both adaptability and generalization. SloMo-Fast generates class prototypes dynamically from high-confidence test features, eliminating the need for source data while preserving domain-specific knowledge.

The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across 11 diverse CTTA scenarios on five datasets (CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, ImageNet-C, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-Sketch), with a mean error rate of 34.7%, surpassing existing methods by at least 1.5%. It also introduces Cyclic-TTA, a new benchmark where domains repeat over time, demonstrating robust adaptation to recurring distribution shifts. SloMo-Fast's parameter-efficient design updates only 4.9% of parameters while maintaining competitive efficiency, making it practical for resource-constrained settings.

## Method Summary
SloMo-Fast is a source-free continual test-time adaptation framework that employs dual teachers to balance adaptability and generalization. The Fast-Teacher (T1) is updated via EMA to quickly adapt to new domains, while the Slow-Teacher (T2) is updated via contrastive optimization to retain long-term knowledge. The method generates class prototypes dynamically from high-confidence test features using dual-criteria filtering (entropy and prediction sensitivity), eliminating the need for source data. The student model is trained using symmetric cross-entropy from both teachers, with T2 providing domain-generalized features through contrastive alignment to the generated prototypes.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with mean error rate of 34.7% across 11 CTTA scenarios
- Introduces Cyclic-TTA benchmark demonstrating robust adaptation to recurring distribution shifts
- Parameter-efficient design updates only 4.9% of parameters while maintaining competitive accuracy
- Surpasses existing methods by at least 1.5% in error rate across diverse datasets including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, ImageNet-C, ImageNet-R, and ImageNet-Sketch

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Plasticity-Stability Decoupling via Dual Teachers
The system employs a Fast-Teacher ($T_1$) updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to capture immediate domain shifts, and a Slow-Teacher ($T_2$) updated via contrastive optimization to maintain long-term invariance. This decoupling mitigates the trade-off between fitting new domains and remembering old ones.

### Mechanism 2: Source-Free Prototyping via Dual-Criterion Filtering
The method constructs class-specific priority queues using features from $T_1$. Features are admitted only if entropy is low ($H_t \leq \sigma$) AND prediction sensitivity ($\Delta p_t$) is high, ensuring only reliable pseudo-labels contribute to prototype generation.

### Mechanism 3: Contrastive Generalization Enforcement
$T_2$ is trained using a contrastive loss ($L_{CL}$) that pulls its feature representations closer to the corresponding class prototypes derived from $T_1$, preserving class topology across sequential domains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
  - Why needed here: Used to update the Fast-Teacher ($T_1$) and smooth the Student updates
  - Quick check question: How does the smoothing factor $\alpha$ (Eq. 3) determine the "memory" of previous domains in $T_1$?

- **Symmetric Cross Entropy (SCE)**
  - Why needed here: Used for the self-training loss ($L_{ST}$) between the student and teachers to handle noisy pseudo-labels
  - Quick check question: Why might standard Cross-Entropy fail in CTTA where pseudo-labels are unreliable?

- **Prediction Sensitivity / Robustness**
  - Why needed here: The PLPD (Pseudo-Label Probability Difference) metric is crucial for the "Sensitivity Criterion" to filter out features that are merely "lucky" guesses
  - Quick check question: How does augmenting the input $x_t$ test the stability of a model's prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Test Sample $x_t$ -> Student (S) -> Fast-Teacher ($T_1$) -> Priority Queues -> Slow-Teacher ($T_2$) -> Ensemble Prediction
- **Critical path:** Student processes batch → $T_1$ (EMA) extracts features and pseudo-labels → Features filtered by Entropy & Sensitivity into Priority Queues → Prototypes computed from Queues → $T_2$ aligns its features to Prototypes via Contrastive Loss → Student aligns to both $T_1$ and $T_2$ via SCE
- **Design tradeoffs:** SloMo-Fast vs. SloMo-Fast* (BN-only vs. full update); Queue Size (too small vs. too large)
- **Failure signatures:** Collapse of Prototypes (empty queues or mode collapse); Teacher Divergence (significant disagreement between $T_1$ and $T_2$)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Ablate the Sensitivity Criterion (use only Entropy filtering) 2) Validate on Cyclic-TTA benchmark 3) Compare SloMo-Fast (BN-only) vs. SloMo-Fast* on resource-constrained setting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper introduces Cyclic-TTA but does not explore scenarios where recurring domains undergo significant intra-domain distribution shifts since their previous appearance. The framework's reliance on memory-based prototypes may be less effective if the recurring domain has evolved, potentially causing a mismatch between stored prototype knowledge and new reality.

## Limitations
- Confidence in long-term generalization claims is medium because Cyclic-TTA only demonstrates repeated domains, not truly novel ones over extended timescales
- The method's reliance on entropy and prediction sensitivity thresholds introduces sensitivity to hyperparameter choices
- Real-time deployment feasibility on edge devices is uncertain due to computational overhead of maintaining two teacher networks

## Confidence
- **High**: Dual-teacher architecture effectiveness, ablation study results, state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks
- **Medium**: Long-term generalization claims, parameter efficiency relative to alternatives, robustness to extreme domain shifts
- **Low**: Claims about being first parameter-efficient method, real-time deployment viability, generalization to truly novel domains beyond Cyclic-TTA

## Next Checks
1. **Extreme Domain Shift Test**: Run SloMo-Fast on corruption severity 5 where all samples exceed entropy threshold 0.5—verify prototype queues do not empty and contrastive learning remains functional
2. **Temporal Consistency Analysis**: Track Slow-Teacher adaptation rate across Cyclic-TTA cycles; measure if adaptation rate actually decreases over time, confirming knowledge retention
3. **Parameter Efficiency Benchmark**: Compare SloMo-Fast BN-only variant against other lightweight CTTA methods on ImageNet-C with identical compute constraints, measuring both accuracy and FLOPs per inference
