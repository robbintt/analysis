# VISAT: Benchmarking Adversarial and Distribution Shift Robustness in Traffic Sign Recognition with Visual Attributes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.26833
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26833
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** VISAT benchmarks traffic sign recognition robustness under adversarial attacks and distribution shifts using a novel dataset built on MTSD with added visual attributes (color, shape, symbol, text).

## Executive Summary
VISAT introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating traffic sign recognition robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. The study builds upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD) by adding detailed visual attribute annotations (color, shape, symbol, text) to enable multi-task learning evaluation. Through extensive experiments with ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32 architectures, the research demonstrates that multi-task learning models show increased robustness overall, but reveal spurious correlations between tasks that can be exploited through targeted attacks. The benchmark includes novel evaluation methods such as color quantization shifts and relative error correlation metrics to systematically assess both model-agnostic and model-specific robustness threats.

## Method Summary
The VISAT benchmark leverages the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD) by cropping full-frame images into patches using bounding box annotations and adding class-level visual attribute labels for color, shape, symbol, and text. The study evaluates both single-task base models (ResNet-152, ViT-B/32) and multi-task learning variants that share a backbone but branch into task-specific heads. Models are trained using weighted cross-entropy loss and evaluated across three attack vectors: PGD-based adversarial attacks with $\epsilon=0.2$, ImageNet-C corruptions, and color quantization shifts. The evaluation framework introduces metrics including relative error ($\Delta\epsilon$), cumulative relative error ($\epsilon_{cu}$), and relative error correlation (RECorr) to quantify spurious correlations between tasks.

## Key Results
- Multi-task learning models showed increased robustness overall compared to single-task baselines
- Color and shape tasks were most vulnerable to adversarial attacks, revealing spurious correlations in the learned feature space
- Color quantization revealed noticeable error correlation among MTL tasks, even when attacks targeted only the color task
- ResNet-152 demonstrated greater robustness than ViT-B/32 under certain ImageNet-C corruptions
- Fine-tuning backbones improved MTL robustness compared to frozen backbone variants

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Out-of-distribution attacks targeting a single visual attribute induce errors in semantically distinct tasks, exposing spurious correlations in the learned feature space.
- **Mechanism:** In hard-parameter-sharing MTL, a shared backbone encodes representations for all tasks. If the backbone learns shortcuts (e.g., associating "red" with "stop"), an OOD shift targeting the shortcut feature degrades performance across all dependent tasks, even if the underlying semantic content remains intact.
- **Core assumption:** The model relies on non-causal correlations between visual attributes during inference.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Color quantization revealed spurious correlations among MTL tasks... attacks targeting one specific task result in noticeable $\Delta \epsilon$ in other tasks."
  - [section 4] "The results reveal noticeable RECorr for all 4 models under attacks specifically targeting their color task."
  - [corpus] Weak support; related work focuses on general adversarial resilience rather than inter-task correlation.
- **Break condition:** If tasks are explicitly disentangled (e.g., via adversarial training to remove color info from shape features) or if the backbone is trained with sufficient regularization to enforce independence.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Adversarial perturbations generated on ViT transfer effectively to ResNet, but the reverse transfer is significantly weaker.
- **Mechanism:** This asymmetry suggests ViT's decision boundaries are more diverse or span a larger feature manifold than ResNet's. Perturbations effective on the "superset" (ViT) manifold remain valid on the "subset" (ResNet) manifold, but ResNet-specific perturbations may not exist in the ViT solution space.
- **Core assumption:** The transferability of adversarial examples correlates with the overlap or containment of the models' effective feature manifolds.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] Mentions comparing performance between base and MTL models.
  - [section 4] "PGD attacks generated using RBFT are ineffective against VBFT... while attacks generated using VBFT remain effective for RBFT."
  - [corpus] "Adversarial attacks are widely studied... can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output" (Quantum Computing...), confirming general transferability but not this specific asymmetry.
- **Break condition:** If the models share identical architectures or are trained with shared representations (e.g., distillation), transferability might become symmetric.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Fine-tuning the backbone in MTL models confers greater robustness to natural distribution shifts compared to training linear "probes" with frozen backbones.
- **Mechanism:** Fine-tuning allows the backbone to adapt its low-level and mid-level features to accommodate the joint distribution of all tasks. This adaptation creates a more robust shared representation compared to a frozen backbone where fixed features may be suboptimal for handling corruption or noise across multiple distinct heads.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-trained backbone features are not universally optimal for the specific combination of traffic sign attributes and corruption types without adaptation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...fine-tuning backbones improved MTL robustness."
  - [section 4] "We also evaluated the performances of RMFTL and VMFTL and saw noticeably worse overall robustness... due to the lack of backbone fine-tuning."
  - [corpus] Weak/No direct support for this specific fine-tuning vs. linear probe comparison in TSR.
- **Break condition:** If the pre-trained backbone is already extremely robust and the domain shift is minimal, fine-tuning might lead to overfitting, negating the robustness gain.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core attack vector used to generate adversarial examples. You must understand that PGD iteratively steps in the direction of maximizing loss within a constrained $\epsilon$-ball to evaluate worst-case robustness.
  - **Quick check question:** How does increasing the step size or number of iterations in PGD typically affect the strength of the adversarial attack?

- **Concept: Hard Parameter Sharing (MTL)**
  - **Why needed here:** The MTL models in VISAT share a backbone (ResNet/ViT) and branch into task-specific heads. Understanding this architecture is essential to diagnosing why an attack on one head affects the others (shared weights).
  - **Quick check question:** In hard parameter sharing, what part of the network is updated by gradients from *all* tasks simultaneously?

- **Concept: Relative Error Correlation ($RE_{Corr}$)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the specific metric introduced in the paper to quantify spurious correlation. It measures the error rate of non-targeted tasks relative to the targeted task under attack.
  - **Quick check question:** If $RE_{Corr} = 0$, what does that imply about the independence of the tasks in the shared representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD) -> Preprocessing (Crop to BBox) -> Attribute Labeling System (Class-level annotation for Color, Shape, Symbol, Text) -> Backbone (ResNet-152 or ViT-B/32) -> Task Heads (Linear layers for 4 attributes + Main Class) -> Test Splits -> Attackers (PGD, ImageNet-C, Color Quantization) -> Metrics ($\epsilon$, $\Delta \epsilon$, $RE_{Corr}$)

- **Critical path:** The Attribute Labeling System is the most critical manual component. Errors or inconsistencies in defining attributes (e.g., defining "symbol" vs "text") directly propagate into spurious correlation measurements.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Class-level vs. Instance-level Attributes: The paper chooses class-level attributes for efficiency (labeling 401 classes vs. thousands of instances). Tradeoff: High efficiency and consistency, but loses fine-grained detail (e.g., occluded text on a specific sign might be mislabeled).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High $RE_{Corr}$ (> 0.5): Indicates the model is "cheating" by using correlated features (e.g., using red pixels to determine "Stop" instead of reading the text or shape).
  - Asymmetric Transfer: If your defense prevents attacks from Model A but not Model B, you are likely vulnerable to black-box transfer attacks from diverse architectures.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce PGD Asymmetry:** Train a Base ResNet and ViT on VISAT. Generate attacks on ResNet and test on ViT, then vice versa. Verify the "ineffective" transfer described in the paper.
  2. **Spurious Correlation Check:** Take the pre-trained RMFT model. Apply the Color Quantization shift. Observe if the Shape/Symbol head error rates rise ($\Delta \epsilon > 0$).
  3. **Backbone Ablation:** Train RMFT (fine-tuned backbone) and RMFTL (frozen backbone). Compare their accuracy on the ImageNet-C "Fog" or "Snow" splits to confirm the robustness gap.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How do object detection models like R-CNNs and YOLOs perform regarding bounding box robustness under the adversarial and distribution shift conditions defined in VISAT?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in "Limitations and Future Work" that their focus is on classification prediction and future work should include robustness assessments for bounding box predictions involving models such as R-CNNs and YOLOs.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study only evaluates classification backbones (ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32) and does not provide metrics for localization tasks.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmark results evaluating mean Average Precision (mAP) and localization error under PGD attacks and ImageNet-C corruptions for detection models.

- **Question:** Can targeted distribution shifts against shape, symbol, or text attributes reveal spurious correlations in MTL models similar to those found using color quantization?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper notes that future research should expand attacks beyond color to target shape, symbol, and text tasks for a comprehensive assessment of spurious correlations.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current analysis of spurious correlations relies exclusively on color quantization attacks.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Metrics of relative error correlation (RECorr) across MTL tasks when applying specific perturbations or quantization techniques to non-color attributes.

- **Question:** How does the robustness of traffic sign recognition models vary when subjected to adversarial algorithms other than Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify exploring alternative adversarial algorithms as an area that warrants further investigation.
  - **Why unresolved:** The benchmark exclusively utilizes the PGD method to generate adversarial examples.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative performance analysis of VISAT models under diverse attack vectors such as AutoAttack or CW attack.

## Limitations

- **Data splitting uncertainty:** The paper does not specify the random seed used to generate train/val/test splits, which may affect reproducibility despite releasing the codebase to generate splits.
- **Limited real-world validation:** Color quantization and ImageNet-C corruptions serve as proxies for real-world conditions, but their correlation with actual traffic sign appearance variations (weather, lighting, damage) is not established.
- **Architecture scope:** The benchmark focuses exclusively on classification backbones (ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32) and does not evaluate detection models or other architectural families.

## Confidence

- **High:** ResNet outperforms ViT under certain corruptions (supported by direct comparisons in tables)
- **Medium:** MTL improves overall robustness (supported but requires careful interpretation of metrics)
- **Medium:** Fine-tuning backbone improves robustness (supported but effect size varies by corruption type)

## Next Checks

1. **RECov metric validation:** Compare RECorr against alternative correlation measures (e.g., mutual information) on the same dataset to verify it captures spurious correlations appropriately.
2. **Cross-architecture transfer testing:** Repeat asymmetric transfer experiments with additional architecture pairs (e.g., EfficientNet, Swin Transformer) to establish pattern generalizability.
3. **Real-world correlation study:** Collect traffic sign images under varying weather/lighting conditions and measure actual correlation between attribute predictions to validate the proxy distribution shifts.
