# Every Question Has Its Own Value: Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20187
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20187
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines by incorporating human-defined value signals into LLM reward functions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method that aligns Large Language Model optimization with quantifiable human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the reward function.

Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels, RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy: concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. The paper demonstrates this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on end-of-sequence tokens.

## Method Summary
RLEV extends standard RLVR by integrating human-defined value signals into the reward function. The method uses exam-style datasets with explicit ground-truth value labels to train policies that optimize for both correctness and value-weighted outcomes. During training, value signals are incorporated multiplicatively with correctness rewards, creating a composite reward signal. The policy gradient updates are weighted by these combined signals, with particular amplification at end-of-sequence tokens, enabling the model to learn when to be concise versus thorough based on the prompt's assigned value.

## Key Results
- RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only RLVR baselines across multiple RL algorithms and model scales
- RLEV policies learn a value-sensitive termination behavior: concise responses for low-value prompts, thorough responses for high-value ones
- The value-sensitive behavior is causally linked to value-weighted gradient amplification on end-of-sequence tokens
- RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as difficulty-based labels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RLEV works by directly incorporating human value signals into the reinforcement learning reward function. Unlike RLVR which only optimizes for binary correctness, RLEV creates a composite reward signal that multiplies correctness rewards by human-defined value weights. This amplification is particularly pronounced at end-of-sequence tokens, where the policy learns to associate high-value prompts with more thorough responses and low-value prompts with more concise ones. The explicit value signal provides a quantifiable utility function that the model can optimize, effectively aligning the LLM's behavior with human priorities rather than treating all tasks as equally important.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**
   - Why needed: Baseline approach that optimizes LLMs using binary correctness rewards for objective tasks
   - Quick check: Can be verified by comparing RLEV against RLVR performance

2. **Policy Gradient Methods**
   - Why needed: Core algorithm for updating LLM parameters based on reward signals
   - Quick check: Gradient updates should reflect value-weighted accuracy improvements

3. **Value-weighted Reward Signals**
   - Why needed: Allows incorporation of human priorities into the optimization objective
   - Quick check: Model behavior should differ based on prompt value labels

4. **End-of-sequence token behavior**
   - Why needed: Critical for understanding how models learn value-sensitive termination policies
   - Quick check: Gradient amplification should be observable at EOS tokens

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: LLM -> Policy Gradient Optimizer -> Value-weighted Reward Function -> Value Labels

Critical Path: Training data (exam-style questions with value labels) → Model input → Reward computation (correctness × value) → Policy gradient update → Optimized policy with value-sensitive behavior

Design Tradeoffs:
- Using explicit value labels requires carefully curated datasets but provides clear optimization signals
- Value-weighted gradients at EOS tokens enable behavior adaptation but may require careful tuning to avoid premature truncation

Failure Signatures:
- If value signals are completely misaligned, model may learn inverse behaviors (concise for high-value prompts)
- Insufficient value signal diversity may lead to uniform response lengths regardless of prompt value

First Experiments:
1. Compare RLEV vs RLVR on a controlled exam dataset with known value labels
2. Analyze response length distribution across different value categories
3. Visualize gradient magnitudes at EOS tokens for high vs low value prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Reliance on exam-style datasets with explicit ground-truth value labels limits generalization to real-world scenarios
- Experiments focus primarily on multiple-choice question formats, leaving open questions about generative task transfer
- Value signal robustness only partially validated with difficulty-based labels, lacking testing with systematically corrupted or inverted value signals

## Confidence

- High: Empirical gains of RLEV over RLVR in controlled exam settings with known value labels
- Medium: Claim that RLEV learns value-sensitive termination policy based on behavioral evidence from prompt-specific output lengths
- Medium: Assertion that value-weighted gradient amplification drives observed behavior, inferred from gradients rather than direct observation

## Next Checks

1. Test RLEV on open-ended or generative tasks where value labels are less clear-cut, such as summarization or reasoning tasks with multi-step outputs

2. Introduce adversarial value signals (e.g., systematically inverted or random value labels) to assess robustness under corrupted supervision

3. Conduct detailed ablation study on contribution of value signals at different stages of the policy (e.g., mid-sequence vs. end-of-sequence) to isolate causal role of value-weighted gradients
