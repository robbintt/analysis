# Theory of Scaling Laws for In-Context Regression: Depth, Width, Context and Time

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01098
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01098
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Deep linear attention models exhibit distinct scaling regimes for in-context learning, with depth benefits depending on context length and data structure

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing in-context learning (ICL) of linear regression using deep linear attention models. The authors identify a new asymptotic scaling regime where context length, number of masked points, and contexts per step scale linearly with dimension. They introduce three distinct ICL data models and derive power laws showing how performance depends on width, depth, context length, and data per context. The work establishes that depth only benefits ICL performance when context length is limited for isotropic and fixed structured settings, while providing significant improvements even at infinite context length for randomly rotated structured covariances.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a solvable model of in-context learning that characterizes how performance depends on computational resources (width, depth, context length) and statistical resources (data per context). They consider deep linear attention models performing linear regression on multiple contexts with a single masked point per context. The framework identifies three distinct asymptotic regimes (limited, linear, and logarithmic depth regimes) and derives explicit scaling laws for each. The analysis covers three data structure settings: isotropic, fixed structured, and randomly rotated structured covariances, with particular attention to power-law features.

## Key Results
- Depth only benefits ICL performance when context length is limited for isotropic and fixed structured settings
- Depth provides significant improvements even at infinite context length for randomly rotated structured covariances
- Loss scales as L(t,N,L,P) ~ t^(-βt) + N^(-βN) + L^(-βL) + P^(-βP) with optimal width-depth scaling L ~ N^ν where ν depends on data properties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's theoretical framework captures how in-context learning performance depends on the interplay between model capacity (width and depth) and the statistical properties of the data distribution. The key insight is that depth can either help or hinder performance depending on whether the context length is sufficient to capture the relevant correlations in the data. When context length is limited, additional depth allows the model to better utilize the available information, but when context length is large, excessive depth can lead to overfitting to noise.

## Foundational Learning

**Deep Linear Attention Models**
- Why needed: Provides a tractable theoretical framework for analyzing in-context learning
- Quick check: Model should reduce to matrix multiplication with learnable parameters

**Scaling Laws**
- Why needed: Characterizes how performance depends on computational and statistical resources
- Quick check: Power-law relationships between loss and model/data parameters should emerge

**Asymptotic Regimes**
- Why needed: Different scaling behaviors emerge in different parameter limits
- Quick check: Three distinct regimes (limited, linear, logarithmic depth) should be identifiable

**Data Structure Properties**
- Why needed: The benefit of depth depends critically on data covariance structure
- Quick check: Isotropic, fixed structured, and randomly rotated structured covariances should show different depth scaling behaviors

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Data -> Deep Linear Attention Model -> ICL Loss -> Scaling Analysis

**Critical Path**
The critical path involves computing attention weights over context tokens, applying depth through repeated attention layers, and aggregating predictions for masked tokens. The depth scaling behavior emerges from how information propagates through these layers under different data structure assumptions.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework reveals a fundamental tradeoff between depth and context length: when context is limited, depth helps extract more information, but when context is abundant, depth can be harmful due to overfitting. This contrasts with standard supervised learning where depth generally helps.

**Failure Signatures**
The theory predicts that excessive depth relative to context length will lead to overfitting, particularly for isotropic and fixed structured data settings. For randomly rotated structured covariances, depth benefits persist even at large context lengths.

**First Experiments**
1. Vary depth while holding width and context length constant to observe the predicted limited-depth regime
2. Vary context length while holding depth and width constant to observe the transition between regimes
3. Compare scaling behavior across the three data structure settings to validate the different depth benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several important open questions including: how the theoretical framework extends to non-linear attention mechanisms and non-linear regression tasks, whether the depth-context trade-offs generalize to practical ICL scenarios with transformers, and how to identify which asymptotic regime best characterizes real-world in-context learning performance.

## Limitations
- Analysis restricted to deep linear attention models and linear regression tasks
- Theoretical predictions require validation against empirical results on real-world datasets
- The three data structure assumptions may not fully capture the complexity of practical ICL scenarios

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The mathematical framework and derivation of scaling laws are rigorous and internally consistent. The identification of different asymptotic regimes is well-supported.

**Medium confidence**: The theoretical predictions about depth benefits in different data regimes are plausible but require empirical validation.

**Medium confidence**: The specific power-law exponents and optimal scaling relationships are derived theoretically but their practical applicability depends on how well real data matches the assumed data models.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation**: Test the predicted scaling laws on real transformer models performing in-context regression tasks with synthetic and real datasets matching the three data structure assumptions.

2. **Beyond linear models**: Extend the theoretical framework to non-linear attention mechanisms and non-linear regression tasks to assess whether core insights about depth-context trade-offs generalize.

3. **Practical regime identification**: Conduct experiments to determine which of the three identified asymptotic regimes best characterizes practical in-context learning scenarios across different model scales and task complexities.
