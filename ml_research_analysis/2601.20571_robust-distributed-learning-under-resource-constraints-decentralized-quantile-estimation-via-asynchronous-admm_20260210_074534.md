# Robust Distributed Learning under Resource Constraints: Decentralized Quantile Estimation via (Asynchronous) ADMM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20571
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20571
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AsylADMM achieves O(1) memory per node for decentralized quantile estimation, converging faster than existing methods while maintaining robustness to data corruption

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of robust decentralized learning on resource-constrained edge devices, where data must be processed locally to minimize communication. The authors propose AsylADMM, an asynchronous ADMM-based gossip algorithm that estimates medians and quantiles while using only two variables per node regardless of network degree. Unlike existing asynchronous ADMM methods requiring O(degree) memory, AsylADMM aggregates dual variables to achieve practical memory efficiency. The algorithm demonstrates faster convergence than competing methods across various network topologies and provides robustness to data contamination through quantile-based trimming, outperforming existing rank-based methods.

## Method Summary
AsylADMM implements decentralized median and quantile estimation using an asynchronous gossip ADMM framework. Each node maintains only two variables: a primal estimate xₖ and an aggregated dual variable μ̂ₖ. When edge (i,j) activates, both nodes compute the average zₑ = (xᵢ + xⱼ)/2 and update their dual variables μ̂ₖ ← μ̂ₖ + ρ(zₑ - xₖ)/dₖ, followed by a proximal update xₖ ← prox_{fₖ/(ρdₖ)}(zₑ + μ̂ₖ/ρ). The proximal operator for the pinball loss provides closed-form updates for quantile estimation. The algorithm achieves memory efficiency by aggregating edge-specific dual variables into μ̂ₖ, eliminating the need to store 2d variables per node where d is node degree.

## Key Results
- AsylADMM converges faster than DAPD, AsyncADMM, and subgradient descent across geometric, cycle, and Watts-Strogatz networks
- Quantile-based trimming outperforms existing rank-based trimming methods empirically
- Memory usage reduced from O(degree) to O(1) per node, enabling deployment on devices with limited memory
- Strong robustness to data contamination demonstrated across multiple network sizes and topologies
- Scales effectively to large networks (n > 1000) while maintaining performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Memory Reduction via Dual Variable Aggregation
- Claim: AsylADMM achieves O(1) memory per node instead of O(degree) by aggregating dual variables.
- Mechanism: Instead of storing 2d edge-specific dual variables yₑ,k per node, the algorithm uses the reparameterization μ̂ₖ = Σₑ yₑ,k/dₖ. This aggregated form suffices for the proximal update because Lemma 3.1 shows xₖ = prox_{fₖ/(ρdₖ)}(ẑₖ + μ̂ₖ/ρ). The key insight is that the consensus constraint information can be compressed into a single aggregate without losing convergence properties.
- Core assumption: The aggregated dual variable μ̂ₖ captures sufficient neighborhood constraint information; individual edge variables are not necessary for convergence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "AsylADMM needs only two variables per node" vs "2d+1 variables per node (where d is node degree)"
  - [Section 3.2]: Lemma 3.1 proves equivalence between edge-based and aggregated formulations
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus evidence; neighbor paper "Asynchronous Gossip Algorithms for Rank-Based Statistical Methods" discusses robustness but not this specific aggregation technique
- Break condition: If the proximal operator requires edge-specific constraint information (e.g., for non-uniform consensus weights), aggregation may fail.

### Mechanism 2: Fast Convergence via Current-Information Consensus
- Claim: AsylADMM converges faster than AsyncADMM and DAPD by using current information from both edge endpoints.
- Mechanism: When edge (i,j) activates, AsylADMM computes ẑₑ = (xᵢ + xⱼ)/2 using both nodes' current values. AsyncADMM uses outdated neighbor values (xₒˡᵈ), while DAPD uses a mix of current local and outdated neighbor information. Section 3.3 explicitly states this difference: "AsylADMM uses current information from both endpoints... This heuristic performs remarkably well in practice, thanks to its use of up-to-date information and the underlying gossip principle."
- Core assumption: The gossip averaging process provides sufficient global information diffusion despite using only pairwise updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.3]: Explicit comparison of how each method estimates ẑₖ
  - [Figure 1(a,b)]: Empirical convergence plots showing AsylADMM outperforming baselines
  - [corpus]: "Asynchronous Decentralized SGD under Non-Convexity" discusses similar asynchronous coordination challenges but in SGD context
- Break condition: On dense graphs with high communication delays, the "current information" advantage may degrade as nodes become outdated between activations.

### Mechanism 3: Robustness via Pinball Loss Proximal Operator
- Claim: The algorithm achieves robustness to data corruption through quantile estimation, which is less sensitive to outliers than mean estimation.
- Mechanism: Quantiles are computed by minimizing the pinball loss L_α(z) = (α - I{z≤0})z. This loss is convex and non-smooth but has a closed-form proximal operator (Section 2.2). The proximal operator clips values to [a-γβ, a+γ], providing natural robustness to extreme observations. This extends to robust trimming: observations outside [q_α, q_{1-α}] are excluded.
- Core assumption: Contamination affects tail observations; median/quantile-based statistics have high breakdown points (up to 50%).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.2]: Closed-form proximal operator for pinball loss
  - [Section 4.1]: Quantile-based trimming excludes tail observations
  - [corpus]: Neighbor paper "High-Dimensional Differentially Private Quantile Regression" connects quantile methods to robustness and privacy
- Break condition: If contamination is concentrated near the target quantile rather than in tails, robustness degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers)**
  - Why needed here: AsylADMM is built on ADMM's splitting approach, which decouples consensus constraints from local optimization. Understanding primal-dual updates and augmented Lagrangians is essential.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why ADMM handles non-smooth objectives better than gradient descent?

- Concept: **Proximal Operators**
  - Why needed here: The core update uses prox_{fₖ}(·) for non-smooth pinball loss. You need to understand what proximal operators do and why they have closed forms for certain loss functions.
  - Quick check question: What is the proximal operator of the ℓ₁-norm at point z with step size γ?

- Concept: **Gossip Protocols for Decentralized Consensus**
  - Why needed here: The communication model is randomized gossip where edges are sampled with probability pₑ. Understanding how pairwise averaging leads to global consensus is foundational.
  - Quick check question: How many iterations does standard gossip require to achieve ε-accuracy on a connected graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Node k State: {xₖ (primal estimate), μ̂ₖ (aggregated dual), aₖ (local observation)} → Communication: Edge (i,j) activation → both nodes exchange xᵢ, xⱼ → Local Update: Compute zₑ = average, update μ̂ₖ, apply proximal operator → Repeat until convergence

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize: xₖ ← aₖ, μ̂ₖ ← 0 for all nodes
  2. Sample edge e = (i,j) with probability pₑ
  3. Both nodes compute zₑ ← (xᵢ + xⱼ)/2
  4. Each node k ∈ {i,j} updates:
     - μ̂ₖ ← μ̂ₖ + ρ(zₑ - xₖ)/dₖ
     - xₖ ← prox_{fₖ/(ρdₖ)}(zₑ + μ̂ₖ/ρ)
  5. Repeat until convergence

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **ρ (step size)**: Larger ρ accelerates consensus but may cause oscillation. Paper uses ρ ∈ [0.1, 1.0].
  - **Graph topology**: Higher connectivity (larger spectral gap) → faster convergence (Figure 1c). Cycle graphs require ~10× more iterations than Watts-Strogatz.
  - **Edge sampling pₑ**: Standard choice pₑ = (1/n)(1/dᵢ + 1/dⱼ). Uniform sampling may slow convergence on irregular graphs.

- Failure signatures:
  - Divergence: Using edge-specific yₑ,k without aggregation causes divergence (Section 3.2 notes μ̂ₖ encodes all neighbor constraints).
  - Slow convergence on dense graphs: AsyncADMM and DAPD degrade significantly (Appendix C.1).
  - Extreme quantile instability: α ∈ {0.1, 0.9} with tail contamination causes degradation (Appendix C.2).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce Figure 1a**: n=101 nodes, geometric graph, contaminated Gaussian (80% N(10,9), 20% N(30,25)), compare AsylADMM vs DAPD vs subgradient descent for median estimation. Verify ~2-3× faster convergence.
  2. **Vary graph topology**: Run AsylADMM on cycle, geometric, and Watts-Strogatz graphs with identical data. Measure iterations to reach MAE < 0.5. Confirm spectral gap correlates with convergence rate.
  3. **Memory profiling**: Instrument node memory usage. Compare AsylADMM (2 variables) vs AsyncADMM (2d+1 variables) on a complete graph with n=100 (d=99). Expect ~100× memory reduction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does AsylADMM converge in the asynchronous setting, and can theoretical convergence guarantees be established?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state their convergence analysis applies only to the synchronous variant: "we believe provides a preliminary basis for understanding the asynchronous case." Appendix G outlines a potential martingale-based proof approach but notes that using ˆµk(e) breaks the antisymmetry property, introducing an additional term A(t) that prevents direct application of standard supermartingale arguments.
- Why unresolved: The surrogate dual variable ˆµk(e) breaks the antisymmetry property that held in the synchronous case, creating an additional term A(t) whose behavior is not theoretically characterized, though empirically observed to converge to zero.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof establishing that A(t) is bounded or decays sufficiently, or an alternative Lyapunov function construction that circumvents the antisymmetry requirement.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical justification for using ze instead of the aggregate ˆzk in the asynchronous primal update?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "This choice is motivated by the fact that ˆµk admits a clean update... whereas ˆzk does not. Moreover, we observed that using ze instead of ˆzk in the update does not significantly affect convergence in practice."
- Why unresolved: The choice is presented as a heuristic justified by empirical observation and implementability, not by theoretical analysis. No formal guarantee connects this approximation to convergence.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis bounding the approximation error introduced by using ze versus ˆzk, or characterization of conditions under which the two approaches are equivalent.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the correction term δk(t) for robust regression be automatically tuned in a fully decentralized setting?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes: "κ may be hard to tune in a decentralized setting and requires further investigation." The simultaneous approach to robust regression requires this correction term, but selecting κ depends on graph topology and data distribution—information not globally available.
- Why unresolved: The correction parameter κ balances estimation uncertainty against inclusion decisions, but without centralized knowledge of network properties or data statistics, nodes cannot independently determine appropriate values.
- What evidence would resolve it: A decentralized mechanism for estimating the necessary graph spectral properties or an adaptive scheme that automatically adjusts δk(t) based on local convergence indicators.

## Limitations

- Graph topology specifics: The paper uses geometric graphs but doesn't specify the distance threshold for edge creation, making exact reproduction difficult.
- Stopping criteria ambiguity: Experiments use fixed iteration counts (5×10⁴) but don't specify convergence tolerances or early stopping rules.
- Contamination model details: While the contamination ratio (20%) is specified, the exact sampling procedure for outliers and their distribution across nodes isn't fully detailed.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Memory efficiency claims (O(1) vs O(degree) variables), convergence speed comparisons on geometric graphs, and the core mechanism of dual variable aggregation via μ̂ₖ.

**Medium confidence**: Performance on varying graph topologies (cycle vs Watts-Strogatz), exact MAE values in Figure 1, and robustness to different contamination levels.

**Low confidence**: Generalization to other network topologies beyond those tested, performance on extremely large graphs (n > 1000) beyond the single validation point, and behavior with non-Gaussian contamination patterns.

## Next Checks

1. **Memory profiling validation**: Instrument the implementation to count actual memory usage per node. Compare AsylADMM (2 variables) against AsyncADMM (2d+1 variables) on complete graphs with varying n. Verify the claimed 100× reduction for d=99.

2. **Graph topology sensitivity**: Systematically test AsylADMM on cycle, geometric, Watts-Strogatz, and complete graphs with identical data distributions. Measure convergence rates and identify the threshold where density begins degrading performance for baseline methods.

3. **Contamination robustness test**: Vary contamination percentage (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%) and contamination distribution (uniform vs clustered vs targeted at median). Measure breakdown point where MAE exceeds acceptable thresholds, validating the claimed robustness properties.
