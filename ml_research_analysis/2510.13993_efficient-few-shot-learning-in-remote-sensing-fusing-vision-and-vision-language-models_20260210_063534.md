# Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13993
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: YOLOv8-VLM fusion achieves 48.46% improvement in object counting accuracy and 6.17% CLIPScore gain for image captioning in remote sensing aircraft detection

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the integration of YOLOv8 with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) including LLaVA, ChatGPT, and Gemini to enhance aircraft detection and scene understanding in remote sensing applications. The approach focuses on improving few-shot learning performance, particularly under degraded image conditions. By combining YOLO's precise object detection capabilities with VLMs' contextual reasoning and language understanding, the method aims to achieve more accurate and interpretable results for remote sensing tasks.

The proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in both object counting accuracy and image captioning performance when evaluated on the Airbus Aircraft Detection Dataset. The fusion approach shows particular effectiveness for degraded imagery and provides enhanced interpretability through combined visual and language outputs. The method is designed to work with both labelled and unlabelled data, suggesting potential for scalable deployment in real-world remote sensing applications.

## Method Summary
The study combines YOLOv8's object detection capabilities with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to create a hybrid system for remote sensing analysis. The approach leverages YOLOv8 for precise bounding box detection of aircraft and VLMs for contextual understanding and scene interpretation. The fusion enables the system to perform both accurate object localization and semantic scene understanding, with particular focus on few-shot learning scenarios where limited training data is available.

The evaluation methodology employs the Airbus Aircraft Detection Dataset to assess performance across multiple metrics including object counting accuracy (measured via Mean Absolute Error) and image captioning quality (measured via CLIPScore). The study compares the fused YOLO-VLM approach against standalone YOLOv8 implementations and includes both quantitative metrics and manual assessment of bounding box quality, particularly for degraded imagery conditions.

## Key Results
- 48.46% average improvement in Mean Absolute Error for object counting accuracy compared to baseline YOLOv8
- 6.17% improvement in CLIPScore for image captioning tasks
- Bounding boxes significantly enhance model accuracy, especially for degraded imagery
- Method effective for both labelled and unlabelled data scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from combining YOLOv8's strong object localization capabilities with VLMs' contextual reasoning abilities. YOLOv8 provides precise spatial information about detected objects through bounding boxes, while VLMs contribute semantic understanding and scene interpretation that helps distinguish between similar objects and understand complex aerial scenes. This complementary relationship allows the system to leverage the strengths of both approaches - YOLO's accuracy in detection and VLMs' ability to understand context and relationships between objects.

The few-shot learning improvement occurs because VLMs can generalize from limited examples by understanding the semantic relationships between objects and their environments. When trained on minimal data, the VLM component helps the system infer object characteristics and relationships that might not be explicitly present in the limited training set, effectively augmenting the detection capabilities of YOLOv8 in data-scarce scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Image -> YOLOv8 Backbone -> Feature Maps -> VLM Fusion Module -> Output Detection + Context
**Critical Path**: Image preprocessing → YOLOv8 detection → Feature extraction → VLM integration → Post-processing → Final output
**Design Tradeoffs**: Precision vs. computational efficiency - VLMs add semantic understanding but increase inference time and resource requirements
**Failure Signatures**: Degraded performance in severe weather conditions, potential hallucinations in VLM-generated context, increased computational overhead affecting real-time capabilities
**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare object detection accuracy with and without VLM integration on clean vs. degraded imagery
2. Measure inference time overhead introduced by VLM fusion across different hardware configurations
3. Test few-shot learning performance with varying numbers of training examples to identify the minimum effective dataset size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a single aircraft detection dataset, restricting generalizability across diverse remote sensing scenarios
- Performance degradation observed in severe weather conditions suggests limited operational robustness
- Computational overhead of combining YOLO with VLMs not quantified, raising practical deployment concerns
- Manual assessment quality depends on reviewer expertise and may introduce subjective bias

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Object counting accuracy improvements (48.46% MAE reduction) and bounding box enhancement effects
- **Medium Confidence**: CLIPScore improvements and general few-shot learning performance claims
- **Low Confidence**: Scalability assertions and generalization across different remote sensing applications

## Next Checks
1. Test the YOLO-VLM fusion approach across multiple remote sensing datasets (e.g., satellite imagery, SAR data) to assess cross-domain generalization
2. Conduct computational efficiency benchmarking comparing the fused model against standalone YOLOv8 under identical hardware constraints
3. Perform ablation studies isolating the contributions of each VLM (LLaVA, ChatGPT, Gemini) to identify optimal architecture components
