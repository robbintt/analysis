# Zenith: Scaling up Ranking Models for Billion-scale Livestreaming Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21285
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21285
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: +1.05% CTR AUC gain in online A/B tests on TikTok Live platform

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of scaling ranking models for billion-scale livestreaming recommendation while maintaining low inference latency. The authors introduce Zenith, a novel architecture featuring Prime Tokens and tokenwise handling, designed to efficiently model complex feature interactions without excessive computational overhead. Zenith uses Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, including specialized designs like Retokenized Self-Attention and Tokenwise Sparse Mixture-of-Experts, to enhance model expressiveness and preserve token heterogeneity. The architecture is evaluated on the TikTok Live platform, demonstrating superior scaling laws and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
Zenith introduces a novel architecture for billion-scale livestreaming recommendation that addresses the fundamental trade-off between model expressiveness and computational efficiency. The key innovation is the Prime Tokens mechanism, which maintains token heterogeneity throughout the model while enabling efficient processing through tokenwise handling. The architecture employs Token Fusion modules that combine features from multiple sources using specialized attention mechanisms, and Token Boost modules that enhance model capacity through sparse mixture-of-experts layers. The design preserves fine-grained user interests while scaling to massive item catalogs, achieving superior performance through architectural innovations rather than simply increasing model size.

## Key Results
- +0.8% to +1.0% relative improvement in LogLoss in offline experiments
- +1.05% CTR AUC improvement in online A/B tests on TikTok Live platform
- +9.93% Quality Watch Session/User and +8.11% Quality Watch Duration/User gains
- Superior scaling laws compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining low latency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Zenith's effectiveness stems from its ability to maintain token heterogeneity throughout the model architecture while efficiently processing billions of items. The Prime Tokens mechanism creates distinct representations that capture different aspects of user behavior and item characteristics, preventing the loss of information that occurs in traditional architectures where all tokens are treated uniformly. The tokenwise handling approach allows the model to process different token types with specialized attention mechanisms and expert networks, ensuring that each type of interaction receives appropriate modeling capacity. The Token Fusion and Token Boost modules work together to enhance model expressiveness without the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms, enabling the system to scale effectively while preserving the nuanced patterns necessary for high-quality recommendations.

## Foundational Learning

**Token Heterogeneity**: The concept that different tokens in a sequence represent distinct types of information requiring specialized processing. Why needed: Traditional models treat all tokens equally, losing important distinctions. Quick check: Verify token types are meaningfully different and benefit from specialized handling.

**Sparse Mixture-of-Experts**: A technique where only a subset of model parameters are activated for each input, reducing computational cost. Why needed: Enables scaling to larger models without proportional increases in computation. Quick check: Ensure load balancing and that activated experts are appropriate for the input.

**Retokenized Self-Attention**: Modified attention mechanism that operates on re-tokenized representations. Why needed: Reduces quadratic complexity while preserving important interactions. Quick check: Validate attention patterns capture meaningful relationships between tokens.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Features -> Prime Tokens -> Token Fusion Modules -> Token Boost Modules -> Item Features -> Prediction

**Critical Path**: The sequence from feature encoding through Prime Tokens to Token Fusion represents the core information flow. Token Boost modules provide capacity enhancement but are not on the critical path for all inputs.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Zenith trades increased architectural complexity for better scaling and efficiency. The multiple specialized modules add implementation complexity but enable superior performance at scale compared to simpler, larger models.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur if token heterogeneity is not properly maintained, if expert networks become imbalanced, or if attention mechanisms fail to capture important interactions. Latency issues may arise if Token Boost modules are not properly gated.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare Prime Tokens performance against baseline token representations on a small dataset
2. Test Token Fusion module effectiveness in isolation before full integration
3. Evaluate Token Boost module gating strategy on computational efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single industrial platform (TikTok Live), raising generalizability concerns
- Computational overhead of maintaining token heterogeneity may offset efficiency gains in practice
- Limited ablation studies make it difficult to assess individual component contributions

## Confidence

**High confidence** in core architectural innovations (Prime Tokens, tokenwise handling, Token Fusion/Boost modules) as the paper provides detailed technical descriptions and clear motivation

**Medium confidence** in quantitative improvements, as results rely on proprietary TikTok data and lack public dataset reproducibility

**Medium confidence** in scaling law analysis, as the paper presents clear trends but comparison methodology could benefit from additional baselines

## Next Checks

1. Replicate key findings on public recommendation datasets (e.g., Criteo, Avazu) to verify generalizability beyond TikTok platform

2. Conduct controlled ablation studies isolating impact of Token Fusion vs. Token Boost modules on both performance and latency

3. Perform long-term A/B testing to assess model stability and potential degradation when scaling to multi-billion item catalogs
