# QoS-Efficient Serving of Multiple Mixture-of-Expert LLMs Using Partial Runtime Reconfiguration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.06481
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06481
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Achieves 85% average reduction in turnaround time versus NVIDIA MIG while serving multiple MoE models on a single GPU

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently serving multiple fine-tuned mixture-of-experts (MoE) large language models on a single GPU, which faces high memory demands and shared resource constraints in multi-tenant environments. The authors propose a system combining similarity-based expert consolidation—sharing similar experts across models to reduce memory footprint—with runtime partial reconfiguration that dynamically swaps non-expert layers when processing requests from different models. Experiments on NVIDIA A100 GPU using Mixtral-8x7B and Google Switch Transformer Base-8 models demonstrate throughput comparable to serving a single model while maintaining competitive output quality.

## Method Summary
The proposed serving system uses two key techniques: expert consolidation and runtime partial reconfiguration. Expert consolidation identifies and shares similar experts across different MoE models, reducing overall memory footprint by avoiding redundant storage of similar parameters. Runtime partial reconfiguration dynamically swaps non-expert layers when processing requests from different models, allowing the system to adapt to varying model requirements without reloading entire models. This approach enables efficient multi-tenant serving by optimizing both memory usage and computational resources while maintaining quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees.

## Key Results
- Achieves throughput comparable to serving a single MoE model while supporting multiple variants
- Demonstrates 85% average reduction in turnaround time compared to NVIDIA's multi-instance GPU (MIG)
- Maintains competitive output quality with only small increase in time-to-first-token
- Scales effectively across up to four model variants on a single A100 GPU

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system exploits the natural redundancy in MoE models where different fine-tuned versions often share similar expert parameters. By identifying and consolidating these similar experts, memory usage is significantly reduced. The partial runtime reconfiguration allows dynamic adaptation to different model requirements without full model reloading, enabling efficient context switching between requests targeting different MoE variants. This combination addresses both the memory bottleneck and the computational efficiency challenges of multi-tenant MoE serving.

## Foundational Learning

**Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture**: A neural network where different "experts" specialize in different types of input, with a gating network routing each input to the most appropriate expert. Why needed: Understanding this is fundamental to grasping why expert consolidation works. Quick check: Can you explain how routing decisions are made in MoE?

**Partial Reconfiguration**: The ability to dynamically swap specific layers or components of a model at runtime without reloading the entire model. Why needed: This is the core mechanism enabling efficient switching between different MoE variants. Quick check: What are the latency implications of swapping individual layers versus entire models?

**Expert Similarity Analysis**: Techniques for measuring and identifying functionally similar experts across different fine-tuned models. Why needed: This enables the consolidation strategy that reduces memory footprint. Quick check: How would you measure similarity between experts from different models?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Request Router -> Expert Consolidation Manager -> Runtime Reconfiguration Engine -> GPU Memory Manager -> Model Execution Unit

**Critical Path**: Request arrival → Routing decision → Expert consolidation lookup → Layer swapping (if needed) → Model execution → Output delivery

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades increased complexity in layer management and consolidation algorithms against improved resource utilization and throughput. The partial reconfiguration adds latency overhead but enables serving more models with less memory.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Expert consolidation mismatches leading to degraded output quality
- Layer swapping failures causing model execution errors
- Memory fragmentation preventing proper expert loading
- Routing conflicts when multiple requests target the same experts simultaneously

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Measure expert similarity scores across multiple fine-tuned versions of the same base MoE model
2. Benchmark layer swapping latency for different model architectures
3. Test consolidation effectiveness with varying numbers of model variants (2-4) on target GPU

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two specific MoE architectures without broader model family analysis
- Claims of 85% turnaround time reduction not validated in real-world deployment scenarios
- No analysis of failure recovery mechanisms when expert swapping introduces latency spikes
- Memory savings evaluated statically rather than under dynamic multi-tenant load patterns

## Confidence

**High**: Technical feasibility of partial reconfiguration mechanism and expert consolidation strategy is well-demonstrated within experimental setup. Throughput and memory efficiency claims are reproducible given same hardware and model configurations.

**Medium**: Scalability claims to "up to four model variants" and generalization of consolidation benefits across different MoE architectures require additional validation with broader model families and larger-scale deployments.

**Low**: Practical deployment viability under real-world multi-tenant conditions, including failure handling, dynamic workload adaptation, and quality-of-service guarantees under stress conditions, remains unproven.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate consolidation effectiveness across diverse MoE architectures (varying expert counts, model sizes, and routing strategies) beyond the two tested models
2. Deploy the system in a production-like multi-tenant environment with heterogeneous workloads and measure quality-of-service stability over extended periods
3. Conduct stress testing with concurrent requests to measure failure rates, latency spikes, and recovery mechanisms when expert swapping creates resource contention
