core_contribution: This paper presents a proof-of-concept for enabling natural-language
  agent communication across independent systems without shared identifiers, schemas,
  or centralised data exchange. Using Orpius as the underlying platform, the prototype
  demonstrates how a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network can coordinate via pseudonymised
  case tokens and OperationRelay calls, keeping all data local.

# Distributed Agent Reasoning Across Independent Systems With Strict Data Locality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16292
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16292
- Reference count: 2
- Proof-of-concept enabling natural-language agent communication across independent systems without shared identifiers or centralised data exchange.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a proof-of-concept for distributed multi-agent reasoning across independent healthcare systems while maintaining strict data locality. Using the Orpius platform, the prototype demonstrates how a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network can coordinate patient care decisions through pseudonymised case tokens and OperationRelay calls, without sharing underlying patient data or identifiers. The approach enables privacy-preserving agent communication by having the Clinic generate HMAC-based pseudonymous tokens, the Insurer evaluate coverage rules and consult the Specialist when needed, and the Specialist return appropriateness recommendations based solely on narrative summaries.

The work is explicitly exploratory, with no clinical validation or formal performance evaluation. It aims to demonstrate architectural feasibility and highlight patterns for privacy-preserving distributed reasoning rather than provide production-ready solutions.

## Method Summary
The prototype implements a distributed healthcare coordination system using Orpius as the underlying platform. The Clinic generates HMAC-based pseudonymous tokens for patient cases, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and may consult the Specialist Network for appropriateness recommendations, and all data remains local to each system. The workflow uses OperationRelay calls to coordinate agent interactions while maintaining strict data locality boundaries. The system relies on natural-language agent communication without shared schemas or identifiers, using only case tokens for cross-system coordination.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated proof-of-concept for multi-agent reasoning across independent systems using pseudonymised tokens
- Showed feasibility of strict data locality while enabling coordinated decision-making
- Established architectural patterns for privacy-preserving distributed agent communication

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by combining pseudonymisation with distributed agent coordination. Each agent operates on local data while using cryptographically generated tokens to reference cases across systems. The OperationRelay mechanism enables agents to trigger actions in other systems without data sharing, and natural language processing allows agents to communicate complex information through narrative summaries rather than structured data exchange.

## Foundational Learning
- **HMAC-based pseudonymisation**: Creates consistent but unlinkable identifiers across systems - needed to enable cross-system coordination without shared identifiers
- **OperationRelay mechanism**: Enables distributed agent communication without data sharing - needed for strict data locality
- **Natural language agent communication**: Allows complex information exchange without shared schemas - needed for schema-free interoperability
- **Data locality boundaries**: Each system maintains sovereign control over its data - needed for privacy compliance and regulatory requirements
- **Token-based case coordination**: Uses pseudonyms instead of real identifiers - needed to prevent cross-system data linkage
- **Narrative summary processing**: Enables information exchange without structured data sharing - needed for schema-free communication

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Clinic -> Insurer -> Specialist Network (via OperationRelay)

**Critical path:** Patient case → Clinic token generation → Insurer coverage evaluation → Specialist consultation (if needed) → Recommendation return

**Design tradeoffs:** Strict data locality vs. richer data sharing; privacy vs. decision accuracy; simplicity vs. clinical validation

**Failure signatures:** Token collision, coverage rule misinterpretation, specialist consultation failures, OperationRelay timeouts

**First experiments:** 1) Test token generation consistency across multiple clinic instances 2) Verify OperationRelay call reliability under concurrent loads 3) Validate coverage rule evaluation accuracy with synthetic test cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No clinical validation or formal performance evaluation
- Lacks security analysis of pseudonymisation scheme
- No assessment of system scalability or robustness under load

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Architectural feasibility of distributed multi-agent reasoning via OperationRelay and pseudonymised tokens

**Medium Confidence:** Functional correctness of prototype workflow given stated proof-of-concept goal

**Low Confidence:** Privacy preservation claims and system performance characteristics without formal analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct formal security analysis of HMAC pseudonymisation scheme including collision probability and resistance to deanonymisation attacks
2. Implement clinical scenario testing with synthetic but realistic patient cases to evaluate coverage rule accuracy and specialist recommendation quality
3. Perform system performance benchmarking under concurrent multi-agent request loads to assess scalability and latency characteristics
