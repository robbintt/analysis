# A Review of Diffusion-based Simulation-Based Inference: Foundations and Applications in Non-Ideal Data Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23748
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23748
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Diffusion-based SBI provides robust inference under complex data conditions, with particular promise for scientific applications requiring discretization-invariant inference in high-dimensional or function-valued parameter spaces

## Executive Summary
This review examines diffusion-based simulation-based inference (SBI) for non-ideal data scenarios including model misspecification, unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. Diffusion models offer advantages over normalizing flows by avoiding strict invertibility constraints and enabling flexible architectures while learning conditional scores to enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. The review synthesizes methods addressing these challenges: conditional diffusion models for infinite-dimensional function spaces, summary networks for variable-length data, compositional/factorized approaches for multiple observations, and guided diffusion for prior adaptation. Applications to geophysical modeling are highlighted, where parameters and data are often functions of continuous domains.

## Method Summary
The review synthesizes diffusion-based SBI approaches that address non-ideal data scenarios through conditional score matching frameworks. These methods leverage diffusion models' flexibility to handle infinite-dimensional function spaces without requiring invertibility constraints that limit normalizing flows. Key methodological advances include summary networks that compress variable-length data, compositional and factorized approaches for multi-observation inference, and guided diffusion techniques for adapting priors. The framework enables discretization-invariant inference crucial for scientific applications where parameters exist in continuous function spaces rather than finite-dimensional vectors.

## Key Results
- Diffusion models provide robust inference under complex data conditions including model misspecification, unstructured observations, and missing data
- Conditional diffusion models enable inference in infinite-dimensional function spaces without requiring discretization
- The approach shows particular promise for geophysical modeling applications where parameters and data are functions of continuous domains
- Diffusion-based SBI offers improved flexibility over normalizing flows by eliminating strict invertibility constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Diffusion-based SBI works by learning conditional score functions that guide sampling from posterior distributions without requiring explicit likelihood computation. The diffusion process gradually adds noise to data, learning to reverse this process through score matching. For non-ideal data scenarios, conditional models incorporate observations, model states, and priors into the score function. This enables likelihood-free inference while maintaining flexibility for infinite-dimensional function spaces. The score-based approach naturally handles missing data through score imputation techniques and accommodates variable-length observations through summary networks.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Score matching and conditional score functions** - Required for understanding how diffusion models learn to reverse the noising process without computing likelihoods; quick check: verify the score function satisfies the denoising score matching objective.

2. **Infinite-dimensional function spaces and discretization invariance** - Essential for applications where parameters are functions rather than vectors; quick check: confirm the method produces consistent results across different discretizations of the same function.

3. **Summary networks for variable-length data** - Needed to compress observations of varying dimensionality into fixed-size representations; quick check: validate summary network preserves sufficient information for accurate inference.

4. **Compositional and factorized inference approaches** - Required for handling multiple independent observations efficiently; quick check: verify factorized posterior approximates full posterior accurately.

5. **Guided diffusion for prior adaptation** - Important for incorporating prior knowledge and constraints; quick check: confirm guided sampling produces samples consistent with prior distributions.

6. **Score imputation for missing data** - Needed to handle incomplete observations; quick check: validate imputation accuracy under varying missingness patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Simulator -> Summary Network -> Diffusion Model -> Posterior Sampler -> Inference Results

**Critical Path:** Simulator (generates synthetic data) -> Summary Network (compresses observations) -> Diffusion Model (learns conditional scores) -> Posterior Sampler (generates posterior samples)

**Design Tradeoffs:** Flexibility vs. computational efficiency - diffusion models offer greater flexibility than normalizing flows but require more computation; discretization invariance vs. implementation complexity - infinite-dimensional approaches avoid discretization artifacts but are harder to implement.

**Failure Signatures:** Posterior collapse when summary networks fail to capture sufficient information; mode collapse in diffusion sampling; poor performance under severe model misspecification; computational bottlenecks in high-dimensional function spaces.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate discretization invariance by comparing inference results across multiple grid resolutions for the same function-valued parameter
2. Test robustness to missing data by systematically removing observations and measuring posterior accuracy degradation
3. Compare computational efficiency and inference quality against normalizing flows on benchmark SBI problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation across diverse scientific domains beyond geophysical modeling
- Many discussed methods remain in early development stages with limited real-world implementation studies
- Claims about superiority for infinite-dimensional function spaces and discretization-invariant inference lack comprehensive comparative analyses
- Review focuses primarily on theoretical frameworks without extensive benchmarking against established SBI approaches

## Confidence
- High: Fundamental advantages of diffusion models over normalizing flows, elimination of invertibility constraints
- Medium: Superiority claims for infinite-dimensional function spaces and discretization-invariant inference, robustness under complex data conditions
- Low: Practical advantages in real-world applications, computational efficiency compared to alternatives

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic benchmark comparisons of diffusion-based SBI against normalizing flows and other SBI methods across diverse scientific domains with varying data complexity (finite/infinite-dimensional, structured/unstructured, missing/not missing).

2. Perform extensive empirical studies on the scalability and computational efficiency of diffusion-based SBI methods for high-dimensional function-valued parameters, particularly in real-world geophysical and biological applications.

3. Investigate the robustness of diffusion-based SBI under severe model misspecification by systematically varying simulator fidelity and assessing posterior accuracy across multiple levels of model discrepancy.
