# Generative forecasting with joint probability models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24446
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24446
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Joint generative models achieve 84% variance explained in forecast error prediction and superior long-term statistics compared to conditional next-step models

## Executive Summary
This paper reframes chaotic dynamical systems forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows. Rather than predicting the next state conditioned on the current state, the approach models the entire temporal window and extracts predictions through marginalization. The method demonstrates improved short-term predictive skill and substantially better long-range statistical behavior on two canonical chaotic systems (Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation), while enabling intrinsic uncertainty quantification without ground truth access.

## Method Summary
The approach learns joint probability distributions over temporal windows of length n=2 from chaotic dynamical systems, then extracts forecasts via marginalization through a sieving process that selects ensemble members with matching overlapping states. A VAE with transformer backbone serves as the generative model, trained to reconstruct joint windows. Inference involves sampling from the learned joint distribution, selecting candidate sequences that match the current state, and extracting the next state. The method is model-agnostic and demonstrates improved predictive skill, attractor geometry preservation, and long-term statistical consistency compared to conventional conditional models.

## Key Results
- Joint generative models achieve up to 84% variance explained in forecast error prediction using uncertainty metrics
- Unconditional joint models dominate conditional joint and baseline models in long-term statistical consistency and tail event reproduction
- Improved short-term predictive skill while preserving attractor geometry and achieving substantially more accurate long-range statistics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The joint generative approach captures nonlinear temporal dependencies by modeling the full probability distribution over temporal windows rather than sequential conditional dependencies. This allows the model to represent multistep trajectory segments and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. By sampling from the full joint distribution and selecting via matching overlapping states, the method naturally incorporates uncertainty and preserves the statistical structure of the attractor.

## Foundational Learning
**Chaotic dynamical systems** - Nonlinear systems highly sensitive to initial conditions
- Why needed: Understanding why joint modeling captures attractor statistics better than sequential prediction
- Quick check: Verify Lorenz-63 and KS equations exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions

**Generative modeling** - Learning probability distributions to produce samples
- Why needed: Core mechanism for producing ensemble forecasts from learned joint distributions
- Quick check: Confirm VAE can generate realistic joint windows from latent space

**Marginalization** - Integrating out variables to obtain marginal distributions
- Why needed: How predictions are extracted from joint distributions
- Quick check: Verify marginalization preserves total probability and yields correct conditional distributions

**Wasserstein distance** - Metric for comparing probability distributions
- Why needed: Quantifying forecast drift and uncertainty in absence of ground truth
- Quick check: Confirm Wasserstein drift captures long-term divergence of ensemble trajectories

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
VAE Encoder -> Latent Space -> VAE Decoder -> Joint Distribution -> Marginalization -> Forecast

**Critical Path**
Lorenz/KS Trajectory -> Joint Window Extraction (n=2) -> VAE Training -> Inference Sampling -> State Matching (Algorithm 1) -> Forecast Extraction (Algorithm 2)

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Window length n: Fixed at 2 for computational efficiency vs. capturing longer temporal dependencies
- Ensemble size N: 5×10⁴ for robust statistics vs. computational cost
- Unconditional vs conditional: Better long-term statistics vs. potentially higher short-term skill

**Failure Signatures**
- Sparse joint point cloud leads to poor nearest-neighbor matches during inference
- Mode collapse or poor tail representation in generated joint distributions
- KL divergence vanishing during VAE training indicates posterior collapse

**3 First Experiments**
1. Train VAE on Lorenz-63 joint windows and verify reconstruction quality on validation set
2. Implement Algorithm 1 and verify state matching produces reasonable candidate sets
3. Compare short-term MAE between joint generative and conditional baseline models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: Can tensorized or factored parameterizations of the joint distribution enable scaling to domains with thousands to millions of degrees of freedom, such as climate or turbulence simulations? The current experiments only tested up to 199 dimensions, where curse of dimensionality already manifested during inference requiring large point clouds for reliable matching.

**Open Question 2**: How can physical constraints (invariances, conservation laws, energy-based regularization) be incorporated into the joint generative framework to improve extrapolation and long-horizon stability? The current framework is purely data-driven and inherits training distribution biases.

**Open Question 3**: Can adaptive temporal window lengths dynamically adjust the memory of the joint distribution based on local flow regimes to improve forecast accuracy? The window length n is currently a fixed hyperparameter chosen a priori.

**Open Question 4**: To what extent can the joint generative approach reliably predict out-of-distribution "grey swan" extreme events absent from training data? While tail behavior improved on test trajectories within the training distribution range, true out-of-distribution extrapolation capability remains unquantified.

## Limitations
- Underspecified methodological details, particularly regarding VAE architecture implementation and latent space dimensionality
- Choice of n=2 window length appears arbitrary and may limit ability to capture longer-range temporal dependencies
- Model comparison limited to conventional next-step conditional models without benchmarking against other state-of-the-art generative approaches

## Confidence
- Short-term predictive skill improvement: **Medium** confidence (limited to two chaotic systems, no ablation on window size)
- Long-term statistical consistency: **Medium** confidence (histogram-based metrics may not capture all dynamical features)
- Uncertainty quantification framework: **High** confidence (methodologically sound, though correlation interpretation needs care)

## Next Checks
1. Perform systematic ablation studies varying n (window length) and N (ensemble size) to identify minimum requirements for maintaining performance
2. Compare against modern generative baselines (normalizing flows, diffusion models) on identical chaotic systems
3. Evaluate model behavior on additional chaotic systems with different dimensionality and dynamics (e.g., Rössler, double pendulum) to test generalizability
