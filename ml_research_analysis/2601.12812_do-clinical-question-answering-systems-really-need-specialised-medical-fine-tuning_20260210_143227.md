  by steering LLM activations with lightweight domain-specific vectors, avoiding fine-tuning.
  This resolves the assumption that medical LLMs must be specialized, delivering consistent

# Do Clinical Question Answering Systems Really Need Specialised Medical Fine Tuning?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.12812
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12812
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: MEDASSESS-X achieves +6% accuracy and up to 50% safety error reduction across general and specialized LLMs via inference-time activation steering

## Executive Summary
MEDASSESS-X challenges the prevailing assumption that clinical QA systems require expensive medical fine-tuning by introducing a lightweight inference-time alignment method. Instead of updating model weights, it steers LLM activations with task-specific vectors learned from contrastive traces. This approach consistently improves accuracy, factual consistency, and safety across both general-purpose and specialized models, demonstrating that effective clinical QA can be achieved without the computational overhead of domain-specific fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
MEDASSESS-X uses activation steering to align general-purpose LLMs to clinical QA without fine-tuning. Steering vectors are computed by contrasting hidden states from correct vs. incorrect answer traces, averaged across 200 examples per task category. A RoBERTa-base classifier routes questions to the appropriate steering vector (triage, literature, or patient-facing). At inference, the selected vector is added to the LLM’s penultimate-layer hidden states (α=1.0), and decoding proceeds with greedy search. The method is evaluated on a 1,077-question binary classification dataset with accuracy, factual consistency, and safety metrics.

## Key Results
- Accuracy improves by +6% on average across models
- Factual consistency gains +7% without fine-tuning
- Safety error rate reduces by up to 50%
- Performance is stable across triage, literature, and patient-facing QA tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by injecting domain-specific activation patterns into LLM hidden states during inference. By learning contrastive vectors from correct vs. incorrect clinical QA traces, MEDASSESS-X effectively nudges the model’s reasoning toward domain-appropriate outputs without altering its core parameters.

## Foundational Learning
- **Activation steering**: Why needed: Enables domain alignment without costly fine-tuning. Quick check: Verify vectors are non-zero and shift hidden-state distributions.
- **Contrastive learning**: Why needed: Generates task-specific vectors from correct/incorrect pairs. Quick check: Confirm vector magnitude and direction via cosine similarity.
- **Task routing**: Why needed: Selects the right steering vector for each question. Quick check: Measure classifier accuracy (>90% recommended).

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input question → Task classifier → Select steering vector → Add to LLM hidden states → Generate answer
**Critical Path**: Task classification → Vector addition → Decoding (α=1.0, greedy)
**Design Tradeoffs**: No fine-tuning saves compute but requires hidden-state access; α=1.0 balances alignment and fluency
**Failure Signatures**: Zero or negative steering gain indicates poor contrastive pairs or incorrect layer extraction
**First Experiments**: 1) Reproduce contrastive vector extraction; 2) Test task classifier accuracy; 3) Apply steering with sweep of α values

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can MEDASSESS-X maintain efficacy in open-ended clinical generation tasks like drafting patient notes or referral letters?
- Is MEDASSESS-X compatible with closed-source or highly optimized black-box LLMs where intermediate hidden states are inaccessible?
- How robust are the steering vectors against distribution shifts involving rare pathologies or underrepresented demographic data?

## Limitations
- Relies on access to intermediate hidden states, limiting use with closed-source models
- Evaluated only on a single English TRUE/FALSE CQA dataset, limiting generalizability
- Effectiveness on rare conditions or underrepresented populations is not established

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Inference-time steering improves CQA without fine-tuning
- **Medium confidence**: Safety error reduction and minimal computational overhead
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to other CQA datasets or languages

## Next Checks
1. Obtain and reproduce the 861/216 stratified split from the Azeez et al. (2025) dataset
2. Clarify and implement the definition of "correct" vs. "incorrect" traces for contrastive vector extraction
3. Identify and validate the external verifier g(·) used for factual consistency scoring
