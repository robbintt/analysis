# Regularization, Semi-supervision, and Supervision for a Plausible Attention-Based Explanation

## Quick Facts

- Key outcome: Three techniques improve attention plausibility without harming classification performance

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether attention maps from neural models can be made more plausible as explanations without harming classification performance. The authors propose three techniques to enforce plausibility constraints on attention maps: Shannon entropy-based sparsity regularization, semi-supervision using heuristic-based attention maps, and supervision using human annotation. Experiments on three text classification tasks (e-SNLI, HateXPlain, and Yelp-Hat) show that all three methods improve attention plausibility at no cost to classification accuracy, with supervision and regularization yielding consistent gains while semi-supervision offers stability.

## Method Summary
The study introduces three complementary approaches to improve attention plausibility in neural text classifiers. First, a Shannon entropy regularization term is added to the loss function to encourage sparser, more focused attention distributions. Second, semi-supervision leverages heuristic-based attention maps as soft targets during training. Third, supervision uses human-annotated rationales as explicit attention targets. These methods are evaluated across three datasets using bidirectional RNN encoders with attention mechanisms, measuring both classification performance and attention plausibility through AUPRC scores against human rationales.

## Key Results
- All three techniques (regularization, semi-supervision, and supervision) improve attention plausibility without degrading classification accuracy
- Shannon entropy regularization and human supervision provide the most consistent plausibility gains
- Deeper RNN contextualization was found to harm attention plausibility, suggesting limitations in attention-based explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed methods work by incorporating plausibility constraints directly into the training objective. Shannon entropy regularization encourages attention to focus on fewer, more relevant tokens by penalizing uniform distributions. Semi-supervision provides domain-informed guidance through heuristic attention maps, while full supervision aligns model attention with human-annotated rationales. These approaches effectively regularize the attention mechanism to produce distributions that better match human intuition about relevant evidence, without requiring changes to the underlying classification architecture.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Attention mechanisms in neural networks** - Why needed: Core component being modified for improved interpretability; Quick check: Verify attention weights sum to 1 across sequence positions
2. **Shannon entropy regularization** - Why needed: Mathematical tool for encouraging sparse attention distributions; Quick check: Monitor entropy values during training to ensure they decrease
3. **AUPRC for attention plausibility** - Why needed: Standard metric for comparing attention maps to human rationales; Quick check: Ensure AUPRC scores are calculated using consistent threshold ranges
4. **Semi-supervised learning with soft targets** - Why needed: Enables using heuristic attention as training signal without requiring human annotation; Quick check: Verify heuristic attention maps capture relevant content
5. **Human-annotated rationales** - Why needed: Ground truth for evaluating explanation quality; Quick check: Confirm inter-annotator agreement on rationale selection
6. **RNN contextualization layers** - Why needed: Encoder architecture that affects attention plausibility; Quick check: Track attention plausibility across different layer depths

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input text -> RNN Encoder -> Attention Mechanism -> Classification Head -> Output
Critical path: Text embedding → RNN layers → Attention distribution → Weighted sum → Classifier → Prediction
Design tradeoffs: RNNs offer sequential processing but may limit attention plausibility compared to transformers
Failure signatures: Uniform attention distributions, attention on irrelevant tokens, attention on padding
First experiments:
1. Train baseline model with standard attention to establish reference performance
2. Apply Shannon entropy regularization with varying lambda values to find optimal tradeoff
3. Compare heuristic-based semi-supervision against full human supervision

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on proxy metrics (AUPRC) rather than direct measures of explanation faithfulness
- Findings about transformer limitations are correlational rather than causally established
- Focus exclusively on attention-based explanations without exploring other interpretability methods

## Confidence
High confidence in: The effectiveness of regularization and supervision techniques for improving attention plausibility metrics without harming classification accuracy.
Medium confidence in: The superiority of attention-based explanations over gradient-based methods for the evaluated tasks.
Medium confidence in: The claim that transformer models inherently limit attention plausibility.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying Shannon entropy regularization strength across wider lambda ranges
2. Implement proposed methods on transformer architectures to test if RNN limitations extend to transformers
3. Design human-subject studies to test whether improved AUPRC scores translate to better human understanding and utility
