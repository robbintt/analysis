# Principled Design of Interpretable Automated Scoring for Large-Scale Educational Assessments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17069
- Reference count: 20
- The paper introduces ANALYTICSCORE, the first principled interpretability framework for automated short-answer scoring that achieves scoring accuracy within 0.06 QWK of state-of-the-art models while maintaining strong interpretability through four core principles.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ANALYTICSCORE, the first principled interpretability framework for automated short-answer scoring in educational assessments. The framework operationalizes four core principles - Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) - to create interpretable scoring models that maintain high accuracy. By extracting explicit analytic components from student responses and applying ordinal logistic regression, ANALYTICSCORE demonstrates that interpretable scoring is feasible without significant accuracy trade-offs, establishing a strong baseline for future work in this domain.

## Method Summary
ANALYTICSCORE is built on a novel interpretability framework that extracts explicit analytic components from student responses. The method uses LLMs to featurize responses into human-understandable values based on rubric criteria, then applies ordinal logistic regression for scoring. The framework is grounded in four principles: Faithfulness (explanations align with actual model decisions), Groundedness (explanations are based on rubric components), Traceability (score explanations can be traced back to specific response components), and Interchangeability (models can be interchanged with human scorers). The approach was evaluated across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset, comparing performance against uninterpretable state-of-the-art models.

## Key Results
- Achieved scoring accuracy within 0.06 QWK of uninterpretable SOTA models
- Demonstrated strong alignment with human featurization judgments (QWK: 0.90, 0.72, 0.81 across assessment areas)
- Established that interpretable scoring is feasible without significant accuracy trade-offs
- Provided the first principled framework for interpretability in automated scoring systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by grounding interpretability in assessment-specific principles rather than general AI interpretability methods. By extracting explicit analytic components that align with rubric criteria and using ordinal logistic regression, the system maintains both interpretability and accuracy. The FGTI principles ensure that explanations are meaningful to assessment stakeholders while remaining faithful to actual model decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **FGTI Principles**: The four core interpretability principles (Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, Interchangeability) provide a theoretical foundation specific to educational assessment needs
  - Why needed: General interpretability methods don't address assessment-specific requirements for transparency and stakeholder trust
  - Quick check: Verify each principle is explicitly addressed in the framework design

- **Ordinal Logistic Regression**: Used for scoring to maintain interpretability while handling ordinal score categories
  - Why needed: Traditional regression methods don't properly handle the ordinal nature of scoring rubrics
  - Quick check: Confirm model properly handles ordered score categories

- **LLM-based Featurization**: Extracts rubric-aligned features from student responses
  - Why needed: Manual feature extraction is impractical at scale for large assessments
  - Quick check: Validate featurization aligns with human scorer judgments

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Student Response -> LLM Featurization -> Feature Vector -> Ordinal Logistic Regression -> Score
- **Critical Path**: The LLM featurization and ordinal logistic regression stages are most critical for maintaining both interpretability and accuracy
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Chose ordinal logistic regression over more complex models to maintain interpretability, accepting potential accuracy limitations
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor featurization quality, misalignment between rubric criteria and extracted features, or violations of ordinal regression assumptions
- **Three First Experiments**:
  1. Test featurization quality by comparing LLM-extracted features against human scorer annotations
  2. Evaluate ordinal regression assumptions (proportional odds) on the dataset
  3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual FGTI principles to assess their impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on LLM-based featurization raises questions about generalizability across different languages and assessment domains
- Human featurization alignment study involved only 30 responses per assessment area, potentially limiting reliability estimates
- Ordinal logistic regression may struggle with complex scoring rubrics involving non-linear relationships or feature interactions

## Confidence
- **High**: The FGTI framework's theoretical validity and core methodology of extracting interpretable features
- **Medium**: The claim that interpretability can be achieved "without sacrificing much accuracy" - needs validation on more diverse datasets
- **Medium**: The generalizability of the approach beyond the tested dataset and assessment type

## Next Checks
1. Test ANALYTICSCORE on multiple languages and non-English educational datasets to assess cross-linguistic generalizability
2. Conduct a larger-scale human featurization study with increased sample size and scorer diversity to better establish reliability
3. Compare performance against other interpretable models (e.g., decision trees, rule-based systems) on datasets with varying complexity levels
