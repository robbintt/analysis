# MV-MLM: Bridging Multi-View Mammography and Language for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Risk Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.26151
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26151
- Reference count: 40
- MV-MLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-view mammography tasks including malignancy classification (AUC 0.7406), mass classification (AUC 0.7649), calcification classification (AUC 0.9393), and breast cancer risk prediction (C-index 0.73)

## Executive Summary
MV-MLM is a multi-view vision-language contrastive learning model that bridges mammography imaging with clinical language through synthetic report generation. The model addresses the critical challenge of limited paired mammogram-report datasets by generating synthetic clinical reports from structured tabular annotations, enabling effective contrastive learning between high-resolution mammograms and corresponding clinical descriptions. The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks including malignancy detection, lesion classification, and breast cancer risk prediction, while showing strong data efficiency even with limited training samples.

## Method Summary
MV-MLM employs a multi-view contrastive learning framework that aligns high-resolution mammography images from multiple views (CC and MLO) with synthetic clinical reports generated from structured tabular data. The model uses a pre-trained vision encoder for mammogram analysis and a language model for report generation, with contrastive learning objectives to align visual and textual representations. The synthetic reports are created using a structured template-based approach that translates tabular annotations into clinically relevant text descriptions. The model is trained end-to-end to optimize the alignment between visual features from multi-view mammograms and semantic features from synthetic reports, enabling effective transfer learning for downstream diagnostic and risk prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieved AUC of 0.7649 for mass classification and 0.9393 for calcification classification on public datasets
- Outperformed existing fully supervised and CLIP-based baselines on malignancy classification (AUC 0.7406)
- Demonstrated strong data efficiency, maintaining high performance with limited training data
- Improved breast cancer risk prediction with C-index of 0.73 and 2-year/5-year AUC scores of 0.76/0.69

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MV-MLM leverages multi-view contrastive learning to align visual and textual representations, enabling the model to learn rich semantic features from mammography images without requiring paired clinical reports. By generating synthetic reports from structured annotations, the model can train on large amounts of unannotated mammography data while still benefiting from the semantic richness of clinical language. The multi-view approach captures complementary anatomical information from different imaging angles, improving the model's ability to detect and classify breast lesions. The contrastive learning objective ensures that images and their corresponding synthetic reports are mapped to similar latent representations, while pushing apart representations of mismatched pairs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: Aligns visual and textual representations by pulling positive pairs together and pushing negative pairs apart. Needed to learn meaningful cross-modal representations without explicit supervision. Quick check: Verify alignment quality using retrieval metrics.
- **Multi-view Mammography**: Combines CC (craniocaudal) and MLO (mediolateral oblique) views to capture complementary anatomical information. Needed because single views may miss critical diagnostic features. Quick check: Compare performance with single-view vs multi-view inputs.
- **Synthetic Report Generation**: Converts structured tabular annotations into natural language clinical reports. Needed to create training pairs when real clinical reports are unavailable. Quick check: Evaluate synthetic report quality using medical expert review or automated metrics.
- **Vision-Language Pre-training**: Initializes models with general-purpose vision and language representations before task-specific fine-tuning. Needed to leverage large-scale pre-training on diverse data. Quick check: Compare with random initialization ablation.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Mammogram Encoder -> Contrastive Loss -> Report Generator -> Language Encoder -> Joint Embedding Space

**Critical Path**: Input mammograms (CC + MLO) → Multi-view fusion → Visual encoder → Synthetic report generation → Language encoder → Contrastive alignment → Downstream task heads

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model trades the availability of real clinical reports for synthetic reports, enabling training on larger datasets but potentially introducing domain shift. Multi-view fusion increases computational cost but improves diagnostic accuracy. The use of pre-trained encoders provides strong initialization but may limit adaptation to specific imaging protocols.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation on datasets with different imaging protocols or equipment, reduced effectiveness when synthetic reports poorly match clinical documentation style, and potential overfitting when training data is extremely limited.

**First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate single-view vs multi-view performance to quantify view complementarity, 2) Compare synthetic vs real clinical reports on downstream task performance, 3) Test model robustness across different mammography equipment manufacturers.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic reports rather than real clinical text may limit clinical generalizability
- Modest improvement in malignancy classification suggests room for improvement on critical diagnostic tasks
- Performance evaluation limited to specific datasets and tasks, requiring validation across diverse clinical settings

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Multi-view contrastive learning framework design and implementation
- **Medium confidence**: Performance on calcification classification and mass classification tasks
- **Medium confidence**: Breast cancer risk prediction improvements
- **Low confidence**: Clinical generalizability due to synthetic report dependency

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MV-MLM performance using real clinical text reports from the same datasets to validate synthetic report generation quality
2. Conduct external validation on multi-institutional datasets with different imaging equipment and protocols
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of synthetic report generation versus multi-view contrastive learning components
