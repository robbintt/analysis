# Sparse classification with positive-confidence data in high dimensions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24443
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24443
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification achieves near-minimax-optimal recovery rates comparable to fully supervised methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of high-dimensional classification when only positive samples with confidence scores are available for training. The authors propose a sparse-penalization framework that incorporates both convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. The method reformulates the standard classification risk using only positive data by re-weighting the loss on inverse predictions with the ratio of negative-to-positive probability. Theoretical analysis establishes estimation and prediction error bounds under restricted strong convexity conditions, while empirical results demonstrate predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches.

## Method Summary
The core method minimizes a penalized empirical risk using proximal gradient descent, where the gradient incorporates confidence-weighted surrogate losses to simulate negative-class information from positive-only data. The framework uses Lasso (soft-thresholding), SCAD, and MCP penalties to regularize the model. Cross-validation selects the regularization parameter by minimizing the Pconf risk. The algorithm requires confidence scores bounded away from zero and assumes restricted strong convexity of the loss. Non-convex penalties use piecewise proximal operators that mitigate Lasso's shrinkage bias for large coefficients.

## Key Results
- Near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates established under Restricted Strong Convexity
- Pconf-Lasso and Pconf-MCP achieve predictive accuracy comparable to fully supervised Logistic Regression
- Pconf-MCP outperforms Pconf-Lasso in variable selection (lower FDR) while maintaining competitive TPR
- Theoretical bounds show estimation error of order $\sqrt{s \log d / n}$ for L1-regularized Pconf estimator

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The standard classification risk can be estimated using only positive samples by re-weighting the loss on inverse predictions with the ratio of negative-to-positive probability.
- **Mechanism:** The paper utilizes a reformulation of the standard risk $R(g)$ where the expectation over the negative class is replaced by a weighted expectation over the positive class. Specifically, the term $\frac{1-r(x)}{r(x)} \ell(-g(x))$ acts as a surrogate for the negative class loss, scaled by the conditional probability that a sample is negative despite being drawn from the positive marginal.
- **Core assumption:** The confidence score $r(x) = p(y=+1|x)$ is strictly positive ($r(x) > 0$) for all sampled features; otherwise, the re-weighting factor becomes unstable.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores... avoiding the need for negative data."
  - [section] Section 2.2, Eq (4) and Remark 1.
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus neighbors focus on standard high-dimensional selection rather than weak supervision risk reformulation.
- **Break condition:** If confidence scores $r(x)$ are noisy or systematically underestimate the true class probability, the weighted surrogate loss likely introduces bias not accounted for in the theoretical bounds.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The L1-regularized Pconf estimator achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates comparable to fully supervised methods, contingent on the loss curvature.
- **Mechanism:** The paper adapts the restricted strong convexity (RSC) framework to the Pconf risk. By bounding the infinity norm of the gradient $\|\nabla \hat{R}_n(\beta^*)\|_\infty$, the analysis shows that the regularization parameter $\lambda$ can suppress noise in non-active features while preserving signal, leading to error bounds of order $\sqrt{s \log d / n}$.
- **Core assumption:** The objective function satisfies RSC in a local neighborhood of the true parameter (Assumption A1), and the true parameter is strictly sparse (Assumption A3).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...proving near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition."
  - [section] Section 3.2, Theorem 1 and Proposition 1.
  - [corpus] "Differentially Private High-dimensional Variable Selection" supports the general viability of solving high-dimensional selection via regularization, though not specific to the Pconf risk.
- **Break condition:** In highly correlated designs where RSC might fail (eigenvalues approaching zero), the error bounds may loosen, although non-convex penalties are suggested to help (Table 1).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Non-convex penalties (SCAD, MCP) mitigate the shrinkage bias of Lasso via piecewise proximal operators that transition from thresholding to identity mapping.
- **Mechanism:** The optimization uses proximal gradient descent. While Lasso applies soft-thresholding (shrinking all coefficients by $\lambda$), the MCP proximal operator rescales coefficients by $(1 - \eta/a)^{-1}$ to offset shrinkage, and SCAD transitions to no-penalty for large coefficients.
- **Core assumption:** The step size $\eta$ must be sufficiently small ($\eta < a$ for MCP) to ensure the local subproblem remains convex and the algorithm converges to a critical point.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias..."
  - [section] Section 4.2, Eq (21-23).
  - [corpus] "Sparse-Input Neural Network using Group Concave Regularization" validates the general strategy of using concave regularization to improve selection accuracy.
- **Break condition:** Non-convex objectives may converge to local minima rather than the global optimum, potentially requiring multiple initializations for stability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Restricted Strong Convexity (RSC)**
  - **Why needed here:** In high dimensions ($d > n$), the Hessian of the loss is rank-deficient. RSC provides a generalized curvature condition ensuring the objective is "curved enough" along sparse directions to allow recovery of the true parameter.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why standard convexity is insufficient to prove estimation error bounds when $d > n$?

- **Concept: Proximal Gradient Descent**
  - **Why needed here:** The objective combines a smooth Pconf loss with a non-smooth (or non-convex) penalty. Proximal methods allow separating the gradient step (for the loss) from the thresholding step (for the penalty), avoiding computationally expensive inner loops.
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't we just use standard Gradient Descent for the Lasso objective directly?

- **Concept: Confidence-Weighted Risk**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core adaptation for weak supervision. Understanding that the "confidence" $r(x)$ acts as an importance weight allows the model to hallucinate the negative class gradient from positive data.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to the gradient update for a sample if the confidence $r_i$ approaches 0?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer (Features X, Confidence Scores r) -> Gradient Module (weighted vector d) -> Proximal Module (penalty-specific thresholds) -> Tuning Loop (K-fold CV)
- **Critical path:** The derivation of the gradient multiplier $d_i$ in Step 6 of Algorithm 1. If the weights $\alpha_i$ are computed incorrectly (e.g., numerical instability when $r_i$ is small), the gradient direction will be biased, and convergence will fail.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Lasso:** Convex (global optimum guaranteed) but biased (shrinks large coefficients)
  - **MCP/SCAD:** Nearly unbiased but non-convex (risk of local minima, sensitive to step size $\eta$)
  - **Corpus Insight:** "Variational Garrote" and related methods suggest that hybrid strategies (convex initialization followed by non-convex refinement) are often robust
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Exploding Gradients:** If $r_i \approx 0$, $\alpha_i \to \infty$. Implementation requires clamping $r_i$ to a minimum floor (e.g., $r_{min} > 0$ as suggested by Proposition 1)
  - **False Discovery Inflation:** Under correlated designs ($\rho_X = 0.5$), supervised Lasso tends to over-select. Pconf methods show more conservative selection but may have lower TPR in some regimes
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Low-dim):** Generate data where $r(x)$ is known perfectly. Verify that Pconf-Lasso recovers the same $\beta$ as standard Logistic Regression on fully labeled data (up to weighting)
  2. **Robustness to Noise:** Add Gaussian noise to the confidence scores $r_i$ before training. Monitor the degradation of estimation error $\|\hat{\beta} - \beta^*\|_2$ to verify the sensitivity of the positivity assumption
  3. **Correlated High-dim Stress Test:** Run the $n=200, p=320, \rho_X=0.5$ simulation and plot the solution path for Pconf-MCP vs Pconf-Lasso to visualize the bias reduction in the non-zero coefficients

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. **Non-convex Penalty Analysis:** Can rigorous estimation and prediction error bounds be established for non-convex penalties like SCAD and MCP within the Pconf classification framework? The current theory focuses on L1-regularization, and non-convex penalties introduce optimization landscapes requiring different analytical tools.
2. **Generalization to Non-linear Settings:** How can the sparse Pconf framework be generalized to non-linear or structured high-dimensional settings, such as generalized additive models or multi-task learning? The current methodology is designed specifically for linear classifiers and doesn't account for additive structure or parameter sharing.
3. **Confidence Score Robustness:** How robust is the Pconf-regularized estimator to noise or errors in the provided confidence scores $r_i$? The theoretical bounds assume the confidence scores are given and valid, but in practice these scores may be estimated by external systems and contain noise.

## Limitations
- The theoretical guarantees rely heavily on the positivity assumption for confidence scores (r(x) > 0), which may not hold in practice
- Non-convex penalties (SCAD, MCP) risk convergence to local minima without guaranteed global optimality
- The restricted strong convexity condition may fail in highly correlated designs, potentially loosening error bounds

## Confidence
- **High:** The empirical performance comparisons in Table 1 showing competitive accuracy with fully supervised methods
- **Medium:** The theoretical estimation error bounds under RSC, contingent on the positivity assumption holding
- **Low:** The practical effectiveness of non-convex penalties in avoiding local minima without multiple random initializations

## Next Checks
1. **Noise Sensitivity Test:** Add Gaussian noise to confidence scores r_i before training. Monitor degradation of estimation error ||β̂ - β*||₂ to quantify sensitivity to the positivity assumption
2. **Correlated Design Stress Test:** Replicate the n=200, p=320, ρ_X=0.5 simulation (Table 1). Plot solution paths for Pconf-MCP vs Pconf-Lasso to visualize bias reduction in non-zero coefficients
3. **Convergence Robustness:** For MCP/SCAD, run the algorithm from 10 different random initializations. Report the variance in final objective values and selected features to assess stability against local minima
