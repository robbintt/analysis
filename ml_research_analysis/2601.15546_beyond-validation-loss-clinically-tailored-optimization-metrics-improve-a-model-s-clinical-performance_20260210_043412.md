# Beyond validation loss: Clinically-tailored optimization metrics improve a model's clinical performance

## Quick Facts

- Using clinically-tailored metrics instead of standard validation loss functions significantly improves model optimization for healthcare applications

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that using clinically-tailored metrics rather than standard validation loss functions significantly improves model optimization for healthcare applications. Through two experiments - hyperparameter optimization for coagulation detection and DNN stopping point selection for twin pregnancy detection - the authors show that patient-level metrics and clinically-relevant metrics (like sliver AUC) outperform traditional approaches. The core insight is that clinical performance metrics often differ substantially from standard ML loss functions, and optimization should reflect these clinical requirements rather than treating them as post-hoc evaluation criteria.

## Method Summary
The method involves defining Figures of Merit (FoMs) that capture specific clinical requirements and using them to drive optimization. For hyperparameter search, non-differentiable clinical metrics can be used as objectives since tasks like TPE optimization operate on scalar metric values rather than gradients. For stopping point selection, clinically-constrained metrics like sliver AUC (AUC restricted to high-specificity regions) can identify better training epochs than aggregate metrics like full AUC or cross-entropy loss. The approach requires implementing object-to-patient aggregation functions and computing custom clinical FoMs per epoch, with additional computational overhead but producing models that better meet clinical performance needs.

## Key Results
- In hyperparameter optimization, patient-level metrics yielded much better clinical performance than object-level metrics
- In DNN stopping point selection, clinically-relevant metrics suggested later training epochs than validation loss curves, resulting in better model separation
- The sliver AUC approach identified epochs where the model achieved superior performance at clinically-relevant operating points (e.g., high specificity)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Optimizing on object-level metrics yields models that perform suboptimally at the patient level, even when training occurs at the object level.
- **Mechanism:** A non-linear transform (e.g., aggregating N objects per patient into one disposition) breaks the correlation between object-level loss and patient-level outcomes. Optimizing one does not optimize the other.
- **Core assumption:** The object-to-patient aggregation function is sufficiently non-linear that gradients or ranks at the object level do not propagate linearly to patient outcomes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "An algorithm is often trained at the object-level... in contrast, the clinician cares about a patient... There is necessarily a transform, usually non-linear, from object-level results to patient-level results."
  - [Section 2.3, Figure 3] "Note the lack of correlation between object- and patient-level results" in scatterplots of AUC values.
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; neighboring papers do not address object-to-patient metric transforms.
- **Break condition:** If object-level and patient-level metrics are linearly related (e.g., single object per patient), this mechanism provides no advantage.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Optimization tasks that do not require differentiability (hyperparameter search, early stopping) can use arbitrary, non-differentiable clinical metrics as the driving Figure of Merit (FoM).
- **Mechanism:** Hyperparameter optimizers like Tree of Parzen Estimators and early-stopping heuristics operate on scalar metric values, not gradients. This decouples the FoM from the training loss.
- **Core assumption:** The clinical FoM can be computed efficiently enough to evaluate at each optimization step (e.g., per epoch or per hyperparameter trial).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant."
  - [Section 2.2] "For optimization we used the hyperopt library... Differentiability is not required."
  - [corpus] Weak; neighboring papers touch on optimization but not the differentiability liberation mechanism specifically.
- **Break condition:** If the optimization task requires gradient-based methods (e.g., training loss itself), this mechanism cannot be applied directly.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Clinically-constrained metrics (e.g., sensitivity at fixed specificity, partial/sliver AUC) identify better stopping points than aggregate metrics like full AUC or cross-entropy loss.
- **Mechanism:** Clinical deployments often mandate minimum specificity (e.g., ≥90%). A model that improves in the high-specificity region but degrades elsewhere will show improving sliver AUC while full AUC or loss appears flat or worsening.
- **Core assumption:** The clinical operating point constraints (minimum specificity or sensitivity) are known and fixed before optimization.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.2] "The sliver AUC considers only the subset of the AUC where specificity is >90%... the entire righthand region of the ROC is irrelevant clinically."
  - [Section 3.3, Figure 5] "The val loss maxes out at epoch 22... The 90% sliver AUC shows steady increase up to epoch 39."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; "Quiet Feature Learning in Algorithmic Tasks" shows phase transitions in loss curves but does not address clinical metric alignment.
- **Break condition:** If no clear operating point constraint exists, or if the task requires balanced performance across the full ROC, sliver AUC provides no advantage.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: ROC curves, AUC, and partial AUC**
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on sliver/partial AUC as a core metric; understanding how AUC aggregates performance and how partial AUC restricts it is essential.
  - Quick check question: Given an ROC curve, can you compute the AUC only in the region where FPR ≤ 0.1?

- **Concept: Sensitivity at fixed specificity (and vice versa)**
  - Why needed here: Clinical requirements often specify a minimum specificity; you must be able to read the corresponding sensitivity from an ROC or threshold curve.
  - Quick check question: If a model must achieve ≥90% specificity, what is the process to find the corresponding sensitivity?

- **Concept: Hyperparameter optimization without gradients (e.g., Bayesian optimization, TPE)**
  - Why needed here: The mechanism depends on using non-differentiable metrics to drive hyperparameter search.
  - Quick check question: Why can Tree of Parzen Estimators optimize using AUC as the objective, while SGD cannot?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Training loop (standard PyTorch/Lightning) — produces per-epoch model checkpoints
  2. Per-epoch inference callback — runs each checkpoint on the validation set, saves raw scores per sample
  3. Clinical metric compute module — takes raw scores + labels, computes: (a) sliver AUC at target specificity, (b) sensitivity at fixed specificity, (c) Fisher distance, (d) score histograms
  4. FoM time-series logger — stores all metrics per epoch for stopping-point analysis
  5. Hyperparameter optimizer interface — wraps the training+metric pipeline, exposes patient-level FoM to hyperopt/optuna

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define clinical operating constraints (e.g., minimum specificity = 90%)
  2. Implement the object→patient aggregation function if applicable
  3. Implement the clinical FoMs (sliver AUC, sensitivity@specificity) as standalone functions (see Appendix B for code)
  4. Hook per-epoch score logging into the training pipeline
  5. Run hyperparameter search using patient-level FoM; run training with per-epoch FoM tracking for stopping-point selection

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Extra compute: Per-epoch inference and custom metric computation add overhead (negligible for small validation sets, significant for large ones)
  - Bespoke metric definition: Each use case requires manual derivation of clinically-relevant FoMs; no off-the-shelf library
  - Validation set size: Patient-level metrics can be noisy with few patients; consider the z-mapping technique (Appendix A) to combine k-fold scores

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Object-level and patient-level FoMs are highly correlated → mechanism 1 provides no gain
  - Sliver AUC is unstable across epochs → likely too few samples in the high-specificity region; consider smoothing or binning
  - Hyperparameter search diverges → FoM may be too noisy; reduce search space or increase validation set size

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Train a model using validation loss for both hyperparameter search and stopping; log all clinical FoMs per epoch to quantify the gap
  2. **Ablation on FoM choice:** Re-run hyperparameter search using (a) object-level AUC, (b) patient-level AUC, (c) sliver AUC. Compare final patient-level performance
  3. **Stopping-point sensitivity analysis:** For a fixed model, plot validation loss, full AUC, sliver AUC, and sensitivity@90% specificity across epochs. Identify the epoch each metric would select and compare clinical performance at each

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach's effectiveness depends heavily on the degree of non-linearity between object-level and patient-level metrics - the paper provides limited quantitative analysis of this relationship
- No comparative analysis against other clinically-informed optimization methods (e.g., cost-sensitive learning, domain adaptation)
- The generalizability of sliver AUC as a stopping criterion to other clinical domains remains untested

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The mathematical framework for object-to-patient metric transforms is sound and well-explained
- **Medium confidence**: The empirical demonstration shows clear improvement in the specific use cases tested, but sample sizes are modest (N=32 patients in Experiment 1, limited DNN training epochs in Experiment 2)
- **Medium confidence**: The core insight that validation loss may not align with clinical performance is valid, though the magnitude of improvement varies by task

## Next Checks
1. **Mechanistic validation**: Systematically quantify the correlation between object-level and patient-level metrics across diverse datasets to identify when the object→patient transform is sufficiently non-linear to warrant this approach
2. **Operating point sensitivity**: Test whether sliver AUC selection is robust to small perturbations in the specificity threshold (e.g., 85% vs 90%) and across different class imbalance ratios
3. **Generalizability assessment**: Apply the clinical FoM optimization framework to a different clinical task (e.g., radiology detection, pathology classification) with distinct aggregation requirements to verify the approach transfers beyond the presented use cases
