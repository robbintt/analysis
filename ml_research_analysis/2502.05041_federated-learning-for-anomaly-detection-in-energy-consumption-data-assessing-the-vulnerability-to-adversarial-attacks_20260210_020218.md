# Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection in Energy Consumption Data: Assessing the Vulnerability to Adversarial Attacks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.05041
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05041
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Federated Learning-based anomaly detection in energy data is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with PGD attacks causing accuracy drops exceeding 10%.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) for anomaly detection in energy consumption data to adversarial attacks. The study employs two state-of-the-art models (LSTM and Transformer) in an FL setting to detect anomalies, and evaluates their robustness against two white-box attack methods (FGSM and PGD). The results demonstrate that FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than FGSM attacks due to PGD's iterative nature, and that FL is more affected by these attacks than centralized learning. The findings highlight the need for defense mechanisms in FL and emphasize the importance of considering adversarial attacks in FL-based anomaly detection systems.

## Method Summary
The study implements Federated Learning for anomaly detection using LSTM and Transformer models trained on energy consumption data. Two white-box adversarial attack methods, FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) and PGD (Projected Gradient Descent), are employed to perturb the data during training. The models are evaluated in both FL and centralized learning settings to compare their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Performance metrics include accuracy, with specific attention to the impact of attack strength and attack type on model performance.

## Key Results
- FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than FGSM attacks due to PGD's iterative nature
- Accuracy drops exceed 10% even with naive, weaker attacks
- FL is more affected by adversarial attacks than centralized learning
- Transformer demonstrates slight resilience compared to LSTM, though both models are highly vulnerable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The vulnerability stems from the iterative nature of PGD attacks, which make small, cumulative perturbations to input data across multiple steps. This allows PGD to find more effective adversarial examples compared to the single-step FGSM attack. In FL settings, the distributed nature of model training may create additional vulnerabilities as the aggregated model becomes susceptible to attacks that exploit the gradient information shared across clients.

## Foundational Learning
- Federated Learning: Distributed machine learning approach where models are trained across multiple devices without sharing raw data; needed to understand the privacy-preserving aspect of FL
- Anomaly Detection: Identification of rare items, events, or observations that deviate from expected patterns; quick check: verify understanding of anomaly detection techniques
- Adversarial Attacks: Deliberate attempts to fool machine learning models by providing deceptive input; quick check: understand different types of adversarial attacks (white-box vs black-box)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Recurrent neural network architecture for processing sequential data; quick check: understand LSTM architecture and applications
- Transformer: Attention-based neural network architecture for processing sequential data; quick check: understand Transformer architecture and self-attention mechanism
- FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method): White-box adversarial attack method that creates perturbations based on model gradients; quick check: understand the mechanics of FGSM
- PGD (Projected Gradient Descent): White-box adversarial attack method that iteratively applies FGSM with projection; quick check: understand the iterative nature of PGD

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Data sources -> FL aggregator -> LSTM/Transformer models -> Anomaly detection
- Critical path: Data perturbation (attack) -> Model training (FL/centralized) -> Anomaly detection performance
- Design tradeoffs: Privacy (FL) vs vulnerability to attacks; model complexity (Transformer vs LSTM) vs attack resilience
- Failure signatures: Accuracy drops exceeding 10% under adversarial attacks; higher vulnerability in FL compared to centralized learning
- First experiments: 1) Test FGSM attack on centralized LSTM; 2) Test PGD attack on FL Transformer; 3) Compare accuracy drops between FGSM and PGD in FL setting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions, though the limitations section suggests several areas for future research, including exploration of black-box attacks, evaluation across multiple datasets, and investigation of defense mechanisms.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to white-box attacks only
- Single dataset type (energy consumption data)
- Focus on only two model architectures (LSTM and Transformer)
- No exploration of defense mechanisms

## Confidence
- High: FL-based anomaly detection vulnerability to adversarial attacks
- High: PGD attacks cause greater accuracy drops than FGSM
- Medium: Comparative vulnerability of FL vs centralized learning
- Medium: Transformer slight resilience compared to LSTM

## Next Checks
1. Test with black-box and transfer-based attacks to assess broader vulnerability
2. Evaluate across multiple datasets and anomaly types to establish generalizability
3. Implement and test defense mechanisms such as adversarial training or model ensemble approaches to measure potential mitigation effectiveness
