# FastInit: Fast Noise Initialization for Temporally Consistent Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.16119
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16119
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: FastInit improves temporal consistency and visual quality in video generation while reducing inference time by eliminating iterative refinement

## Executive Summary
FastInit addresses the challenge of temporal inconsistency in video generation by introducing a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that directly generates refined noise from random noise and text prompts. Unlike traditional methods that rely on iterative refinement processes, FastInit learns to predict optimal noise initialization in a single forward pass. The method achieves significant improvements in temporal consistency metrics while reducing inference time from over 200 seconds to under 45 seconds on benchmark tests. By leveraging a large-scale Prompt Noise Dataset (PNData) and incorporating Tucker decomposition for noise filtering, FastInit demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods like FreeInit and IV-mixed Sampler.

## Method Summary
FastInit introduces a novel approach to video generation by learning a direct mapping from random noise and text prompts to refined noise suitable for video generation. The core innovation is the Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet), which predicts optimal noise initialization without requiring iterative refinement steps. The method uses Tucker decomposition to isolate low-frequency components in the noise and employs a global contextual residual module to recover fine details. Training is performed on a large-scale Prompt Noise Dataset (PNData) created from text prompts and optimized noise pairs. During inference, FastInit can be applied without modifying the underlying diffusion backbone, making it a model-agnostic solution that significantly improves temporal consistency while reducing computational overhead.

## Key Results
- Achieves higher temporal coherence scores (UMT-FVD, UMTScore, MTScore, CHScore) on Chronomagic-Bench compared to baseline methods
- Reduces inference time from over 200 seconds to under 45 seconds by eliminating iterative refinement
- Demonstrates superior visual quality and temporal consistency compared to FreeInit and IV-mixed Sampler methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FastInit works by learning to predict optimal noise initialization directly rather than relying on iterative refinement. The VNPNet architecture incorporates Tucker decomposition to filter out high-frequency noise components that contribute to temporal inconsistency, while the global contextual residual module helps recover important visual details. By training on a large dataset of prompt-noise pairs, the model learns to generate noise that produces temporally consistent video sequences when passed through a video diffusion model. This approach eliminates the need for multiple refinement steps while maintaining or improving output quality.

## Foundational Learning
- Tucker decomposition for noise filtering: Separates low-frequency components from high-frequency noise; needed for temporal consistency; quick check: verify noise component separation effectiveness
- Global contextual residual module: Recovers fine details after low-frequency filtering; needed for visual quality; quick check: measure detail preservation metrics
- Prompt-noise pair training: Learns mapping from text prompts to optimal noise; needed for conditioning; quick check: validate prompt-to-noise consistency

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Random noise + Text prompt -> VNPNet -> Tucker filter -> Global contextual residual -> Refined noise -> Video diffusion model -> Generated video

Critical path: Input noise and prompt flow through VNPNet, undergo Tucker decomposition filtering, pass through residual module, then serve as initialization for video generation.

Design tradeoffs: Single forward pass vs. iterative refinement (speed vs. quality), learned noise prediction vs. handcrafted initialization (adaptability vs. simplicity), model-agnostic approach vs. backbone-specific optimization (flexibility vs. performance).

Failure signatures: Temporal flickering in generated videos, loss of fine details, inconsistent object tracking across frames, generation artifacts at motion boundaries.

First experiments:
1. Test VNPNet with synthetic noise patterns to verify noise filtering effectiveness
2. Evaluate temporal consistency on simple motion sequences (e.g., rotating objects)
3. Compare frame-by-frame quality between FastInit and iterative methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation relies heavily on synthetic datasets created from text prompts rather than real-world video sequences
- Uncertainty about generalization capability beyond specific training conditions
- Potential dependency on large-scale data curation requirements for different domains

## Confidence
- High confidence: The technical approach of using Tucker decomposition for noise filtering and the global contextual residual module for detail recovery
- Medium confidence: The quantitative improvements on benchmark metrics and inference speed gains
- Low confidence: Generalization to real-world video generation scenarios beyond synthetic benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate FastInit on real-world video datasets (e.g., Kinetics, VLOG) to assess performance on natural video content beyond synthetic prompts
2. Test the method's compatibility with multiple video diffusion models (e.g., Imagen Video, Phenaki) to verify true model-agnostic behavior
3. Analyze the quality of individual frames generated by FastInit compared to iterative methods, as temporal consistency improvements might come at the cost of per-frame quality
