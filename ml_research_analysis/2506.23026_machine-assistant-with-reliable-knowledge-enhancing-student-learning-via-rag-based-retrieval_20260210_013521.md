# Machine Assistant with Reliable Knowledge: Enhancing Student Learning via RAG-based Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.23026
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23026
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MARK is a RAG-based Q&A system that uses dense and sparse retrieval to support student learning, includes a feedback loop for iterative improvement, and was deployed in classrooms as a substitute for office hours.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents MARK, a retrieval-augmented question-answering system designed to enhance student learning through accurate, contextually grounded responses. Built on a RAG framework, MARK combines dense vector similarity with sparse keyword-based retrieval to improve robustness across diverse question types. The system includes a feedback loop where students can rate responses and instructors can review and revise them, enabling adaptive refinement over time. Deployed in a classroom as a substitute for office hours, MARK successfully addressed a broad range of student queries. It was also used for technical support, integrating with customer-specific knowledge bases. The system is publicly accessible at https://app.eduquery.ai.

## Method Summary
MARK is a retrieval-augmented question-answering (RAG) system designed to support student learning. It uses a dual-retrieval approach, combining dense vector similarity with sparse keyword-based retrieval, to improve robustness across diverse question types. The system incorporates a feedback loop where students rate responses and instructors can review and revise them, enabling adaptive refinement over time. MARK was deployed in a classroom as a substitute for office hours and also used for technical support with customer-specific knowledge bases. The system is publicly accessible at https://app.eduquery.ai.

## Key Results
- MARK successfully addressed a broad range of student queries when deployed in a classroom as a substitute for office hours.
- The dual retrieval approach (dense and sparse) improves robustness across diverse question types.
- The feedback loop mechanism enables adaptive refinement over time through student ratings and instructor reviews.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MARK leverages a RAG framework that combines dense vector similarity with sparse keyword-based retrieval, improving robustness across diverse question types. The dual-retrieval approach ensures both semantic and keyword-based matching, enhancing accuracy. The feedback loop, where students rate responses and instructors review and revise them, enables iterative improvement and adaptation over time. This combination of robust retrieval and continuous refinement supports accurate, contextually grounded responses that enhance student learning.

## Foundational Learning
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combines retrieval of relevant documents with generation of responses; needed to ground answers in reliable knowledge sources; quick check: verify retrieval step retrieves relevant context before generation.
- **Dense Retrieval**: Uses vector embeddings for semantic similarity; needed for understanding nuanced, context-rich queries; quick check: measure retrieval relevance using embedding similarity metrics.
- **Sparse Retrieval**: Uses keyword matching; needed for robustness to phrasing variations and exact term matching; quick check: test retrieval accuracy on keyword-heavy queries.
- **Feedback Loop**: Iterative improvement via user ratings and instructor revisions; needed to adapt and refine system accuracy over time; quick check: track changes in accuracy metrics after feedback incorporation.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: User Query -> Dual Retrieval (Dense + Sparse) -> Document Selection -> Response Generation -> Feedback Collection -> Instructor Review
- **Critical Path**: Query → Dual Retrieval → Response Generation → Feedback → Instructor Review → System Update
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Dense retrieval captures semantics but may miss exact terms; sparse retrieval ensures keyword matching but lacks semantic depth; dual approach balances both.
- **Failure Signatures**: Dense-only retrieval may fail on keyword-specific queries; sparse-only may miss semantically similar but lexically different content; feedback loop delays adaptation if reviews are infrequent.
- **First 3 Experiments**: 1) Compare dense-only vs. sparse-only vs. hybrid retrieval performance on educational questions. 2) Measure feedback loop utilization and impact on accuracy over iterations. 3) Conduct user study comparing MARK to traditional office hours.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies primarily on anecdotal deployment rather than systematic quantitative metrics, making it difficult to assess performance beyond subjective success reports.
- Limited empirical comparison showing how much each retrieval component (dense vs. sparse) contributes to robustness.
- Feedback loop mechanism lacks details on frequency of use and impact on system accuracy over time.

## Confidence
- Confidence in core claims: Medium
- Confidence in deployment success: Medium
- Confidence in retrieval robustness: Low to Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic evaluation comparing dense-only, sparse-only, and hybrid retrieval performance on a labeled dataset of educational questions.
2. Measure the frequency and quality of feedback utilization by instructors, and quantify its impact on system accuracy over multiple iterations.
3. Perform a controlled user study comparing student learning outcomes and satisfaction between MARK and traditional office hours or standard Q&A systems.
