core_contribution: This study evaluates a zero-shot time-series foundation model,
  TimesFM, for both forecasting and causal inference from fMRI data, comparing it
  with classical methods like ARIMA and Granger causality. TimesFM achieved strong
  zero-shot forecasting performance (MAPE of 0.55 in healthy controls, 0.27 in stroke
  patients), competitive with traditional models, though fine-tuning improved results
  further, especially in patients.

# Prediction and Causality of functional MRI and synthetic signal using a Zero-Shot Time-Series Foundation Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.12497
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12497
- Authors: Alessandro Crimi; Andrea Brovelli
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Zero-shot TimesFM foundation model achieves strong forecasting performance on fMRI data and captures nonlinear causal dependencies better than Granger causality, though with higher false positive rates.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates TimesFM, a zero-shot time-series foundation model, for forecasting and causal inference from fMRI data, comparing it with classical methods like ARIMA and Granger causality. The model demonstrates strong zero-shot forecasting performance (MAPE of 0.55 in healthy controls, 0.27 in stroke patients), competitive with traditional models, and shows promise for causal discovery by capturing nonlinear dependencies and achieving higher recall in synthetic data. However, TimesFM also produces more false positives than Granger causality and requires more computational resources. The results suggest foundation models could complement traditional approaches in neuroimaging, particularly for complex, nonlinear interactions, though validation against ground truth remains essential.

## Method Summary
The study employed TimesFM, a zero-shot time-series foundation model, to forecast and infer causal relationships from fMRI data. The model was compared against classical time-series methods including ARIMA and Granger causality. Evaluation included forecasting performance on healthy controls and stroke patients using metrics like MAPE, and causal inference assessment on synthetic data with known ground truth. The analysis examined both zero-shot performance and fine-tuned capabilities, measuring accuracy, recall, and false positive rates while also considering computational efficiency and scalability.

## Key Results
- TimesFM achieved strong zero-shot forecasting performance with MAPE of 0.55 in healthy controls and 0.27 in stroke patients
- Foundation model showed higher recall and accuracy in detecting causal interactions in synthetic data compared to Granger causality
- TimesFM captured nonlinear dependencies better than linear Granger approaches, particularly in complex, high-density causal networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TimesFM leverages large-scale pretraining on diverse time-series data, enabling it to capture complex temporal patterns and nonlinear relationships without task-specific training. The foundation model's attention mechanisms and deep architecture allow it to model long-range dependencies and contextual information that traditional linear methods miss. By pretraining on massive datasets, the model develops generalizable representations that transfer effectively to new domains like fMRI analysis. The zero-shot capability demonstrates that the model has learned fundamental time-series dynamics that apply across different domains and signal types.

## Foundational Learning

**Time-Series Forecasting** - Predicting future values in sequential data based on historical patterns; needed to evaluate model's ability to predict fMRI dynamics, quick check: compare forecast accuracy against baseline methods.

**Causal Inference** - Determining cause-effect relationships between variables; needed to assess model's ability to discover neural interactions, quick check: measure precision/recall against ground truth causal structures.

**Foundation Models** - Large-scale pretrained models adaptable to multiple downstream tasks; needed to leverage transfer learning capabilities, quick check: evaluate zero-shot performance across different domains.

**fMRI Signal Processing** - Analysis of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals in brain imaging; needed to apply methods to real neuroscience data, quick check: validate predictions against known neural activity patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: TimesFM (Encoder -> Attention Layers -> Decoder) -> Prediction/Causality Output

**Critical Path**: Input time-series -> Embedding layer -> Multi-head attention blocks -> Feed-forward networks -> Output layer

**Design Tradeoffs**: Foundation model prioritizes generalizability and flexibility over computational efficiency; linear methods like Granger causality are faster but miss nonlinear relationships

**Failure Signatures**: High false positive rates in causal inference indicate potential over-detection of spurious correlations; longer inference times suggest computational scalability challenges

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare zero-shot vs fine-tuned performance on same dataset, 2) Test model on increasingly complex synthetic causal networks, 3) Evaluate computational requirements on larger fMRI datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Longer inference times and higher memory usage compared to traditional methods could limit scalability
- Higher false positive rates in causal inference raise reliability concerns for clinical applications
- Evaluation primarily on synthetic data may not capture real fMRI complexity and noise

## Confidence
- **High**: TimesFM's zero-shot forecasting performance and competitive accuracy relative to traditional methods
- **Medium**: TimesFM's ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and higher recall in causal inference tasks, given synthetic data results
- **Low**: Generalization of findings to diverse neurological conditions and real-world fMRI data, as well as scalability for large-scale applications

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a head-to-head comparison of TimesFM with other foundation models (e.g., GPT-based or causal-specific models) on both synthetic and real fMRI datasets to establish relative performance.
2. Validate TimesFM's causal inference capabilities on ground truth fMRI datasets with known causal structures to assess false positive rates and clinical applicability.
3. Evaluate the model's scalability and computational efficiency on larger, more diverse datasets to determine its feasibility for widespread use in neuroimaging research.
