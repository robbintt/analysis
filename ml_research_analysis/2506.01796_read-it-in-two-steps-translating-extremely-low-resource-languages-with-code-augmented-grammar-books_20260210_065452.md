# Read it in Two Steps: Translating Extremely Low-Resource Languages with Code-Augmented Grammar Books

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.01796
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01796
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Code-based grammar rules improve low-resource translation by 13.1% BLEU

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of translating extremely low-resource languages by leveraging grammar books as structured knowledge sources. The authors propose decomposing the translation task into two steps: retrieving relevant grammar rules and applying them to translation. They introduce ZHUANG RULES, a dataset of 109 Zhuang grammar rules with parallel sentences, and find that rule retrieval is a significant bottleneck for large language models. To address this, they represent grammar rules as code functions, which improves both retrieval accuracy and translation quality by providing clearer structure and explicit semantics.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a two-step approach for grammar-book-guided translation. First, they create ZHUANG RULES, a modular dataset containing 109 Zhuang grammar rules with corresponding parallel sentences. They then evaluate LLMs' ability to retrieve relevant rules from full grammar books and apply them to translation. To improve performance, they convert grammar rules into code functions, leveraging the structural similarity between code and grammar rules. The code-based rules are integrated into a retrieval-augmented generation framework where relevant rules are first retrieved and then applied to generate translations.

## Key Results
- Rule retrieval is a major bottleneck, with LLMs struggling to locate relevant rules from full grammar books
- Code-based grammar rules improve rule retrieval recall by 8.8%
- Code-based grammar rules improve translation BLEU score by 12.2%
- Overall translation performance improves by 13.1% BLEU with code-based rules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing two key challenges in grammar-book-guided translation: the difficulty of retrieving relevant rules from unstructured text, and the ambiguity in interpreting natural language grammar descriptions. By converting grammar rules into code functions, the system provides explicit, unambiguous instructions that LLMs can more easily parse and apply. The procedural nature of code aligns well with the step-by-step nature of grammar rule application, making it easier for models to follow the logical flow of rule implementation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Grammar book structure**: Understanding the organization and content of grammar books is essential for effective rule extraction and representation. Quick check: Verify that the grammar book contains sufficient coverage of grammatical phenomena relevant to translation.
- **Code representation of linguistic rules**: Translating natural language grammar rules into executable code requires understanding both linguistic concepts and programming paradigms. Quick check: Ensure code functions preserve the semantic intent of the original grammar rules.
- **Retrieval-augmented generation**: The two-step process of retrieving relevant knowledge and using it for generation is critical for this approach. Quick check: Confirm that retrieved rules are both relevant and sufficient for the translation task at hand.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Grammar book -> Rule retrieval module -> Rule application module -> Translation output

Critical path: The system processes input sentences through a retriever that searches the grammar book for relevant rules, then applies those rules using the translation model. The code-based rule representation sits between retrieval and application, serving as an intermediary that makes rules more accessible to the model.

Design tradeoffs: The authors chose to represent rules as Python functions rather than other formats (like JSON schemas or formal grammars) because code provides procedural clarity while being widely supported by LLMs. The tradeoff is that this requires programming knowledge to create the rule representations.

Failure signatures: When retrieval fails, translations lack grammatical accuracy for the target language. When application fails, even retrieved rules don't improve translation quality. Code-based rules help with both issues by making rules more discoverable and interpretable.

First experiments:
1. Test rule retrieval accuracy on a subset of grammar rules with varying complexity levels
2. Evaluate translation quality with and without code-based rule representations
3. Measure the impact of rule granularity on retrieval and application performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are based on a single low-resource language (Zhuang) and may not generalize to other language families
- The manual creation of code-based grammar rules is labor-intensive and may not scale to larger grammar books
- The evaluation relies primarily on BLEU scores, which may not fully capture grammatical accuracy improvements

## Confidence
- High confidence: Rule retrieval is a bottleneck for LLMs working with full grammar books
- Medium confidence: Code-based grammar rules improve both retrieval and translation performance
- Medium confidence: The two-step retrieval-application approach is effective for grammar-book-guided translation

## Next Checks
1. Test the code-based grammar rule approach on at least three additional extremely low-resource languages with different grammatical families (e.g., polysynthetic, agglutinative, and tonal languages) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct human evaluation studies to verify whether BLEU improvements correspond to meaningful quality improvements in translation, particularly for grammatical features that are difficult to capture with automated metrics.
3. Evaluate the scalability of the approach by creating grammar books with 200-500 rules and testing whether the retrieval bottleneck persists or whether new challenges emerge in managing larger rule sets.
