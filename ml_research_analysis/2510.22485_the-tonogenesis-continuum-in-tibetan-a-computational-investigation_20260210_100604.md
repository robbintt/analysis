- Primary result: Tibetan dialects show varying ASR degradation when pitch is removed, revealing a continuum of pitch dependence reflecting historical tonogenesis

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how Tibetan dialects at different stages of tonogenesis rely on pitch for lexical contrast by systematically removing pitch contours from speech and measuring the resulting degradation in automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. Using fine-tuned XLS-R models on six Tibetan varieties, the authors compare word and character error rates with and without pitch information. Fully tonal Ü-Tsang dialects (Lhasa, Shigatse) show large error increases when pitch is removed (up to +0.139 CER for Shigatse), indicating heavy reliance on tone for word distinction. Intermediate Kham dialects show moderate degradation, while atonal Amdo varieties are minimally affected. These results reveal a continuum of pitch dependence that reflects historical tonogenesis and demonstrate that computational methods can capture nuanced stages of sound change beyond traditional text-based functional load measures.

## Method Summary
The authors use the TIBMD@MUC corpus containing six Tibetan dialects with ~2 hours of training and ~30 minutes of test audio per variety. They fine-tune separate XLS-R 300m models for each dialect using CTC loss with character-level vocabularies derived from Tibetan script transcriptions converted to Wylie transliteration. Pitch-flattening is applied to test sets using Praat PSOLA by replacing f0 contours with mean pitch. The primary metric is the delta in character and word error rates (CER/WER) between original and pitch-flattened audio, quantifying each dialect's reliance on pitch for lexical disambiguation.

## Key Results
- Lhasa and Shigatse (fully tonal Ü-Tsang) show large CER increases (+0.079 and +0.139 respectively) when pitch is removed
- Kham dialects (Dege, Changdu, Aba) show intermediate degradation, falling between tonal and atonal extremes
- Amdo dialects (Xiahe) show minimal error increase, confirming atonal status
- The gradient in ASR sensitivity to pitch removal correlates with the historical stage of tonogenesis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ASR performance degradation from pitch removal reveals the functional load of pitch across the tonogenesis continuum
- Mechanism: XLS-R models, fine-tuned on Tibetan speech, implicitly learn pitch-dependent lexical contrasts. Systematic pitch-flattening removes this cue, forcing reliance on residual segmental features. The resulting error rate increase quantifies how much pitch contributes to word distinction
- Core assumption: The model's learned representation of lexical contrast mirrors the phonological system, such that removing a critical cue causes predictable confusion proportional to its functional load
- Evidence anchors: "We introduce a computational approach that quantifies the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The gradient in ASR sensitivity to pitch-flattening correlates with the historical stage of tonogenesis
- Mechanism: Amdo dialects rely on preserved consonantal contrasts, so pitch removal causes minimal degradation. Ü-Tsang dialects rely heavily on phonemic pitch, so pitch removal causes large degradation. Kham dialects rely on a mix of cues, showing moderate degradation
- Core assumption: The dialects' positions on the tonogenesis continuum are accurately characterized by prior linguistic work
- Evidence anchors: "atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects fall measurably between these extremes"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Computational pitch-flattening captures nuances of pitch-segment interaction that text-based functional load measures may miss
- Mechanism: Traditional functional load metrics based on minimal pairs may overestimate pitch reliance in transitional systems where pitch co-exists with or is predictable from residual segmental cues. The ASR model implicitly captures this complex interplay
- Core assumption: Text-based minimal pair counts are an imperfect proxy for actual acoustic cue weighting in speech perception and production during sound change
- Evidence anchors: "traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined"

## Foundational Learning

### Tonogenesis
- Why needed: This is the core linguistic phenomenon under study. Understanding that languages can transition from using consonantal cues to pitch cues for lexical contrast is essential to interpreting why ASR models behave differently across dialects
- Quick check: In the context of this paper, what primary cue do atonal Amdo dialects rely on for lexical contrast instead of pitch?

### Functional Load
- Why needed: The paper uses ASR error degradation as a proxy for this linguistic concept. You must understand that functional load refers to how much work a particular contrast (here, pitch) does in distinguishing words within a language's lexicon
- Quick check: According to the paper, why might counting tone-based minimal pairs be a flawed measure of functional load for languages undergoing tonogenesis?

### Pitch-Flattening (f0 removal)
- Why needed: This is the key computational intervention. Understanding that this manipulation removes the pitch contour while preserving other acoustic features is critical to understanding why it isolates the contribution of pitch to ASR performance
- Quick check: What is the intended effect of the PSOLA-based pitch-flattening method on a speech signal?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
TIBMD@MUC corpus -> Preprocessing (Tibetan script -> Wylie transliteration -> character-level vocabulary) -> XLS-R 300m fine-tuning (per dialect) -> Pitch-flattening module (Praat PSOLA) -> Evaluation (CER/WER calculation on original vs. flattened test sets)

### Critical path
1. Fine-tune a separate XLS-R model on each dialect's original audio and text
2. Generate a pitch-flattened copy of each dialect's test set
3. Run inference with the corresponding fine-tuned model on both original and flattened test sets
4. Calculate CER/WER deltas to quantify pitch dependence

### Design tradeoffs
Using a shared orthography (Wylie) abstracts from dialect-specific phonology but simplifies vocabulary creation. The CTC loss enforces an alignment between audio frames and characters, which may not perfectly model complex tone-segment interactions. Fine-tuning per dialect maximizes sensitivity to its specific cues but reduces data efficiency compared to a multi-dialect model. Using only ~2 hours of data per dialect limits model robustness and generalization.

### Failure signatures
High baseline CER/WER may indicate insufficient training data or difficulty learning from the specific orthographic mapping. A negligible performance drop after pitch-flattening in a putatively tonal dialect would challenge the tonogenesis hypothesis. Large variance in results across speakers within a dialect could indicate overfitting to speaker idiosyncrasies rather than learning generalizable phonological patterns.

### First 3 experiments
1. Reproduce core delta-CER/WER analysis: For one atonal (Xiahe) and one tonal (Lhasa) dialect, fine-tune XLS-R, generate flattened test data, and confirm that the tonal dialect shows a substantially larger error rate increase
2. Test speaker independence: Re-evaluate a fine-tuned model on a held-out speaker from the same dialect to ensure the learned pitch dependence is not overfit to training speakers' specific voice qualities
3. Compare with explicit tone modeling: For the Lhasa dialect, experiment with adding a pitch contour feature as an additional input to the model and measure if it improves baseline CER/WER

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Which specific segments, syllable types, or tonal categories are most prone to confusion when f0 is removed in transitional Kham dialects versus fully tonal Ü-Tsang varieties?
- Basis in paper: "A next step is a more granular error analysis, focusing on whether certain segments or syllables are more prone to confusion when f0 is removed"
- Why unresolved: The study reports aggregate CER/WER differences but does not break down errors by phonological category, segment type, or tone class
- What evidence would resolve it: Confusion matrices or segment-level error analyses comparing pitch-flattened vs. original conditions across dialects, linked to tonal and segmental categories

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do the observed patterns of pitch sensitivity generalize to genuinely held-out speakers not seen during training?
- Basis in paper: "Our training and test datasets often contained recordings from the same speakers... Future work should validate these findings with genuinely held-out speakers to better gauge generalization"
- Why unresolved: Speaker overlap between training and test may inflate performance estimates and limit assessment of model robustness
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the pitch-flattening experiment with strictly speaker-disjoint train/test splits for each dialect

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can incorporating voice quality features (e.g., breathiness, phonation) alongside or instead of pitch improve ASR robustness for dialects in intermediate stages of tonogenesis?
- Basis in paper: "Future research could... explore advanced acoustic correlates (e.g., breathiness) that may serve as additional or alternative cues in emergent tone systems"
- Why unresolved: The current study isolates pitch but does not model phonation or voice quality, which may carry residual lexical contrast in transitional dialects
- What evidence would resolve it: ASR experiments adding breathiness/phonation features, comparing performance with and without these cues in Kham and other intermediate dialects

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (~2 hours per dialect) may limit model robustness and increase overfitting risk
- Speaker overlap between training and test sets could inflate baseline ASR performance
- Pitch-flattening may introduce subtle acoustic artifacts that confound error rate interpretation
- Relies on prior linguistic work to characterize tonogenesis continuum without direct acoustic validation

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Core experimental finding that tonal dialects show larger ASR degradation when pitch is removed is strongly supported
- Medium Confidence: Kham dialects show intermediate degradation, but continuum is less sharply defined than for tonal/atonal extremes
- Low Confidence: Theoretical claim that text-based minimal pair counts overestimate pitch dependence is not empirically validated in this study

## Next Checks
1. **Speaker Disjointness Test**: Re-evaluate ASR models on held-out speakers from each dialect to ensure pitch dependence is not an artifact of speaker overlap
2. **Acoustic Artifact Control**: Perform spectral analysis of pitch-flattened audio to quantify introduced artifacts and rerun evaluation with artifact-mitigated flattened audio if necessary
3. **Functional Load Comparison**: Calculate traditional functional load metrics based on tone-based minimal pairs and compare them directly to ASR-derived measure of pitch dependence to test the paper's claims about text-based approaches
