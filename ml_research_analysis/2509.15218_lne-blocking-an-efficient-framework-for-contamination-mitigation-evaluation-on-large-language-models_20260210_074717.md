core_contribution: This paper introduces LNE-Blocking, a framework that restores the
  genuine performance of large language models (LLMs) under greedy decoding by detecting
  contamination levels via LengthNormalizedEntropy (LNE) and applying targeted token-blocking
  interventions. Experiments on code generation and arithmetic reasoning tasks show
  that LNE-Blocking consistently recovers model performance across varying contamination

# LNE-Blocking: An Efficient Framework for Contamination Mitigation Evaluation on Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.15218
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15218
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: LNE-Blocking restores LLM performance under greedy decoding by detecting contamination via LengthNormalizedEntropy (LNE) and applying targeted token-blocking, outperforming sampling-based methods like TED especially on heavily contaminated models.

## Executive Summary
LNE-Blocking is a contamination mitigation framework for large language models that addresses performance degradation under greedy decoding when models are contaminated with pre-existing solutions. The framework detects contamination levels using a LengthNormalizedEntropy (LNE) metric and applies targeted token-blocking interventions to restore genuine model performance. Experiments demonstrate that LNE-Blocking consistently recovers performance across varying contamination levels, with particular effectiveness on heavily contaminated models in code generation and arithmetic reasoning tasks, while maintaining better coherence than sampling-based alternatives.

## Method Summary
The LNE-Blocking framework operates by first evaluating the contamination level of a model through the LengthNormalizedEntropy (LNE) metric, which captures the ratio of average token-level entropy to the total number of tokens. When contamination is detected, the framework applies a token-blocking strategy that prevents the model from outputting potentially contaminated tokens during greedy decoding. This approach directly addresses the core issue that contamination causes models to produce memorized answers rather than genuine reasoning, particularly under greedy decoding where sampling-based contamination mitigation methods like TED become ineffective. The framework is designed to be task-independent and scalable across different model sizes and contamination levels.

## Key Results
- LNE-Blocking consistently restores model performance across contamination levels 0-50% in code generation and arithmetic reasoning tasks
- The framework outperforms baseline sampling-based methods like TED, particularly on heavily contaminated models where sampling-based approaches fail
- Token-blocking intervention achieves stable performance recovery with minimal degradation in output coherence compared to sampling-based alternatives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LNE-Blocking works by addressing the fundamental conflict between contamination mitigation and greedy decoding. When models are contaminated with pre-existing solutions, greedy decoding tends to produce memorized answers rather than genuine reasoning outputs. Traditional sampling-based methods like TED, which introduce stochasticity to avoid contamination, are incompatible with greedy decoding's deterministic nature. LNE-Blocking circumvents this limitation by using LengthNormalizedEntropy to detect contamination patterns and then applying targeted token-blocking to prevent the model from outputting potentially memorized content, thereby forcing genuine reasoning while maintaining the determinism of greedy decoding.

## Foundational Learning
- **LengthNormalizedEntropy (LNE)**: A metric that captures the ratio of average token-level entropy to total tokens, used to detect contamination patterns in model outputs
  - Why needed: Provides a quantitative measure to distinguish between genuine reasoning (high entropy) and contamination (low entropy)
  - Quick check: Verify LNE values differ significantly between clean and contaminated model outputs on the same task

- **Token-blocking intervention**: A targeted mechanism that prevents the model from outputting specific tokens identified as potentially contaminated
  - Why needed: Enables contamination mitigation without introducing stochasticity, preserving greedy decoding's determinism
  - Quick check: Confirm blocked tokens correspond to known contaminated outputs in validation data

- **Greedy decoding contamination problem**: The tendency of contaminated models to produce memorized answers rather than genuine reasoning under deterministic decoding
  - Why needed: Identifies the core challenge that LNE-Blocking addresses, distinguishing it from sampling-based approaches
  - Quick check: Compare outputs from clean vs contaminated models under greedy decoding on novel problems

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input task -> LNE calculation -> Contamination detection -> Token-blocking intervention -> Output generation

**Critical path:** Task input → LNE-based contamination detection → Token blocking → Output generation (greedy decoding)

**Design tradeoffs:** The framework trades some output diversity (compared to sampling) for deterministic contamination mitigation, prioritizing reliability over exploration

**Failure signatures:** 
- False negatives: Contaminated outputs pass LNE threshold and aren't blocked
- False positives: Clean outputs trigger blocking unnecessarily
- Threshold sensitivity: Inappropriate LNE thresholds leading to over/under-blocking

**First 3 experiments to run:**
1. Measure LNE values on clean vs contaminated models across multiple task types to establish baseline detection capability
2. Test token-blocking effectiveness by comparing outputs with and without intervention on known contaminated data
3. Evaluate performance recovery across contamination levels (0%, 25%, 50%) while monitoring coherence metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does LNE-Blocking remain effective when contamination arises from full pre-training rather than continued pre-training or LoRA fine-tuning?
- Basis in paper: The authors note in the Limitations section that due to cost, they simulated contamination via continued pre-training, whereas "a significant portion of contamination... arises from pretraining from scratch."
- Why unresolved: Retraining LLMs from scratch with specific contaminated corpora is prohibitively expensive, so the framework has only been validated on cheaper simulation methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating LNE-Blocking on a model known to be contaminated during its initial pre-training phase, or training a smaller model from scratch with a controlled contamination mix.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does LNE-Blocking perform on open-ended tasks like long-form text generation compared to the structured reasoning tasks evaluated?
- Basis in paper: The authors state, "the evaluation of our work is mainly focused on benchmarks for code generation and arithmetic reasoning," and they plan to "validate our approaches on other benchmarks" in future work.
- Why unresolved: The detection metric (LNE) relies on entropy patterns that may differ significantly in creative writing or open-domain dialogue compared to deterministic tasks like math and code.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results applying LNE-Blocking to datasets for summarization, translation, or creative writing with controlled contamination levels.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the framework be refined to improve performance recovery on models with mild contamination levels?
- Basis in paper: In the Results section (6.1.1), the authors observe that on mildly contaminated models, "LNE-Blocking strategy under-performs compared to TED," suggesting the "framework has room for improvement with a more fine-grained strategy."
- Why unresolved: The current LNE detection method may lack the sensitivity to distinguish genuine low-entropy reasoning from mild memorization, leading to sub-optimal blocking intensity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified detection mechanism that successfully recovers performance on mildly contaminated data to a degree statistically superior to sampling-based methods like TED.

## Limitations
- Framework validation limited to contamination from continued pre-training/LoRA fine-tuning, not full pre-training from scratch
- Primary evaluation focused on structured tasks (code generation, arithmetic reasoning) rather than open-ended text generation
- LNE detection may lack sensitivity for mild contamination levels, where sampling-based methods currently outperform

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The framework's core mechanism (LNE detection + token-blocking) and its effectiveness on controlled contamination scenarios
**Medium confidence**: Claims about superior performance over baseline methods like TED, particularly given the specific implementation details and parameter choices
**Medium confidence**: Task-independence assertions based on current experimental scope
**Low confidence**: Real-world scalability and performance on heterogeneous contamination patterns

## Next Checks
1. Test LNE-Blocking on models with mixed contamination levels across different domains to assess framework adaptability
2. Evaluate framework performance on diverse task types including natural language understanding, creative writing, and domain-specific applications
3. Implement systematic coherence evaluation using both automated metrics (e.g., perplexity, semantic consistency scores) and human assessment to quantify preservation guarantees
