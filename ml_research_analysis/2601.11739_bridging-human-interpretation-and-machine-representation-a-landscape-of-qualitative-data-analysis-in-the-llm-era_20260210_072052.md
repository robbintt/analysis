- Primary result: Introduces 4×4 landscape model mapping human meaning-making and machine modeling levels in LLM-assisted qualitative research

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the gap between human interpretive practices and machine representations in qualitative research by introducing a 4×4 landscape model. The framework crosses four levels of meaning-making (descriptive, categorical, interpretive, theoretical) with four levels of modeling (static structure, stages/timelines, causal pathways, feedback dynamics). Manual annotation of 300 papers reveals that current LLM-based systems skew toward low-commitment modeling and shallow meaning-making, rarely achieving interpretive or theoretical depth. The landscape provides a specification language for analytic contracts, governance rules, and evaluation protocols, with LLM-based annotation experiments confirming operational clarity.

## Method Summary
The study collected 300 papers through PRISMA-style screening (664,244 records) and snowball sampling, annotating each on two axes: meaning-making level (M1–M4) and modeling level (D1–D4). Three annotators classified each paper using detailed prompts, with consensus resolution. The framework was validated using GPT-5.2, achieving 85% agreement for meaning-making and 94% for modeling levels. The approach also introduced evidence-anchored graph standards and LLM-judge-based goodness-of-fit metrics for evaluating qualitative models against corpora.

## Key Results
- Computational papers cluster in low-commitment zones (M1–M2, D1–D2) while human QR spans the full landscape
- Framework enables systematic mapping of current practice and identification of gaps in LLM-assisted qualitative analysis
- LLM-based annotation achieves high agreement rates (85% meaning-making, 94% modeling) with human experts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing qualitative outputs into orthogonal meaning-making and modeling axes prevents category errors and aligns evaluation to claim type.
- Mechanism: The 4×4 landscape factorizes two coupled inference problems: (1) what meanings are inferred from traces, and (2) what global structure is asserted. By making these separable, the framework distinguishes surface reorganization from substantive interpretation, and thematic maps from mechanism explanations.
- Core assumption: Evaluators and automated systems can reliably distinguish levels along each axis given explicit definitions and boundary tests.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract statement of landscape crossing four levels of meaning-making with four levels of modeling; corpus examples of Neo-Grounded Theory and Disagreement as Data addressing similar decomposition challenges.
- Break condition: If annotators or LLMs cannot achieve reliable inter-rater agreement on level assignments, the operational utility of the landscape collapses.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Evidence-anchored graph representations maintain traceability required for qualitative rigor while enabling computational operations.
- Mechanism: Each node and edge in the QualGraph carries structured EvidenceItem objects linking claims to excerpt spans, support labels, rationales, and confidence scores. This creates an auditable trail from model claims back to corpus evidence.
- Core assumption: Corpora can be segmented into testable excerpts, and LLM judges can produce consistent support/contradiction labels with rationales.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mention of evidence-anchored graph standards; section discussion of Evidence anchors as required for every node and edge.
- Break condition: If multi-step LLM synthesis breaks the audit trail or if judges produce inconsistent labels, traceability is lost and fitness scores become uninterpretable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Goodness-of-fit metrics computed via LLM judges enable automated evaluation of qualitative models against corpora without requiring gold-standard human annotations.
- Mechanism: The Fit(G,X) score aggregates per-claim support-contradiction ratios, evidence coverage, and complexity penalties. For D2/D3/D4, level-specific components (order consistency, mechanism specificity, loop closure) add structure-sensitive validation.
- Core assumption: LLM judges can approximate human evaluation of whether excerpts support, contradict, or are irrelevant to model claims.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mention of LLM-judge-based goodness-of-fit metrics; section formula Fit(G,X)= mean(score(k)) + β·mean(cov(k)) − γ·Complexity(G).
- Break condition: If LLM judges exhibit systematic bias toward high confidence on unsupported claims or fail to detect contradictions, the fit scores will be misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Manifest vs. latent content distinction
  - Why needed here: The meaning-making axis (M1–M4) operationalizes the classic qualitative distinction between surface-observable content and inferred implicit meaning.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify whether a given theme restates what participants said versus inferring what they meant but did not explicitly state?

- Concept: Causal/mechanism vs. temporal ordering
  - Why needed here: The modeling axis distinguishes D2 (stages with "next/then" semantics) from D3 (directed influence with "produces/changes" semantics).
  - Quick check question: Given a process diagram, can you determine whether arrows represent sequence or causation?

- Concept: Traceability and audit trails in QR
  - Why needed here: Qualitative rigor depends on showing how claims connect to excerpts; computational systems must preserve this.
  - Quick check question: For a generated model claim, can you trace back to the specific corpus evidence that supports it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: QualGraph (typed property multigraph) -> EvidenceItem (structured link to excerpt) -> LLM Judge (claim-excerpt evaluation) -> Fit Scorer (aggregate evaluation) -> Retrieval Index (candidate excerpt retrieval)

- Critical path: 1. Define codebook → 2. Extract codes via LLM → 3. Induce inter-code relations (axial coding) → 4. Build QualGraph (D1–D4) → 5. Judge evidence anchors → 6. Compute Fit(G,X) → 7. Iterate or promote to higher modeling level

- Design tradeoffs: Higher modeling levels (D3/D4) require stronger evidence warrants but yield more explanatory power; LLM judges enable scalability but introduce variance and potential hallucination; complexity penalty favors parsimonious models but may underfit rich phenomena

- Failure signatures: High Fit score but low human expert agreement → judge calibration issue; empty or sparse evidence anchors → over-interpretation without corpus grounding; D3/D4 models with D1-level meaning-making → representational overcommitment without interpretive warrant

- First 3 experiments: 1. Validate the landscape on a held-out set of QR papers using the provided annotation rubric; measure inter-annotator agreement. 2. Implement the QualGraph representation for a small corpus; manually verify evidence anchor quality before automating. 3. Compare LLM judge agreement against human expert judgments on a sample of claim-excerpt pairs; calibrate confidence thresholds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can LLM systems implement adaptive level selection to autonomously determine the appropriate level of meaning-making and modeling based on corpus evidence, including calibrated abstention for high-commitment regions?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.2, Agenda item 2 explicitly calls for enabling "adaptive level selection" with "calibrated abstention or fallback to lower-commitment outputs when evidence is insufficient."
- Why unresolved: Current LLM-based QR systems produce fixed outputs regardless of data quality or ambiguity, lacking the mechanism to assess if the evidence warrants deep interpretive claims (M3/M4) or dynamic models (D3/D4).
- What evidence would resolve it: A system demonstration where the model autonomously downgrades a proposed D3 causal model to a D1 thematic summary when counter-evidence is detected, validated against human expert judgment.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What computational methodologies can effectively operationalize "fitness-to-corpus" metrics—such as evidence coverage, contradiction rates, and semantic consistency—for evaluating structural qualitative models (D2–D4)?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.2, Agenda item 3 states the need to create "evaluation methodologies for qualitative modeling" because "automatic goodness-of-fit metrics for qualitative models" are a "key missing ingredient."
- Why unresolved: QR outcomes are typically narrative and discursive, making them poorly suited for standard evaluation; current methods rely on human judgment or bespoke datasets rather than systematic, scalable metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of a quantitative metric for graph-based qualitative models that correlates strongly with human assessments of structural adequacy and evidence linkage.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can algorithms be designed to move beyond semantic aggregation to explicitly induce structural relationships (axial coding) between codes, thereby bridging the gap between static themes (D1) and process/mechanism models (D2–D4)?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.2, Agenda item 1 calls for "code relation induction algorithms" that transition from "coding individual data points" to "modeling relationships among codes" (axial coding), noting existing work stops at D1.
- Why unresolved: Current computational approaches treat codes as independent clusters, failing to infer the temporal, causal, or logical dependencies required for higher-level modeling.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm that successfully constructs D2 (stages) or D3 (causal pathways) graphs from unstructured text with accuracy comparable to human axial coding.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Do the risks of LLM-assisted qualitative research (hallucination, context erosion) distribute uniformly across the landscape, or do they increase predictably in high-commitment regions (M3–M4, D3–D4)?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.1 hypothesizes that risks "might not distribute uniformly" and suggests the landscape could scaffold "systematic benchmarking to establish more rigorous governance rules."
- Why unresolved: There is no empirical data mapping specific failure modes (e.g., over-interpretation) to specific cells in the 4×4 landscape; the authors currently treat this as a "plausible hypothesis."
- What evidence would resolve it: A benchmarking study showing significantly higher error rates or "epistemic drift" in M4/D4 tasks compared to M1/D1 tasks, justifying scoped governance rules.

## Limitations

- Framework operational clarity depends on achieving consistent annotator agreement, particularly for M3/M4 and D3/D4 boundary cases where Kappa statistics suggest ongoing challenges
- Evidence-anchored graph approach assumes corpora can be reliably segmented and that LLM judges will produce consistent support/contradiction labels, but systematic evaluation of judge reliability is limited
- Framework inherits classical qualitative research tensions about interpretation versus objectivity that computational approaches may oversimplify

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The 4×4 landscape structure as a useful conceptual tool for mapping current practice (well-supported by corpus analysis showing computational papers cluster in low-commitment zones)
- **Medium confidence**: LLM judges can approximate human evaluation of qualitative model fit (supported by validation numbers but limited judge reliability testing)
- **Medium confidence**: Evidence-anchored graphs enable computational rigor in qualitative analysis (design is sound but no systematic validation of traceability preservation)
- **Low confidence**: The framework can bridge the human-machine gap in qualitative research practice (correlational evidence only; causal claims about practical impact untested)

## Next Checks

1. **Inter-annotator agreement stress test**: Have three independent teams annotate 50 papers using the provided rubric, focusing on M3/M4 and D3/D4 boundary cases; measure whether Kappa improves with training and whether teams converge on problematic distinctions.

2. **Evidence anchor audit trail validation**: Implement the QualGraph for a small corpus, then systematically test whether every node/edge claim can be traced to supporting excerpts, and whether removing evidence anchors causes LLM judges to hallucinate support for unsupported claims.

3. **LLM judge calibration experiment**: Compare LLM judge agreement against multiple human expert judgments on claim-excerpt pairs spanning all support/contradiction/irrelevance cases; quantify false positive/negative rates and establish confidence thresholds that maintain precision ≥90%.
