# Heteroscedastic Neural Networks for Path Loss Prediction with Link-Specific Uncertainty

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.23243
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23243
- Authors: Jonathan Ethier
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Shared-parameter heteroscedastic network achieves 7.4 dB RMSE with 95.1% PICP and 29.6 dB MPIW, outperforming MSE and independent architectures.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a heteroscedastic neural network for path loss prediction that jointly estimates the mean and link-specific variance via Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss, capturing real-world variability instead of assuming constant uncertainty. Three architectural variants—shared, partially shared, and independent parameters—were evaluated using accuracy, calibration, and sharpness metrics on large-scale RF drive-test data. The shared-parameter architecture outperformed alternatives, achieving an RMSE of 7.4 dB, 95.1% coverage for 95% prediction intervals, and a mean interval width of 29.6 dB, while maintaining good calibration and sharpness. Heteroscedastic uncertainty estimates support more accurate coverage margins, improve RF planning and interference analysis, and serve as effective diagnostics for identifying model weaknesses in data-sparse regions.

## Method Summary
The method employs a shared-parameter neural network with two hidden layers (64 neurons each, ReLU activation, 25% dropout) that jointly predicts path loss mean and variance using Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss. The model uses three features per link: frequency, distance, and total obstruction depth. Training follows a leave-one-group-out cross-validation scheme across six drive-test locations with 10 random 80/20 splits per fold, early stopping at 100 epochs, and Adam optimizer (lr=0.01, batch=1024). Performance is evaluated via RMSE for accuracy and PICP/MPIW for calibration and sharpness of 95% prediction intervals.

## Key Results
- Shared-parameter architecture achieves lowest validation NLL (3.37) with smallest variance (0.02)
- RMSE of 7.4 dB with 95.1% PICP for 95% prediction intervals (target: 95%)
- Mean interval width of 29.6 dB with kurtosis/skewness < 1, indicating normality assumption holds
- High predicted variance identifies data-sparse regions rather than inherently complex propagation conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Gaussian NLL Enables Joint Mean-Variance Optimization
The NLL loss function treats variance σ²ᵢ as a learnable parameter alongside mean μᵢ. During backpropagation, the network is penalized for both prediction errors and miscalibrated uncertainty—overconfident wrong predictions receive doubly penalized, encouraging the model to output larger variance when uncertain. Core assumption: residuals follow an approximately Normal distribution. Evidence: Abstract states joint prediction via NLL, Section II-A shows full NLL formulation, but external validation limited. Break condition: If residuals violate normality (high skewness/kurtosis), predicted variances may not correspond to true uncertainty.

### Mechanism 2: Shared Architecture Provides Implicit Regularization
Forcing one network to serve both objectives (mean and variance) prevents overspecialization to either task. The shared representation must encode features useful for both predictions, encouraging more robust internal representations that generalize better. Core assumption: Mean and variance prediction benefit from shared intermediate features. Evidence: Section III-B explains implicit regularization, Table I shows shared achieves lowest validation NLL (3.37) with lowest SD (0.02), Table II confirms shared significantly outperforms partial (p=0.0013) and independent (p=0.0218). Break condition: If mean and variance require fundamentally different feature representations, shared architecture could underperform.

### Mechanism 3: Variance as Diagnostic for Data Sparsity
Data-driven models cannot express confidence in regions poorly represented in training. When NLL-optimized models encounter out-of-distribution inputs, they learn to output high variance—reflecting epistemic uncertainty about unfamiliar conditions. Core assumption: High predicted variance correlates with sparse training data rather than merely difficult propagation conditions. Evidence: Section III-F notes highest predicted variances appeared in physically "easy" LOS conditions with few training samples, indicating variance reflects model ignorance rather than propagation complexity. Break condition: If training data is biased toward certain conditions, high variance may mislead.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Heteroscedasticity vs. Homoscedasticity**
  - Why needed: The paper is motivated by the claim that real-world path loss uncertainty varies by link (heteroscedastic), contrary to classical models assuming constant variance (homoscedastic)
  - Quick check: If a model predicts RMSE = 7 dB everywhere, is it heteroscedastic or homoscedastic?

- **Concept: Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood**
  - Why needed: Understanding why NLL enables variance estimation while MSE does not requires grasping how the loss function's mathematical form incorporates σ² as a parameter
  - Quick check: In Eq. 2, what happens to the loss if the model predicts small σ² but makes a large prediction error?

- **Concept: Prediction Interval Calibration (PICP/MPIW)**
  - Why needed: The paper evaluates models not just on accuracy (RMSE) but on whether predicted uncertainty is trustworthy (calibration) and useful (sharpness)
  - Quick check: A model with 95% PICP and MPIW = 50 dB is well-calibrated. Why might this still be undesirable?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input features (frequency, distance, obstruction) → 2 hidden layers (64 neurons, ReLU, 25% dropout) → dual outputs (μ, σ²) → NLL loss → Adam optimization

- **Critical path**: Feature extraction from terrain/profile data → 3-feature vector per link → forward pass through shared network → μᵢ and log(σ²ᵢ) outputs → NLL computation comparing (μᵢ, σ²ᵢ) to ground truth yᵢ → backprop updates both mean and variance parameters jointly → inference: μᵢ for point prediction, σᵢ for interval width (±1.96σᵢ for 95% CI)

- **Design tradeoffs**: Shared vs. independent: Shared offers better calibration and stability (~4,500 params), independent allows specialized features but shows high variance across runs (SD of RMSE = 1.5 dB). Network depth: >2 layers showed overfitting in preliminary experiments. Feature minimalism: 3 features chosen for computational efficiency; terrain/clutter features could improve accuracy but untested.

- **Failure signatures**: Independent architecture shows training instability (validation NLL SD = 0.21 vs. 0.02 for shared) and high metric variance (MPIW SD = 6.1 dB). MSE-optimized models appear sharper (MPIW = 27.0 dB) but are overconfident (PICP = 93.2%, below 95% target). Kurtosis/skewness > 1 suggests normality assumption violated (independent architecture max kurtosis = 5.45).

- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Replicate shared architecture on held-out location using paper's hyperparameters (2 layers, 64 neurons, Adam lr=0.01, batch 1024, early stopping at 100 epochs). Target: RMSE ~7.4 dB, PICP ~95%.
  2. Ablate to MSE loss with identical architecture. Verify that calibration degrades (PICP < 95%) while accuracy stays similar—confirming NLL's value is uncertainty quality, not point prediction.
  3. Spatial variance diagnostic: Generate prediction interval heatmap for a new environment. Identify high-variance regions and check if they correspond to underrepresented conditions in training data (e.g., LOS, specific distance ranges).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Question:** To what extent does incorporating complex environmental features (such as terrain roughness or clutter type) improve the sharpness (MPIW) of heteroscedastic models without degrading calibration (PICP)?
- **Basis in paper:** The conclusion states, "Future work will... explore new model features," noting that the current study utilized a minimal feature set (frequency, distance, obstruction depth) to establish a baseline.
- **Why unresolved:** While the minimal feature set demonstrated the validity of the NLL approach, it is unknown if richer features would significantly tighten the prediction intervals (currently ~29.6 dB) while maintaining the 95.1% coverage.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study benchmarking the shared-parameter NLL model's PICP and MPIW using the current feature set against a model utilizing high-resolution geospatial data.

## Limitations
- All claims rest on a single dataset (UK Ofcom RF drive-test data) with a specific three-feature input set
- The diagnostic interpretation of variance as data-sparsity indicator lacks external validation
- Shared architecture's superiority untested in richer feature spaces or different propagation environments

## Confidence
- Confidence in core claims: **Medium** - The mechanism connecting NLL loss to joint mean-variance optimization is mathematically sound, and empirical superiority of shared architecture is statistically significant (p < 0.05)
- Confidence in diagnostic properties: **Low** - The interpretation of variance as data-sparsity indicator lacks external validation
- Confidence in architectural generalizability: **Medium** - Shared architecture shows superior calibration but untested with richer feature sets

## Next Checks
1. **External Dataset Test**: Apply the shared heteroscedastic network to a geographically and technologically distinct dataset (e.g., millimeter-wave urban measurements) to verify calibration and diagnostic properties generalize.

2. **Feature Ablation Study**: Systematically remove each of the three input features to quantify their individual contributions to accuracy and uncertainty quality, testing whether the shared architecture's advantage persists with reduced input information.

3. **Temporal Stability Test**: Train on data from multiple time periods to verify that predicted variance reliably flags out-of-distribution temporal conditions (e.g., seasonal foliage changes) as well as spatial ones.
