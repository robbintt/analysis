# Diverse LLMs or Diverse Question Interpretations? That is the Ensembling Question

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.21168
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21168
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Question interpretation diversity consistently outperforms model diversity in LLM ensembles

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether diversity in question interpretation can serve as an effective alternative to model diversity in LLM ensembles. The authors compare two approaches: using multiple models to answer the same question versus using a single model to generate multiple interpretations of the question, then answering each. Both approaches use majority voting for final answer selection. Experiments on three datasets (boolq, strategyqa, and pubmedqa) with GPT and LLaMA models show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity, with minimal overlap in accuracy improvements.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two ensemble strategies for improving LLM accuracy: model diversity and question interpretation diversity. For model diversity, multiple LLM models independently answer the same question, and majority voting determines the final answer. For question interpretation diversity, a single model generates multiple interpretations of the question, each interpretation is answered separately, and majority voting is applied across these answers. The authors evaluate both approaches on boolq, strategyqa, and pubmedqa datasets using GPT and LLaMA models, measuring ensemble accuracy and comparing the diversity and effectiveness of each approach.

## Key Results
- Question interpretation diversity consistently leads to better ensemble accuracy than model diversity across all tested datasets
- Model diversity typically produces results between the best and worst ensemble members without clear improvement
- Minimal overlap exists between accuracy improvements from the two approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind question interpretation diversity's superiority lies in its ability to explore different semantic spaces of the same question. When a single model generates multiple interpretations, it can uncover nuances, ambiguities, and alternative framings that might lead to different answers. This approach effectively multiplies the diversity of reasoning paths without the variability introduced by different model architectures and training data. In contrast, model diversity relies on inherent differences between models, which may not systematically address question ambiguity or alternative interpretations.

## Foundational Learning

**LLM Ensemble Methods**: Understanding how multiple models or interpretations can be combined to improve accuracy through voting mechanisms. Why needed: Forms the basis for comparing the two diversity approaches. Quick check: Can you explain how majority voting aggregates multiple responses?

**Question Ambiguity and Interpretation**: Recognizing that questions can have multiple valid interpretations leading to different answers. Why needed: Central to understanding why interpretation diversity might outperform model diversity. Quick check: Can you identify multiple valid interpretations of a complex question?

**Diversity Metrics in Ensembles**: Measuring and comparing the diversity of model outputs versus interpretation outputs. Why needed: Helps quantify and compare the effectiveness of different diversity approaches. Quick check: Can you calculate diversity metrics for a set of model responses?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Question -> Interpretation Generator -> Multiple Interpreted Questions -> LLM -> Multiple Answers -> Aggregator (Majority Voting) -> Final Answer

**Critical Path**: For interpretation diversity: Question generation -> Multiple LLM queries -> Answer aggregation. For model diversity: Single question -> Multiple LLM queries -> Answer aggregation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Interpretation diversity requires an additional step of generating question variants but uses fewer LLM queries. Model diversity uses more models but fewer steps per model. The tradeoff involves computational cost versus potential accuracy gains.

**Failure Signatures**: Both approaches can fail when the majority voting selects incorrect answers, particularly when question interpretations are too diverse (leading to contradictory answers) or when model outputs are highly correlated.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Generate multiple interpretations of a single question and verify they capture different semantic meanings
2. Run majority voting on a small set of model outputs to confirm aggregation works
3. Compare diversity metrics between interpretation diversity and model diversity on a sample dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations

The study's findings are limited by the effectiveness of majority voting as the aggregation method, which may not be optimal for all question types. The experiments are constrained to three specific datasets that may not represent the full diversity of question types encountered in real-world applications. The analysis assumes that diversity in question interpretation is always beneficial without investigating scenarios where this might lead to contradictory or nonsensical interpretations.

## Confidence

**Core Finding**: High confidence that question interpretation diversity outperforms model diversity for ensemble accuracy, supported by consistent experimental results across multiple datasets.

**Model Diversity Performance**: Medium confidence that model diversity typically produces results between best and worst ensemble members, based on specific models and datasets tested.

**Minimal Overlap Claim**: Medium confidence in the minimal overlap between accuracy improvements from the two approaches, as analysis could be influenced by experimental conditions and metrics used.

## Next Checks

1. Test alternative aggregation methods (weighted voting, confidence-based selection) to determine if they can improve model diversity ensemble performance to match or exceed question interpretation diversity results.

2. Evaluate the approaches on additional question types and domains, particularly those requiring numerical reasoning, commonsense knowledge, or multi-step problem solving, to assess generalizability beyond the three studied datasets.

3. Conduct a computational cost analysis comparing the resources required for generating multiple interpretations versus querying multiple models, including latency measurements for real-time applications.
