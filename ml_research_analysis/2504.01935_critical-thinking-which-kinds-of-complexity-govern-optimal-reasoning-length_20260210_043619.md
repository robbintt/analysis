# Critical Thinking: Which Kinds of Complexity Govern Optimal Reasoning Length?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.01935
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01935
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Optimal reasoning length correlates with DFA run length but not state-space size

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates which aspects of task complexity govern optimal reasoning length in large language models. The authors propose a framework using deterministic finite automata (DFAs) to formalize task complexity through two measurable properties: run length (number of reasoning steps required) and state-space size (decision complexity). Through experiments across diverse tasks and models, they find that optimal reasoning length strongly correlates with DFA run length but not with state-space size. They demonstrate that filtering generations to predicted optimal reasoning lengths improves accuracy across models, with COT-RL models showing the largest gains. The results suggest that test-time compute primarily serves implicit state-tracking rather than representing complex decision structures.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize task complexity using DFAs with two measurable properties: run length (number of reasoning steps required to solve a task) and state-space size (number of distinct states in the DFA). They design a novel reasoning length probing task to measure model's understanding of optimal reasoning length and find that longer-run-length tasks benefit more from COT-RL training. Through experiments on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks, they demonstrate that optimal reasoning length correlates strongly with DFA run length across tasks, while state-space size has minimal impact. The authors also show that filtering generations to predicted optimal reasoning lengths improves accuracy across models, with COT-RL models showing the largest gains.

## Key Results
- Optimal reasoning length strongly correlates with DFA run length but not state-space size
- COT-RL models show the largest gains from reasoning length filtering
- Filtering generations to predicted optimal reasoning lengths improves accuracy across models
- Test-time compute primarily serves implicit state-tracking rather than representing complex decision structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying the relationship between task complexity and optimal reasoning length centers on how language models process information during chain-of-thought reasoning. The DFA framework captures two distinct dimensions of complexity: the number of sequential steps required (run length) and the number of decision points (state-space size). The strong correlation between optimal reasoning length and run length suggests that models primarily use additional tokens to track state transitions through sequential reasoning steps rather than to navigate complex decision structures. COT-RL training appears to enhance the model's ability to allocate reasoning steps appropriately for different task complexities, particularly for longer-run-length tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA): Mathematical models for recognizing patterns and sequences
  - Why needed: Provides formal framework to quantify task complexity through run length and state-space size
  - Quick check: Can be represented as 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F) where Q is states, Σ is alphabet, δ is transition function, q0 is start state, F is accept states

- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning: Step-by-step reasoning process in language models
  - Why needed: Central mechanism for understanding how models use reasoning tokens
  - Quick check: Each reasoning step corresponds to a state transition in the DFA model

- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Training method for aligning model behavior
  - Why needed: COT-RL specifically trains models to optimize reasoning length
  - Quick check: Uses reward functions that penalize incorrect reasoning steps

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
DFA Framework -> Reasoning Length Probing Task -> Optimal Length Prediction -> Generation Filtering

**Critical Path:**
Task complexity measurement → DFA run length/state-space size extraction → Model reasoning length probing → Optimal length prediction → Generation filtering for accuracy improvement

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- DFA complexity vs. model performance: Simpler DFAs may not capture all task nuances
- Reasoning length vs. accuracy: Longer reasoning doesn't always improve accuracy
- COT-RL training vs. base models: Trade-off between computational cost and performance gains

**Failure Signatures:**
- Over-reliance on run length when state-space complexity matters
- COT-RL models overfitting to specific reasoning patterns
- Poor generalization from synthetic DFA tasks to real-world problems

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify DFA run length correlation with optimal reasoning length across multiple task types
2. Compare COT-RL vs. base models on reasoning length prediction accuracy
3. Test generation filtering performance across different model families

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- The DFA framework may oversimplify complex reasoning tasks
- Results primarily based on synthetic tasks, limiting real-world applicability
- The relationship between reasoning length and accuracy may not hold for all model architectures

## Confidence
- Correlation between run length and optimal reasoning length: High
- COT-RL performance gains: Medium
- Generalization to real-world tasks: Low

## Next Checks
1. Validate DFA-based complexity measures on non-synthetic reasoning tasks
2. Test whether reasoning length filtering works across different model families beyond those studied
3. Investigate the relationship between run length and accuracy on tasks with varying state-space sizes
