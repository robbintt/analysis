- Proposed an efficient approximation to full conformal prediction for neural network regression by combining Gauss-Newton influence functions with network linearization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ACP-GN, an efficient approximation to full conformal prediction for neural network regression that avoids expensive retraining and exhaustive grid searches. By combining Gauss-Newton influence functions with network linearization, the method expresses the absolute residual nonconformity score as a piecewise linear function of the candidate label. On standard UCI regression benchmarks and bounding box localization tasks, ACP-GN produces locally-adaptive, often tighter prediction intervals than split conformal prediction while maintaining coverage. For limited-data regimes, it yields the most efficient intervals among well-calibrated methods. Variants using sample splitting or scalable approximations (KFAC, last-layer) are also explored, with split+refine generally ensuring correct coverage.

## Method Summary
ACP-GN approximates full conformal prediction for neural network regression by linearizing the network around training data and leveraging Gauss-Newton influence functions. Instead of retraining the model for each candidate label during the calibration set search, the method approximates the change in model predictions using the Gauss-Newton approximation to the Hessian, which captures curvature information efficiently. The absolute residual nonconformity score is expressed as a piecewise linear function of the candidate label, enabling analytical interval construction without exhaustive search. The approach scales to deep networks while maintaining computational efficiency through approximations like KFAC and last-layer-only updates.

## Key Results
- ACP-GN produces tighter, locally-adaptive prediction intervals than split conformal prediction on UCI regression benchmarks
- The method maintains valid coverage while significantly reducing computational cost compared to full conformal prediction
- In limited-data regimes, ACP-GN achieves the most efficient intervals among well-calibrated methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the structure of neural network regression through linearization and influence functions. When a candidate label is perturbed, the change in network output can be approximated using the Gauss-Newton approximation to the Hessian, which captures how sensitive the model is to changes in the input. This allows expressing the nonconformity score (absolute residual) as a piecewise linear function of the candidate label, making it possible to construct prediction intervals analytically rather than through exhaustive search. The linearization is valid locally around training points, and the Gauss-Newton approximation provides a computationally efficient way to capture the curvature of the loss landscape.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal prediction**: A framework for uncertainty quantification that provides statistically valid prediction intervals by using the conformity of new examples to a calibration set
  - *Why needed*: Provides the theoretical foundation for constructing prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage
  - *Quick check*: Verify that the method maintains marginal coverage at the specified confidence level
- **Influence functions**: A tool from robust statistics that measures how model predictions change when individual training points are upweighted
  - *Why needed*: Enables efficient approximation of model behavior under label perturbations without retraining
  - *Quick check*: Compare influence-based predictions against actual retraining for a subset of examples
- **Gauss-Newton approximation**: An approximation to the Hessian of the loss that is more stable and efficient than exact second-order methods
  - *Why needed*: Provides a computationally tractable way to capture curvature information for linearization
  - *Quick check*: Verify that the approximation remains accurate for the network architectures used
- **Network linearization**: The process of approximating a neural network as a linear function around specific input points
  - *Why needed*: Enables analytical treatment of the nonconformity score as a function of candidate labels
  - *Quick check*: Assess the accuracy of linearization by comparing linearized and actual network outputs
- **Piecewise linear functions**: Functions that are linear on different intervals of their domain
  - *Why needed*: The nonconformity score becomes piecewise linear in the candidate label, enabling efficient interval construction
  - *Quick check*: Verify that the nonconformity score exhibits the expected piecewise linear structure
- **Nonconformity scores**: Measures of how different a new example is from the calibration set
  - *Why needed*: Central to conformal prediction - determines which candidate labels are plausible
  - *Quick check*: Ensure that the absolute residual is an appropriate nonconformity measure for the regression task

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data -> Network (Linearized) -> Gauss-Newton Influence -> Nonconformity Score -> Prediction Interval

**Critical path**: Training data and calibration set feed into the linearized network and influence computation, which together determine the nonconformity scores used to construct prediction intervals for new test points.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades exactness (full conformal prediction requires retraining for each candidate) for efficiency through linearization and first-order approximations. While this enables scalability to deep networks, it may sacrifice accuracy in highly nonlinear regimes. The choice between full ACP-GN, split+refine, and scalable approximations involves balancing computational cost against theoretical guarantees.

**Failure signatures**: Poor calibration when the linearization assumption breaks down (highly nonlinear networks, large perturbations), coverage violations when influence approximations are inaccurate, and degraded efficiency when the piecewise linear approximation poorly represents the true nonconformity surface.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Compare ACP-GN intervals against split conformal prediction on a simple UCI dataset (e.g., Boston Housing) to verify basic functionality
2. Test the accuracy of the linearization approximation by comparing linearized predictions against actual retraining for a small set of candidate labels
3. Evaluate coverage and efficiency on a synthetic regression problem with known noise structure to validate theoretical guarantees

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper notes that while the method shows promise, questions remain about its behavior in high-dimensional settings, with structured outputs, and under distribution shift. The authors also highlight the need for further investigation into the theoretical properties of the piecewise linear approximation and its interaction with different network architectures and loss functions.

## Limitations
- Dependence on network linearization and first-order approximations may reduce accuracy for highly nonlinear neural networks or poorly calibrated base models
- Theoretical coverage guarantees rely on assumptions that may not hold with limited or non-i.i.d. data
- Computational requirements still scale with network size, potentially limiting applicability to very large architectures

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in empirical results, given extensive benchmarking on standard datasets with clear quantitative improvements
- **Medium** confidence in theoretical framework, as linearized approximations introduce approximations not fully characterized
- **Medium** confidence in scalability claims, since tests focus on moderate-sized networks and benefits for extremely large models are not demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on deep architectures (e.g., ResNet-50) on large-scale regression tasks to validate scalability claims
2. Evaluate performance under distribution shift and covariate shift conditions to assess robustness beyond i.i.d. assumptions
3. Compare calibration and efficiency against conformalized quantile regression networks on tasks with asymmetric or heteroscedastic noise to test sensitivity to noise structure
