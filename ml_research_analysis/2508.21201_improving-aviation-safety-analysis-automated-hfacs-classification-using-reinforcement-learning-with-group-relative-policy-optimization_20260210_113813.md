# Improving Aviation Safety Analysis: Automated HFACS Classification Using Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.21201
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21201
- Reference count: 40
- 350% improvement in exact match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) on HFACS classification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of classifying aviation accidents using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), a complex multi-label classification task that requires identifying multiple contributing factors from accident narratives. The authors propose a novel approach using Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B language model, incorporating a multi-component reward system and synthetic data generation to handle class imbalance. Their GRPO-optimized model achieves a 350% improvement in exact match accuracy and reaches 0.8800 partial match accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-flash on key metrics. The work demonstrates that smaller, domain-optimized models can outperform significantly larger general-purpose models on specialized tasks while enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a reinforcement learning approach using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune the Llama-3.1 8B language model for HFACS classification. The method employs a multi-component reward system that combines accuracy, coherence, and diversity metrics to optimize model performance on multi-label classification tasks. To address class imbalance in the aviation accident dataset, the researchers generated synthetic training data using GPT-5. The GRPO algorithm was specifically designed to handle the complexities of identifying multiple contributing factors from accident narratives, with the model generating chain-of-thought explanations to justify its classifications.

## Key Results
- 350% improvement in exact match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) compared to baseline models
- 0.8800 partial match accuracy achieved by the GRPO-optimized model
- Outperforms GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-flash on HFACS classification metrics
- Demonstrates superior computational efficiency suitable for edge deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The GRPO approach works by optimizing the language model through group-relative comparisons rather than absolute reward values, which helps the model learn more effectively in the multi-label classification context where multiple correct answers exist. The multi-component reward system encourages not just correct classification but also coherent reasoning and diverse coverage of contributing factors. The synthetic data generation addresses the inherent class imbalance in aviation accident reports, where certain types of human errors occur more frequently than others.

## Foundational Learning
- **HFACS Taxonomy**: Hierarchical framework for classifying human factors in aviation accidents (needed to understand classification targets)
  - Quick check: Can the model correctly identify all four levels of HFACS codes?
- **Reinforcement Learning with GRPO**: Optimization technique using group-relative comparisons for policy updates (needed for effective multi-label classification)
  - Quick check: Does the model show stable learning curves during fine-tuning?
- **Multi-Component Reward Systems**: Combining accuracy, coherence, and diversity metrics (needed to balance multiple classification objectives)
  - Quick check: Are all reward components contributing positively to final performance?
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Using GPT-5 to create balanced training examples (needed to address class imbalance)
  - Quick check: Do synthetic examples match the statistical properties of real accident narratives?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input → Llama-3.1 8B → GRPO Optimizer → Reward Calculator → Updated Model

**Critical Path:**
HFACS code generation → Reward computation (accuracy + coherence + diversity) → Policy update via GRPO → Model fine-tuning

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Smaller Llama-3.1 8B vs larger general-purpose models: better computational efficiency but potentially less general knowledge
- Synthetic data generation: addresses class imbalance but risks introducing distributional biases
- Chain-of-thought reasoning: improves interpretability but adds computational overhead

**Failure Signatures:**
- Overfitting to synthetic data patterns rather than real accident characteristics
- Reward hacking where the model maximizes rewards without meaningful classification improvements
- Class imbalance persisting despite synthetic data generation

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Ablation study comparing performance with and without synthetic data generation
2. Comparison of different reward weightings in the multi-component system
3. Testing model performance on out-of-distribution aviation accident narratives

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the internal reasoning pathways of the GRPO-optimized model be interpreted to verify that generated chain-of-thought explanations faithfully represent the decision logic?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly identify the need to "interpret and trace the model's circuits for analysing the outputs and enabling interpretability of model reasoning pathways" in future work.
- Why unresolved: While the model generates reasoning tags, RL fine-tuning can create opaque decision processes where the generated text acts as a post-hoc rationalization rather than a true indicator of model logic.
- What evidence would resolve it: Mechanistic interpretability studies (e.g., activation patching or probing) that demonstrate a causal link between specific attention heads and the prediction of distinct HFACS codes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the reliance on GPT-5-generated synthetic data for underrepresented classes introduce distributional biases that limit generalization to novel, real-world accident narratives?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper addresses class imbalance by generating synthetic narratives using GPT-5. However, it does not validate whether these synthetic examples capture the full variance of rare human errors or merely mimic the generator's style.
- Why unresolved: The use of LLMs to generate training data risks "model collapse" or circular reasoning, where the student model learns the teacher's hallucinations or stylistic quirks rather than the underlying domain reality.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative ablation study evaluating model performance on a hold-out set composed exclusively of real (non-synthetic) examples from the rare classes (AD000, PC200, PE200).

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can this specific GRPO and reward framework scale effectively to the full four-layer HFACS framework, including organizational factors typically absent in general aviation data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note their study is limited to the first two HFACS layers and suggest future work should "extend this methodology to other high-stakes domains."
- Why unresolved: The current dataset specifically excludes organizational factors because general aviation accidents rarely involve them; however, these factors are crucial for commercial aviation safety analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful training and evaluation of the GRPO model on commercial aviation datasets (e.g., large commercial carriers) where the full four-layer taxonomy is required.

## Limitations
- Limited to first two layers of HFACS taxonomy, excluding organizational factors crucial for commercial aviation
- Potential overfitting to synthetic data generation process without thorough examination of real-world generalization
- Reward system design may introduce biases based on how multi-component rewards are weighted and calibrated

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Computational efficiency gains and edge deployment suitability of the optimized Llama-3.1 8B model
- **Medium confidence**: 350% improvement in exact match accuracy and 0.8800 partial match accuracy claims, pending independent replication
- **Medium confidence**: Assertion that smaller, domain-optimized models can outperform larger general-purpose models, though this requires verification across different aviation datasets

## Next Checks
1. Independent replication of the results using a held-out test set not seen during any phase of training or fine-tuning to verify the claimed accuracy improvements
2. Ablation study removing the synthetic data generation component to assess its actual contribution to performance gains versus potential overfitting
3. Cross-dataset validation using HFACS-classified accident reports from different aviation authorities (e.g., EASA, ICAO) to test generalizability beyond the training corpus
