# Diagnosing our datasets: How does my language model learn clinical information?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.15024
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15024
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Model accuracy on clinical jargon correlates with term frequency in pretraining corpora, but clinical notes and pretraining data show significant frequency mismatch.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how open-source large language models acquire clinical knowledge from publicly available pretraining corpora. The authors evaluate model performance on clinical jargon interpretation using a new benchmark, MedLingo, and examine the frequency of relevant clinical terms in pretraining data. They find that model accuracy correlates with the frequency of clinical jargon in training corpora, but note a significant mismatch between jargon frequency in clinical notes and pretraining data. Additionally, they analyze how often disputed medical claims appear in pretraining data and how models respond to such prompts. Finally, they classify the sources of clinical information in pretraining corpora, revealing that while peer-reviewed research is the primary source, informal sources like patient forums and personal blogs also contribute. The findings highlight the need for better filtering and curation of pretraining data to ensure reliable and safe clinical applications of LLMs.

## Method Summary
The study uses WIMBD to estimate clinical term frequencies in RedPajama, Dolma, and C4 corpora, correlating these with model accuracy on clinical jargon tasks. They evaluate models using CASI dataset (59 acronyms, 147 expansions, 5887 examples) and MedLingo benchmark (100 jargon-expansion pairs from MIMIC-IV). GPT-4o serves as an LLM-as-a-judge for semantic equivalence matching with ~98% human-judge concordance. Document relevance and source classification use GPT-4o with samples of ≤500 documents per term. Zero-shot evaluation is performed on CASI, while MedLingo uses one-shot prompting. Disputed medical claims are analyzed through keyword matching and model response classification.

## Key Results
- Model accuracy on clinical jargon correlates with term frequency in pretraining corpora (Spearman ρ = 0.70 for co-occurrence, ρ = 0.81 for contextual frequency)
- Significant mismatch exists between clinical jargon frequency in clinical notes (1.35% co-occurrence) versus pretraining data (0.21%)
- Peer-reviewed research dominates pretraining sources (40-68%), but informal sources like patient forums and personal blogs also contribute
- Non-negligible portion of pretraining documents support disputed medical claims, with models generating mixed responses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that clinical LLMs learn medical terminology through exposure frequency in pretraining data, with higher co-occurrence and contextual frequencies leading to better performance. The methodology leverages corpus frequency estimation tools and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation to establish quantitative relationships between training data composition and model capabilities. The approach reveals that while formal medical sources dominate pretraining corpora, informal sources contribute significantly, potentially introducing both beneficial context and harmful misinformation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Clinical terminology acquisition**: Understanding how models learn medical jargon is essential for ensuring clinical accuracy and safety. Quick check: Compare model performance on jargon versus general vocabulary tasks.
- **Corpus frequency estimation**: Accurate measurement of term prevalence in large datasets enables correlation with model performance. Quick check: Validate WIMBD estimates against alternative frequency tools.
- **LLM-as-a-judge methodology**: Using models to evaluate other models requires careful prompt design and validation against human judgments. Quick check: Verify human-judge concordance on sampled evaluations.
- **Source classification in massive datasets**: Identifying information provenance helps understand potential biases and reliability issues. Quick check: Sample classified documents to verify accuracy.
- **Disputed claim detection**: Recognizing medical misinformation in training data is crucial for safe clinical applications. Quick check: Test classifier sensitivity to nuanced claim contexts.
- **Correlation vs. causation analysis**: Establishing relationships between training data and model behavior requires careful statistical validation. Quick check: Perform cross-validation across different model architectures.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: WIMBD frequency estimation -> Model evaluation (CASI/MedLingo) -> GPT-4o classification (relevance/source) -> Correlation analysis -> Source attribution

**Critical Path**: Term frequency estimation → Model accuracy measurement → Correlation computation → Source classification

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes breadth of analysis across multiple corpora and tasks over deep causal analysis of specific learning mechanisms. Using LLM-as-a-judge enables scalable evaluation but introduces potential circularity.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Low correlation between frequency and accuracy suggests model learning isn't primarily frequency-based
- High judge-human disagreement indicates semantic equivalence criteria need refinement
- Source classification errors reveal limitations in automated document categorization

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate WIMBD frequency estimates using alternative corpus analysis tools
2. Conduct human evaluation of a subset of model predictions to verify judge accuracy
3. Test model performance on jargon from different clinical departments to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
**Question**: To what extent does the composition of pretraining corpora reveal whether models are memorizing medical facts versus reasoning through diagnosis tasks?
**Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations and Future Work section: "future work should also examine how pretraining corpora may reveal whether models are memorizing vs. reasoning for diagnosis tasks."
**Why unresolved**: The current study relies on correlating keyword frequency with model accuracy, which does not distinguish between a model retrieving a memorized expansion and a model inferring meaning from context.
**What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments using diagnostic tasks specifically designed to separate reasoning from recall, potentially by using novel combinations of symptoms that do not appear explicitly in the training corpus.

### Open Question 2
**Question**: How can influence functions be utilized to estimate which specific inputs in pretraining corpora lead to the generation of both correct and incorrect clinical outputs?
**Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors propose "exploring how influence functions can estimate which inputs in pretraining corpora led to the generation of both correct and incorrect outputs."
**Why unresolved**: The current methodology utilizes aggregate frequency counts (via WIMBD) rather than tracing specific model outputs back to specific training documents.
**What evidence would resolve it**: A study applying influence function analysis to clinical LLMs to map specific hallucinations or correct medical interpretations directly to their source documents in datasets like Dolma or C4.

### Open Question 3
**Question**: Does the correlation between clinical jargon frequency in pretraining data and model performance generalize to clinical settings outside of the ICU?
**Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors note that their MedLingo analysis "centered on jargon from a single hospital, only from the ICU" and explicitly state that "significant future work requires expanding our analysis to additional clinical settings."
**Why unresolved**: Clinical documentation varies significantly by department and institution; findings based on MIMIC-IV ICU notes may not apply to outpatient, specialty, or radiology notes.
**What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluating models on clinical jargon datasets extracted from diverse hospital departments and non-ICU settings to see if the frequency-performance correlation holds.

### Open Question 4
**Question**: Can existing classifier-based fact-checking approaches be effectively extended to detect and filter subtle disputed medical claims in massive pretraining corpora?
**Basis in paper**: [inferred] The authors note that while conventional pipelines filter profanity or hate speech, "methods to detect subtle disputed medical claims in the pretraining corpora... remain under-explored."
**Why unresolved**: The study found that a non-negligible portion of documents support disputed claims, but focused on quantifying this presence rather than implementing or testing a scalable filtering solution.
**What evidence would resolve it**: Developing and applying classifiers to identify and prune documents containing disputed claims (e.g., regarding vaccines or alternative therapies) from corpora, and measuring the subsequent reduction in the generation of unsupported claims.

## Limitations
- Correlation analysis explains only moderate variance in model performance, suggesting other factors beyond frequency influence learning
- WIMBD frequency estimates may not capture full complexity of model learning dynamics
- Keyword-based detection of disputed claims may miss nuanced contexts
- Source classification based on sampling rather than comprehensive coverage

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The finding that there is a significant mismatch between clinical jargon frequency in clinical notes versus pretraining corpora (1.35% vs 0.21% for co-occurrence). The source classification showing peer-reviewed research as the dominant source (40-68%) is also well-supported.

**Medium Confidence**: The correlation coefficients between frequency metrics and model accuracy, as these depend on the accuracy of WIMBD frequency estimates and the specific evaluation methodology. The analysis of disputed claims responses is moderately confident but limited by keyword-based detection.

**Low Confidence**: The exact contribution of specific source types to model performance, as the paper does not establish causal links between source type and model behavior. The claim that frequency correlates with accuracy is descriptive rather than explanatory of the underlying learning mechanisms.

## Next Checks
1. **Replication with alternative frequency estimation**: Validate the frequency-accuracy correlation using a different corpus frequency estimation tool (e.g., CC-100, OSCAR) to ensure WIMBD results are not artifacts of that specific platform.
2. **Judge independence validation**: Conduct a blind human evaluation of a subset of CASI and MedLingo examples to verify that GPT-4o judge decisions align with independent human raters, checking for systematic biases in the semantic equivalence classification.
3. **Source attribution analysis**: Perform a deeper analysis of how specific source types (e.g., peer-reviewed vs. informal sources) contribute to model performance on different clinical task categories, moving beyond descriptive frequency analysis to functional impact assessment.
