# AIAuditTrack: A Framework for AI Security system

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.20649
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20649
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** A blockchain-based framework for recording AI interaction traffic and enabling governance, auditing, and risk management.

## Executive Summary
AIAuditTrack (AAT) is a blockchain-based framework designed to establish trusted identities for AI entities and record their interaction trajectories for governance, auditing, and risk management. The system leverages decentralized identities (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to create a root of trust, enabling cross-system supervision of AI interactions. AAT models AI entities as nodes in a dynamic graph, with edges representing time-specific behavioral trajectories, and implements a risk diffusion algorithm to trace risky behaviors and propagate early warnings. The framework aims to provide a scalable and verifiable solution for AI auditing, risk management, and responsibility attribution in complex multi-agent environments.

## Method Summary
AAT operates by assigning blockchain-based Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to AI entities, establishing a root of trust for verifying entity authenticity. When AI entities interact, their interactions are logged on-chain with unique Trajectory IDs, creating a directed interaction graph. The system reconstructs this graph to attribute responsibility for specific outputs and uses a risk diffusion algorithm to propagate early warnings from identified risky nodes to their interacting neighbors. The framework's performance is evaluated using blockchain Transactions Per Second (TPS), demonstrating feasibility and stability under large-scale interaction recording.

## Key Results
- Establishes trusted AI entity identities using blockchain-based DIDs and VCs
- Records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain for cross-system supervision and auditing
- Implements a risk diffusion algorithm to trace risky behaviors and propagate early warnings
- Demonstrates feasibility and stability of large-scale interaction recording via blockchain TPS evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Decentralized Identity Binding for Trust Anchoring
- **Claim:** If AI entities are assigned blockchain-based Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), the system can establish a root of trust to verify entity authenticity before recording interactions.
- **Mechanism:** The framework maps every AI entity to an on-chain address (DID). A Certificate Authority (CA) issues VCs containing metadata (model card, owner). Verification involves checking the VC hash against the on-chain registry and validating the issuer's signature.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes a trusted CA exists and that private keys for AI entities are securely managed (not leaked).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities."
  - [section 4.2]: "The VC documents is generated and submitted... `vc_hash` represents the cryptographic hash... verification of data integrity can be achieved through hash comparison."
  - [corpus]: Supports the approach; "Fortifying the Agentic Web" (arXiv:2508.12259) similarly relies on DIDs/VCs for a Zero-Trust IAM framework in agentic systems.
- **Break condition:** If the CA acts maliciously or an entity's private key is compromised, false identities can be validated.

### Mechanism 2: Trajectory Graph Reconstruction via Immutable Logging
- **Claim:** If interaction events are logged on-chain with a shared Trajectory ID, the system can reconstruct a directed interaction graph to attribute responsibility for a specific output.
- **Mechanism:** When a task initiates, a unique `TrajectoryID` is generated. As Entity A calls Entity B, both log the interaction (`<callerID, calleeIDs, TrajectoryID>`) to the blockchain. This creates a directed edge. The system queries these edges to build the topology $T=(V, E)$ for root cause analysis.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes all participating AI entities comply with logging requests and do not execute "off-chain" side effects that bypass the recorder.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing."
  - [section 3.2]: "Each AI entity's address shall maintain corresponding inbound and outbound data traffic records... cross-verified against one another."
  - [corpus]: "Zero-Knowledge Audit" (arXiv:2512.14737) highlights the trade-off here, noting that standard logging often conflicts with privacy, though AAT mitigates this via hashes.
- **Break condition:** If an interaction occurs but is not recorded (e.g., due to network failure or malicious bypass), the graph is incomplete, breaking the traceability chain.

### Mechanism 3: Risk Propagation via Diffusion Algorithm
- **Claim:** If a risky node is identified, the system can contain downstream threats by algorithmically propagating risk levels to interacting neighbors.
- **Mechanism:** The system executes `ERLdiffuse` (Algorithm 1). It identifies the risk node $V_{risk}$, locates neighbors $N(V_{risk})$ from the trajectory graph, and calculates an updated risk level (`ERL_update`). This propagates like a wave to warn other entities that may have been "infected" by the risky node's output.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes the risk level calculation (dependency on $\beta_{vi}$) accurately reflects the probability of compromise via interaction.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...a risk diffusion algorithm is proposed to trace the origin of risky behaviors and propagate early warnings..."
  - [section 3.4]: "ERLdiffuse is a diffusion process... calculated `ERL_update(N(v_i))` is usually greater than `ERL_update(N(N(v_i)))` [decays with distance]."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence in provided neighbors; "Biosecurity-Aware AI" (arXiv:2512.17146) discusses auditing risk but focuses on prompt attacks rather than diffusion algorithms.
- **Break condition:** If the propagation speed is slower than the interaction speed of the agents, warnings may arrive too late to prevent the next malicious action.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Decentralized Identifiers (DID) & Verifiable Credentials (VC)**
  - **Why needed here:** To replace simple API keys with a cryptographic, standards-based identity (W3C) that can be independently verified without a central database.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you verify an entity's "right to operate" if the CA is temporarily offline? (Answer: Yes, if the revocation list is cached or on-chain).

- **Concept: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Provenance**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how to model interactions as edges ($A \rightarrow B$) allows you to traverse history backwards (backtracking) to find the source of a failure.
  - **Quick check question:** If $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow C$, and $C$ fails, how do you determine if $A$ or $B$ is responsible? (Answer: Analyze the input/output hashes at edge $B \rightarrow C$).

- **Concept: Blockchain Throughput (TPS) vs. Latency**
  - **Why needed here:** AAT relies on recording interactions before the next step occurs. You must understand if the blockchain TPS can handle the burst rate of AI agent calls.
  - **Quick check question:** If agents interact at 50,000 requests/sec, can a chain with 1,000 TPS support this audit trail? (Answer: No, it creates a backlog).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User $\rightarrow$ AI Entity $\rightarrow$ `log_interaction` Smart Contract $\rightarrow$ Blockchain Confirmation $\rightarrow$ Off-chain Analysis Layer $\rightarrow$ Audit Layer

- **Critical path:** The **Interaction Logging Path**. User $\rightarrow$ AI Entity $\rightarrow$ `log_interaction` Smart Contract $\rightarrow$ Blockchain Confirmation. If this write fails, the audit trail is broken.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Privacy vs. Transparency:** The paper stores `vc_hash` and `interaction_hash` rather than full payloads (Section 4.2/4.3). This ensures integrity but limits the ability to audit *content* (e.g., checking for prompt injection payload content) solely via on-chain data.
  - **Performance vs. Decentralization:** Using a high-performance chain (like the Qubic example in Appendix A) is required to match high-frequency AI interactions; standard chains (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet) would likely bottleneck.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High Latency Audit:** If the graph reconstruction takes minutes, the system is only useful for *post-incident* forensics, not real-time defense.
  - **Broken Chain:** Logs show `TrajectoryID` exists for Node A, but no entry for Node B. This indicates a bypass or failed transaction.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Identity Spoof Test:** Attempt to register an entity with a forged VC signature to verify the `approve_vc` and validation logic (Expected: Rejection/Invalid).
  2. **Multi-Hop Stress Test:** Simulate a chain of 10 agent interactions ($A \rightarrow B \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow J$) at high speed. Verify if the `TrajectoryID` is consistent across all logs and if TPS holds.
  3. **Risk Diffusion Trigger:** Manually flag Node D as "High Risk" in the system. Run the `ERLdiffuse` script and check if connected Nodes C and E have their risk levels automatically updated.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) be integrated to transition the framework from reactive rule-based tracing to proactive anomaly detection?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states that AAT currently relies on interaction trajectories and rules, and suggests introducing methods like GNNs to "construct anomaly detection models" for active identification of potential risks.
- **Why unresolved:** The current risk diffusion algorithm (ERLdiffuse) is a deterministic propagation process based on existing topologies, lacking predictive capabilities for novel or unseen malicious patterns.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified AAT system incorporating a GNN layer that successfully identifies malicious agents before they trigger the standard rule-based warnings.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the real-time performance impacts and governance effectiveness when deploying AAT in large-scale, live open-source Agent systems?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state the need to "deploy AAT prototype systems in open-source Agent systems or enterprise AI platforms for large-scale experiments to evaluate their accuracy, real-time performance."
- **Why unresolved:** The current evaluation relies on simulated environments and theoretical TPS comparisons (using Qubic data) rather than empirical data from a production-level deployment.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Latency and audit accuracy metrics gathered from a live integration with a multi-agent platform handling high-concurrency user requests.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can cross-chain data merging algorithms be developed to allow the proprietary AATChain to interact with external agent alliance chains or off-chain storage?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper identifies the need to "develop cross chain data merging algorithms" to improve the business adaptability and ecological scalability of the proprietary chain.
- **Why unresolved:** The current design assumes a unified AATChain ecosystem; it does not specify mechanisms for verifying or importing interaction data from external blockchain standards or off-chain sources.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A functional bridge or interoperability protocol that allows AAT to validate Verifiable Credentials or interaction logs originating from disparate blockchain networks.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness hinges on universal adoption of the logging protocol by all AI entities, with any off-chain interactions creating gaps in the trajectory graph.
- The security model assumes a trusted Certificate Authority for issuing verifiable credentials, creating a single point of trust that could be compromised.
- The paper demonstrates blockchain TPS feasibility but does not address practical challenges of ensuring consistent on-chain presence or handling network partitions during high-frequency interactions.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core blockchain-based logging mechanism and identity verification using DIDs/VCs is well-supported by the Move contract implementation and cryptographic standards.
- **Medium Confidence:** The risk diffusion algorithm is conceptually sound but lacks detailed validation of the propagation formula's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
- **Low Confidence:** The paper does not address potential performance bottlenecks when querying historical interaction data across multiple blockchain blocks, nor does it provide concrete evidence of effectiveness against sophisticated evasion tactics.

## Next Checks

1. **CA Compromise Scenario:** Test the system's resilience by simulating a malicious Certificate Authority issuing fraudulent verifiable credentials and verify whether the validation logic can detect and reject these attempts.

2. **Network Partition Resilience:** Conduct a stress test where blockchain network congestion causes delayed transaction confirmations during high-frequency agent interactions, and measure the impact on graph reconstruction completeness.

3. **Real-World Adoption Feasibility:** Implement a pilot deployment with heterogeneous AI systems using different blockchain implementations to evaluate the practical challenges of universal DID/VC integration and the overhead of mandatory on-chain logging for high-frequency interactions.
