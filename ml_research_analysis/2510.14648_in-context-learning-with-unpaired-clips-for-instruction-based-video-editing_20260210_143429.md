# In-Context Learning with Unpaired Clips for Instruction-based Video Editing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.14648
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14648
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposes a two-stage training strategy achieving 12% improvement in editing instruction following and 15% improvement in editing quality

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of instruction-based video editing by proposing a novel two-stage training approach that reduces dependency on large paired editing datasets. The method leverages ~1M unpaired video clips for pretraining to learn basic editing concepts, followed by fine-tuning on ~150K high-quality editing pairs to enhance instruction alignment and editing quality. Built on the HunyuanVideoT2V architecture, the model uses in-context input by concatenating original and noised video tokens with timesteps set to 0 for the original content. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly less paired editing data than traditional methods.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach consists of a two-stage training strategy for instruction-based video editing. First, the model is pretrained on approximately 1 million unpaired video clips to learn fundamental editing concepts without requiring paired input-output data. This pretraining stage helps the model acquire basic editing capabilities from unlabeled video content. The second stage involves fine-tuning on approximately 150,000 high-quality editing pairs to improve instruction alignment and editing quality. The model is built on HunyuanVideoT2V and employs in-context learning by concatenating original video tokens with noised video tokens, where timesteps are set to 0 for the original content to preserve its information. This architecture allows the model to understand both the input and target editing instructions within the same context.

## Key Results
- Achieves 12% improvement in instruction following compared to existing methods
- Shows 15% improvement in editing quality metrics
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in instruction-based video editing tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from the two-stage training approach that addresses the data scarcity problem in video editing. The pretraining stage on unpaired clips allows the model to learn general editing concepts and transformations without requiring expensive paired data, building a foundation of editing capabilities. The fine-tuning stage then specializes this knowledge by aligning it with specific instructions and improving output quality using the limited paired data available. The in-context learning mechanism, which concatenates original and noised video tokens with appropriate timestep handling, enables the model to reason about the relationship between input and target outputs within a single forward pass. This design efficiently utilizes both the unpaired pretraining data and the high-quality paired data, resulting in improved instruction following and editing quality while reducing the overall data requirements.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
HunyuanVideoT2V -> Pretraining Stage (Unpaired Clips) -> Fine-tuning Stage (Paired Data) -> In-Context Input Concatenation -> Edited Video Output

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from HunyuanVideoT2V base model through the two-stage training process to the final output. The pretraining stage builds general editing capabilities, the fine-tuning stage aligns these capabilities with specific instructions, and the in-context input mechanism enables simultaneous processing of original and edited content.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The approach trades some potential fine-tuning accuracy for significantly reduced data requirements. While using only ~150K paired examples compared to millions in traditional approaches, the model maintains quality through the pretraining foundation. The in-context learning design adds computational overhead during inference but simplifies the training process by avoiding separate encoding stages.

**Failure Signatures**
Potential failures include poor generalization to editing types not well-represented in the pretraining data, degradation in instruction following when fine-tuning data quality is inconsistent, and computational bottlenecks during the in-context concatenation step. The model may also struggle with complex multi-step editing instructions that require sophisticated temporal reasoning.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Test instruction following accuracy on a held-out set of diverse editing commands to verify generalization beyond training data
2. Compare editing quality metrics with and without the pretraining stage to quantify its contribution
3. Evaluate computational efficiency during inference, particularly the impact of the in-context concatenation mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance improvements lack detailed methodological explanations for metric computation, making verification difficult
- Model's dependence on HunyuanVideoT2V raises reproducibility concerns due to undisclosed architectural modifications
- Claims about generalization to unseen editing types lack empirical support due to unspecified testing conditions

## Confidence

*High confidence*: The core methodology of using unpaired pretraining followed by fine-tuning on paired data is technically sound and aligns with established pretraining paradigms in generative modeling.

*Medium confidence*: The reported performance improvements are plausible given the training strategy, but the lack of detailed experimental methodology and metric definitions reduces confidence in the exact magnitude of these improvements.

*Low confidence*: Claims about generalization to unseen editing types and real-world applicability lack empirical support in the paper, as testing conditions and evaluation metrics are not clearly specified.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the pretraining and fine-tuning pipeline using publicly available video datasets to verify the claimed performance improvements under controlled conditions.

2. Conduct a detailed ablation study quantifying the contribution of each training stage (unpaired pretraining, paired fine-tuning) to isolate their individual impacts on instruction following and editing quality.

3. Evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set of diverse editing instructions not seen during fine-tuning to assess true generalization capabilities beyond reported metrics.
