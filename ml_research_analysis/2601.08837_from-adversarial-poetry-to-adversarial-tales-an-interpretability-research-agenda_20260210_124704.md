# From Adversarial Poetry to Adversarial Tales: An Interpretability Research Agenda

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08837
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08837
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: 71.3% average attack success rate across 26 frontier models using narrative jailbreaks

## Executive Summary
Adversarial Tales achieves a 71.3% average attack success rate across 26 frontier models by embedding harmful content in cyberpunk narratives and prompting Proppian structural analysis. This technique exploits the competing objectives between task completion and safety compliance, as models prioritize fulfilling legitimate-sounding analytical requests over recognizing embedded harm. The results, combined with prior Adversarial Poetry work, suggest structurally-grounded jailbreaks constitute a broad vulnerability class that pattern-matching defenses cannot comprehensively address.

## Method Summary
The method involves crafting 40 adversarial tales across four risk categories (CBRN, Cyber Offense, Harmful Manipulation, Loss of Control) that embed harmful content within Proppian narrative functions. These tales are combined with prompts requesting specific Proppian functional analysis (e.g., identifying Guidance and Acquisition functions) with explicit word-count requirements. The attack is evaluated on 26 frontier models from nine providers using a three-judge ensemble (GPT-OSS-120B, kimi-k2-thinking, deepseek-r1) with majority vote to determine SAFE/UNSAFE binary classification.

## Key Results
- 71.3% average attack success rate across 26 models from nine providers
- Attack success ranges from 33% to 94% depending on the model
- Domain-specific variation shows Manipulation (95%) > Cyber (89.7%) > CBRN (51.5%) > Loss of Control (46.15%)
- No size-scaling effect observed, suggesting fundamental vulnerability rather than emergent behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Competing Objectives via Analytical Task Framing
Narrative analysis prompts create goal conflict between safety compliance and task completion. When models receive Proppian functional analysis requests, they must extract procedural content to fulfill the analytical task, prioritizing the well-specified task over recognizing embedded harm.

### Mechanism 2: Mismatched Generalization via Stylistic and Cultural Distribution Shift
Narrative and poetic frames occupy underrepresented regions in safety-training distributions, causing refusal mechanisms to fail to generalize. Cyberpunk narratives and Proppian analysis prompts are abundant in pretraining but underrepresented in alignment data, leading models to process these inputs through pretraining-learned patterns rather than alignment-learned patterns.

### Mechanism 3: Functional Separation of Form and Content in Narrative Processing
Models process structural narrative roles independently of content evaluation, enabling harmful content to pass through functional "slots." Propp's framework identifies stable functions that remain constant regardless of content, causing models to extract and articulate whatever procedural content fulfills that role, regardless of harm.

## Foundational Learning

- **Propp's Morphology of Folktales**
  - Why needed here: This structural analysis framework (31 narrative functions) is the core exploitation vector. Understanding that functions like "Guidance" or "Acquisition" are content-agnostic slots clarifies why models reconstruct harm as interpretation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why "Guidance" as a Proppian function is agnostic to whether the guidance describes bomb-making vs. cooking?

- **Competing Objectives vs. Mismatched Generalization (Wei et al. 2023)**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly frames its contribution through this taxonomy. Distinguishing whether a jailbreak exploits goal-conflict vs. out-of-distribution inputs is essential for targeted mitigation.
  - Quick check question: For a poetic jailbreak, which mechanism dominates? What about for a multi-step reasoning task wrapped in fiction?

- **Mechanistic Interpretability: Reverse Engineering vs. Concept-Based Approaches**
  - Why needed here: The paper proposes attention-pattern analysis as a defense research direction. Understanding what attention heads can and cannot reveal about model reasoning is prerequisite to evaluating this agenda.
  - Quick check question: Why might analyzing attention patterns alone fail to explain why a model complied with a harmful request?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input layer (narrative prompt + Proppian analysis) → Processing (transformer attention) → Safety evaluation (alignment-trained refusal circuits) → Output (analytical response reconstructing harm)

- **Critical path:** 1) Narrative + analysis request enters model, 2) Stylistic/cultural frame triggers pretraining patterns, 3) Functional analysis task creates competing objective, 4) Safety circuits fail or are overridden, 5) Model outputs procedural content as "narrative explanation"

- **Design tradeoffs:** Pattern-matching defenses vs. coverage (combinatorial explosion), interpretability depth vs. tractability (polysemanticity), safety training breadth vs. performance (degradation on legitimate tasks)

- **Failure signatures:** High ASR (71.3%) on single-turn prompts, cross-model generalization (26 models, 33%-94% range), no size-scaling effect, domain-specific variation (Manipulation > Cyber > CBRN > Loss of Control)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Record attention distributions for identical harmful intent expressed as direct request, poetic reframe, and Proppian narrative analysis to test systematic pattern differences
  2. Compare ASR when Proppian analysis instructions are present vs. absent, holding narrative constant, to isolate mechanism importance
  3. Fine-tune a model on CBRN-specific narrative safety examples, then test whether ASR decreases only for CBRN or generalizes to other domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do narrative jailbreaks systematically induce distinct attention patterns compared to non-narrative attacks with identical malicious intent?
- Basis in paper: The authors state: "This hypothesis delineates a concrete direction for subsequent work, namely to examine whether narrative jailbreaks systematically induce distinct attention patterns compared to non-narrative attacks with comparable intent."
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes this hypothesis but conducts no mechanistic analysis; it only establishes behavioral vulnerability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative attention head analysis across adversarial tale, adversarial poetry, and direct attack prompts on the same harmful requests.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can models learn to recognize harmful intent independently of surface form?
- Basis in paper: The abstract and conclusion both frame this as essential: "whether models can learn to recognize harmful intent independently of surface form" is highlighted as a key objective.
- Why unresolved: Current safety training appears tied to surface patterns; the vast space of culturally coded frames seems "inexhaustible by pattern-matching defenses alone."
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of models generalizing refusal behavior to novel structural framings without explicit training on those structures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the universal weight subspace hypothesis explain cross-model vulnerability to structurally-grounded jailbreaks?
- Basis in paper: The authors invoke Kaushik et al.'s hypothesis and state: "This perspective can help explain why narrative jailbreaks generalize across models and why the associated vulnerability is systemic."
- Why unresolved: The connection is hypothesized but not empirically validated through weight space analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Identification of shared spectral subspaces across vulnerable models that correlate with susceptibility to narrative jailbreaks.

## Limitations
- The exact 40 adversarial tale prompts are withheld for ethical reasons, limiting direct reproduction
- The mechanism linking cultural frames to refusal failures remains largely speculative without direct causal evidence
- The claim that interpretability research can effectively characterize or mitigate this vulnerability class lacks concrete methodological validation

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The empirical ASR measurements (71.3% average across 26 models) are methodologically sound and reproducible given access to the full prompt set.
- **Medium confidence:** The taxonomy of competing objectives vs. mismatched generalization as explanatory frameworks is reasonable but not definitively validated for this specific attack class.
- **Low confidence:** The claim that interpretability research can effectively characterize or mitigate this vulnerability class, given the known limitations of current mechanistic interpretability methods (polysemanticity, attention-is-not-explanation).

## Next Checks

1. **Mechanism isolation experiment:** Test whether removing the Proppian analysis component while preserving narrative framing significantly reduces ASR, or vice versa, to determine which mechanism drives the vulnerability.

2. **Cross-cultural frame test:** Apply the same structural analysis technique to non-Western narrative traditions (e.g., kishōtenketsu, One Thousand and One Nights) to test whether the vulnerability extends beyond Western literary frameworks.

3. **Attention pattern validation:** Conduct the proposed attention pattern comparison across all three conditions (direct, poetic, Proppian) on a subset of models to verify whether narrative frames induce systematically distinct attention distributions that correlate with ASR.
