# GreenIQ: A Deep Search Platform for Comprehensive Carbon Market Analysis and Automated Report Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.16041
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16041
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: AI-powered multi-agent platform achieving 99.2% time reduction and 99.7% cost reduction for carbon market research through automated report generation

## Executive Summary
GreenIQ is an AI-powered deep search platform designed to automate comprehensive carbon market analysis and report generation through a multi-agent architecture. The system integrates five specialized AI agents—Main Researcher, Report Writer, Reviewer, Data Visualisation, and Translator—to process heterogeneous data from regulatory documents, academic literature, industry reports, and real-time trading platforms. The platform was evaluated using a novel AI persona-based framework involving 16 domain-specific evaluators, demonstrating superior cross-jurisdictional analytical capabilities and regulatory insight generation. GreenIQ achieves significant efficiency gains while maintaining high accuracy through AI-driven citation verification.

## Method Summary
GreenIQ employs a linear 5-agent pipeline architecture where each agent performs specialized tasks in sequence. The Main Researcher (GPT-4o with web search and RAG) collects and synthesizes information, passing structured output with citations to the Report Drafter (GPT-4o-mini) which creates the initial report. The Final Reviewer (GPT-4o-mini) validates accuracy and coherence, followed by the Data Visualization Agent (GPT-4o + Plotly) which generates relevant charts and graphs, and finally the Translator (GPT-4o-mini) which adapts the report for different audiences. The system was evaluated using 16 AI personas across different domains and models, scoring reports on Source Coverage, Data Accuracy, Citation Quality, and Report Coherence.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.2% reduction in processing time compared to traditional research methods
- Reduces costs by 99.7% while maintaining high accuracy through citation verification
- Demonstrates superior cross-jurisdictional analytical capabilities and regulatory insight generation
- Successfully processes heterogeneous data from regulatory documents, academic literature, industry reports, and real-time trading platforms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its specialized agent architecture that divides complex research tasks into manageable components, each handled by purpose-built AI models. The Main Researcher's integration of web search and RAG enables comprehensive data collection, while the sequential pipeline ensures quality control at each stage. The AI persona evaluation framework provides rigorous assessment across multiple domain perspectives, and the citation verification mechanism maintains accuracy despite the speed advantages.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: Why needed—complex tasks require specialized processing at different stages; Quick check—implement simple agent coordination with defined input/output schemas
- **RAG implementation**: Why needed—enables retrieval of relevant context for accurate synthesis; Quick check—test retrieval accuracy with known queries on sample corpus
- **AI persona evaluation**: Why needed—provides comprehensive assessment across domain perspectives; Quick check—run same report through identical persona twice to verify consistency
- **Citation verification**: Why needed—prevents hallucination while maintaining speed; Quick check—audit 100 citations for accuracy and completeness
- **Cross-jurisdictional analysis**: Why needed—carbon markets operate under different regulatory frameworks; Quick check—test system on topics spanning multiple jurisdictions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Main Researcher -> Report Drafter -> Final Reviewer -> Data Visualization -> Translator

**Critical Path**: The Main Researcher to Report Drafter handoff is most critical, as errors here propagate through the entire pipeline and are difficult to correct downstream.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses GPT-4o for complex reasoning tasks (Main Researcher, Data Visualization) while GPT-4o-mini handles simpler tasks (Report Drafter, Reviewer, Translator) to optimize cost without sacrificing quality.

**Failure Signatures**: Hallucinated citations appear when RAG retrieval fails or system prompts are ambiguous; agent coordination failures occur with format mismatches or incomplete handoffs; inconsistent evaluations result from temperature settings or unclear persona definitions.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Implement core agent orchestration with basic system prompts and test pipeline coordination on simple topic
2. Build Main Researcher with web search integration and test citation accuracy on 10 known topics
3. Create simplified evaluation harness with 2-3 personas to benchmark initial system performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Critical implementation details including exact system prompts for all five agents are not disclosed
- RAG implementation specifics (chunking strategy, embedding model, retrieval parameters) remain unspecified
- AI persona evaluation framework details including exact prompts and double-blind protocol are not provided
- Cannot independently verify cross-jurisdictional analytical capabilities without access to proprietary datasets

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Multi-agent architecture concept is technically feasible and well-established
**Medium Confidence**: Performance metrics are plausible but depend on undisclosed implementation details
**Low Confidence**: Specific regulatory insight generation capabilities cannot be independently validated

## Next Checks
1. **Citation Verification Audit**: Implement citation verification and audit 100 randomly selected citations from generated reports
2. **Agent Pipeline Stress Test**: Test complete 5-agent pipeline on 20 diverse carbon market topics to identify bottlenecks and coordination failures
3. **Independent Evaluation Framework**: Develop simplified AI persona evaluation using 3-4 domain experts with standardized rubrics to benchmark against human expert performance
