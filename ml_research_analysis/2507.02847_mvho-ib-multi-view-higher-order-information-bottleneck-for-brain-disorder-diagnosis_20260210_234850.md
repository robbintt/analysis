# MvHo-IB: Multi-View Higher-Order Information Bottleneck for Brain Disorder Diagnosis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.02847
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02847
- Authors: Kunyu Zhang; Qiang Li; Shujian Yu
- Reference count: 36
- One-line primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on three fMRI benchmark datasets by integrating pairwise and higher-order brain interactions via O-information.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework for diagnosing mental disorders from fMRI data. The method uniquely integrates both pairwise and higher-order brain interactions using O-information, capturing synergistic and redundant patterns beyond conventional functional connectivity. By combining a GIN encoder for pairwise interactions with a Brain3DCNN for O-information-based higher-order interactions, fused under a multi-view information bottleneck, the framework achieves superior classification performance on three benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
MvHo-IB is a multi-view learning framework that addresses the limitations of conventional functional connectivity (FC) by incorporating both pairwise and higher-order brain interactions. The framework uses O-information to capture synergistic and redundant patterns among brain regions. It integrates a GIN encoder for modeling pairwise interactions and a Brain3DCNN for higher-order interactions, all fused under a multi-view information bottleneck. The method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets (UCLA, ADNI, EOEC) and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to eight baseline methods, including hypergraph-based and graph neural network models.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on UCLA, ADNI, and EOEC datasets.
- Significantly outperforms eight baseline methods, including hypergraph-based and graph neural network models.
- Grad-CAM visualizations confirm interpretable, clinically plausible brain-region interactions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from its ability to capture both pairwise and higher-order brain interactions, which are critical for understanding complex mental disorders. By using O-information, MvHo-IB goes beyond traditional FC to model synergistic and redundant patterns, providing a more comprehensive representation of brain dynamics. The integration of GIN and Brain3DCNN under a multi-view information bottleneck allows for effective fusion of different interaction types, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Functional Connectivity (FC)**: Measures linear correlations between brain regions; needed to establish baseline interaction patterns. Quick check: Verify FC matrices capture known functional networks.
- **O-information**: Quantifies synergistic and redundant interactions among brain regions; needed to model higher-order dependencies. Quick check: Confirm O-information values align with expected synergistic/redundant patterns.
- **GIN (Graph Isomorphism Network)**: Encodes graph-structured data; needed to model pairwise brain interactions. Quick check: Validate GIN output preserves graph isomorphism.
- **Brain3DCNN**: Processes 3D spatial data; needed to extract features from O-information maps. Quick check: Ensure 3D convolutions capture spatial hierarchies.
- **Multi-View Information Bottleneck**: Regularizes multi-view learning; needed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Quick check: Monitor mutual information between views and labels.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: fMRI data -> Preprocessing -> Pairwise GIN -> Higher-order Brain3DCNN -> Fusion -> Classification
- **Critical Path**: fMRI preprocessing -> GIN encoding -> O-information computation -> Brain3DCNN processing -> Multi-view fusion -> Classification
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing pairwise vs. higher-order interaction modeling; computational complexity vs. model performance.
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on noisy data; overfitting due to complex interaction modeling.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Validate FC and O-information computation on synthetic brain networks.
  2. Test GIN and Brain3DCNN modules separately on controlled datasets.
  3. Evaluate multi-view fusion with synthetic multi-view data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The claim of state-of-the-art performance is supported by comparisons with eight baseline methods, though the diversity and recency of these baselines could be expanded to strengthen generalizability claims.
- The integration of pairwise and higher-order interactions via O-information is innovative, but the computational complexity and scalability to larger cohorts remain untested.
- The interpretability through Grad-CAM is promising, yet the clinical validation of these biomarkers is not demonstrated, limiting the framework's immediate applicability in real-world diagnostics.

## Confidence
- **Classification Performance**: High
- **Clinical Utility**: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional, larger datasets to assess scalability and generalizability.
2. Conduct cross-dataset validation to evaluate robustness across different acquisition protocols.
3. Perform a detailed ablation study to quantify the individual contributions of pairwise and higher-order interaction modules.
