# TComQA: Extracting Temporal Commonsense from Text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.15274
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15274
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Automated pipeline extracts temporal commonsense with >80% precision from text using LLM-based question-answer generation

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of extracting temporal commonsense from text, which is crucial for understanding events but often not explicitly stated. The authors propose an automated pipeline leveraging large language models (LLMs) to mine temporal commonsense properties like duration, frequency, and typical time. The approach involves generating relevant questions for specific temporal properties and using LLMs to extract corresponding answers from context. They construct TComQA, a dataset derived from SAMSum and RealNews corpora, which achieves over 80% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model trained with TComQA outperforms existing approaches on temporal question-answering tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of their method.

## Method Summary
The method uses a three-stage pipeline to extract temporal commonsense from short text. First, a T5 model fine-tuned on MCTACO generates property-conditioned questions (duration, frequency, typical time, stationary, event order) from input contexts. Second, a two-stage validation filters questions using lexical overlap/temporal markers and semantic similarity. Finally, a Llama2 decoder generates variable-length answers conditioned on the context, question, and property type. The approach is validated on SAMSum and RealNews corpora, producing the TComQA dataset with over 17K high-precision QA pairs.

## Key Results
- TComQA dataset achieves >80% precision in extracting temporal commonsense from short text
- Llama2-based generative answer model outperforms encoder-based alternatives (BERT, NumBERT) with 84% precision
- Model trained on TComQA shows improved performance on temporal question-answering tasks compared to existing approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuning T5 on MCTACO enables property-conditioned question generation that targets specific temporal commonsense types. The model learns to surface events and frame questions whose answers require commonsense reasoning rather than literal extraction, conditioned on explicit temporal property labels.

### Mechanism 2
Two-stage validation using lexical overlap and semantic similarity effectively filters questions that do not require commonsense reasoning. Questions must pass both a lexical validator (temporal markers + token overlap) and a semantic validator (phrase embedding similarity threshold) to be retained.

### Mechanism 3
Decoder-based answer generation with Llama2 captures temporal commonsense more effectively than encoder-based MASK prediction due to dynamic output length. The Llama2 decoder generates variable-length answers conditioned on (context, question, temporal_property), leveraging both parametric knowledge and contextual inference.

## Foundational Learning

- **Temporal Commonsense Taxonomy (five types)**: Understanding duration, frequency, typical time, stationary, and event order is prerequisite to debugging question quality per property. *Quick check: Given "She checked her phone during the meeting," what temporal property does "How long did the meeting last?" target?*

- **Text-to-Text (Seq2Seq) Fine-Tuning with T5**: Question generation uses T5 conditioned on context and property labels; understanding input formatting and teacher forcing is essential. *Quick check: How would you format a training example for T5 given context "Emma will be home soon" and property "typical time"?*

- **Embedding-Based Semantic Similarity Validation**: The semantic validator uses cosine similarity over phrase embeddings; threshold selection directly controls precision-recall tradeoffs. *Quick check: If V_s precision is 91.9% but recall is 69.5% at θ=0.5, what happens if you lower θ to 0.4?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (short context + temporal property) → Question Generator (T5-large, fine-tuned on MCTACO) → Validators (V_l: lexical marker + token overlap; V_s: phrase embedding similarity ≥θ) → Answer Generator (Llama2-7B, fine-tuned on MCTACO then TComQA) → Output (QA pair with temporal property label)

- **Critical path**: Question validity filtering. Invalid questions pass nonsensical or literal-extraction prompts to the answer generator, introducing label noise that degrades downstream QA performance.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Encoder vs. decoder for answer generation (encoder forces fixed-length outputs; decoder allows dynamic length but requires careful generation truncation); semantic threshold θ (higher values increase precision but reduce recall); validator choice (V_l aligns better with human judgment than V_s alone; combining both may over-constrain).

- **Failure signatures**: Low semantic similarity (SS < 0.5) between generated questions and ground truth despite manual validity; high answer variability across runs for properties like "typical time"; missing temporal markers in generated questions (breaks V_l).

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Validator alignment check**: Sample 200 contexts from target corpus, run V_l and V_s at θ∈{0.5, 0.6, 0.7}, compare against human majority-vote labels to confirm which validator best matches ground truth.
  2. **Answer generation ablation**: Compare BERT, NumBERT, and Llama2 on 150 held-out MCTACO QA pairs; measure both semantic similarity (SS) and domain expert (DE) precision to quantify encoder vs. decoder gap.
  3. **Downstream QA transfer**: Fine-tune Llama2 on TComQA, evaluate on MCTACO test set; compare SS and DE against baseline Llama2 fine-tuned only on MCTACO to validate TComQA's incremental value.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the lexical and semantic validators be optimized or combined to better align with human assessments of question validity? The paper notes that the lexical validator achieves higher recall (85.6%) while the semantic validator offers higher precision (91.9%), but does not explore hybrid approaches or fine-tuning the semantic threshold θ to capture the strengths of both methods.

### Open Question 2
Can an automated evaluation metric be developed that accurately captures the correctness of temporal answers better than semantic similarity? The authors note that semantic similarity (SS) "does not directly reflect the preciseness of the model on correct answer generation" because valid temporal answers often have different surface forms, and rely on human domain experts to verify precision.

### Open Question 3
Does the extraction pipeline maintain high precision when applied to long-form contexts rather than the short texts (avg. 20 tokens) currently evaluated? The paper specifies the method is designed for "short text" and does not test extraction from longer narratives where resolving dependencies across multiple sentences may introduce additional complexity.

## Limitations

- **Temporal commonsense generalization gap**: The paper does not report precision on held-out real-world contexts, creating uncertainty about real-world applicability beyond the SAMSum and RealNews corpora used for TComQA generation.
- **Property-specific performance variance**: Aggregate metrics are reported without breaking down precision per temporal property type, making it unclear whether all five types (duration, frequency, typical time, stationary, event order) perform equally well.
- **Temporal marker dependency**: The lexical validator's reliance on explicit temporal markers may systematically exclude valid questions with implicit temporal reasoning, creating bias toward marker-heavy questions.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The two-stage validation mechanism is well-specified with measurable precision/recall metrics (V_l: 89.7% precision, 85.6% recall; V_s: 91.9% precision, 69.5% recall); decoder-based answer generation superiority is empirically supported.
- **Medium confidence**: Pipeline's ability to generalize from MCTACO to SAMSum/RealNews contexts is plausible but not directly validated; claim that TComQA outperforms existing approaches is based on internal metrics rather than direct comparison with published baselines.
- **Low confidence**: Assertion that LLMs encode sufficient temporal commonsense for answer generation lacks direct evidence; success of Llama2-7B fine-tuning on TComQA is reported without ablation studies showing how much performance gain comes from MCTACO pre-training versus TComQA fine-tuning.

## Next Checks

1. **Property-specific precision audit**: Run the full TComQA pipeline on 200 held-out contexts from SAMSum and RealNews, manually validate each QA pair per temporal property type, and report precision disaggregated by duration, frequency, typical time, stationary, and event order.

2. **Temporal marker ablation study**: Remove the lexical validator entirely and run TComQA generation on SAMSum with only the semantic validator (θ=0.5); compare resulting dataset size, precision, and downstream QA performance to assess marker dependency.

3. **Real-world transfer evaluation**: Fine-tune Llama2 on TComQA, then evaluate on a temporal QA benchmark not used in training (e.g., TORQUE or TimeDial) to measure actual generalization performance rather than internal semantic similarity metrics.
