# AgriEval: A Comprehensive Chinese Agricultural Benchmark for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.21773
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21773
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: First comprehensive Chinese agricultural benchmark for LLMs; best model achieves 63.21% accuracy vs human experts at 70.62%

## Executive Summary
AgriEval is the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in real-world farming scenarios. It features 14,697 multiple-choice and 2,167 open-ended questions across 29 subcategories and 15 cognitive task dimensions, covering domains such as crop science, aquaculture, and forestry. We assess 51 open-source and commercial LLMs under zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, with RAG-based external knowledge integration. Results show that even the best model achieves only 63.21% accuracy, significantly below expert human performance of 70.62%. LLMs struggle particularly with numerical reasoning and multi-step inference tasks. External knowledge and instruction tuning consistently improve performance, while positional bias in answer selection remains a notable limitation.

## Method Summary
AgriEval provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for Chinese agricultural LLMs using 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167 open-ended Q&A across 29 subcategories and 15 cognitive dimensions. The benchmark supports zero-shot, few-shot (5-shot), and chain-of-thought prompting strategies, with RAG integration using Chinese Wikipedia and instruction-tuned models. Evaluation uses exact-match accuracy for multiple-choice and ROUGE-L for open-ended generation, with results aggregated over three independent runs. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/PaperHarvester/AgriEval with detailed implementation guidance in the paper.

## Key Results
- Best model achieves 63.21% accuracy, significantly below expert human baseline of 70.62%
- External knowledge (RAG) provides ~4% average accuracy gains, especially for smaller models
- Instruction tuning delivers consistent 10.60% performance improvements across all question types
- Positional bias causes ~6.95% accuracy drop when answer positions are shuffled
- CoT prompting helps numerical reasoning (+9.81%) but hurts factual recall (overall -3.51%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can partially compensate for limited agricultural knowledge in smaller models, yielding ~4% average accuracy gains.
- Mechanism: External knowledge retrieval from Chinese Wikipedia provides domain-specific facts that open-domain LLMs lack during pre-training, grounding responses in verified agricultural information.
- Core assumption: The retrieval corpus contains relevant agricultural knowledge that aligns with benchmark questions; retrieval quality determines integration effectiveness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RAG-based external knowledge integration... results show that external knowledge and instruction tuning consistently improve performance"
  - [section 4.4] "RAG consistently improves accuracy, with an average gain of approximately 4.0%. Notably, smaller models benefit the most, suggesting that external knowledge can partially compensate for limited model capacity"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support—related papers focus on NER and general Chinese benchmarks, not RAG in agriculture specifically
- Break condition: Retrieval corpus lacks coverage of specialized subdomains (e.g., traditional Chinese herbology, tea science) or retrieval quality degrades for domain-specific terminology.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Instruction tuning provides consistent performance improvements (~10.60% average gain) across agricultural tasks by enhancing instruction-following and response quality.
- Mechanism: Supervised fine-tuning on instruction-response pairs improves the model's ability to parse task requirements and generate structured outputs aligned with benchmark formats.
- Core assumption: The instruction-tuning data distribution generalizes to agricultural question formats without catastrophic forgetting of general capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "Instruction-tuned models consistently outperform their base counterparts, with an average accuracy gain of 10.60%"
  - [section 4.3] "The performance gain is observed consistently across all question types, indicating stronger robustness in handling diverse task formats"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for instruction tuning in agricultural LLMs; assumption extrapolates from general domain findings
- Break condition: Instruction-tuning data lacks agricultural domain coverage, or tuning overfits to specific prompt formats not represented in benchmark.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Positional bias in multiple-choice selection causes systematic underperformance when correct answers appear in later positions (D–G), with ~6.95% accuracy drop under shuffling.
- Mechanism: LLMs exhibit attention-weight heuristics that favor earlier tokens, leading to selection shortcuts rather than semantic reasoning over all options.
- Core assumption: Positional bias is a training artifact, not an intrinsic architectural constraint; it can be mitigated through permutation augmentation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Positional bias in answer selection remains a notable limitation"
  - [section 4.4] "Shuffling leads to an average 6.95% accuracy drop... predictions skewed toward earlier options, while ground-truth answers are more evenly distributed"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence specifically for agricultural benchmarks; aligns with general LLM positional bias literature
- Break condition: Models trained with permutation-invariant objectives would not exhibit this bias; the effect may vary across architectures.

## Foundational Learning

- **Bloom's Taxonomy for Cognitive Classification**
  - Why needed here: AgriEval organizes tasks into Memorization, Understanding, Inference, and Generation—directly derived from Bloom's framework to assess knowledge breadth and reasoning depth.
  - Quick check question: Can you map "disease diagnosis based on leaf symptoms" to the correct cognitive level? (Answer: Inference)

- **Domain Adaptation vs. General-Purpose Pre-training**
  - Why needed here: The benchmark reveals that general LLMs achieve only ~41% average accuracy, highlighting the gap between open-domain knowledge and specialized agricultural expertise.
  - Quick check question: Why does a 72B-parameter model still underperform human experts on agricultural inference tasks? (Answer: Lack of domain-specific pre-training data and grounding)

- **Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy vs. ROUGE-L**
  - Why needed here: Multiple-choice questions use exact-match accuracy; open-ended generation tasks use ROUGE-L to measure lexical overlap with reference answers.
  - Quick check question: What limitation does ROUGE-L have for evaluating agricultural knowledge generation? (Answer: Fails to capture semantic equivalence when models produce lexically diverse but correct responses)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Dataset: 14,697 MC questions + 2,167 Q&A across 29 subcategories, 15 cognitive dimensions
  - Evaluation pipeline: Zero-shot, few-shot (5-shot), CoT prompting
  - Enhancement layer: RAG with Chinese Wikipedia, instruction tuning
  - Analysis layer: Positional bias testing, error categorization (knowledge/understanding/reasoning)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Data collection from university exams → expert annotation with 90%+ consistency
  2. Difficulty enhancement via GPT-4 distractor generation
  3. Model inference across 51 LLMs under multiple prompting strategies
  4. Performance analysis by cognitive level, domain, and failure mode

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Zero-shot vs. few-shot: Few-shot shows inconsistent gains due to demonstration sensitivity
  - CoT prompting: Helps numerical reasoning (+9.81%) but hurts factual recall (overall -3.51%)
  - RAG vs. larger models: RAG helps smaller models more; scaling shows diminishing returns beyond 14B

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Knowledge gaps: 83% of errors from missing domain-specific information (agronomy, aquaculture, forestry)
  - Reasoning errors: Incorrect formulas or intermediate values in numerical tasks despite CoT
  - Positional bias: Models select earlier options disproportionately; shuffling reveals 6.95% drop

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Establish baseline with zero-shot evaluation on a 1,000-sample subset across all cognitive levels.
  2. Test RAG integration using a domain-specific corpus (e.g., agricultural extension documents) to compare against Wikipedia-only retrieval.
  3. Conduct positional debiasing via permutation augmentation during evaluation to quantify true semantic reasoning capability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. Does dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) selection based on task type improve agricultural LLM performance compared to static prompting?
   - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4 notes that CoT helps inference but hinders factual tasks, suggesting future strategies may benefit from "dynamic CoT selection mechanisms based on task type."
   - Why unresolved: The paper identifies a trade-off where CoT aids numerical reasoning but degrades performance on memorization tasks, yet experiments only applied static prompting strategies across all question types.
   - What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing static prompting against a dynamic system that activates CoT only for "Inference" tasks (e.g., Numerical Reasoning) while using Zero-Shot for "Memorization" tasks.

2. Can training strategies such as permutation augmentation mitigate the strong positional bias LLMs exhibit in agricultural multiple-choice tasks?
   - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4 reports a "strong bias toward earlier options" and explicitly calls for "position-robust evaluation and training strategies, such as permutation augmentation."
   - Why unresolved: While the analysis quantifies the bias (shuffling causes a 6.95% accuracy drop), the authors do not experiment with training interventions to correct this heuristic reliance.
   - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments fine-tuning agricultural LLMs on datasets where option orders are randomly shuffled during training, followed by evaluation on AgriEval's shuffled test sets.

3. Do LLM-based evaluators correlate better with human expert judgment than ROUGE-L for assessing open-ended agricultural generation tasks?
   - Basis in paper: [inferred] Section G (Limitations) states that ROUGE-L "may fail to fully capture LLMs' true performance" because models often produce "semantically correct but lexically diverse responses."
   - Why unresolved: The paper relies on ROUGE-L for generation tasks despite acknowledging its limitations in capturing semantic accuracy in specialized domains.
   - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative correlation analysis between human expert scores, ROUGE-L scores, and LLM-based evaluation scores (e.g., GPT-4 as a judge) on AgriEval's "Generation" subset.

## Limitations
- External knowledge integration (RAG) lacks transparent implementation details and domain-specific corpus coverage
- Instruction-tuning improvements rely on unspecified data distributions that may not generalize to all agricultural subdomains
- ROUGE-L metric may fail to capture semantic equivalence when models produce lexically diverse but correct responses

## Confidence
**High Confidence**:
- AgriEval is the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural benchmark for LLMs
- Even the best model achieves only 63.21% accuracy, significantly below expert human performance of 70.62%
- External knowledge and instruction tuning consistently improve performance across models
- Positional bias in answer selection remains a notable limitation

**Medium Confidence**:
- RAG can partially compensate for limited agricultural knowledge in smaller models, yielding ~4% average accuracy gains
- Instruction tuning provides consistent performance improvements (~10.60% average gain) across agricultural tasks
- CoT prompting helps numerical reasoning (+9.81%) but hurts factual recall (overall -3.51%)

**Low Confidence**:
- Retrieval quality determines integration effectiveness for all agricultural subdomains
- Instruction-tuning data distribution generalizes to agricultural question formats without catastrophic forgetting
- Positional bias is a training artifact that can be mitigated through permutation augmentation

## Next Checks
1. **RAG Implementation Verification**: Replicate the RAG integration using transparent retriever architecture, embedding model specifications, and retrieval quality metrics to verify the ~4% average accuracy gain claim across different agricultural subdomains.

2. **Instruction-Tuning Data Analysis**: Obtain or reconstruct the instruction-tuning dataset to assess its coverage of agricultural domains and evaluate whether the 10.60% average performance gain holds across different cognitive task dimensions.

3. **Positional Bias Architecture Study**: Test positional debiasing across multiple model architectures (including models trained with permutation-invariant objectives) to determine whether the observed 6.95% accuracy drop from shuffling is an intrinsic architectural constraint or a training artifact.
