# EddyFormer: Accelerated Neural Simulations of Three-Dimensional Turbulence at Scale

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24173
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24173
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves DNS-level accuracy in 3D turbulence simulation at 256³ resolution while running 30× faster than direct numerical simulation

## Executive Summary
EddyFormer introduces a spectral-element Transformer architecture that achieves DNS-level accuracy in simulating three-dimensional turbulence at 256³ resolution while running 30× faster than direct numerical simulation. The model decomposes flow fields into grid-scale and subgrid-scale components using spectral/hp element methods, enabling efficient capture of both local and global features through complementary LES and SGS streams. When tested on unseen domains up to four times larger than training data, EddyFormer maintains accuracy on physics-invariant metrics including energy spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions.

## Method Summary
EddyFormer uses spectral/hp element (SEM) methods to represent turbulent flow fields, decomposing them into large-eddy simulation (LES) and subgrid-scale (SGS) components. The architecture employs a dual-stream Transformer design: an LES stream with self-attention across elements for global structure capture, and an SGS stream with localized convolution for fine-scale dynamics. This tokenization approach reduces sequence length from O(N³M³) mesh points to O(N³) SEM tokens while preserving spectral accuracy. The model achieves 30× acceleration over DNS while maintaining DNS-level accuracy on energy spectra, structure functions, and correlation functions.

## Key Results
- Achieves DNS-level accuracy in 3D isotropic turbulence (Re94) with 8.6% error vs 22.5% for F-FNO at 256³ resolution
- Maintains accuracy on physics-invariant metrics (energy spectra, correlation functions, structure functions) when tested on domains 4× larger than training data
- Outperforms state-of-the-art ML models on The Well benchmark suite across magnetohydrodynamics, shear layers, and buoyancy-driven turbulence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: LES-SGS Scale Decomposition
Separating flow into grid-scale and subgrid-scale components enables specialized processing of distinct physical regimes. A spectral cutoff filter splits SEM coefficients into filtered LES coefficients (global structures) and residual SGS coefficients (local eddy dynamics). The LES stream models coherent structures via attention; the SGS stream models local interactions via convolution. This decomposition leverages Kolmogorov's similarity hypothesis that small-scale turbulence statistics have universal form independent of large-scale structures.

### Mechanism 2: SEM Tokenization for Tractable Attention
Spectral-element representation reduces sequence length from O(N³M³) mesh points to O(N³) SEM tokens, making attention scalable while preserving spectral accuracy. The domain is partitioned into H = N³ elements, each with M³ spectral modes. Each element becomes a single "SEM token" for attention, while spectral expansions within elements capture fine-scale physics. This approach combines local spectral expressiveness with compact sequence length for efficient attention computation.

### Mechanism 3: Information Asymmetry via Turbulence Cascade Physics
Feeding LES features into the SGS stream improves accuracy, but the reverse is unnecessary due to energy cascade directionality. The SGS stream receives a weighted sum of LES features, reflecting physical reality that large eddies drive small-eddy behavior through energy transfer while small scales primarily dissipate energy. This unidirectional information flow is justified by the turbulence cascade and validated through ablation studies showing LES features improve SGS predictions but not vice versa.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) and filtering
  - Why needed here: EddyFormer directly operationalizes LES concepts—understanding why we filter Navier-Stokes equations and model subgrid stress is essential to grasp the dual-stream design.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the filtered momentum equation is unclosed and requires SGS modeling?

- Concept: Spectral/hp Element Methods
  - Why needed here: The SEM basis determines how fields are represented and how SEMConv quadrature works.
  - Quick check question: Why must the spectral basis be modified for C⁰-continuity across element boundaries, and how do boundary modes achieve this?

- Concept: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)
  - Why needed here: EddyFormer uses coordinate-based rotation for positional encoding in SEMAttn; understanding rotation properties clarifies translational invariance guarantees.
  - Quick check question: How does the rotation in Eqn. (12) encode position while preserving the ability to compare query-key similarities across different spatial locations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input velocity field → SEM interpolation → expansion coefficients → spectral cutoff → LES stream (SEMAttn) + SGS stream (SEMConv) → weighted sum → output reconstruction

- Critical path: SEM interpolation quality (~0.1% error on Re94) → LES filter size k_max=5 (optimal; saturation beyond due to LES stream capacity) → convolution kernel size s=π/4 (small value usually expressive enough) → model size 2.3M parameters

- Design tradeoffs: Chebyshev vs. Legendre basis show comparable performance; model size vs. resolution: 2.3M params achieves 8.6% error vs. F-FNO's 22.5% with 1.7M params; hybrid (learned correction) vs. pure ML: learned correction from 96³ coarse DNS provides better initialization but requires numerical solver at inference

- Failure signatures: Energy dissipation over long rollouts (F-FNO shows systematic energy loss; EddyFormer conserves energy); non-physical convergence (on Rayleigh-Taylor instability, baseline FNO produces divergent solutions; EddyFormer maintains stable plume structures); domain overfitting (F-FNO energy spectra deviate on 4× larger domains, indicating failure to generalize beyond training domain size)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce one-step prediction on Re94: Train EddyFormer (Legendre basis, 8³ elements, 13³ modes, k_max=5) using one-step L² loss for 15k steps; target ~8.5% test error. Compare against F-FNO baseline with identical training budget.
  2. Ablate LES-SGS information flow: Implement EF(LES-only) and EF(SGS-only) variants; verify ~12.6% and ~23.2% errors respectively, confirming complementary role of both streams.
  3. Test domain generalization on KF4: Train on 2π×2π domain, evaluate on 4π×4π domain with 16×16 attention window masking; verify energy spectra match reference DNS across all wavenumbers while F-FNO baseline shows high-frequency deviation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Extending EddyFormer to handle general domains and complex geometries is left unexplored and is a target for future work.
- Scaling to extreme-scale turbulence at high Reynolds numbers is particularly challenging and remains an open question.
- Application to real-world turbulent flows in near-wall regions with fine features is left unexplored.

## Limitations
- Limited testing on extreme domain scaling beyond 4× training domain size
- No evaluation on varying Reynolds numbers or Reynolds number transfer
- Lack of long-term stability analysis over thousands of timesteps
- Physical interpretability of learned coefficients (k_max=5) remains empirical

## Confidence

High Confidence (★★★): DNS-level accuracy claims for 3D turbulence (Re94) and 2D Kolmogorov flow, validated through energy spectra, structure functions, and Q-criterion comparisons with reference DNS.

Medium Confidence (★★☆): Performance claims on The Well benchmark suite, where EddyFormer outperforms FNO and F-FNO on VRMSE metrics across diverse flow types, though specific numerical values show significant variation by case.

Low Confidence (★☆☆): Claims about computational acceleration (30× faster) lack clear definition of the baseline DNS configuration and hardware specifications used for comparison.

## Next Checks

1. **Extreme Domain Scaling Test**: Train EddyFormer on Re94 turbulence at 96³, then evaluate on domains 8× and 16× larger (768³ and 1536³) while monitoring energy spectrum fidelity and computational scaling.

2. **Reynolds Number Transfer Experiment**: Train a single EddyFormer model on a distribution of Reynolds numbers (Re68, Re94, Re180) and evaluate performance on held-out Re values to quantify Re generalization capability.

3. **Long-term Statistical Convergence Analysis**: Run EddyFormer for 10,000 timesteps on Re94 turbulence, computing time-averaged energy spectra, dissipation rates, and velocity derivative statistics to verify maintenance of physical fidelity over extended simulations.
