# DatasetResearch: Benchmarking Agent Systems for Demand-Driven Dataset Discovery

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.06960
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06960
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: AI agents achieve only 22% score on DatasetResearch-pro, revealing fundamental limitations in handling dataset discovery demands outside existing distributions

## Executive Summary
DatasetResearch introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets based on specific user demands. The benchmark consists of 208 real-world dataset requirements across six NLP tasks, categorized into knowledge-based and reasoning-based demands. The evaluation framework assesses agents through metadata alignment and downstream task performance using few-shot learning and fine-tuning. Experiments reveal a clear performance dichotomy: search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth, while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured generation. However, all current methods catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing distributions, highlighting fundamental limitations in generalization.

## Method Summary
DatasetResearch evaluates AI agents tasked with discovering or synthesizing datasets to meet specific natural language demands. The benchmark includes 208 real-world requirements from HuggingFace (91) and PapersWithCode (117), split across six NLP tasks. Agents are categorized as search (querying existing datasets), synthesis (generating data), or deep research (combining tools). Evaluation uses a tri-dimensional approach: metadata similarity scored 0-10 across six dimensions using OpenAI o3 as judge, few-shot learning performance with LLaMA-3.1-8B, and fine-tuning on discovered data evaluated against reference sets. The challenging DatasetResearch-pro subset contains 20 tasks that expose agents' limitations with out-of-distribution demands.

## Key Results
- Search agents outperform synthesis agents on knowledge-based tasks (average score 43.75 vs 39.81) due to retrieval breadth
- Synthesis agents dominate reasoning-based tasks (average score 60.72 vs 50.29) through structured generation capabilities
- All methods fail catastrophically on "corner cases" outside training distributions, achieving scores near baseline
- Advanced deep research systems achieve only 22% score on the challenging DatasetResearch-pro subset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning

**Demand-driven dataset discovery**: The process of finding or creating datasets that precisely match specific user requirements expressed in natural language. *Why needed*: Enables targeted dataset creation for niche research areas. *Quick check*: Can the agent correctly interpret "news sentiment analysis" vs "customer service dialogue" as distinct requirements?

**Metadata alignment evaluation**: Scoring discovered datasets across six dimensions (e.g., output format, task type) against reference metadata. *Why needed*: Ensures discovered datasets match both content and structural requirements. *Quick check*: Does the agent's output metadata match the reference dataset's instruction format and output schema?

**Corner case identification**: Detecting dataset demands that fall outside existing data distributions or require domain-specific knowledge. *Why needed*: Reveals fundamental limitations in current AI agents' generalization capabilities. *Quick check*: Are all methods scoring near baseline on specific tasks, indicating inability to handle niche domains?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: User Demand → Agent Type (Search/Synthesis/Deep Research) → Dataset Discovery → Metadata Evaluation → Downstream Task Evaluation (Few-shot/Fine-tuning)

**Critical path**: The most critical evaluation component is metadata alignment using OpenAI o3 judge, as it directly measures whether discovered datasets match the semantic and structural requirements of the demand.

**Design tradeoffs**: Search agents trade depth for breadth (finding relevant but potentially imperfect matches), while synthesis agents trade retrieval accuracy for generation flexibility (creating perfect matches but requiring strong generation capabilities).

**Failure signatures**: Corner case tasks where all methods score near baseline indicate tasks requiring domain knowledge outside pre-training data; search agents failing metadata alignment on instruction format suggests insufficient filtering criteria.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Run metadata evaluation pipeline on a single task to verify OpenAI o3 API integration
2. Compare search agent vs synthesis agent performance on a knowledge-based task
3. Evaluate 3-shot vs 5-shot performance to identify model size limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can hybrid agents that combine search and synthesis strategies achieve more balanced performance across both knowledge-based and reasoning-based tasks? The paper suggests this as a natural evolution but hasn't tested combined approaches empirically.

**Open Question 2**: What mechanisms can enable agents to successfully handle "corner cases" that fall outside existing data distributions? The paper identifies this as an inherent limitation but hasn't proposed solutions.

**Open Question 3**: Can open-source models achieve competitive data synthesis capabilities compared to closed-source models like OpenAI o3? All synthesis experiments relied exclusively on o3, with no comparison to open-source alternatives.

## Limitations

- Fundamental inability to handle "corner cases" - dataset demands outside existing training distributions
- Reliance on o3 for metadata evaluation introduces potential bias when the same model family generates synthetic datasets
- 5-shot evaluation performance degradation suggests evaluation metrics may be overly sensitive to sample size

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Performance dichotomy between search and synthesis agents; failure on corner cases; low scores on DatasetResearch-pro
- **Medium confidence**: Specific score differences between agent types; relative performance on different task categories
- **Low confidence**: Exact human verification criteria during dataset curation; impact of different o3 parameter settings

## Next Checks

1. Test metadata evaluation using multiple judge models (not just o3) to assess potential bias
2. Systematically categorize and analyze characteristics of tasks where all methods fail
3. Evaluate whether increasing model size improves performance on knowledge-based tasks where search agents excel
