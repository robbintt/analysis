# Likely Interpolants of Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.26266
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26266
- Reference count: 40
- The paper develops a general interpolation scheme that targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and probability distributions, achieving better likelihood scores compared to alternative approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental problem of interpolation in generative models, which is crucial for controlled generation and model inspection. Most generative models lack a principal notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or data dimension. The authors develop a general interpolation scheme that targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and probability distributions, formulating interpolation as a (pseudo)-metric analogous to a geodesic constrained to a suitable data distribution. The approach requires no additional training and can be applied across various generative models.

## Method Summary
The method computes interpolation paths by minimizing a regularized energy functional consisting of kinetic energy (smoothness) and potential energy (negative log-likelihood). The algorithm, called ProbGEORCE, treats the continuous curve-finding problem as a discrete optimal control problem with a closed-form update step derived from Pontryagin's maximum principle. This allows for fast convergence without requiring gradients through time. The approach works by considering interpolants analogous to a geodesic constrained to a suitable data distribution, and it enables higher-order statistical calculations like means and principal components, allowing generative models to be incorporated into traditional data analysis pipelines.

## Key Results
- The proposed interpolation scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models and datasets
- The method achieves better likelihood scores compared to alternative approaches
- For diffusion models, the method demonstrates improved results for image interpolation tasks, with FID scores showing competitive or better performance compared to other methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Interpolation paths traverse high-density regions because the gradient of the data log-likelihood acts as a force field that "bends" standard geodesics toward the data manifold.
- **Mechanism:** The method minimizes a regularized energy functional (Eq. 4) consisting of kinetic energy (smoothness) and potential energy (negative log-likelihood). The Euler-Lagrange derivation (Eq. 7) shows that the resulting ODE is equivalent to Newtonian mechanics on a manifold, where the "force" $\frac{\lambda}{2} G^{-1} \nabla S$ pushes the curve toward lower potential (higher likelihood).
- **Core assumption:** The generative model provides a differentiable score function or log-density ($S(x) = -\log p(x)$) that accurately reflects the data distribution.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 4, Eq. 7]: The derived ODE explicitly includes the term $\frac{\lambda}{2}g^{kp}\partial_p S$, described as an "external force."
  - [Page 1, Fig. 1]: Conceptual illustration of the density gradient pushing the Riemannian geodesic.
  - [Corpus]: Related work "Riemannian Neural Geodesic Interpolant" supports the viability of neural geodesic approaches, though this paper uniquely relies on the score-based "force" mechanism rather than strictly learning the metric.
- **Break condition:** If the regularization weight $\lambda$ is set too low, the force is insufficient to overcome the curvature of the background metric, resulting in a straight line through low-density space.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The algorithm (ProbGEORCE) achieves fast convergence by treating the continuous curve-finding problem as a discrete optimal control problem with a closed-form update step.
- **Mechanism:** Rather than using generic optimizers (like Adam) to minimize path energy, the paper derives a specific update scheme (Eq. 10) based on Pontryagin's maximum principle. This allows the curve to be updated iteratively by solving for "control" variables (velocities) that optimally trade off between the metric constraint and the probabilistic penalty.
- **Core assumption:** The discretization step size $N_{grid}$ is small enough to approximate the continuous integral but large enough to avoid numerical instability.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 5, Prop. 3.4]: Explicitly derives the update scheme $\mu, u, z$ without requiring gradients through time.
  - [Page 6, Fig. 4]: Shows ProbGEORCE converging to lower energy significantly faster than standard gradient descent methods.
  - [Corpus]: Weak direct corpus evidence for "ProbGEORCE" specifically, as it appears to be a novel contribution extending prior GEORCE work.
- **Break condition:** Convergence fails if the Hessian of the log-likelihood becomes singular or if the initialization is too far from the data manifold, causing the "force" to push the curve into numerical instability.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The constructed (pseudo)-metric allows for statistical operations (like computing means) because it locally approximates a valid Riemannian metric along the optimal path.
- **Mechanism:** While the global energy function is not strictly a metric (it can be negative), Proposition 3.2 proves that locally along the curve, the energy is equivalent to geodesic distance under a specific Riemannian metric $U(x) = G(x) + \frac{\lambda}{2} \nabla^2 S(x)$. This mathematical property validates the calculation of Fréchet means.
- **Core assumption:** The curve remains in regions where the Hessian $\nabla^2 S$ is well-behaved and positive semi-definite.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 4, Prop. 3.2]: Demonstrates the local isomorphism to a Riemannian metric $U(\gamma^*(t))$.
  - [Page 7, Eq. 8]: Defines the generalized Fréchet mean based on this metric structure.
- **Break condition:** If the path crosses a region where the density is not smooth (e.g., sharp boundaries in the data), the local metric approximation degrades, potentially leading to non-unique means.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Riemannian Geometry (Manifolds, Metrics, Geodesics)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper frames the interpolation problem as finding a curve on a manifold. You must understand that "distance" on a manifold is defined by a metric tensor $G$, and geodesics are the generalization of straight lines.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the distance function $dist(a,b)$ change if the metric tensor $G$ varies spatially?

- **Concept:** Score-Based Generative Models (Score Functions)
  - **Why needed here:** The core "driving force" of the method is the score ($\nabla \log p$). Understanding that this vector points in the direction of steepest increase in data density is crucial.
  - **Quick check question:** In a diffusion model, what does the score $\nabla_x \log p_t(x)$ represent at time $t$?

- **Concept:** Calculus of Variations / Euler-Lagrange Equation
  - **Why needed here:** The method derives its governing ODE (Eq. 7) by minimizing an energy functional. Understanding that minimizing $\int L dt$ leads to differential equations is necessary to grasp why the "force" term appears.
  - **Quick check question:** If you add a potential term $V(x)$ to a kinetic energy Lagrangian, what term appears in the Euler-Lagrange equation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Start/End points ($a, b$) -> Background Metric $G$ -> Score Function $\nabla S$ -> ProbGEORCE Core -> Post-Processor (Decoder)
- **Critical path:**
  1. **Initialization:** Discretize a straight line between $a$ and $b$ into $N_{grid}$ points.
  2. **Force Calculation:** Evaluate the score $\nabla S$ at all current curve points.
  3. **Control Update:** Apply Eq. 10/11 to compute new velocities. This step is the "fast" converger—do not replace it with generic backprop unless testing ablations.
  4. **Line Search:** Check if the update reduces total energy; if not, dampen the step.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **$\lambda$ (Regularization):** High $\lambda$ forces the path to stay strictly on the data manifold (high likelihood) but may create jagged paths. Low $\lambda$ is smooth but may hallucinate transitions.
  - **Noise Space vs. Data Space:** Calculating curves in noise space (prior) is faster but less semantically precise than data space (requires Score distillation).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"Drifting":** The curve drifts away from the manifold (NLL increases). Cause: $\lambda$ too low or score model inaccurate.
  - **"Oscillation":** The curve jitters. Cause: $N_{grid}$ too coarse for the curvature of $S$.
  - **Blurriness:** In diffusion models, data-space curves appear blurry. Cause: As noted in the paper, it is better to compute in latent/noise space and decode.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **2D Synthetic Test:** Implement ProbGEORCE on a 2D Gaussian Mixture (Fig. 3). Verify that increasing $\lambda$ pulls the curve toward the modes.
  2. **Speed Benchmark:** Compare ProbGEORCE convergence steps vs. Adam on the n-sphere experiment (Fig. 4) to validate the quadratic convergence claim.
  3. **Image Interpolation:** Apply to a pre-trained diffusion model (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR) using a pre-computed score. Compare visual smoothness vs. Spherical linear interpolation (Slerp).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a principled, data-driven heuristic be developed to automatically select the optimal regularization strength $\lambda$ and the regularization function $S$?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The limitations section states that the choice of $\lambda$ and $S$ "depend on the preferences of the user for smoothness versus high likelihood," implying a lack of objective selection criteria.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the trade-off visually (Fig. 3) and fixes $\lambda=20.0$ experimentally, but does not provide a theoretical or automated framework for determining the optimal balance for unseen data distributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm or theoretical bound that selects $\lambda$ based on data geometry or desired interpolation properties, validated by showing consistent performance without manual tuning.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Under what specific mathematical conditions does the duality gap between the constrained minimization (Eq. 3) and the Lagrange relaxation (Eq. 4) disappear?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3 notes that if convexity is not met, "there could be duality gaps... i.e., the solution to Eq. 4 is an optimal solution, but there is not necessarily a $\lambda$ for all values of $\bar{S}$."
- Why unresolved: The paper uses the relaxed formulation for computational tractability but leaves the theoretical gap between the "true" constrained path and the computed regularized path unexplored for non-convex cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis defining the class of functions $S$ and manifolds where strong duality holds, or an empirical study quantifying the error introduced by the relaxation in high-dimensional generative models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the precise curvature bounds required to guarantee the uniqueness of the regularized Fréchet mean in this pseudo-metric space?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Appendix B discusses existence and uniqueness, noting that while the classic Fréchet mean is unique in regular balls, the generalized version (Eq. 8) may not be. Figure 10 suggests that increasing $\lambda$ creates multiple local minima.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides an algorithm to compute the mean but highlights that the conditions for uniqueness in the *regularized* setting are not fully established, relying instead on local convexity assumptions for convergence.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof extending the Karcher or Kendall uniqueness theorems to the specific energy functional $E_\lambda$ used in the paper.

## Limitations
- The method depends critically on the quality of the underlying score function or log-density estimate
- Computational costs can become prohibitive for high-dimensional models
- Requires careful tuning of the regularization parameter λ with no clear automatic selection procedure

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The mathematical derivation of the energy functional and its relationship to Riemannian geometry (Mechanism 1) - supported by explicit equations and the Euler-Lagrange derivation
- **Medium confidence:** The ProbGEORCE algorithm's superior convergence speed compared to standard optimizers - validated by Fig. 4 but requires independent reproduction
- **Medium confidence:** The method's ability to compute valid statistical operations (means, principal components) using the constructed pseudo-metric - theoretically sound but practical validation limited to specific examples

## Next Checks

1. **Score sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary λ and measure how the resulting interpolation paths change in terms of likelihood and perceptual quality. Identify the threshold where the "force" becomes either too weak or causes numerical instability.

2. **Cross-model robustness test:** Apply the method to multiple generative model architectures (VAE, GAN, diffusion) on the same dataset to determine if the interpolation quality correlates with model architecture or training procedure.

3. **Latent space vs. data space comparison:** For diffusion models, compute interpolation paths in both noise space and data space, then decode both to measure the trade-off between computational efficiency and visual fidelity.
