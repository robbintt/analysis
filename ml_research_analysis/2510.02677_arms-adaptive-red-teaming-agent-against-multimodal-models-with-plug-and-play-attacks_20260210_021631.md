- ARMS achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates, improving performance by an average of 52.1% over existing baselines and exceeding 90% on Claude-4-Sonnet

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ARMS, a novel adaptive red-teaming agent framework designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in multimodal models. ARMS combines reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration with a layered memory module to optimize diverse multimodal attack strategies, including 11 novel approaches spanning visual context cloaking, typographic transformation, and visual reasoning hijacking. Experiments across both instance-based and policy-based evaluations demonstrate that ARMS achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates, improving performance by an average of 52.1% over existing baselines and exceeding 90% on Claude-4-Sonnet.

## Method Summary
ARMS employs a multi-agent framework that orchestrates reasoning-enhanced multi-step attacks through a layered memory system. The framework integrates 11 novel multimodal attack strategies that manipulate both visual and textual inputs. The system uses reinforcement learning to optimize attack generation while maintaining diversity across attack types. ARMS systematically generates red-teaming instances that reveal vulnerabilities across 51 risk categories, culminating in the creation of the ARMS-BENCH dataset containing over 30K instances.

## Key Results
- ARMS achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates, improving performance by an average of 52.1% over existing baselines
- ARMS exceeds 90% attack success rate on Claude-4-Sonnet
- ARMS generates significantly more diverse red-teaming instances, revealing emerging vulnerabilities across 51 risk categories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ARMS works by combining adaptive reasoning with systematic memory management to orchestrate diverse multimodal attacks. The framework leverages both visual context manipulation and textual prompt engineering in concert, using reinforcement learning to discover optimal attack sequences. The layered memory module enables the system to maintain context across multi-step attacks while avoiding redundancy, allowing it to explore the vulnerability space more efficiently than single-step or static attack approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Attack Strategies**: Understanding how to simultaneously manipulate visual and textual inputs to bypass safety filters - needed to create comprehensive red-teaming that addresses both modalities, quick check: verify each attack strategy targets both visual and textual components
- **Reinforcement Learning for Adversarial Generation**: Using reward signals to optimize attack generation while maintaining diversity - needed to balance attack effectiveness with exploration of vulnerability space, quick check: confirm diversity metrics show varied attack patterns
- **Layered Memory Systems**: Maintaining context across multi-step reasoning processes - needed to track attack progress and avoid redundant attempts, quick check: verify memory prevents duplicate attack patterns
- **Visual Reasoning Hijacking**: Exploiting how models interpret visual information to trigger unintended responses - needed to uncover vulnerabilities in visual understanding, quick check: confirm visual-only attacks succeed independently

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Image/Text -> ARMS Agent -> Attack Strategy Generator -> Multimodal Attack -> Model Response -> Memory Layer -> Reward Signal -> ARMS Agent

Critical path: The agent receives inputs, generates attacks using the strategy generator, applies multimodal manipulations, observes model responses, updates memory layers, and adjusts future attacks based on reward signals.

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes attack diversity over pure success rate, sacrificing some immediate effectiveness for broader vulnerability discovery. The layered memory system adds computational overhead but enables more systematic exploration compared to simpler iterative approaches.

Failure signatures: Limited success on open-source models suggests potential overfitting to proprietary model architectures. The ARMS-BENCH dataset may contain bias toward attack patterns that ARMS is particularly effective at generating.

First experiments: 1) Test individual attack strategies in isolation to verify basic functionality, 2) Run ablation studies removing the memory layer to quantify its contribution, 3) Compare attack diversity metrics with and without the reasoning enhancement component.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on proprietary models (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-4-Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro), with limited testing on open-source models beyond LLaVA-1.5
- ARMS-BENCH dataset constructed using ARMS itself may introduce bias toward attack patterns that ARMS is particularly effective at generating
- Paper does not thoroughly address potential false positives in attack success rates or provide detailed analysis of false positive rates across different attack strategies

## Confidence

High confidence in: The technical implementation of ARMS's modular architecture, the comparative performance metrics against baselines, and the demonstrated effectiveness of the 11 attack strategies.

Medium confidence in: The generalizability of attack success rates across different VLM architectures and training paradigms, the true diversity of vulnerabilities discovered versus those specifically targeted by ARMS's attack strategies.

Low confidence in: Claims about discovering "emerging vulnerabilities" without clear baseline comparisons of what vulnerabilities existed before ARMS, and the assertion that ARMS "surpasses existing baselines by an average of 52.1%" without accounting for potential ceiling effects.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-validation by testing ARMS against a diverse set of open-source VLMs (not just LLaVA-1.5) with varying architectures and training approaches to assess generalizability beyond proprietary models.

2. Perform ablation studies on the ARMS-BENCH dataset to determine whether the safety improvements come from learning generalizable safety concepts or simply memorizing specific attack patterns from ARMS-generated data.

3. Implement an independent red-teaming evaluation where a different attack framework attempts to jailbreak models fine-tuned on ARMS-BENCH to assess whether robustness improvements are transferable or attack-specific.
