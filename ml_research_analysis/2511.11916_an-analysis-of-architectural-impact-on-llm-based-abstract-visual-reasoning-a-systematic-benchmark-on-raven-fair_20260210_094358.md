# An Analysis of Architectural Impact on LLM-based Abstract Visual Reasoning: A Systematic Benchmark on RAVEN-FAIR

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.11916
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11916
- **Reference count**: 33
- **Primary result**: GPT-4.1-Mini achieved 46.91% accuracy in single-shot configuration, with embedding-controlled repetition improving performance by 7.01% while revealing systematic disconnects between reasoning quality and execution accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates four LLM architectures on abstract visual reasoning using the RAVEN-FAIR dataset. Four models (GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b) are tested across single-shot, embedding-controlled repetition, self-reflection, and multi-agent architectures. The research reveals that architectural improvements are highly model-specific, with GPT-4.1-Mini consistently outperforming others. A key finding is the systematic disconnect between Chain-of-Thought reasoning quality and final answer accuracy, challenging assumptions about reasoning process evaluation. The study also identifies coverage variation as a major methodological confounder, with self-reflection causing Claude's coverage to drop from 99.7% to 75.2%.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates LLMs on RAVEN-FAIR's 1200 abstract visual reasoning problems, where models must generate answers without being provided choices, producing visual outputs via a tool function. Four reasoning architectures are tested: single-shot (baseline), embedding-controlled repetition (cosine similarity threshold 0.8), self-reflection (confidence threshold 8/10 triggers regeneration), and feature-based multi-agent (specialized agents per visual feature). Four LLMs are tested across all configurations with best-of-5-runs reporting. Performance is measured via SSIM/LPIPS visual accuracy, Chain-of-Thought scoring (0-10), coverage rate, and error classification (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception, minor deviation, invalid format).

## Key Results
- GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest accuracy (46.91% in single-shot configuration) across all architectures
- Embedding-controlled repetition improved GPT-4.1-Mini by 7.01% while LLaMA-3.3-70B gained only +0.45%, illustrating "consistency-in-error" amplification
- Self-reflection caused Claude-3.5-Haiku's coverage to drop drastically from 99.7% to 75.2% due to systematic refusals and overly critical self-assessment
- Multi-agent architecture provided largest gains for LLaMA-3.3-70B (+8.76% accuracy) but introduced semantic-numeric trade-offs, with semantic hallucination increasing from 83.23% to 90.84%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Embedding-controlled repetition improves accuracy selectively for models with strong base execution but amplifies consistent errors in others.
- **Mechanism**: Two-pass generation with cosine similarity filtering (threshold 0.8) promotes output stability. When embeddings diverge, regeneration is triggered, reducing "decision-layer drift."
- **Core assumption**: Consistency in embedding space correlates with correctness; this holds for GPT-4.1-Mini but fails for models with systematic biases.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract]: "embedding-based repetition improved GPT-4.1-Mini by 7.01%"; [section 5.2]: "LLaMA-3.3-70B achieved only a +0.45% gain, illustrating the 'consistency-in-error' phenomenon"
- **Break condition**: When a model's inherent errors are consistent across runs, the filter repeatedly endorses mistakes rather than correcting them.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Self-reflection architectures can degrade performance by reinforcing confirmation bias and causing coverage collapse.
- **Mechanism**: After initial generation, the model scores its confidence (0-10). If below threshold (8), it revisits reasoning and regenerates. This meta-cognitive loop is intended to catch errors but often rationalizes existing mistakes.
- **Core assumption**: Models possess reliable self-assessment capabilities; evidence suggests this assumption is model-specific and often violated.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract]: "systematic disconnect between explanation quality and execution quality"; [section 5.3]: Claude-3.5-Haiku "coverage dropping drastically from 99.7% to 75.2% (a decrease of 24.5%)" due to "systematic refusals and overly critical self-assessment"
- **Break condition**: When self-assessment is poorly calibrated, reflection reinforces errors rather than correcting them; when models are over-critical, they refuse to generate valid outputs.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Multi-agent decomposition creates a semantic-numeric trade-off rather than uniform improvement.
- **Mechanism**: Specialized agents analyze individual features (shape, color, position, angle). A master agent integrates outputs into final JSON. This modular structure can improve one error type while worsening another.
- **Core assumption**: Feature-level decomposition enables more precise reasoning; integration overhead and coordination failures may negate benefits.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract]: "multi-agent architecture provided the largest performance gains for LLaMA-3.3-70b (+8.76% accuracy)"; [section 5.4]: For LLaMA, "semantic hallucination increased from 83.23% to 90.84%, and numerical reasoning degraded significantly, with misperception climbing from 66.08% to 95.86%"
- **Break condition**: Coordination overhead reduces coverage; feature agents introduce errors that propagate through integration.

## Foundational Learning

- **Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM)**
  - Why needed here: The RAVEN-FAIR dataset is derived from RPM, requiring understanding of 3×3 matrix completion with abstract rule discovery.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why providing answer choices vs. requiring free-form generation changes what the benchmark measures?

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The study uses 0-10 CoT scoring to assess reasoning quality independently of final answer correctness.
  - Quick check question: What does a high CoT score with low accuracy suggest about a model's reasoning process?

- **Perceptual Similarity Metrics (SSIM/LPIPS)**
  - Why needed here: Visual outputs are evaluated via SSIM (structural similarity) and LPIPS (learned perceptual similarity) rather than exact pixel matching.
  - Quick check question: Why would LPIPS be preferred over pixel-wise comparison for evaluating generated visual answers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: JSON Extraction -> LLM Reasoning Architecture -> Tool Function -> Evaluation Layer
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Problem JSON → LLM reasoning architecture → CoT + JSON output
  2. JSON output → Tool Function → Visual panel (160×160)
  3. Generated panel vs. ground truth → SSIM/LPIPS scoring
  4. CoT text → Manual/automated scoring (0-10)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Single-shot: Fast, low compute, baseline performance
  - Embedding-controlled: +7% for GPT-4.1-Mini, but risk of "consistency-in-error" amplification
  - Self-reflection: Can cause 25% coverage loss; model-specific effectiveness
  - Multi-agent: Best gains for open-source models (+8.76% for LLaMA), but semantic-numeric trade-offs

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Semantic hallucination: Model invents non-existent rules (e.g., "size decreasing" when no size change exists)
  - Numeric misperception: Incorrect transcription of values (size deviation > 0.1, angle > ±45°)
  - Coverage collapse: Model refuses or fails to generate valid JSON (notably Claude under self-reflection)
  - Format failures: Missing mandatory fields, unsupported data types, tool function not called

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Single-shot baseline: Run all four models on 100-problem subset; measure accuracy, coverage, and CoT scores to establish model-specific baselines.
  2. Embedding threshold sweep: For GPT-4.1-Mini, test cosine similarity thresholds (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) to find optimal consistency filter; track accuracy vs. semantic hallucination rate.
  3. Coverage diagnostics: Under self-reflection, log all cases where Claude refuses or scores itself below threshold; categorize refusal reasons to diagnose over-critical behavior.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Self-reflection architecture shows severe coverage collapse (Claude dropping from 99.7% to 75.2%), suggesting poorly calibrated confidence-based refinement for visual reasoning tasks
- Embedding-controlled repetition's benefits are model-specific and risk amplifying systematic errors when models exhibit consistent but incorrect reasoning patterns
- Multi-agent architecture introduces semantic-numeric trade-offs, with feature-level decomposition potentially creating new error modes rather than purely additive benefits

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: GPT-4.1-Mini consistently outperforms other models across architectures; the systematic disconnect between CoT quality and execution accuracy is well-documented and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: Embedding-controlled repetition benefits are model-specific and depend on error consistency patterns; multi-agent gains come with trade-offs that vary by model capability.
- **Low confidence**: The self-reflection architecture's effectiveness is highly model-dependent and may not generalize beyond the specific models tested, given the extreme coverage variation observed.

## Next Checks
1. **Error amplification audit**: Systematically track whether embedding-controlled repetition's "consistency-in-error" phenomenon occurs across different model families by comparing pre-filter and post-filter error distributions on identical problems.
2. **Coverage stability stress test**: Evaluate self-reflection architecture with varying confidence thresholds (6, 7, 8, 9) across all four models to map the relationship between refinement intensity and coverage collapse.
3. **Multi-agent decomposition analysis**: Dissect feature agent outputs to quantify how semantic hallucination increases while numerical accuracy decreases, testing whether this trade-off is inherent to modular reasoning or dependent on agent coordination quality.
