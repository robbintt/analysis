# Nested Browser-Use Learning for Agentic Information Seeking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23647
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23647
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: NestBrowse framework achieves 31.6% accuracy on BrowseComp benchmark with 30B model, outperforming larger models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), a framework enabling information-seeking agents to perform effective deep web browsing. The key innovation is a nested interaction structure that decouples outer-loop reasoning from inner-loop page exploration, allowing agents to incrementally extract goal-relevant content while avoiding context overload. The framework uses a minimal browser toolkit and trains agents via multi-task imitation learning on challenging deep search tasks. Experiments show that NestBrowse achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, demonstrating that small models can acquire sophisticated browser-use capabilities through appropriate tool abstractions and interaction strategies.

## Method Summary
NestBrowse employs a nested interaction structure where outer-loop reasoning handles high-level planning while inner-loop page exploration manages local navigation and content extraction. The framework uses a minimal browser toolkit (search, visit, click, fill) and trains agents through multi-task imitation learning on challenging deep search tasks. This architecture allows agents to incrementally extract goal-relevant content while maintaining manageable context windows, addressing the challenge of context overload in deep web browsing scenarios.

## Key Results
- 30B model achieves 31.6% accuracy on BrowseComp benchmark
- 4B model achieves 22.4% accuracy on BrowseComp benchmark
- Outperforms many larger models on four different benchmarks (BrowseComp, BrowseComp-zh, GAIA, XBench)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The nested interaction design effectively separates concerns between strategic planning and tactical execution. By decoupling outer-loop reasoning from inner-loop page exploration, the framework allows agents to maintain focus on high-level objectives while efficiently navigating local content. This structure prevents context overload by processing information incrementally rather than attempting to maintain complete web page context throughout the entire browsing session.

## Foundational Learning
- **Nested interactions**: Why needed - prevents context overload; Quick check - verify separate handling of planning vs. execution
- **Tool abstraction**: Why needed - simplifies agent decision-making; Quick check - confirm minimal toolkit sufficiency
- **Incremental content extraction**: Why needed - manages memory constraints; Quick check - validate progressive information gathering
- **Multi-task imitation learning**: Why needed - enables transfer across different browsing scenarios; Quick check - test on unseen web domains

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Browser Toolkit -> Nested Interaction Layer -> Agent Model -> Output
- **Critical path**: Search query -> Outer reasoning -> Inner page exploration -> Content extraction -> Next action
- **Design tradeoffs**: Minimal toolkit vs. comprehensive capabilities; nested structure vs. monolithic approach
- **Failure signatures**: Context loss during nested transitions; ineffective tool selection; premature termination
- **First experiments**: 1) Test nested vs. flat interaction performance; 2) Evaluate toolkit completeness; 3) Measure context retention across sessions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance relies on benchmarks that may not capture real-world complexity
- Nested interaction design may not generalize to rapid context switching scenarios
- Success rates indicate significant room for improvement (31.6% and 22.4% accuracy)

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Technical framework description and implementation details are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Benchmark performance results are credible but may not generalize beyond tested domains
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about superiority over larger models need validation across broader task distributions

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate NestBrowse on real-world user tasks beyond synthetic benchmarks, particularly those requiring complex reasoning chains or domain-specific knowledge
2. Test the framework's performance under noisy or incomplete web content conditions, including broken links, dynamic content loading issues, and varying page layouts
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of the nested interaction structure versus the underlying model architecture to the observed performance gains
