## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection (CLID) and presents CLAIRE, an LLM-based agent system that combines retrieval with reasoning to surface potentially inconsistent claims from large knowledge corpora like Wikipedia. CLAIRE includes disambiguation and explanation tools to help users understand complex claims and evidence. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, CLAIRE increased the number of identified inconsistencies by 64.7% in the same time and boosted editor confidence by 87.5%. The authors create WIKICOLLIDE, the first benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies, and find that at least 3.3% of Wikipedia facts are corpus-level inconsistent. On WIKICOLLIDE, CLAIRE achieves an AUROC of 75.1%, demonstrating both the feasibility and headroom of the task.

## Method Summary
CLAIRE is a ReAct-style agent system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to detect corpus-level inconsistencies in Wikipedia. The system extracts atomic facts from text using GPT-4o, then employs an iterative retrieval-reasoning loop (max 10 steps, 15 passages per query) using mGTE embeddings and RankGPT reranking to gather evidence across the Wikipedia corpus. The agent can invoke auxiliary tools for entity disambiguation and terminology explanation. Evidence is then passed to a GPT-4o verifier that outputs an inconsistency score in [0,1], with claims scoring above 0.5 flagged as potentially inconsistent. The system was evaluated on WIKICOLLIDE, a new benchmark of 955 atomic facts (34.7% inconsistent) created from real Wikipedia inconsistencies.

## Key Results
- CLAIRE achieved 75.1% AUROC on WIKICOLLIDE test set
- Wikipedia contains at least 3.3% corpus-level inconsistent facts
- In user study with 8 experienced Wikipedia editors, CLAIRE increased inconsistencies found by 64.7% in same time and boosted confidence by 87.5%
- At least 11% of Wikipedia articles contain at least one corpus-level inconsistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Iterative retrieval-reasoning loops improve inconsistency detection over single-pass verification
- Mechanism: CLAIRE uses the ReAct architecture where research and verification steps interleave—insights from early verification guide subsequent retrieval queries, enabling discovery of contradictions that require multi-hop reasoning across articles
- Core assumption: Contradictions often require gathering evidence from multiple documents that aren't retrieved together in a single query
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface potentially inconsistent claims"; [section 4] "research and verification steps are interleaved, allowing insights gained during verification to guide subsequent retrieval"
- Break condition: If contradictions are typically found within single documents or by simple keyword overlap, interleaved reasoning provides no advantage

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Disambiguation tools reduce false positives from entity name collisions
- Mechanism: The `clarify` tool retrieves context on entities with similar names and uses LLM summarization to highlight distinguishing features, preventing spurious inconsistency flags when different entities share names
- Core assumption: A significant portion of false positives stem from entity ambiguity rather than genuine contradictions
- Evidence anchors: [section 4] "clarify: Request clarifications to disambiguate entities... gathers additional context, and produces concise summaries highlighting key differences"; [section 7.5] "All evaluated systems frequently conflate distinct entities that share the same name, leading to incorrect inconsistency flags"
- Break condition: If entity ambiguity is rare in the target corpus or LLMs already handle it well natively, the tool adds overhead without benefit

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Confidence scoring enables effective human-AI collaboration by prioritizing review effort
- Mechanism: CLAIRE outputs a continuous inconsistency score [0,1] rather than binary classification, allowing users to threshold based on their tolerance for false positives vs. missed detections
- Core assumption: Users have limited review capacity and benefit from ranking candidates by model confidence
- Evidence anchors: [section 4] "we design CLAIRE to output an inconsistency score in the range [0, 1] to quantify confidence and help users prioritize high-confidence candidates"; [section 4.1] "Participants identified an average of 64.7% more inconsistencies per hour when using CLAIRE"
- Break condition: If score calibration is poor (scores don't correlate with true inconsistency probability), prioritization fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a subcomponent**
  - Why needed here: CLID formalizes inconsistency detection as finding evidence E where NLI(E, f) = Refutes; understanding NLI's three-way classification (Supports/Refutes/NEI) is essential
  - Quick check question: Given claim "The population doubled" and evidence "Population increased 50%," what NLI label applies?

- Concept: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture patterns**
  - Why needed here: CLAIRE is a RAG variant; you need to understand embedding-based retrieval, reranking, and how retrieval quality affects downstream verification
  - Quick check question: Why might embedding similarity fail to retrieve evidence containing numerical contradictions?

- Concept: **ReAct agent loop (Reasoning + Acting)**
  - Why needed here: CLAIRE's core architecture follows ReAct—alternating between thought steps and tool invocations until termination
  - Quick check question: What determines when a ReAct agent should stop searching and report its conclusion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Fact Extractor -> Retriever (mGTE + RankGPT) -> Agent Controller (ReAct) -> Verifier (GPT-4o) -> User Interface
- Critical path: 1. Page content → Fact extraction → Atomic facts; 2. Each fact → Agent retrieves evidence across multiple steps; 3. Agent may invoke clarify/explain tools during retrieval; 4. Final evidence set → Verifier produces inconsistency score; 5. Score > threshold → Highlight in UI with explanation
- Design tradeoffs: More retrieval steps → higher recall but increased latency and cost; Lower score threshold → more false positives but fewer missed inconsistencies; Paper found 10 steps with 15 passages/query achieved 75.1% AUROC; increasing passages helped marginally (~3%); Reranking improved AUROC by 2.0-2.8 points across systems
- Failure signatures: Entity conflation (flags different people with same name as inconsistent); Context-insensitive numerics (flags rounding differences as hard contradictions); Translation variants (flags different language versions of same entity as inconsistent); Temporal mismatch (compares facts from different time periods without recognizing change)
- First 3 experiments: 1. Baseline reproduction: Implement retrieve-and-verify pipeline on WIKICOLLIDE validation set; target ~73-74% AUROC with GPT-4o; 2. Ablate clarify/explain: Run CLAIRE with each tool disabled individually; expect F1 drop of ~2-4 points; 3. Threshold sweep: Plot precision-recall curves by varying inconsistency score threshold; identify operating point matching your false-positive tolerance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The paper does not specify the exact chunking strategy for building the retrieval index, which could significantly affect retrieval quality and downstream inconsistency detection performance
- The RankGPT configuration details (such as top-k reranking parameters) are not provided, making exact reproduction difficult
- While the user study shows strong positive results, it involved only 8 Wikipedia editors working for one hour each, limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The feasibility of CLID as a task and the existence of corpus-level inconsistencies in Wikipedia (supported by WIKICOLLIDE benchmark with 34.7% inconsistency rate)
- **Medium confidence**: The specific 64.7% productivity improvement and 87.5% confidence boost from the user study, given the small sample size
- **Medium confidence**: The 75.1% AUROC achievement, as exact reproduction requires unknown implementation details like chunking strategy and RankGPT configuration

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a replication study with a larger pool of Wikipedia editors (n≥20) working for multiple sessions to validate the claimed productivity improvements
2. Implement ablation studies varying the number of retrieval steps and passages per query to determine optimal configurations and confirm the reported 10-step, 15-passage settings
3. Perform cross-corpus validation by applying CLAIRE to another knowledge base (e.g., academic publications or news articles) to test generalizability beyond Wikipedia
