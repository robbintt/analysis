# Comparison of Autoencoders for tokenization of ASL datasets

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.06942
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06942
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: Diffusion autoencoder achieves lowest MSE (0.00141) and highest MOS (3.11) for ASL image reconstruction

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates three autoencoder architectures—feedforward, convolutional, and diffusion—for tokenizing and reconstructing images from an American Sign Language dataset of 87,000 images across 29 hand sign classes. The diffusion autoencoder outperforms others with the lowest mean squared error (0.00141) and highest mean opinion score (3.11), attributed to its iterative noise modeling and denoising capabilities. The convolutional autoencoder performs moderately well (MSE 0.00144, MOS 2.79), while the feedforward autoencoder serves as a baseline with significantly lower performance (MSE 0.00506, MOS 1.28). Results demonstrate the superiority of diffusion-based models for high-fidelity image reconstruction in multimodal AI applications.

## Method Summary
The study compares three autoencoder architectures for tokenizing ASL hand sign images. Models were trained on 80% of the dataset (69,600 images) with validation on 20% (17,400 images), using a subset of 2,900 images for final evaluation. All models compress 200×200×3 input images into a 64-dimensional latent space. The diffusion autoencoder introduces a noise schedule over 100 timesteps with a beta schedule, using a denoising network to iteratively remove noise before reconstruction. Evaluation used mean squared error (MSE) for objective assessment and mean opinion score (MOS) from 5 human raters on a 1-5 scale for subjective quality.

## Key Results
- Diffusion autoencoder achieved lowest MSE (0.00141) and highest MOS (3.11)
- Convolutional autoencoder performed moderately (MSE 0.00144, MOS 2.79)
- Feedforward autoencoder showed baseline performance (MSE 0.00506, MOS 1.28)
- Diffusion model's superiority attributed to iterative noise modeling and denoising capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The diffusion autoencoder's superior reconstruction quality appears linked to its iterative denoising process.
- Mechanism: A noise schedule perturbs latent variables over 100 timesteps using a beta schedule; a denoising network predicts and removes noise during reverse diffusion before the decoder reconstructs the image.
- Core assumption: Iterative noise prediction captures data distribution structure more effectively than direct encoding-decoding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Diffusion Autoencoder outperformed the others... due to its probabilistic noise modeling and iterative denoising capabilities."
  - [section 3.6] "The diffusion model introduces a noise schedule over 100 timesteps, perturbing the latent variables using a beta schedule. A denoising model... predicts and removes the noise during reverse diffusion."
  - [corpus] DGAE paper (arXiv:2506.09644) explores diffusion-guided autoencoders, suggesting broader interest but limited direct validation of this specific approach.
- Break condition: If noise schedules are poorly tuned or timesteps are insufficient, denoising may introduce artifacts outweighing benefits.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Convolutional architectures likely outperform feedforward baselines by preserving spatial hierarchies during encoding.
- Mechanism: Three convolutional layers with 4×4 filters progressively reduce spatial dimensions (200→100→50→25) while increasing feature maps (32→64→128), extracting edges, textures, and patterns before flattening to a 64-dim latent space.
- Core assumption: Spatial correlations in hand sign images contain critical information that flattened representations destroy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4] "Convolutional operations hierarchically extract spatial features such as edges, textures, and complex patterns."
  - [section 7] "The Convolutional Autoencoder performed moderately well, effectively capturing spatial hierarchies in image data."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence for this specific ASL application; spatial feature extraction is widely established in computer vision but not specifically validated for ASL tokenization.
- Break condition: If latent dimension (64) is too compressed for 29 classes, spatial features may be irreversibly lost.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Characterizing the latent space probabilistically (mean and variance) may provide robustness against input variations.
- Mechanism: The encoder outputs distribution parameters rather than deterministic values, combining variational autoencoder principles with diffusion—a semantically meaningful and decodable representation.
- Core assumption: ASL images with varying lighting, hand sizes, and backgrounds benefit from uncertainty modeling in latent space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.5] "This architecture combines principles of variational autoencoders with iterative noise prediction."
  - [section 6.0.2] "The diffusion network slightly outperformed the convolutional network... the varied lighting on the sign... likely contributed to the lower quality of these reconstructions."
  - [corpus] Diffusion Autoencoders (Preechakul et al., CVPR 2022, cited in paper) provides theoretical foundation but corpus lacks independent replication for ASL.
- Break condition: If variance estimation is unstable or regularization is insufficient, the latent space may become uninformative.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Autoencoder loss functions and reconstruction objectives**
  - Why needed here: All three architectures optimize MSE between input and reconstruction; understanding what MSE captures (and misses) is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Why might a low MSE still produce perceptually poor reconstructions?

- Concept: **Diffusion forward and reverse processes**
  - Why needed here: The diffusion autoencoder's advantage hinges on understanding how noise is added (forward) and removed (reverse) over timesteps.
  - Quick check question: What happens if the denoising network is undertrained—does reconstruction fail gracefully or catastrophically?

- Concept: **Latent space bottleneck design**
  - Why needed here: All architectures compress 200×200×3 inputs into a 64-dimensional latent representation; bottleneck size directly affects information retention.
  - Quick check question: If you doubled the latent dimension to 128, would you expect linear improvement in MSE? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Feedforward AE**: Flatten(200×200×3) → FC layers → Latent(64) → FC layers → Unflatten → Sigmoid output
  - **Convolutional AE**: Conv(32→64→128) → Flatten → FC(64) → FC → TransposedConv(128→64→32) → Sigmoid output
  - **Diffusion AE**: Conv encoder → μ,σ (latent) → Forward diffusion (100 steps, beta schedule) → Denoising network (5+ layers) → Reverse diffusion → TransposedConv decoder

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess images to 200×200, normalize to [0,1]
  2. Implement encoder (shared Conv backbone for Conv and Diffusion variants)
  3. For Diffusion: implement noise schedule, denoising network, and reverse process
  4. Train with MSE loss; for Diffusion, track intermediate latent/noise outputs
  5. Evaluate on held-out validation set (2,900 images) using MSE and human MOS

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Diffusion vs. Convolutional**: +~2% MOS improvement, +significant training complexity (100 timesteps, denoising network)
  - **Convolutional vs. Feedforward**: ~3.5× lower MSE, +spatial inductive bias, similar parameter count (~16M)
  - **Latent dimension (64)**: Sufficient for 29 classes per paper results; Assumption: larger dimensions may yield diminishing returns

- Failure signatures:
  - Blurry outputs with undefined hand boundaries → feedforward limitation (spatial structure lost)
  - Poor reconstruction on spread-finger signs (e.g., "Y") under varied lighting → all models struggle; diffusion degrades more gracefully
  - MOS ≤2 despite low MSE → suggests pixel-level metrics don't capture perceptual quality

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation on diffusion timesteps**: Train with 50, 100, 200 timesteps to test whether the 100-step choice is critical or arbitrary.
  2. **Latent dimension sensitivity**: Compare 32, 64, and 128-dim latent spaces for Convolutional AE to quantify bottleneck impact.
  3. **Class-stratified error analysis**: Compute per-class MSE/MOS to identify whether specific signs (e.g., spread fingers, similar letters like M/N) systematically underperform across architectures.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the superior reconstruction fidelity of the Diffusion Autoencoder translate to improved accuracy when used as a tokenizer for downstream Large Language Models (LLMs) in sign language translation tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The abstract and introduction explicitly frame the goal of these architectures as "tokenizing" data for LLMs to enable "sign language detection and generation," yet the evaluation relies entirely on visual reconstruction metrics (MSE and Mean Opinion Score) without testing the tokens in an actual LLM pipeline.
- Why unresolved: High pixel-fidelity (low MSE) does not guarantee that the latent representation is semantically meaningful or optimized for the sequence-to-sequence tasks required for translation, meaning a "blurrier" model might theoretically serve as a better semantic tokenizer.
- What evidence would resolve it: An end-to-end evaluation where the latent vectors from each autoencoder are fed into a transformer model to perform sign language translation, comparing the resulting BLEU scores or classification accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the trade-off between the reconstruction quality of the Diffusion Autoencoder and its computational efficiency (inference time and resource consumption) compared to the Convolutional Autoencoder?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights the "iterative noise modeling and denoising capabilities" of the diffusion model as the source of its high MOS (3.11), but does not analyze the computational cost or latency associated with this iterative process.
- Why unresolved: For real-time applications like sign language recognition, inference speed is critical. The paper leaves unresolved whether the marginal gain in Mean Opinion Score (0.32 higher than Convolutional) justifies the likely significant increase in processing time and energy required for the diffusion steps.
- What evidence would resolve it: A benchmark comparison of the average inference time per image and GPU memory usage for the Convolutional versus Diffusion models on identical hardware.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of these autoencoders scale when trained on the full dataset (87,000 images) rather than the described subset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While Section 2 describes a dataset of 87,000 images, Section 4 ("Model Building") states that "We utilized 500 images per class" (totaling only 14,500 images) for training, leaving the impact of the full dataset on model generalization unstated.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the "moderate" performance of the Convolutional Autoencoder (MOS 2.79) represents an architectural ceiling or simply insufficient training data volume relative to the complexity of the ASL features.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of MSE and MOS convergence curves when the models are trained on the complete 87,000-image dataset versus the subset used in the study.

## Limitations
- Critical hyperparameters including learning rate, batch size, epoch count, and diffusion beta schedule parameters are unspecified
- The diffusion autoencoder's exact denoising network architecture and "dynamically added layers" mechanism are not specified
- Training used only 500 images per class (14,500 total) rather than the full 87,000-image dataset
- MOS protocol lacks detail on rater training, inter-rater reliability, and score aggregation method

## Confidence

- **Architecture specification**: Low - key components of diffusion denoising network and feedforward layers unspecified
- **Training protocol**: Low - critical hyperparameters missing
- **Evaluation methodology**: Medium - MSE is well-defined but MOS lacks procedural detail
- **Dataset usage**: Medium - clear data description but training subset choice unexplained

## Next Checks

1. Verify implementation of the 100-step diffusion process with correct beta schedule and denoising network architecture
2. Test the diffusion autoencoder's performance on individual ASL classes to identify systematic weaknesses
3. Benchmark inference time and memory usage of diffusion vs. convolutional models on identical hardware
