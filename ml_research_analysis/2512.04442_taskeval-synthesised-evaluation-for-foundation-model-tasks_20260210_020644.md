## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Framework synthesises task-specific evaluators for foundation model tasks using a meta-model, interaction protocol, and strategy templates

## Executive Summary
TaskEval introduces a framework for synthesising task-specific evaluators for foundation model (FM) tasks when no metrics or datasets exist. The core innovation is a task-agnostic meta-model that captures properties of any FM task, an interaction protocol for efficient human feedback, and an eval synthesiser that generates custom evals or selects from known ones. This approach addresses the challenge of evaluating FM tasks by automatically generating task-specific UIs and APIs, enabling both automated evaluation and human inspection. The system was demonstrated on two diverse tasks—chart data extraction and document QA—achieving 93% and 90% accuracy in preliminary evaluations.

## Method Summary
TaskEval employs a three-component pipeline: (1) a task-agnostic meta-model capturing task properties including input/output specifications, constraints, objectives, and evaluation requirements; (2) an interaction protocol with a four-stage loop (Elicit → Map → Run → Refine) using structured message types to iteratively elicit task knowledge; and (3) an eval synthesiser that maps meta-model instances to reusable strategy templates (summarize, visualize, judge, logic program) and generates both Evaluator API and UI components. The system takes task descriptions and sample inputs as input, producing custom evaluators that can handle tasks with novel evaluation dimensions.

## Key Results
- Achieved 93% accuracy on chart data extraction task (28/30 charts correctly evaluated)
- Achieved 90% accuracy on document QA task (27/30 documents correctly evaluated)
- Preliminary evaluation demonstrates feasibility of synthesising task-specific evaluators without ground truth datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A task-agnostic meta-model can capture sufficient properties of diverse FM tasks to enable evaluator synthesis
- Mechanism: The meta-model abstracts task dimensions (input/output modalities, task type, constraints, evaluation objectives, reasoning mode, reference sources) into a structured representation that drives strategy selection and UI component generation
- Core assumption: The identified facets (modalities, constraints, objectives, etc.) are sufficient to distinguish evaluation requirements across tasks
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "core novelty... a task-agnostic meta-model that captures properties of any FM task"; [Section 3.1] lists seven facets under investigation
- Break condition: Tasks with novel modalities or evaluation dimensions not covered by the seven facets fail to map correctly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A structured interaction protocol can iteratively elicit task knowledge with lower human effort than manual eval design
- Mechanism: Four-stage loop (Elicit → Map → Run → Refine) guides users through validating potential errors, approving or overriding strategies, executing evaluations, and refining descriptors using structured message types
- Core assumption: Users can accurately identify and articulate failure modes and evaluation objectives when prompted
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "an interaction protocol for efficient use of human feedback"; [Section 3.2] specifies message types and loop structure
- Break condition: Users cannot articulate failure modes or objectives; feedback loop requires many iterations without convergence

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Eval synthesis via strategy templates can produce task-appropriate evaluators without ground truth
- Mechanism: The Eval Synthesiser maps meta-model properties to reusable strategy templates and generates UI components for human inspection and labelling
- Core assumption: The four strategy categories span the evaluation needs of most FM tasks
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "an eval synthesiser that generates custom evals or selects from known ones"; [Section 3.3] categorises strategies; [Section 5] preliminary evaluation results
- Break condition: Tasks requiring evaluation dimensions not covered by available strategies receive inadequate evals

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Meta-modelling (Model-Driven Engineering)
  - Why needed here: TaskEval's core abstraction is a task-agnostic meta-model; understanding how models represent domain concepts and relationships is prerequisite to extending or debugging the schema
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a meta-model differs from a domain model, and what it means to "instantiate" a meta-model for a specific task?

- Concept: LLM-as-a-Judge and its limitations
  - Why needed here: The Judge strategy uses FMs to evaluate outputs; understanding calibration, consistency, and failure modes of judge-based eval is necessary to interpret results
  - Quick check question: What are two documented failure modes of LLM-as-a-judge approaches, and why might they compound when evaluating another FM's output?

- Concept: Human-in-the-loop feedback loops
  - Why needed here: The interaction protocol relies on iterative refinement; understanding feedback loop design (when to elicit, how to validate, convergence criteria) is required to deploy or adapt the protocol
  - Quick check question: What signals indicate a human-in-the-loop refinement loop is failing to converge, and what intervention would you try?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Task description + sample input → Meta-model instantiation (via protocol) → Strategy selection → Evaluator API/UI generation → Run evaluation → Refine via feedback loop
- Critical path: Task description + sample input → Meta-model instantiation (via protocol) → Strategy selection → Evaluator API/UI generation → Run evaluation → Refine via feedback loop
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Generality vs. precision: Task-agnostic meta-model may miss domain-specific nuances; specialized evals may outperform synthesised ones but require manual effort
  - Automation vs. human oversight: Full automation risks accepting hallucinated evals; human inspection adds latency
  - Strategy template coverage: Four categories may not cover all tasks; extending templates requires schema updates
- Failure signatures:
  - Irrelevant evals: Selected strategies do not address actual failure modes
  - Non-converging protocol: Feedback loop iterates without stabilizing on an evaluation plan
  - Judge inconsistency: LLM-as-judge strategies produce unreliable metrics
  - UI mismatch: Generated UI components do not support required labelling interactions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate meta-model coverage on a held-out task: Choose a task not in the paper (e.g., code generation, summarization). Attempt to instantiate the meta-model and identify missing facets
  2. Measure protocol convergence on your domain: Run the interaction protocol with a domain expert. Track number of iterations to reach a stable evaluation plan and log friction points
  3. Benchmark synthesised evals against manual evals: For a task where you have or can create a labelled dataset, compare TaskEval's synthesised evals against manually designed evals on precision, recall, and human inspection time

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Meta-model coverage across diverse FM tasks is asserted but not empirically proven beyond two case studies
- Strategy template coverage is presumed sufficient but not systematically tested across varied task types
- Reliance on LLM-as-a-judge introduces known reliability concerns that are acknowledged but not quantified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The three-component architecture is internally consistent and addresses a genuine gap in FM evaluation
- **Medium confidence**: Preliminary evaluation results are promising but limited in scope and sample size
- **Low confidence**: Claims about efficiency gains over manual eval design are not yet substantiated

## Next Checks

1. **Meta-model coverage validation**: Apply TaskEval to three additional FM tasks (e.g., code generation, summarization, multimodal reasoning) and document any missing meta-model facets or inadequate strategy mappings

2. **Protocol efficiency benchmarking**: Compare the interaction protocol against manual eval design for three tasks, measuring iteration count, total time, and user satisfaction scores

3. **Strategy template extensibility test**: Attempt to evaluate a task requiring novel evaluation dimensions (e.g., temporal reasoning in dialogue systems) and document whether the current four strategy categories can be composed to meet the need or require extension
