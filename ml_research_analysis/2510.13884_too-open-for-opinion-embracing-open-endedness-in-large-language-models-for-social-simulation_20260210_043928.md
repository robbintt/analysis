## Executive Summary
This position paper argues that large language models should be used for open-ended text generation in social simulations rather than constrained multiple-choice formats. While current LLM simulations predominantly use closed-ended structures for ease of scoring, this approach fails to leverage the generative capabilities of LLMs and risks collapsing nuanced opinions into predefined categories. The authors draw on survey methodology research to demonstrate how open-ended responses can improve measurement validity, reveal unanticipated views, reduce directive bias, capture expressiveness, and aid in pretesting. They propose novel evaluation frameworks that leverage the generative diversity of LLMs rather than constraining it.

## Method Summary
This conceptual position paper advocates for open-ended LLM social simulation without providing specific implementation details. The approach involves using open-ended prompts instead of closed-ended multiple-choice questions, leveraging the same autoregressive generation mechanism but allowing unconstrained free-form text responses. The paper maps eight benefits from survey methodology to LLM simulation: measurement validity, exploration of unknown answer spaces, improved question design through pretesting, reduced directive bias, enhanced engagement, capturing individuality, and methodological utility. No specific datasets, training procedures, or evaluation metrics are provided—the paper focuses on conceptual framework and use-cases rather than empirical implementation.

## Key Results
- Open-ended generation enables measurement of reasoning processes and internal consistency that closed formats miss
- Free-form text surfaces unanticipated perspectives and minority viewpoints that predefined response categories cannot capture
- Open-ended prompts reduce researcher-induced directive bias compared to closed formats

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Open-ended generation enables measurement of reasoning processes and internal consistency that closed formats miss.
- Mechanism: When LLMs produce free-form text in response to prompts, they must articulate justifications and contextual details. This allows researchers to assess whether synthetic outputs authentically reflect the simulated persona by inspecting the coherence between stated positions and their rationales.
- Core assumption: LLMs' articulation of reasoning reflects genuine reasoning processes rather than post-hoc rationalization or pattern matching from training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "free-form text that captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes 'in' LLMs"
  - [section 4.2]: "a conservative respondent might explain skepticism about climate change by citing economic priorities and shifting scientific claims, through an open-ended reasoning and explanation"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus evidence—related papers focus on simulation infrastructure rather than reasoning validation
- Break condition: If reasoning traces are systematically unfaithful (models fabricate plausible but non-representative justifications), the measurement benefit collapses.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Open-ended generation surfaces unanticipated perspectives and minority viewpoints that predefined response categories cannot capture.
- Mechanism: Without constrained options, models can express opinions and framings researchers did not enumerate. This enables discovery of emergent themes rather than confirmation of researcher-defined categories.
- Core assumption: The open answer space contains socially relevant viewpoints that researchers would not or could not anticipate a priori, and that LLMs can access and articulate these.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "free-form text captures nuanced opinions, minority viewpoints"
  - [section 4.1]: "open-ended questions are particularly useful when the full range of possible answers is unknown. They can surface new, unexpected, emergent, or rare perspectives"
  - [corpus]: Related work on echo chamber simulation suggests open-ended agent interaction reveals emergent group dynamics
- Break condition: If model outputs collapse into stereotypical patterns from training distributions, "emergent" views become artifacts of model biases rather than genuine discoveries.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Open-ended prompts reduce researcher-induced directive bias compared to closed formats.
- Mechanism: Closed-ended questions channel outputs toward predefined frames. Open-ended prompts allow models to generate their own framings and vocabularies, reducing selection bias from option design and ordering.
- Core assumption: Closed options inherently bias outputs by constraining response space; open formats sufficiently reduce this to yield more authentic expressions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: open-endedness "reduces directive bias"
  - [section 4.2]: "The choice of answer options and how it is presented can both affect the final results. Open-ended prompts mitigate this risk"
  - [corpus]: Related work on LLM sensitivity to option ordering (Pezeshkpour & Hruschka, 2024) supports that closed formats introduce artifacts
- Break condition: If prompts themselves carry sufficient framing bias through wording alone, the benefit is partial, not eliminated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Open-ended vs. closed-ended task design in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes that both formats use autoregressive generation—the distinction is in prompt structure (constrained vs. unconstrained), not the generation mechanism itself.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a multiple-choice LLM prompt still involves autoregressive text generation?

- Concept: **Qualitative coding (survey methodology sense)**
  - Why needed here: Open-ended outputs require systematic analysis. Coding means categorizing free responses into analytic categories with codebooks and intercoder reliability checks—not programming.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between "coding" in survey research versus in NLP/ML?

- Concept: **Synthetic population construction via conditioning**
  - Why needed here: Social simulation requires conditioning LLMs on demographic, ideological, or cultural profiles to approximate subgroup-specific opinions.
  - Quick check question: How would you validate that a "silicon sample" matches the opinion distribution of a real population?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Persona/profile conditioning module -> Open-ended prompt design layer -> Response collection and storage pipeline -> Analysis system -> Validation framework
- Critical path: Define simulation objectives → Design persona profiles → Create open-ended prompts (no predefined options) → Generate responses at scale → Apply coding/analysis methods → Validate against human data (distribution matching, coherence checks)
- Design tradeoffs: Richness vs. comparability (open-ended yields more nuance but harder to aggregate); discovery vs. measurement (exploratory vs. confirmatory goals); scalability vs. validation depth (more outputs require more sophisticated analysis)
- Failure signatures: (1) Stereotypical outputs—all personas produce similar phrasing despite different conditions; (2) Distribution mismatch—synthetic opinion distributions diverge from human baselines; (3) Coherence failures—stated positions contradict articulated reasoning; (4) Ethical risks—amplifying biases or generating harmful content without audit trails
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Format comparison pilot**: Run identical simulation with closed vs. open-ended formats; compare what each captures (expected: open-ended reveals reasoning and minority views missed by closed)
  2. **Coding reliability test**: Apply human coding scheme to open-ended outputs; measure intercoder reliability; if using LLM-as-coder, validate against human coders on subset
  3. **Distribution alignment check**: Compare open-ended response distributions (after coding) to human survey baselines; measure statistical matching (e.g., KL divergence, chi-square tests)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do open-ended prompts amplify, mitigate, or reshape representation biases (e.g., political leaning, WEIRD framings) compared to closed-ended formats?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 9 states, "whether open-ended responses amplify, mitigate, or simply reshape these biases remains an open question."
- Why unresolved: Current bias detection methods rely on closed-ended setups; the effect of free-form generation constraints on bias behavior is currently unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative empirical studies measuring bias metrics in both constrained and unconstrained outputs against human baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What multidimensional evaluation frameworks can effectively measure alignment in infinite open-ended responses beyond surface-level similarity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 argues that "Open-ended social simulation makes traditional NLP metrics such as ROUGE or BertScore inadequate."
- Why unresolved: Success in simulation is defined by authenticity and diversity rather than reference overlap, yet no standard benchmark exists for these qualities.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of evaluation frameworks capturing internal coherence, generative diversity (e.g., Sui Generis score), and statistical matching with human distributions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can comprehensive benchmarks be developed to pair human and synthetic open-ended responses for validating social simulation fidelity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 identifies a data scarcity problem and calls to "Develop comprehensive benchmarks that pair human and synthetic open-ended responses."
- Why unresolved: Most existing survey corpora lack naturally occurring open-text fields matched with demographic metadata, limiting ground-truth comparison.
- What evidence would resolve it: The release of purpose-built datasets containing rich metadata paired with free-text responses across diverse cultures.

## Limitations
- Paper is conceptual position piece without empirical validation, making claims contingent on unproven assumptions
- No specific datasets, evaluation protocols, or implementation details provided for practical deployment
- Uncertainty about whether LLMs can generate genuinely diverse reasoning processes rather than reproducing training data patterns

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The conceptual framing connecting survey methodology benefits to LLM simulation is well-grounded. The distinction between open and closed formats using the same autoregressive generation mechanism is technically sound.

**Medium confidence**: The argument that open-ended prompts reduce directive bias has support from related work on LLM sensitivity to option ordering, but the magnitude of this benefit in practice remains unclear.

**Low confidence**: Claims about open-endedness enabling discovery of "emergent" perspectives and authentic reasoning processes assume LLMs can generate novel, contextually appropriate viewpoints that weren't in their training data—an assumption not yet validated.

## Next Checks
1. **Format comparison experiment**: Run identical social simulation scenarios using parallel open-ended and closed-ended prompt sets with the same LLMs. Systematically compare what each format captures, focusing on reasoning depth, minority viewpoints, and emergent themes.

2. **Distribution alignment validation**: Compare open-ended response distributions (after coding) to human survey baselines using statistical measures like KL divergence and chi-square tests. This validates whether open-ended generation produces realistic variation.

3. **Reasoning coherence audit**: Manually inspect chains of reasoning in open-ended responses to verify that stated positions align with articulated justifications. Test whether reasoning traces reflect genuine internal consistency or post-hoc rationalization.
