# Understanding Cross Task Generalization in Handwriting-Based Alzheimer's Screening via Vision Language Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05841
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05841
- Authors: Changqing Gong; Huafeng Qin; Mounim A. El-Yacoubi
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter (CLFA) achieves mean zero-shot AUC of 69.1% on handwriting-based AD screening, outperforming MVFA baseline by +1.85%.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter (CLFA) framework for zero-shot Alzheimer's disease detection from handwriting, leveraging the vision-language model CLIP. The method uses lightweight multi-level adapters to progressively align visual representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. Extensive experiments on the DARWIN-RAW dataset reveal that tasks requiring continuous visuospatial control or sequential language-motor coordination yield the strongest discriminative signals for AD. The study systematically investigates cross-task generalization, demonstrating that the model can detect AD on tasks it was never trained on.

## Method Summary
The method uses CLIP ViT-L/14 as a frozen backbone with Cross-Layer Fusion Adapters inserted at layers 6, 12, 18, and 24. Each adapter contains a bottleneck projection (768 dimensions), depthwise 1D convolution for local context modeling, and cross-layer fusion with previous adapter outputs. The visual features are compared against text prototypes using cosine similarity in a zero-shot fashion. The framework is trained on 25 handwriting tasks from DARWIN-RAW (174 participants, 89 AD, 85 healthy) and evaluated through cross-task generalization experiments.

## Key Results
- CLFA achieves mean zero-shot AUC of 69.1% across cross-task evaluation
- Tasks requiring continuous visuospatial control show stronger discriminative power than discrete tasks
- Cross-layer fusion adapters improve performance by +1.85% over baseline MVFA
- Zero-shot inference works without task-specific fine-tuning, enabling flexible deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Layer Fusion for Hierarchical Stroke Alignment
The adapter at each layer receives fused descriptors from previous adapters, creating representations that link low-level kinematic irregularities with high-level semantic medical concepts. This hierarchical approach captures both micro-level tremor patterns and macro-level spatial planning deficits that characterize AD.

### Mechanism 2: Local Context Modeling via Tokenwise Depthwise Convolution
Depthwise 1D convolution along token sequences explicitly models relationships between adjacent visual tokens corresponding to continuous pen strokes. This captures "micro-level stability" and subtle tremor-like fluctuations that global attention mechanisms might miss.

### Mechanism 3: Residual Retargeting for Domain Translation
Softly blending adapted features into the frozen CLIP backbone (α=0.1) preserves pre-trained visual-semantic priors while gently steering them toward the medical domain. This prevents catastrophic forgetting and maintains alignment for zero-shot text matching.

## Foundational Learning

- **Vision-Language Models (CLIP):** Joint embedding space where visual features can be compared to text features. Why needed: Core architecture relies on aligned visual-text embeddings for zero-shot inference. Quick check: If visual encoder were not frozen, would text-visual alignment be preserved?

- **Adapter Tuning:** Lightweight parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large models. Why needed: Modifies massive CLIP using only bottleneck modules, preventing overfitting to small DARWIN dataset. Quick check: Why insert adapters at intermediate layers rather than just adding classification head?

- **Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection:** Detecting AD on tasks model was never trained on. Why needed: Simulates real-world deployment where new screening tasks may emerge. Quick check: How does model calculate anomaly score for unseen tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Rendered RGB image -> ViT-L/14 backbone -> Adapters (layers 6,12,18,24) -> Cosine similarity with text prototypes
- **Critical path:** Render trajectory to image → Extract patch tokens via ViT → Adapter Loop (Project → Conv → Fuse → Residual) → Compare final descriptor against Text Prototypes → Aggregate scores across layers
- **Design tradeoffs:** Bottleneck dimension (768) balances parameters vs stroke details; Residual coefficient (α=0.1) balances adaptation speed vs stability; Adapter layers balance kinematic vs semantic signals
- **Failure signatures:** Low AUC on unseen tasks suggests overfitting to training patterns; High variance across folds suggests unstable feature space; Random-guess performance suggests prompt misalignment
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Run 25×25 cross-task matrix to verify mean AUC and identify best task pairs 2) Disable cross-layer fusion to measure specific contribution 3) Vary residual scaling α to verify optimal steering

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can incorporating temporal dynamics of pen trajectories improve detection sensitivity compared to current 2D image-based rendering?
- Can integrating handwriting analysis with other digital biomarkers (speech, eye-tracking) improve robustness in vision-language framework?
- How does CLFA framework's performance generalize across diverse demographic backgrounds and varying hardware not represented in DARWIN?
- Can few-shot personalization strategies enhance accuracy for individual subjects without compromising cross-task generalization?

## Limitations
- DARWIN-RAW dataset limited to 174 participants, constraining statistical power and population-level generalizability
- Performance sensitive to prompt engineering choices, which are not fully disclosed in truncated template list
- Visual rendering pipeline may introduce artifacts that correlate more with preprocessing than actual AD biomarkers

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Residual retargeting prevents catastrophic forgetting | High |
| Cross-layer fusion improves cross-task generalization | Medium |
| Specific handwriting tasks contain inherently stronger AD signals | Low |

## Next Checks
1. **Task-specific biomarker isolation:** Vary only kinematic features within same task type to determine if generalization stems from motor dynamics rather than task semantics
2. **Prompt sensitivity analysis:** Systematically ablate and permute text prompt templates to measure AUC variance across semantically equivalent prompts
3. **Sample efficiency test:** Retrain CLFA on progressively smaller subsets (50%, 25%, 10%) to quantify overfitting risk and minimum sample size for robust generalization
