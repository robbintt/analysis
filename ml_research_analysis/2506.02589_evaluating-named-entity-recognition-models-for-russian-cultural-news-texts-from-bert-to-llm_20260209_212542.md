# Evaluating Named Entity Recognition Models for Russian Cultural News Texts: From BERT to LLM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02589
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02589
- Authors: Maria Levchenko
- Reference count: 9
- One-line primary result: GPT-4.1 achieves F1=0.94 on Russian cultural news NER, outperforming specialized transformer models and eliminating the need for structured output prompting.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates NER models for extracting person names from Russian cultural news texts using the SPbLitGuide dataset. It compares transformer-based models (DeepPavlov, RoBERTa, SpaCy) with LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1) on a manually annotated sample of 1,000 records. GPT-4.1 achieves the highest F1 score of 0.94 using both simple and JSON-formatted prompts, demonstrating that structured output prompting is no longer necessary. The study shows LLMs outperform traditional models on this challenging morphologically-rich language task, with GPT-4.1 eliminating the precision-recall trade-off and simplifying deployment requirements.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates zero-shot NER performance on 1,000 manually annotated Russian cultural news records from the SPbLitGuide dataset. Models tested include transformer-based architectures (DeepPavlov BERT variants, RoBERTa Large, SpaCy Russian) and OpenAI LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1). Two prompting strategies are used for LLMs: simple API requests and JSON-formatted outputs via LangChain/Pydantic. Performance is measured using precision, recall, and F1-score by comparing model outputs against gold standard annotations. The dataset contains 5,611 PERSON labels and is available at Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.13753154.

## Key Results
- GPT-4.1 achieves F1=0.94, outperforming RoBERTa (0.84) and DeepPavlov (0.78)
- GPT-4o with JSON prompts scores 0.93 F1, while GPT-4.1 achieves 0.94 with simple prompts
- GPT-4-turbo achieves 0.99 precision but lower recall (0.69), highlighting precision-recall trade-offs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** High-parameter LLMs outperform specialized transformer-based models on morphologically rich languages (MRLs) in zero-shot settings, provided the model version is sufficiently recent.
- **Mechanism:** Large-scale pre-training likely encodes complex inflectional patterns (e.g., Russian case variations) more effectively than the smaller datasets used by models like DeepPavlov or RoBERTa.
- **Core assumption:** The superior performance stems from implicit linguistic knowledge in the model weights rather than overfitting to general web data.
- **Evidence anchors:** GPT-4.1 achieves F1=0.94, outperforming RoBERTa (0.84) and DeepPavlov (0.78). "Recent LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, can achieve state-of-the-art performance... Roberta Large... was the strongest among the non-LLM transformers."
- **Break condition:** Performance degrades on highly specialized sub-domains or rare dialects not well-represented in the pre-training data.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Advancements in model architecture (specifically GPT-4.1) reduce the necessity of structured output prompting (JSON) for optimal extraction quality.
- **Mechanism:** Improved instruction following and semantic grounding allow the model to maintain focus on the extraction task without the "scaffolding" of a rigid JSON schema.
- **Core assumption:** The convergence of simple vs. JSON prompt scores implies robust internal reasoning, rather than a ceiling effect of the benchmark.
- **Evidence anchors:** "GPT-4.1 achieves F1=0.94... demonstrating that structured output prompting is no longer necessary." GPT-4o needed JSON for best results (0.93), while GPT-4.1 achieves 0.94 with simple prompts.
- **Break condition:** If downstream parsing logic requires strict schema adherence, the "simple prompt" output may still fail integration tests even if extraction accuracy is high.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Entity disambiguation in ambiguous contexts (e.g., names in street addresses vs. person names) is solved via higher recall calibration in newer models rather than pure conservative precision.
- **Mechanism:** GPT-4-turbo optimizes for safety via conservative predictions (P=0.99), whereas GPT-4.1 balances the probability distribution to capture edge cases (R=0.95) without significant precision loss.
- **Core assumption:** The remaining 6% error rate is dominated by contextual ambiguity rather than simple token recognition failure.
- **Evidence anchors:** Discusses disambiguation challenges like " ул. Достоевского " (Dostoevsky St.); notes GPT-4's conservatism vs. GPT-4o's broader coverage. GPT-4-turbo (P=0.99, R=0.69) vs. GPT-4.1 (P=0.94, R=0.95).
- **Break condition:** In domains where false positives carry a high penalty, the slight recall gain of GPT-4.1 may not justify the drop from 0.99 precision.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs)
  - **Why needed here:** Russian uses complex inflections (cases) that change name spellings (e.g., *Matyushkina* vs. *Matyushkine*). Standard NLP tokenizers often fail here without subword handling or large context windows.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a standard English NER model might fail to link "Ivan" and "Ivana" as the same entity stem in a Russian text context?

- **Concept:** Precision-Recall Trade-off
  - **Why needed here:** The paper highlights distinct profiles: GPT-4-turbo misses valid entities to avoid mistakes (High Precision), while GPT-4.1 captures more but risks minor errors (High Recall).
  - **Quick check question:** If your goal is to build a definitive archive of every cultural figure mentioned, which metric (P or R) should you prioritize, and which model from the paper fits best?

- **Concept:** Zero-shot vs. Fine-tuned Extraction
  - **Why needed here:** The study evaluates models "as they are" (zero-shot) against fine-tuned architectures (RoBERTa/DeepPavlov), demonstrating that LLMs can now skip the fine-tuning step for this domain.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the operational cost difference between calling a GPT-4.1 API (zero-shot) versus hosting a fine-tuned BERT model on a CPU?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (1,000 raw Russian text records) -> Processor (API-based LLM or Local Transformer) -> Parser (LangChain/Pydantic for mapping text output to JSONL spans) -> Evaluator (Alignment logic comparing model offsets against manual Doccano annotations)

- **Critical path:** The **Output Alignment** step. Raw LLM text outputs must be precisely mapped back to character indices in the original text to calculate F1 scores against the gold standard.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Cost vs. Accuracy: SpaCy (CPU efficient, F1 0.83) vs. GPT-4.1 (API cost, F1 0.94)
  - Prompt Complexity: GPT-4.1 allows simple prompts; GPT-4o requires JSON enforcement for peak performance, adding parsing complexity

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Context Confusion: Extracting "Pushkin" from "Pushkin House" (organization) as a Person entity
  - Transliteration Gaps: Missing non-standard spellings (e.g., artistic pseudonyms like "Lena Smirno") if the model relies on formal name training data

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Test:** Run SpaCy Russian Pipeline on a 50-record sample to establish a speed baseline and verify environment setup
  2. **Prompt A/B Test:** Compare GPT-4.1 "Simple Prompt" vs. "JSON Prompt" on 100 records to verify the paper's claim that JSON is no longer needed (check for parsing errors vs. extraction misses)
  3. **Ambiguity Stress Test:** Curate 20 examples of "names in addresses" (e.g., "ul. Dostoevskogo") and compare GPT-4-turbo (Precision focus) vs. GPT-4.1 (Recall focus) handling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can entity linking algorithms effectively resolve and normalize the diverse morphological forms and pseudonyms of person names in Russian cultural texts to canonical identities? (The authors identify "automatic alignment of person mentions" and linking different written forms to a single entity as a "primary direction" for future work.)

- **Open Question 2:** Can domain-specific fine-tuning of smaller, open-source models (like RoBERTa or DeepPavlov) enable them to match or surpass the zero-shot performance of proprietary LLMs like GPT-4.1 on this task? (The authors note that models were evaluated "as they are" without fine-tuning and suggest that "fine-tuning... could potentially improve the performance of many models.")

- **Open Question 3:** How does model performance fluctuate when expanding the annotation scope beyond "PERSON" entities to include complex types like organizations, locations, and works of art? (The authors list "expanding the scope of entity types recognized beyond 'PERSON'" as a specific avenue for future research.)

## Limitations

- Data Domain Specificity: The SPbLitGuide dataset covers Russian cultural news from 1999-2019, which may not generalize to other domains (e.g., medical, legal, or modern social media text).

- Reproducibility Constraints: Exact prompt formulations and entity matching criteria are not fully specified, which could affect reported F1 scores.

- Cost-Benefit Analysis Gap: The paper lacks explicit cost-per-record analysis comparing API-based LLMs versus local transformer deployment.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** GPT-4.1 achieving 0.94 F1 score represents the best performance in the study.
- **Medium Confidence:** The assertion that structured output prompting is "no longer necessary" requires cautious interpretation.
- **Low Confidence:** The mechanism explanation for why GPT-4.1 outperforms GPT-4o remains speculative.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Evaluate the same models on a non-cultural Russian text corpus to verify whether GPT-4.1's performance advantage persists across different semantic domains.

2. **Cost-Performance Trade-off Analysis:** Calculate the cost-per-accurate-entity for each model to determine if GPT-4.1's 0.94 F1 justifies its expense compared to cheaper alternatives.

3. **Prompt Robustness Evaluation:** Systematically vary prompt wording for GPT-4.1 using the "simple" approach to measure performance variance and test whether the claimed prompt convergence is robust.
