# Diffusion-based Surrogate Model for Time-varying Underwater Acoustic Channels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18078
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18078
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces StableUASim, a pre-trained conditional latent diffusion model for simulating time-varying underwater acoustic channels.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents StableUASim, a generative model for time-varying underwater acoustic channels that combines latent compression with conditional diffusion. The approach addresses the challenge of generating realistic channel impulse responses (CIRs) that capture multipath propagation, fading, and Doppler effects critical for underwater communication system design. By pre-training on simulated data and adapting to real environments with minimal measurements, the model achieves superior performance in generating diverse, statistically accurate channels compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage approach: first, an LSTM autoencoder compresses high-dimensional complex-valued CIRs into a compact latent representation; then a conditional diffusion model learns to generate diverse channel realizations conditioned on observed measurements. Pre-training on simulated data enables rapid adaptation to new environments using minimal real-world measurements. The architecture processes 20×250 complex-valued TVIRs by converting them to real-valued sequences (amplitude, sin/cos phase), compresses to 128-dim latent space, and uses a 100-step denoising diffusion process to generate realistic channels.

## Key Results
- StableUASim achieves superior bit error rate predictions compared to state-of-the-art generative models and stochastic replay methods
- The model accurately reproduces key channel characteristics and communication performance metrics across real-world datasets
- With as few as 1-25 real recordings, StableUASim successfully adapts to new environments while maintaining statistical fidelity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Compression of Complex-Valued Sequences
The architecture uses a Bi-LSTM autoencoder to exploit sparsity and temporal correlation in underwater channels, converting complex CIRs into a compact 128-dim latent space while preserving temporal phase and amplitude dynamics. This achieves compression ratios of approximately 78× (latent) to 46,800× (effective) without losing communication-critical features.

### Mechanism 2: Conditional Diffusion for Stochastic Diversity
The conditional denoising process in latent space captures stochastic channel variations more robustly than GANs, allowing generation of diverse realizations from limited observations. The model iteratively refines random Gaussian noise into coherent latent channel representations over 100 steps, learning the distribution of channel variations.

### Mechanism 3: Sim-to-Real Transfer via Pre-training
Pre-training on physics-based simulated data provides a strong prior for channel physics, enabling the model to adapt to new real-world environments with minimal fine-tuning data. This approach leverages 1 million simulated TVIRs to create baseline understanding of acoustic propagation, which can be rapidly adjusted to match specific environmental statistics.

## Foundational Learning

**Time-Varying Impulse Response (TVIR)**
- Why needed: This is the fundamental data unit; understanding TVIR = [Time x Delay] matrix is crucial for understanding why LSTMs (time) and Diffusion (stochasticity) are used
- Quick check: How does the dimension of the input TVIR (20×250 complex values) change when processed by the encoder?

**Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)**
- Why needed: The core generative engine; unlike GANs which map noise to data in one shot, diffusion models iteratively denoise data
- Quick check: Why is the diffusion process applied to the latent vector z rather than the raw TVIR signal directly?

**Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)**
- Why needed: The compression mechanism; processes time-sequence of channel snapshots in both directions to capture temporal context
- Quick check: In the autoencoder, why is a bidirectional architecture preferred over a unidirectional one for processing CIR sequences?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Input Pre-processor → Bi-LSTM Autoencoder (Encoder E→Latent z→Decoder D) → Diffusion Denoiser (FCN with residual connections) → Generated TVIR

**Critical path:**
Conditional Input → Encoder → Latent z_c → Concatenate with Noise → Denoiser Loop (100 steps) → Decoder → Generated TVIR

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Compression vs Fidelity: Aggressive latent compression (46,800× effective) speeds up diffusion but risks losing fine-grained phase details required for high-order modulation
- Simulation vs Reality: Pre-training on clean simulations ensures robust priors but requires noisy fine-tuning or augmentation to handle real-world background noise
- Steps vs Speed: 100 denoising steps ensures high-quality generation but introduces latency unsuitable for real-time hardware-in-the-loop testing

**Failure signatures:**
- Phase Jumps: Autoencoder failure to learn sin/cos relationship leads to phase discontinuities, destroying OFDM subcarrier orthogonality
- Mode Collapse (Diffusion): Weak conditioning or small training data may generate "average" channel rather than diverse realizations
- BER Mismatch: Generated channels "easier" than reality leads to lower simulated BER than measured BER

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Train Autoencoder on simulated data; verify D(E(X)) preserves amplitude and phase of test TVIRs visually and via L_phase metric
2. Pre-train Diffusion model to predict second half of TVIR given first half (conditional generation) on simulated data
3. Fine-tune pre-trained model on single real recording; evaluate if statistical distribution of generated channels matches full dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Can training objectives be redesigned to explicitly optimize for communication-relevant metrics (e.g., Bit Error Rate, Doppler dynamics) rather than just signal reconstruction fidelity?**
The current loss functions prioritize general signal fidelity, potentially overlooking specific errors that significantly impact end-to-end communication performance. Comparative evaluations showing models trained with task-specific loss functions yield superior BER prediction accuracy would resolve this.

**How can the architecture be modified to support dynamic sequence lengths and delay spreads to handle channels with much longer multipath?**
The fixed-dimensional constraint limits the model's applicability to diverse environments where delay spreads exceed the pre-configured setup. Successful training and deployment of a model variant that processes variable-length inputs without truncation would address this.

**Would replacing the LSTM autoencoder with a transformer architecture improve the modeling of long-term temporal dependencies and variable-length inputs?**
While LSTMs handle sequential data, they may struggle with very long-term dependencies compared to attention mechanisms. Ablation studies comparing LSTM versus Transformer-based models on long-duration TVIR generation tasks would provide evidence.

**Can incorporating structured environmental descriptors (e.g., water depth, seabed properties) enable the model to generalize to unseen environments without requiring fine-tuning on local measurements?**
The current model relies on conditioning on observed measurements; it cannot yet generate channels solely from physical environmental parameters. Generation of accurate channel realizations for new, unmeasured environments using only physical descriptors would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Sim-to-real gap effectiveness depends on simulation fidelity and may vary across diverse environments
- Latent space compression may lose information critical for high-order modulation schemes
- 100-step denoising process introduces computational overhead unsuitable for real-time applications

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Core methodology of latent diffusion for conditional channel generation is sound with strong quantitative results
- Medium Confidence: Sim-to-real transfer mechanism plausible but relies on unvalidated assumptions about simulation fidelity
- Medium Confidence: Choice of 128 latent dimensions and 100 denoising steps appears justified but lacks ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Test StableUASim on a third real-world dataset from a significantly different environment to quantify simulation prior generalization
2. Conduct ablation study varying latent dimension (64, 128, 256) to identify optimal compression-fidelity tradeoff
3. Profile denoising network runtime and explore reducing steps (50, 25) or using progressive sampling for real-time feasibility
