# Doc2AHP: Inferring Structured Multi-Criteria Decision Models via Semantic Trees with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.16479
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16479
- **Reference count:** 6
- **Primary result:** Automated AHP model construction from unstructured documents with high downstream accuracy and perfect consistency

## Executive Summary
Doc2AHP introduces a novel framework for automatically constructing Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) multi-criteria decision models from unstructured documents, eliminating the need for extensive expert annotation. The approach uses hierarchical clustering of document embeddings to extract a structurally sound AHP hierarchy, followed by a multi-agent collaborative weighting mechanism with adaptive consistency optimization to derive mathematically rigorous, consistent weights. By enforcing AHP's logical constraints during model building, Doc2AHP ensures both semantic coherence and numerical reliability while scaling up AHP applications to real-world scenarios.

## Method Summary
The Doc2AHP framework operates in two phases: hierarchical clustering of document embeddings to construct the AHP hierarchy structure, and a multi-agent collaborative weighting mechanism with adaptive consistency optimization to derive pairwise comparison matrices and weights. The system leverages large language models to extract semantic relationships from unstructured documents, clustering similar criteria and alternatives to form a coherent hierarchy. The weighting phase employs multiple specialized agents that work collaboratively to generate pairwise comparisons while an adaptive optimization process ensures the resulting weights satisfy AHP's consistency requirements. This approach maintains mathematical rigor while automating what traditionally required extensive expert input.

## Key Results
- Achieved NDCG@5 scores up to 0.993 on three real-world datasets (IMDb, HotelRec, Beer Advocate)
- Maintained perfect consistency across both lightweight and heavyweight language models
- Outperformed direct-generation baselines in both interpretability and task performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Doc2AHP succeeds by combining semantic understanding of unstructured documents with AHP's mathematical rigor. The hierarchical clustering phase captures the natural structure of decision criteria from document embeddings, while the multi-agent collaborative weighting mechanism distributes the complexity of pairwise comparison generation. The adaptive consistency optimization ensures that the derived weights satisfy AHP's logical constraints, preventing inconsistencies that would undermine decision quality. By building the hierarchy directly from semantic relationships rather than manual specification, the framework scales AHP to real-world applications while maintaining mathematical soundness.

## Foundational Learning
**Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** - A structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions using pairwise comparisons and hierarchical decomposition. *Why needed:* Provides the mathematical framework for consistent multi-criteria decision making. *Quick check:* Verify that the pairwise comparison matrix satisfies consistency ratio requirements.

**Hierarchical clustering** - An unsupervised learning approach that builds a hierarchy of clusters from data points. *Why needed:* Extracts the natural structure of decision criteria from document embeddings. *Quick check:* Confirm that semantically similar criteria are grouped together in the hierarchy.

**Multi-agent systems** - Collaborative AI systems where multiple specialized agents work together to solve complex problems. *Why needed:* Distributes the complexity of pairwise comparison generation across specialized components. *Quick check:* Verify that agent outputs are properly coordinated and consistent.

**Pairwise comparison matrices** - Square matrices where each entry represents the relative importance of one criterion over another. *Why needed:* Forms the mathematical basis for deriving consistent weights in AHP. *Quick check:* Ensure matrix entries follow the reciprocal property (a_ij = 1/a_ji).

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Document -> Embedding Model -> Hierarchical Clustering -> Semantic Tree Construction -> Multi-Agent System -> Pairwise Comparisons -> Consistency Optimization -> AHP Model

**Critical path:** Document embedding and hierarchical clustering form the foundation, followed by semantic tree construction, then multi-agent weighting with consistency optimization.

**Design tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational complexity for automation and scalability, relying on LLMs for semantic understanding rather than manual expert input.

**Failure signatures:** Inconsistent pairwise comparisons, semantically disconnected hierarchy levels, or clustering that fails to capture domain-specific relationships.

**First experiments:**
1. Test hierarchical clustering on a small document set to verify semantic grouping quality
2. Validate pairwise comparison generation with a known consistent example
3. Measure consistency ratio on a simple two-level hierarchy before scaling up

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The computational complexity of consistency optimization for large hierarchies is not addressed
- Reliance on LLMs introduces uncertainty about generalization to domains with different vocabularies or structural patterns
- The framework lacks comparison to established AHP tools and domain-specific benchmarks

## Confidence
- Downstream accuracy claims: Medium
- Consistency results: Medium
- Generalizability claims: Low

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the experiments on an additional dataset from a different domain (e.g., medical treatment selection) to test cross-domain generalization
2. Compare Doc2AHP's computational efficiency and scalability against traditional AHP software tools for large hierarchies
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the consistency optimization to quantify its impact on both decision accuracy and processing time
