# Investigating Intersectional Bias in Large Language Models using Confidence Disparities in Coreference Resolution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.07111
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07111
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: Introduces WinoIdentity benchmark revealing 40% confidence disparities in LLMs across demographic markers

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces WinoIdentity, a new benchmark for evaluating intersectional bias in large language models through uncertainty-aware coreference resolution. The authors augment the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10 attributes to create 245,700 prompts evaluating 50 intersectional bias patterns. They propose Coreference Confidence Disparity as a group fairness metric measuring confidence differences across demographic subgroups. Evaluating five LLMs, they find confidence disparities as high as 40% for body type, sexual orientation, and socio-economic status, with doubly-disadvantaged identities showing highest uncertainty in anti-stereotypical contexts. Surprisingly, even hegemonic markers like "White" and "cisgender" show decreased confidence, suggesting LLMs rely on memorization rather than reasoning.

## Method Summary
The authors developed WinoIdentity by augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10 attributes (age, nationality, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, and socio-economic status). This created 245,700 prompts evaluating 50 intersectional bias patterns. The Coreference Confidence Disparity metric measures confidence differences across demographic subgroups by comparing LLM confidence scores for coreference resolution tasks. The benchmark evaluates whether LLMs can correctly resolve pronouns in contexts that challenge stereotypical associations between demographic markers and occupations.

## Key Results
- Confidence disparities reached 40% for body type, sexual orientation, and socio-economic status markers
- Doubly-disadvantaged identities showed highest uncertainty in anti-stereotypical contexts
- Even hegemonic markers like "White" and "cisgender" showed decreased confidence, suggesting memorization-based rather than reasoning-based responses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by measuring confidence disparities in coreference resolution tasks where demographic markers intersect with stereotypical contexts. When LLMs encounter prompts that challenge their learned associations between demographic groups and social roles, they exhibit uncertainty through lower confidence scores. This uncertainty reveals the model's reliance on memorized patterns rather than genuine reasoning about intersectional identities. The coreference resolution task is particularly effective because it requires understanding relationships between entities while accounting for demographic context.

## Foundational Learning
- **Coreference resolution**: Why needed - to understand how LLMs connect pronouns to entities; Quick check - models should correctly resolve "she" to the appropriate female character
- **Intersectional bias**: Why needed - to capture compound discrimination across multiple identity dimensions; Quick check - doubly-disadvantaged groups should show distinct patterns from single-dimension biases
- **Confidence calibration**: Why needed - to measure model uncertainty as a proxy for reasoning quality; Quick check - calibrated models should show consistent confidence across similar difficulty tasks
- **Group fairness metrics**: Why needed - to quantify disparities across demographic subgroups; Quick check - metric should capture systematic differences beyond random variation
- **WinoBias framework**: Why needed - provides established benchmark for gender bias in coreference; Quick check - should reproduce known gender bias patterns before adding intersectional dimensions

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: WinoBias dataset -> Demographic marker augmentation -> Prompt generation -> LLM evaluation -> Confidence score extraction -> Disparity calculation
Critical path: Prompt generation and LLM evaluation form the bottleneck, as each of 245,700 prompts requires individual LLM inference
Design tradeoffs: Broad demographic coverage versus prompt complexity; measured confidence disparity versus qualitative assessment of reasoning
Failure signatures: Uniform confidence across all groups suggests insufficient sensitivity; extremely high confidence in anti-stereotypical contexts suggests memorization over reasoning
First experiments: 1) Test with single demographic markers before intersectional combinations; 2) Compare confidence across stereotypical versus anti-stereotypical contexts; 3) Validate that confidence disparities correlate with human judgment of task difficulty

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The Coreference Confidence Disparity metric may conflate actual bias with other uncertainty sources like prompt ambiguity
- Evaluation focused on five LLMs without specifying zero-shot versus few-shot settings
- Demographic markers may not capture full complexity of real-world intersectional identities

## Confidence
- High confidence: Existence of measurable confidence disparities across demographic groups
- Medium confidence: Interpretation that disparities primarily reflect intersectional bias rather than other factors
- Medium confidence: Conclusion that doubly-disadvantaged identities show highest uncertainty in anti-stereotypical contexts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate whether confidence disparities stem from intersectional bias versus other uncertainty sources
2. Validate findings across broader range of LLMs with different training approaches and datasets
3. Implement human evaluation studies to assess whether confidence disparities correlate with actual reasoning quality differences across demographic groups
