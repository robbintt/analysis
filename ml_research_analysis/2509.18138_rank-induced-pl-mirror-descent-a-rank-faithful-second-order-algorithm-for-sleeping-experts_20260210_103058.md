core_contribution: This paper introduces Rank-Induced PL Mirror Descent (RIPLM), a
  new algorithm for the sleeping experts problem that maintains rank-faithfulness
  while achieving variance-adaptive regret bounds. The key insight is that RIPLM updates
  directly in the rank-induced Plackett-Luce parameterization rather than over expert

# Rank-Induced PL Mirror Descent: A Rank-Faithful Second-Order Algorithm for Sleeping Experts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.18138
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18138
- **Reference count:** 20
- **Primary result:** First algorithm achieving both rank-faithfulness and variance-adaptive regret bounds in sleeping experts setting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Rank-Induced PL Mirror Descent (RIPLM), a novel algorithm for the sleeping experts problem that maintains rank-faithfulness while achieving variance-adaptive regret bounds. The key innovation lies in updating directly in the rank-induced Plackett-Luce parameterization rather than over expert identities, ensuring played distributions remain within the rank-induced distribution class at every round. The algorithm leverages centered residuals with AdaGrad scaling to achieve second-order regret bounds of O(√V_T log N + ln ln T), matching minimax lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. RIPLM represents the first algorithm simultaneously achieving rank-faithfulness and variance adaptivity in the sleeping experts setting.

## Method Summary
RIPLM operates by performing mirror descent updates in the rank-induced Plackett-Luce parameterization space, which naturally captures the structure of rank-based comparisons. The algorithm uses centered residuals—the difference between observed losses and their mean—to decorrelate the loss signals, combined with AdaGrad-style adaptive learning rates that scale according to the cumulative variance. By working directly in the rank-induced space rather than the expert space, RIPLM ensures that the predicted distributions always lie within the feasible set of rank-induced distributions. The mirror descent framework provides stability while the centered residual structure enables variance adaptation, resulting in second-order regret bounds that depend on the cumulative variance V_T rather than just the time horizon T.

## Key Results
- Achieves second-order regret bound of O(√V_T log N + ln ln T), matching minimax lower bounds up to logarithmic factors
- First algorithm simultaneously maintaining rank-faithfulness (remaining within rank-induced distribution class) and variance adaptivity
- Establishes matching lower bound of Ω(√V_T log N), proving the algorithm's regret bound is essentially tight
- Demonstrates that rank-induced parameterization enables both theoretical guarantees and practical implementation benefits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm's effectiveness stems from three key mechanisms: First, the rank-induced Plackett-Luce parameterization ensures that all predictions remain within the valid space of rank distributions, addressing the rank-faithfulness requirement. Second, centered residuals remove the correlation structure inherent in pairwise comparisons, allowing the algorithm to adapt to the actual variance in the loss signals rather than being misled by their structure. Third, AdaGrad scaling provides automatic adaptation to the observed variance, concentrating updates when uncertainty is low and being more conservative when uncertainty is high. The combination of these elements enables the algorithm to achieve variance-adaptive bounds while maintaining the critical rank-faithfulness property.

## Foundational Learning

**Rank-Induced Distributions:** Probability distributions over permutations induced by ranking models like Plackett-Luce. *Why needed:* The sleeping experts problem involves rank-based comparisons, so working directly in this space preserves the problem structure. *Quick check:* Verify that the algorithm's predictions can be interpreted as valid probability distributions over rankings.

**Centered Residuals:** The difference between observed losses and their mean across alternatives. *Why needed:* Removes correlation structure from pairwise comparisons, enabling proper variance estimation. *Quick check:* Confirm that centering preserves the unbiasedness of loss estimates while decorrelating them.

**AdaGrad Scaling:** Adaptive learning rate that grows with the cumulative squared gradients. *Why needed:* Provides automatic variance adaptation without prior knowledge of the loss variance. *Quick check:* Verify that the learning rate appropriately scales with observed variance over time.

**Mirror Descent:** Optimization framework using Bregman divergences for updates in non-Euclidean spaces. *Why needed:* Enables stable updates in the rank-induced parameterization while respecting the manifold structure. *Quick check:* Confirm that updates remain within the feasible set of rank-induced distributions.

**Sleeping Experts Framework:** Extension of multi-armed bandits where experts can be unavailable at different rounds. *Why needed:* Models realistic scenarios where not all actions are available at all times. *Quick check:* Verify that the algorithm handles availability constraints correctly.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input losses → Centering operation → AdaGrad variance tracking → Mirror descent update in rank-induced space → Output rank distribution

**Critical Path:** At each round: receive available experts → compute centered residuals → update AdaGrad accumulators → perform mirror descent step → output rank distribution

**Design Tradeoffs:** Rank-induced parameterization ensures feasibility but increases computational complexity compared to working in expert space. Centered residuals improve variance adaptation but require maintaining additional state. AdaGrad provides automatic adaptation but may over-regularize in highly non-stationary environments.

**Failure Signatures:** If the algorithm outputs invalid distributions, check the mirror descent implementation. If regret bounds are not achieved, verify the centering operation is correctly implemented. Poor performance in low-variance settings may indicate AdaGrad is over-regularizing.

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify that algorithm outputs remain valid rank-induced distributions across all rounds
2. Test performance on synthetic data with known variance structure to validate variance adaptation
3. Compare regret against benchmark algorithms on standard sleeping experts datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical assumptions require bounded loss gradients and specific structure of sleeping experts setting
- Performance in non-stationary or adversarial environments beyond established framework remains unclear
- Computational overhead of maintaining rank-induced distributions and computing centered residuals may be substantial in high-dimensional settings

## Confidence
- **Regret bound tightness (High):** Matching upper and lower bounds demonstrate theoretical optimality
- **Novelty of rank-faithfulness (Medium):** Literature review supports claim, though specialized problem class requires careful verification
- **Practical implementation (Medium):** Algorithm structure is clear but computational complexity in large-scale settings needs empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Empirical evaluation comparing RIPLM against state-of-the-art sleeping experts algorithms across diverse problem instances with varying levels of variance
2. Extension of theoretical analysis to verify robustness under gradient noise and approximate computation of centered residuals
3. Investigation of computational complexity and memory requirements as the number of experts N grows large, particularly for online implementations
