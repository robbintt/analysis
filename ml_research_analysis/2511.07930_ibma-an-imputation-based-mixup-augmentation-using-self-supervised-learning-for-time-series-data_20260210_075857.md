# IBMA: An Imputation-Based Mixup Augmentation Using Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.07930
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07930
- **Reference count:** 7
- **Primary result:** Introduces IMA, a novel data augmentation method combining self-supervised imputation with Mixup interpolation for time series forecasting, achieving 22 out of 24 improvements across three datasets and three models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Imputation-based Mixup Augmentation (IMA), a novel data augmentation technique for time series forecasting that leverages self-supervised imputation to reconstruct masked sequences, followed by Mixup interpolation to blend augmented samples. By addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in time series forecasting, IMA aims to enhance model generalization and performance across diverse forecasting tasks. The method combines the strengths of imputation-based augmentation (handling missing data) with Mixup's interpolation capabilities to create more robust and diverse training samples.

## Method Summary
IMA operates through a two-stage process: first, self-supervised imputation is used to reconstruct masked portions of time series sequences, treating the imputation task as a pretext learning objective. Second, the reconstructed sequences are blended using Mixup interpolation, where convex combinations of pairs of augmented samples create new synthetic examples. This approach allows the model to learn from both the original data distribution and the interpolated space, capturing complex temporal patterns while maintaining temporal coherence. The method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing forecasting pipelines without architectural modifications.

## Key Results
- IMA achieved improvements in 22 out of 24 experimental comparisons across three datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Illness, Exchange Rate)
- The method produced 10 best-case results when compared to baseline augmentation techniques
- iTransformer model showed particularly strong performance with IMA, demonstrating the method's effectiveness across different model architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
IMA works by leveraging the complementary strengths of imputation and Mixup augmentation. The self-supervised imputation stage forces the model to learn robust representations of temporal patterns by reconstructing missing or masked sequences, which improves its ability to capture underlying data distributions. The subsequent Mixup interpolation then creates novel synthetic samples by blending these learned representations, effectively expanding the training data manifold. This combination allows the model to generalize better to unseen patterns while maintaining the temporal coherence essential for time series forecasting.

## Foundational Learning

**Time Series Forecasting**
- Why needed: Understanding sequential dependencies and temporal patterns is crucial for predicting future values
- Quick check: Can identify seasonality, trends, and autocorrelation structures in univariate time series

**Mixup Augmentation**
- Why needed: Interpolation-based methods create synthetic samples that improve model generalization
- Quick check: Understands how convex combinations of data points can smooth decision boundaries

**Self-Supervised Imputation**
- Why needed: Learning to reconstruct missing data serves as effective pretext task for representation learning
- Quick check: Can implement sequence masking and reconstruction using temporal models

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Time Series Data -> Imputation Module -> Mixup Module -> Augmented Dataset -> Forecasting Model

**Critical Path:** Masked Time Series → Imputation Network → Reconstructed Sequences → Mixup Blending → Training Data Augmentation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational overhead vs. performance gains from two-stage augmentation
- Imputation accuracy vs. quality of Mixup interpolations
- Masking ratio selection balancing data preservation and augmentation diversity

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor imputation quality leading to noisy Mixup samples
- Overfitting to synthetic data when interpolation becomes too aggressive
- Temporal incoherence in blended sequences disrupting forecasting accuracy

**First Experiments:**
1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate forecasting performance without any augmentation
2. Ablation study: Test imputation-only and Mixup-only variants to isolate individual contributions
3. Masking ratio sensitivity: Systematically vary the percentage of masked data to find optimal imputation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on accurate imputation: If self-supervised imputation fails to properly reconstruct masked sequences, the subsequent Mixup interpolation could propagate errors and degrade performance
- Computational overhead: The two-stage process (imputation followed by Mixup) introduces additional training time and resource requirements not thoroughly analyzed
- Limited evaluation scope: Experiments focus on univariate time series forecasting with specific model architectures, leaving effectiveness on multivariate data and other domains unexplored

## Confidence

**Major Claims:**
- IMA consistently improves forecasting performance across multiple datasets and models: **High confidence**
- Combining imputation with Mixup creates synergistic benefits: **Medium confidence**
- Method is generalizable across different forecasting architectures: **Medium confidence**

## Next Checks

1. **Computational efficiency analysis**: Conduct detailed study comparing training time, memory usage, and inference latency of models trained with IMA versus baselines across different hardware configurations and dataset sizes

2. **Robustness testing under varying missing data rates**: Systematically evaluate IMA's performance across different percentages of missing data (0% to 50%) to determine thresholds where imputation quality degrades significantly

3. **Generalization to multivariate and cross-domain forecasting**: Extend experimental evaluation to multivariate time series datasets from different domains (healthcare monitoring, financial markets, sensor networks) and test effectiveness across diverse temporal patterns and correlation structures
