# LLM-Supported Formal Knowledge Representation for Enhancing Control Engineering Content with an Interactive Semantic Layer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.02759
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02759
- Reference count: 7
- Demonstrates transformation of textbook content into interactive semantic layer with 700+ tooltip elements

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an LLM-supported approach for creating formal knowledge representations in control engineering by converting LaTeX source code into structured knowledge graphs. The method employs a two-step process: first transforming mathematical content into Formal Natural Language (FNL) with LLM assistance, then algorithmically generating PyIRK code for knowledge graph construction. Applied to textbook sections on mathematical preliminaries and PID controllers, the approach creates an "interactive semantic layer" where readers can hover over technical terms to access additional context and explanations.

The authors argue that formal knowledge graphs offer significant advantages over direct LLM querying, including transparency of knowledge sources, version control capabilities, and computational efficiency. While requiring manual review of approximately 10-20% of FNL statements, the demonstrated tooltip functionality with around 700 elements shows promise for creating accessible and collaborative knowledge bases in control engineering education.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a two-step conversion process where LaTeX source code is first transformed into Formal Natural Language (FNL) with LLM assistance, then algorithmically converted into PyIRK code to create a formal knowledge graph. This graph can be transformed into JSON or HTML format and integrated into web-based documents as an interactive semantic layer. The method was demonstrated by processing two textbook sections covering mathematical preliminaries and PID controllers, resulting in approximately 700 tooltip elements that provide additional context when readers hover over technical terms and symbols.

## Key Results
- Successfully created interactive semantic layer with ~700 tooltip elements from textbook content
- Demonstrated two-step conversion process (LaTeX → FNL → PyIRK) for knowledge graph construction
- Showed potential for creating accessible knowledge bases with version control and computational efficiency benefits
- Required manual review of 10-20% of FNL statements for quality assurance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages LLMs to bridge the gap between informal mathematical notation in LaTeX and formal knowledge representation systems. By first converting technical content into structured FNL, the system creates an intermediate representation that can be systematically processed into PyIRK code. This two-step process allows for human oversight at the FNL stage while maintaining algorithmic consistency in the final knowledge graph generation, enabling the creation of semantically rich, interactive educational content.

## Foundational Learning

**LaTeX mathematical notation** - Standard typesetting system for mathematical content; needed for parsing textbook source material and extracting formal relationships between symbols and concepts.

**Formal Natural Language (FNL)** - Structured, unambiguous language that bridges informal natural language and formal logic; needed as intermediate representation between LaTeX and knowledge graph structures.

**Knowledge graphs** - Network structures representing entities and relationships; needed for organizing control engineering concepts in machine-readable format that supports semantic queries and interactive displays.

**PyIRK framework** - Python-based tool for knowledge representation in engineering contexts; needed for algorithmic conversion of structured content into formal knowledge graph structures.

**Interactive semantic layers** - Web-based overlays that provide contextual information on hover; needed for creating accessible educational interfaces that enhance traditional textbook content.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** LaTeX source → LLM-assisted FNL conversion → Algorithmic PyIRK generation → Knowledge graph (JSON/HTML) → Interactive web interface

**Critical path:** The transformation pipeline from LaTeX through FNL to PyIRK code represents the essential workflow for creating the knowledge graph. Manual review occurs at the FNL stage before final PyIRK generation.

**Design tradeoffs:** The two-step process (LaTeX → FNL → PyIRK) trades some computational efficiency for human oversight and error correction at the FNL stage. This approach prioritizes accuracy and transparency over fully automated conversion.

**Failure signatures:** Common failure modes include incorrect FNL generation by the LLM (requiring 10-20% manual review), parsing errors when converting complex LaTeX expressions, and inconsistencies between mathematical notation and semantic interpretation.

**First experiments:**
1. Convert a simple LaTeX equation with known structure to verify the LaTeX → FNL pipeline
2. Process a complete but small section of textbook content to test the full conversion workflow
3. Generate and visualize a basic knowledge graph from the converted content to validate PyIRK output

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas warrant further investigation: the generalizability of the approach beyond the specific control engineering domain and textbook content used for demonstration, the systematic characterization of error types in the 10-20% manual review cases, and empirical validation of the claimed advantages of formal knowledge graphs over direct LLM querying through comparative studies.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability assessment beyond the specific textbook sections and control engineering domain used for demonstration
- Lack of systematic error analysis for the 10-20% of FNL statements requiring manual review
- Unvalidated claims about advantages of formal knowledge graphs over direct LLM querying without comparative empirical studies

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the technical description of the two-step conversion process (LaTeX → FNL → PyIRK)

**Medium confidence** in the practical benefits claimed for formal knowledge representation in educational contexts

**Low confidence** in scalability assessments and error rate characterization

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic error analysis of the 10-20% manual review cases to identify common failure modes and patterns

2. Perform comparative user studies measuring learning outcomes between traditional textbooks, LLM-augmented content, and interactive semantic layer implementations

3. Test the approach on diverse control engineering materials beyond the two textbook sections used in the demonstration to assess generalizability
