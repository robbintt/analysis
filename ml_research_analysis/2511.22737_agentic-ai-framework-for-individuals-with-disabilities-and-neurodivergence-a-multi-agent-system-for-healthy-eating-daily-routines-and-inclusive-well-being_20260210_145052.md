# Agentic AI Framework for Individuals with Disabilities and Neurodivergence: A Multi-Agent System for Healthy Eating, Daily Routines, and Inclusive Well-Being

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22737
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22737
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Multi-agent AI framework for supporting healthy eating and daily routines in individuals with disabilities and neurodivergence, demonstrating 27% improvement in nutritional adequacy and 54% increase in reminder adherence in simulated pilots

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an agentic AI framework designed to support individuals with disabilities and neurodivergence in maintaining healthy eating habits and daily routines. The system employs a multi-layer architecture integrating four specialized agents—Meal Planner, Reminder, Food Guidance, and Monitoring—coordinated by a hybrid reasoning engine combining rule-based logic and reinforcement learning. These agents interact through a blackboard mechanism and multimodal interfaces, enabling personalized, adaptive, and accessible support. The framework incorporates privacy-preserving data integration from EHRs, wearables, and IoT devices, with caregiver dashboards and explainable AI modules enhancing transparency and trust.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a multi-agent architecture with four specialized agents operating through a blackboard coordination mechanism. The hybrid reasoning engine combines rule-based logic with reinforcement learning to provide personalized support. Data integration occurs from multiple sources including EHRs, wearables, and IoT devices while maintaining privacy-preserving protocols. The system includes multimodal interfaces for accessibility and caregiver dashboards for monitoring support. The architecture employs explainable AI modules to ensure transparency and build user trust.

## Key Results
- 27% improvement in nutritional adequacy metrics
- 54% increase in reminder adherence rates
- 92% explainability success rate in AI decision transparency
- 35% reduction in caregiver interventions required

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by distributing cognitive and monitoring tasks across specialized agents that can adapt to individual needs through reinforcement learning while maintaining consistency through rule-based constraints. The blackboard mechanism enables flexible information sharing and coordination without rigid hierarchical dependencies. Multi-modal interfaces ensure accessibility across different abilities, while privacy-preserving data integration allows comprehensive support without compromising user confidentiality. The explainable AI components build trust and enable users to understand and verify recommendations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Distributed task handling through specialized agents - needed to address diverse support requirements while maintaining system flexibility
- **Blackboard pattern**: Shared knowledge space for agent communication - needed to enable loose coupling between agents while maintaining coherent support
- **Hybrid reasoning**: Combination of rule-based and reinforcement learning - needed to balance consistency with personalization
- **Privacy-preserving data integration**: Secure multi-source data aggregation - needed to maintain comprehensive support while protecting sensitive health information
- **Explainable AI**: Transparent decision-making mechanisms - needed to build trust and enable user verification of recommendations
- **Multimodal interfaces**: Multiple interaction modes for accessibility - needed to accommodate diverse abilities and preferences

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User Devices -> Agents (Meal Planner, Reminder, Food Guidance, Monitoring) -> Blackboard -> Hybrid Reasoning Engine -> Data Sources (EHR, Wearables, IoT) -> Caregiver Dashboard
- **Critical path**: User input → Agent selection → Blackboard coordination → Hybrid reasoning → Response generation → User feedback → Learning update
- **Design tradeoffs**: Flexibility vs. consistency (addressed through hybrid reasoning), comprehensiveness vs. privacy (addressed through privacy-preserving integration), personalization vs. explainability (addressed through transparent AI modules)
- **Failure signatures**: Agent coordination breakdown, data integration errors, privacy breaches, interface accessibility failures, reasoning engine conflicts
- **First experiments**: 1) Unit test individual agent decision-making logic, 2) Validate blackboard message passing reliability, 3) Test hybrid reasoning engine performance on synthetic data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Demonstrated only through simulated pilot testing on synthetic data, not real-world deployment
- No clinical trials or studies with actual users with disabilities/neurodivergence
- Integration challenges with diverse data sources not fully addressed
- Privacy-preserving mechanisms require independent verification

## Confidence
- Technical architecture: Medium - well-conceived but unproven in real conditions
- Health outcomes: Low - theoretical improvements without longitudinal studies
- Data privacy claims: Low - need independent security audit

## Next Checks
1. Conduct small-scale pilot study (10-15 actual users) to assess usability and accessibility
2. Perform comparative effectiveness study against existing meal planning applications
3. Undertake security and privacy audit including penetration testing of privacy mechanisms
