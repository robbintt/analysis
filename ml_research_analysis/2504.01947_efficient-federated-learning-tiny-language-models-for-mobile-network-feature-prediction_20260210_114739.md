# Efficient Federated Learning Tiny Language Models for Mobile Network Feature Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.01947
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01947
- **Reference count:** 6
- **One-line primary result:** NNCodec compression reduces FL update transmission to below 1% size with negligible performance loss for tiny language models predicting mobile network features.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses communication overhead in federated learning for autonomous mobile networks by integrating tiny language models with ISO/IEC Neural Network Coding (NNC) compression. The authors demonstrate that transformer-based TLMs can effectively process tabular cellular network data through tokenization and achieve transparent compression when combined with federated averaging. Using the Berlin V2X dataset, experiments show that NNCodec compression reduces update transmissions to below 1% of original size while maintaining accuracy above 89% for next-token prediction tasks.

## Method Summary
The method trains lightweight Llama 2-based TLMs (409k/10M/32M parameters) on tabular cellular network data converted to string sequences via a custom SentencePiece tokenizer. The Berlin V2X dataset is partitioned by geographic segments into five FL clients (Residential, Park, Avenue, Highway, Tunnel). Each client trains locally on its data partition, with differential weight updates compressed using NNCodec through sparsification, quantization, and DeepCABAC entropy coding. Federated averaging aggregates these compressed updates centrally, and the process repeats for 25 communication rounds. The approach targets mobile network feature prediction tasks including ping, SNR, and band frequency prediction.

## Key Results
- NNCodec achieves compression ratios of 0.16%-1.52% with accuracy changes of -0.34% to +0.11% across TLM sizes
- TLMs achieve over 89% top-1 accuracy for next-token prediction with perplexities below 1.35
- Communication overhead reduced to below 1% of original size while maintaining "transparent compression" (negligible performance loss)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Tabular cellular network data can be effectively processed by transformer-based language models through tokenization.
- **Mechanism:** Cellular features converted from tabular format → strings → tokens via custom SentencePiece tokenizer. TLM learns correlations through next-token prediction across vocabulary.
- **Core assumption:** Cellular feature correlations exhibit sequential dependencies that transformer attention mechanisms can capture.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions TLM integration for mobile network feature prediction; Section II.A studies technical feasibility of capturing correlations in cellular data via tokenization.
- **Break condition:** If token-by-token prediction of continuous numeric values introduces excessive prediction error accumulation.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** ISO/IEC NNC compression (via NNCodec) can reduce FL update transmission to below 1% with negligible performance degradation.
- **Mechanism:** Differential weight updates pass through sparsification → quantization → DeepCABAC entropy coding pipeline with PUT referencing.
- **Core assumption:** Weight update redundancy is sufficiently high that aggressive compression preserves learning signal.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract claims transparent compression with below 1% overhead; Table I shows compression ratios of 0.16%-1.52% with minimal accuracy changes.
- **Break condition:** If quantization parameters are too aggressive or sparsity too high for given model size.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Federated averaging across spatially-distributed AN cells enables collaborative learning without raw data exchange.
- **Mechanism:** Five FL clients train local TLMs on geographic data partitions, compress updates, transmit to central server, average via FedAvg, and redistribute.
- **Core assumption:** Data distributions across geographic segments share sufficient structure for aggregated gradients to improve global performance.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section II.B describes data distribution across five area segments; Section III reports TLM accuracy over 89% and perplexities below 1.35.
- **Break condition:** Highly heterogeneous local data distributions may cause client drift or slow convergence.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Federated Averaging (FedAvg)**
  - **Why needed here:** Core algorithm enabling collaborative training across AN cells without data sharing.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why averaging weight updates preserves privacy compared to sharing raw data?

- **Concept: Transformer Attention Mechanism**
  - **Why needed here:** TLMs rely on self-attention to capture correlations between tokenized cellular features.
  - **Quick check question:** How does attention enable modeling relationships between distant tokens in a sequence?

- **Concept: Quantization & Sparsification in Neural Compression**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding qp and sparsity parameters is essential for tuning NNCodec compression vs. accuracy tradeoffs.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to gradient information when weights are quantized from FP32 to INT8?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Berlin V2X dataset → preprocessor → custom SentencePiece tokenizer → Lightweight Llama 2 TLM → NNCodec encoder → central server → FedAvg aggregation → NNCodec decoder → weight redistribution
- **Critical path:** Tokenizer vocabulary design → TLM size selection → qp/sparsity calibration → 25 FL rounds with monitored accuracy/perplexity
- **Design tradeoffs:** Larger TLM (32M) provides better accuracy but requires higher qp for compression; higher sparsity reduces transmission size but risks information loss; learning rate interacts with compression strategy
- **Failure signatures:** Accuracy drops >1% from baseline indicate qp too aggressive; significant perplexity increases suggest compression artifacts; non-converging FL rounds indicate potential client drift
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline calibration: Train smallest TLM uncompressed for 25 rounds; 2) Compression sweep: Vary qp and sparsity for fixed TLM size to find transparency boundary; 3) Scale validation: Apply best compression settings across 10M and 32M models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly called out in the paper.

## Limitations
- Claims of "transparent compression" rely heavily on internal experimental evidence without external validation
- SentencePiece tokenization approach for tabular cellular data lacks rigorous justification for transformer effectiveness
- NNCodec integration lacks detailed analysis of calibration for quantization parameters across different model sizes
- Small Tunnel dataset (475 samples) raises concerns about client drift affecting federated averaging convergence

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Feasibility of combining federated learning with tiny language models for mobile network feature prediction
- **Medium confidence:** Effectiveness of NNCodec compression achieving claimed ratios with minimal accuracy degradation
- **Low confidence:** Assumption that tabular cellular network data can be meaningfully processed by transformer-based language models through tokenization

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying quantization parameters and sparsity levels systematically across all three TLM sizes to establish precise transparency boundaries
2. Compare SentencePiece tokenization approach against alternative tabular data encoding methods to validate transformer-based approach
3. Test federated averaging convergence with heterogeneous client data distributions, particularly examining whether the small Tunnel dataset causes client drift or convergence issues
