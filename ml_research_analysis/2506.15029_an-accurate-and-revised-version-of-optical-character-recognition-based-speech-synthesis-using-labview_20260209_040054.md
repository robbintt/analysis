# An accurate and revised version of optical character recognition-based speech synthesis using LabVIEW

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.15029
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15029
- Authors: Prateek Mehta; Anasuya Patil
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: OCR-based speech synthesis system using LabVIEW achieves near 100% accuracy in text recognition and speech synthesis for visually impaired users.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an optical character recognition-based speech synthesis system developed using LabVIEW to assist visually impaired individuals in accessing printed text. The system extracts text from PDF files using PDFBox, processes it through OCR, and converts recognized text into speech using Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1. The implementation offers features like text highlighting, adjustable speech rate and volume, and real-time audio output. Experiments demonstrate the system achieves nearly 100% accuracy in text recognition and speech synthesis, outperforming existing solutions in both accuracy and font size compatibility.

## Method Summary
The system uses LabVIEW 13.0 with PDFBox (Java library) for PDF text extraction and Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 for speech synthesis. The pipeline involves: (1) PDF parsing and text extraction via PDFBox, (2) text highlighting/search functionality, (3) TTS conversion with adjustable speech rate and volume via Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1, (4) optional NI-myRio hardware integration for real-time scanner communication over TCP/IP. The system is designed to work with standard hardware like PCs and scanners, making it accessible for deployment in educational institutions for the visually impaired.

## Key Results
- System achieves nearly 100% accuracy in text recognition and speech synthesis
- Outperforms existing solutions in both accuracy and font size compatibility
- Cost-effective and user-friendly design compatible with standard hardware

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Text extraction from PDF files enables accurate speech synthesis output.
- Mechanism: PDFBox (a Java-based open-source library) parses PDF documents and extracts text content directly, bypassing image-based character recognition. The extracted text is then passed to a post-processing stage where it can be saved as a text file or searched/highlighted before TTS conversion.
- Core assumption: The input PDFs contain selectable text (not scanned images), which the paper does not explicitly distinguish from image-based OCR in its accuracy claims.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The system extracts text from PDF files using PDFBox, processes it through OCR, and converts recognized text into speech..."; [section] "The file is taken in PDF format and is converted into the required text. This is done by parsing PDF using PDFBox..."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 integration via ActiveX enables configurable real-time speech output.
- Mechanism: LabVIEW's Communication palette includes ActiveX sub-pallet functions that call Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 APIs. The system retrieves available system voices and audio devices, accepts text input (from OCR or manual entry), and synthesizes speech with adjustable rate and volume. Audio can be paused and resumed mid-playback.
- Core assumption: The host Windows system has Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 installed and compatible audio hardware.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "...converts recognized text into speech using Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1. The implementation offers features like text highlighting, adjustable speech rate and volume, and real-time audio output."; [section] "Here for speech system, Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 is used. The LLB VIs call Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 and retrieve the voice and audio output information..."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: NI-myRio hardware interface enables scanner integration and real-time data flow orchestration.
- Mechanism: The NI-myRio device runs a LabVIEW Real-Time OS and establishes a TCP/IP connection to receive scanned document data. An interrupt-driven callback VI transfers data from the scanning system to the OCR/TTS pipeline. The entire process runs within a while loop with controlled inter-sentence delays for continuous operation.
- Core assumption: Scanner hardware supports TCP/IP output or file-based handoff compatible with the myRio's listening routine.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "...designed to work with standard hardware like PCs and scanners..."; [section] "NI-myRio firsts listen for any file stored by a scanner then ensures a TCP/IP connection specifying the IP address and the port at which the connection would be established..."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **ActiveX/COM Interfacing in LabVIEW**
  - Why needed here: The TTS system relies on calling external Windows APIs through ActiveX, a legacy but functional bridge between LabVIEW and Microsoft Speech SDK.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a LabVIEW VI invokes an external COM object's methods, and what happens if that object is not registered on the system?

- Concept: **PDF Text Extraction vs. Image-Based OCR**
  - Why needed here: The paper conflates PDFBox text extraction with "OCR" — understanding the distinction is critical for evaluating where the claimed near-100% accuracy applies.
  - Quick check question: Given a PDF file, how would you determine whether it contains extractable text versus a scanned image requiring true OCR?

- Concept: **Real-Time Data Flow with Interrupt Callbacks**
  - Why needed here: The NI-myRio integration uses interrupt-driven callbacks to handle asynchronous scanner input, a pattern common in embedded systems but requiring careful state management.
  - Quick check question: What race conditions could occur if a callback VI writes to a buffer while the main loop reads from it without synchronization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PDF/Scanner -> Text Extraction -> String Processing -> TTS SDK -> Audio Output
- Critical path: PDF/Scanner → Text Extraction → String Processing → TTS SDK → Audio Output. The weakest link is the input method: PDFBox works only on text-based PDFs; scanner input depends on external hardware and network reliability.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Legacy SDK vs. Modern TTS: Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 is Windows-only and dated, but requires no external API calls or neural model inference.
  - LabVIEW graphical programming vs. text-based languages: Faster prototyping per authors' claim, but locks the project into National Instruments ecosystem.
  - TCP/IP scanner interface vs. direct USB: Network-based design allows distributed deployment but adds configuration complexity.
- Failure signatures:
  - "No voice available" errors → Speech SDK not installed or no system voices configured
  - Empty text output from PDF → Input PDF contains scanned images, not extractable text
  - TCP connection timeout → Scanner not transmitting, wrong IP/port, or firewall blocking
  - Audio stuttering → While-loop delay too short for TTS synthesis rate
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate PDFBox extraction: Feed a known text-based PDF (e.g., a research paper) and compare character count of extracted text against original; test with a scanned-image PDF to confirm failure mode.
  2. Test ActiveX TTS integration in isolation: Create a minimal LabVIEW VI that calls Microsoft Speech SDK with hardcoded text; verify voice selection, rate/volume adjustment, and pause/resume functions.
  3. Characterize scanner-handoff timing: Simulate scanner input via TCP to NI-myRio (or mock the listener); measure end-to-end latency from file receipt to audio output start.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the system perform on scanned documents and camera-captured images rather than born-digital PDFs with embedded text?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The methodology relies on PDFBox to parse and extract text directly from PDF files, which differs fundamentally from true image-based OCR required for scanned books—the primary use case for visually impaired users accessing physical library materials.
- Why unresolved: No experiments were conducted using scanner-captured images or photographs of printed pages; all results used digital PDFs with selectable text.
- What evidence would resolve it: Accuracy benchmarks on scanned documents at various DPI settings, lighting conditions, and document qualities (yellowed paper, underlined text, margin notes).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the system be extended to support languages beyond English with comparable accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "In this paper, an OCR based speech synthesis has been successfully implemented for English on LabVIEW 13.0 platform."
- Why unresolved: The authors explicitly limit their implementation to English, and Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 has limited multilingual capabilities compared to modern TTS engines.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and accuracy testing with non-Latin scripts (e.g., Devanagari, Arabic) and accented characters common in developing-country contexts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the actual usability and effectiveness of this system for visually impaired users in real-world educational settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Despite claiming the work is dedicated to visually impaired students, the paper presents no user studies, satisfaction metrics, or learning outcome assessments with the target population.
- Why unresolved: Technical accuracy metrics alone do not demonstrate that the system meaningfully improves information access or learning for blind users.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled user studies measuring task completion time, comprehension scores, and subjective usability ratings with visually impaired participants.

## Limitations
- The claimed "nearly 100% accuracy" conflates PDFBox's text extraction accuracy on text-based PDFs with true OCR performance on scanned documents.
- The system relies on legacy components (Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1, LabVIEW 13.0) that may not represent current best practices for assistive technology.
- The paper presents no user studies or real-world effectiveness assessments with the visually impaired target population.

## Confidence

- PDFBox text extraction accuracy: Medium (PDFBox is well-established but effectiveness depends on PDF structure)
- Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 integration: High (ActiveX interfacing is documented, though legacy)
- Overall system accuracy claims: Low (insufficient validation data provided)

## Next Checks

1. **Input Format Validation**: Test the system with both text-based PDFs and scanned-image PDFs to determine whether the claimed accuracy applies only to extractable text or includes actual OCR of images.

2. **SDK Compatibility Testing**: Verify Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 functionality on modern Windows versions, as the legacy SDK may have compatibility issues or require specific registry configurations.

3. **End-to-End Latency Measurement**: Measure the complete pipeline latency from PDF loading through speech output to assess whether the "real-time" performance claim holds under practical usage conditions.
