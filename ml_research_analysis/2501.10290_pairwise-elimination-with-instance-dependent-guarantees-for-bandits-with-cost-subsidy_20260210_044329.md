- Introduces Pairwise Elimination (PE) algorithm with logarithmic instance-dependent guarantees for MAB-CS

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the Multi-Armed Bandit with Cost Subsidy (MAB-CS) problem, where the objective is to minimize cumulative costs while maintaining a reward constraint. The authors propose two novel settings: a fixed threshold setting and a known reference arm setting. They introduce the Pairwise Elimination (PE) algorithm for the known reference arm setting and generalize it to PE-CS for the subsidized best reward setting. The key contribution is establishing logarithmic upper bounds on cost and quality regret, making these algorithms the first to achieve such instance-dependent guarantees in this framework.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces the Pairwise Elimination (PE) algorithm that operates in the known reference arm setting by systematically eliminating suboptimal arms through pairwise comparisons. The algorithm maintains estimates of both rewards and costs while comparing arms against a reference arm to determine which arms satisfy the reward threshold. For the subsidized best reward setting, PE is generalized to PE-CS, which incorporates cost subsidy mechanisms to further optimize cumulative costs. Both algorithms employ an elimination-based approach that progressively refines the set of viable arms based on statistical confidence bounds.

## Key Results
- PE algorithm achieves logarithmic upper bounds on cost and quality regret for known reference arm setting
- PE-CS generalizes the approach to the subsidized best reward setting with similar guarantees
- PE is proven order-optimal for all known reference arm problem instances through upper and lower bound comparison
- Experimental validation on MovieLens 25M and Goodreads datasets demonstrates effectiveness of PE and superior performance of PE-CS

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pairwise elimination approach works by maintaining statistical confidence intervals for both rewards and costs of each arm. Through systematic pairwise comparisons against a reference arm, the algorithm can identify and eliminate suboptimal arms with high probability. The key mechanism is the use of adaptive confidence bounds that tighten as more samples are collected, allowing for increasingly precise arm comparisons. This elimination-based approach ensures that computational and sampling resources are focused on the most promising arms, leading to the logarithmic regret bounds.

## Foundational Learning
- Instance-dependent analysis (why needed: to capture problem-specific characteristics; quick check: verify bounds scale appropriately with problem parameters)
- Confidence bound construction (why needed: for statistical guarantees; quick check: validate coverage probability)
- Elimination-based bandit algorithms (why needed: for computational efficiency; quick check: confirm convergence rates)
- Cost subsidy mechanisms (why needed: to reduce cumulative costs; quick check: verify subsidy effectiveness)
- Order-optimality (why needed: to establish fundamental limits; quick check: compare with known lower bounds)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
PE Algorithm -> Confidence Bounds -> Arm Elimination -> Reward/Cost Tracking

Critical Path:
1. Initialize confidence bounds for all arms
2. Perform pairwise comparisons against reference arm
3. Eliminate suboptimal arms based on confidence intervals
4. Update reward and cost estimates for remaining arms
5. Repeat until convergence or budget exhausted

Design Tradeoffs:
- Exploration vs. exploitation balance through confidence bounds
- Computational complexity vs. statistical accuracy
- Subsidy amount vs. cumulative cost reduction
- Elimination aggressiveness vs. premature convergence risk

Failure Signatures:
- Overly conservative confidence bounds leading to slow convergence
- Incorrect subsidy calibration causing cost inefficiencies
- Premature elimination of optimal arms due to statistical noise
- Reference arm selection impacting overall performance

First Experiments:
1. Validate confidence bound coverage on synthetic reward distributions
2. Test elimination accuracy on known optimal arms under varying noise levels
3. Benchmark PE-CS against baseline algorithms on diverse problem instances

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Logarithmic bounds rely on specific problem structure assumptions that may not generalize
- Order-optimality claim established theoretically but lacks extensive empirical validation
- Experimental validation covers limited scope of problem instances and datasets
- Performance superiority claims need substantiation across more diverse problem structures

## Confidence
- Instance-dependent logarithmic bounds: High
- Order-optimality claim: Medium
- PE-CS performance superiority: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive empirical studies across synthetic problem instances with varying reward distributions and cost structures to validate the claimed instance-dependent bounds and order-optimality
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the impact of different algorithmic components in PE and PE-CS on their theoretical guarantees
3. Compare PE-CS against additional baseline algorithms from the broader bandit literature under varying problem conditions to strengthen the performance claims
