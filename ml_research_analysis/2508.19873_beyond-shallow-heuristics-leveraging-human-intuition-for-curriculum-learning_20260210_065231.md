core_contribution: The study investigates whether human-curated simple language can
  guide curriculum learning (CL) in masked language model pretraining, and how it
  compares to competence-based strategies using shallow heuristics. Using the Simple
  Wikipedia corpus, researchers compare label-based curricula (based on article-level
  SL/EL labels) to competence-based CL relying on sentence length, word rarity, and
  Flesch Reading Ease.

# Beyond Shallow Heuristics: Leveraging Human Intuition for Curriculum Learning

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether human intuition about linguistic difficulty can provide more effective curriculum learning strategies than traditional competence-based heuristics. Using Simple Wikipedia as a source of human-curated simple language, researchers compare curriculum learning approaches based on article-level complexity labels against competence-based strategies using sentence length, word rarity, and Flesch Reading Ease. The experiments reveal that while adding simple language data alone yields no overall benefit, structuring it through a curriculum—particularly when introduced first—consistently improves perplexity scores. Critically, label-based curricula based on human intuition outperform competence-based approaches that rely on shallow heuristics, suggesting that human judgment about linguistic difficulty provides superior guidance for curriculum ordering.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted masked language model pretraining experiments using BERT-tiny on Simple Wikipedia and Normal Wikipedia corpora. They implemented three types of curriculum strategies: label-based curricula using article-level simple/complex labels, competence-based curricula using three shallow heuristics (sentence length, word rarity, and Flesch Reading Ease), and random ordering as a baseline. The curricula were tested in two configurations: starting with simple language data or introducing it midway through training. Training continued until convergence was reached for each configuration. Model performance was evaluated using perplexity scores on both Simple and Normal Wikipedia test sets, with additional analysis of learning curves and training dynamics.

## Key Results
- Human-curated simple language data alone provides no benefit over random ordering
- Label-based curricula consistently outperform random ordering, especially when simple language is introduced first
- Competence-based curricula using shallow heuristics show no consistent gains over random ordering
- The effectiveness of label-based curricula is particularly pronounced on simple language test sets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Human intuition about linguistic difficulty captures structural and semantic properties that shallow heuristics miss. The label-based curricula succeed because they leverage the human curation process that created Simple Wikipedia, which considers factors beyond surface-level features like sentence length or word frequency. This human judgment incorporates pragmatic aspects of language complexity, including syntactic structure, semantic coherence, and discourse organization. In contrast, the shallow heuristics fail because they cannot effectively separate the two classes in this particular corpus, likely due to the limited range of complexity variation and the specific nature of the Wikipedia domain.

## Foundational Learning
- **Curriculum Learning**: Why needed - to improve model convergence and generalization by ordering training examples by difficulty. Quick check - does ordering affect learning curves?
- **Masked Language Modeling**: Why needed - self-supervised pretraining task that learns bidirectional representations. Quick check - is MLM suitable for measuring curriculum effects?
- **Perplexity as Evaluation**: Why needed - standard metric for language model quality measuring predictive uncertainty. Quick check - does perplexity correlate with downstream task performance?
- **BERT Architecture**: Why needed - transformer-based model that enables effective pretraining and transfer learning. Quick check - does model scale affect curriculum benefits?
- **Linguistic Complexity Measures**: Why needed - to quantify and operationalize difficulty for curriculum ordering. Quick check - which features best capture human notions of difficulty?
- **Competence-Based Heuristics**: Why needed - automated methods for estimating example difficulty without human labels. Quick check - can shallow features effectively separate complexity classes?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data -> Preprocessing -> Curriculum Generator -> BERT-tiny -> Training Loop -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Simple Wikipedia Corpus → Label Extraction → Curriculum Ordering → Masked Language Model Pretraining → Perplexity Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Small BERT-tiny model enables efficient experimentation but may limit generalizability to larger models. Binary complexity classification simplifies curriculum design but may miss nuanced difficulty gradients.

**Failure Signatures**: Competence-based curricula failing to outperform random ordering suggests shallow heuristics cannot effectively capture linguistic complexity. No benefit from simple language data alone indicates that data quantity/quality alone is insufficient without proper ordering.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test label-based curriculum with simple language introduced first vs. random ordering
2. Compare competence-based heuristics (sentence length, word rarity, Flesch) against label-based approach
3. Evaluate training with simple language introduced midway vs. from the beginning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on BERT-tiny may not generalize to larger models with different optimization dynamics
- Limited exploration of alternative competence-based heuristics beyond three shallow measures
- Binary complexity classification may oversimplify the spectrum of linguistic difficulty
- Focus on masked language modeling limits applicability to other NLP tasks and fine-tuning scenarios

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Human-curated simple language data alone provides no benefit over random ordering
- Medium Confidence: Label-based curricula outperform competence-based approaches within experimental constraints
- Low Confidence: Explanation that heuristic failure stems from inability to separate classes is plausible but not definitively proven

## Next Checks
1. Scale-Up Validation: Replicate experiments with BERT-base or larger models to determine whether curriculum benefits scale with model capacity
2. Heuristic Space Exploration: Systematically test alternative or composite heuristics beyond the three shallow measures used
3. Cross-Domain Transfer Study: Apply curriculum strategies to non-Wikipedia corpora with varying linguistic complexity levels
