## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.01590
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01590
- Reference count: 40

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an integrated classroom surveillance system that combines sleep detection, face recognition, and mobile phone detection to monitor student engagement in real time. The system employs YOLOv8 for detecting mobile phone usage and drowsiness, and LResNet Occ FC for robust face recognition, integrating these models into a unified PHP web application with ESP32-CAM hardware for data capture. The system was trained and evaluated on specialized datasets, achieving 97.42% mAP@50 for sleep detection, 86.45% validation accuracy for face recognition, and 85.89% mAP@50 for mobile phone detection. This multimodal approach offers an automated, scalable solution for classroom monitoring, enhancing attendance recording and student attentiveness assessment while addressing limitations of traditional manual observation. Future work will focus on improving occlusion handling, processing speed, and expanding scalability for larger educational environments.

## Method Summary
The system integrates three detection tasks - sleep detection, face recognition, and mobile phone detection - using YOLOv8 for object detection, LResNet Occ FC for face recognition, and MTCNN for face detection. Data is captured via ESP32-CAM modules and processed through a PHP web application. The system was trained on custom datasets: 2,155 images for sleep detection, 1,048 images for phone detection, and 3,524 images from the AFDB dataset for face recognition. Models were evaluated using mAP@50 for detection tasks and validation accuracy for face recognition, with a threshold of 0.7 for face matching similarity.

## Key Results
- Sleep detection achieved 97.42% mAP@50 with 96.15% precision and 93.67% recall
- Face recognition validation accuracy of 86.45% on AFDB dataset with 3524 images
- Mobile phone detection achieved 85.89% mAP@50 with 94.45% precision and 89.94% recall
- Real-time processing with 1.906ms inference time per image for detection tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sleep Detection via Head Posture and Facial Cue Analysis
- Claim: The system identifies drowsy or asleep students by analyzing visual features correlated with fatigue states.
- Mechanism: A YOLOv8-based CNN extracts spatial features from video frames, focusing on head tilt angle, eyelid closure duration, and facial muscle relaxation patterns. The softmax function outputs probability scores across classes (awake, drowsy, asleep). The paper states: "if a student's head tilts downward for more than five seconds and their eyes remain closed for over 70% of the time, the system classifies them as 'asleep' and triggers an alert."
- Core assumption: Visual proxies (head position, eye closure) reliably correlate with actual drowsiness states, and these patterns generalize across different students and lighting conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: Reports 97.42% mAP@50 for sleep detection with 96.15% precision and 93.67% recall.
  - [section]: Section III.A describes the softmax classification: P(Sleep|x) = e^z_sleep / Σe^z_i where z_sleep represents the logit for the "sleep" class.
  - [corpus]: Related paper "AI-based Multimodal Biometrics for Detecting Smartphone Distractions" discusses attention monitoring in learning contexts, suggesting behavioral monitoring is an active research area, but does not directly validate sleep detection specifically.
- Break condition: False positives increase when students look down at desks (reading) or when faces are partially occluded—the paper explicitly acknowledges this limitation.

### Mechanism 2: Face Recognition via Embedding Similarity Matching
- Claim: Students can be identified from seated positions using facial embeddings compared against a pre-registered database.
- Mechanism: MTCNN detects faces, then LResNet Occ FC extracts 512-dimensional feature embeddings. Identity is determined by cosine similarity between captured and stored embeddings: Similarity(A,B) = (A·B)/(||A||·||B||). A threshold of 0.7 determines match acceptance. The architecture is specifically designed to handle occlusions (masks, glasses) and pose variations.
- Core assumption: Facial embeddings maintain sufficient discriminative power across variations in lighting, occlusion, and head pose to uniquely identify individuals within the enrolled population.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: Reports 86.45% validation accuracy on the AFDB dataset with 3524 images across 4 classes (masked, normal, glasses).
  - [section]: Section III.B and Table I show 96% train accuracy but 84-86% validation accuracy, indicating moderate generalization gap.
  - [corpus]: Corpus mentions face recognition in surveillance contexts but provides no direct validation of LResNet Occ FC architecture performance.
- Break condition: The paper explicitly lists failure modes: "Similar Face Confusion"—the model may occasionally confuse students with similar facial features; accuracy degrades with extreme angles, masks, and poor lighting.

### Mechanism 3: Mobile Phone Detection via Object Recognition and Contextual Hand Positioning
- Claim: Mobile phone usage can be detected in real-time by identifying phone-like objects in relation to hand positions.
- Mechanism: YOLOv8 performs object detection with bounding box regression and classification. The loss function combines coordinate error, confidence scores, and class probabilities. Detection considers both object shape (rectangular phone-like objects) and contextual cues (hand position near ear or lap).
- Core assumption: The visual appearance of phones and typical usage postures are sufficiently distinctive from other classroom objects and behaviors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: Reports 85.89% mAP@50 with 94.45% precision and 89.94% recall on a custom 1048-image Roboflow dataset.
  - [section]: Section III.C provides the YOLO loss function formulation; Section IV notes 1.906ms inference time per image.
  - [corpus]: "AI-based Multimodal Biometrics for Detecting Smartphone Distractions" (arxiv:2506.17364) addresses similar phone detection in online learning, providing indirect support that phone detection during attention-critical tasks is technically tractable.
- Break condition: Small phones, phone-like objects (calculators, wallets), or hands obscuring the device may reduce detection accuracy—the paper does not quantify these specific failure rates.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Object Detection with YOLO (You Only Look Once)**
  - Why needed here: Two of three system components (sleep and phone detection) rely on YOLOv8. Understanding single-stage detectors, anchor boxes, and the mAP evaluation metric is essential for interpreting results and troubleshooting.
  - Quick check question: Given a model with 85.89% mAP@50 but lower recall (89.94%), what type of errors dominate—false positives or missed detections?

- Concept: **Face Embeddings and Similarity Metrics**
  - Why needed here: The face recognition pipeline depends on embedding extraction and cosine similarity thresholds. Understanding how embeddings encode identity and how threshold selection affects precision/recall tradeoffs is critical.
  - Quick check question: If the similarity threshold is raised from 0.7 to 0.9, what happens to false acceptance rate and false rejection rate?

- Concept: **Multi-Object Tracking with Kalman Filters**
  - Why needed here: The SORT algorithm maintains identity across frames using Kalman Filter state estimation and Hungarian algorithm assignment. This enables temporal consistency in behavior detection.
  - Quick check question: In the state vector x = [x, y, s, r, ẋ, ẏ, ṡ]ᵀ, what do s and r represent, and why are velocities included?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  ESP32-CAM modules -> frame capture -> three parallel detection models (YOLOv8-sleep, YOLOv8-phone, MTCNN-face) -> SORT tracking -> LResNet Occ FC recognition -> PHP web application with session management and event logging

- Critical path:
  1. ESP32-CAM captures frame -> 2. Frame preprocessed -> 3. Three detection models run (can be parallelized) -> 4. SORT maintains object identity across frames -> 5. Face recognition matches detected faces to enrolled identities -> 6. Events logged with timestamps -> 7. UI/API serves annotated video and status updates

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **ESP32-CAM vs. higher-end cameras**: Low cost (~$10) but limited resolution and low-light performance; paper explicitly notes this constraint.
  - **YOLOv8 vs. two-stage detectors**: Faster inference (1.9-2.4ms/image) but potentially lower precision for small objects.
  - **Single threshold (0.7) for face matching**: Simple implementation but no per-user adaptivity; similar-looking students may cause confusion.
  - **Local vs. cloud processing**: Paper mentions both options; local reduces latency but limits scalability.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Sleep detection false positives**: Student looking down at desk while reading triggers "asleep" classification.
  - **Face recognition degradation**: Validation accuracy (86.45%) significantly lower than training (96%) indicates overfitting or insufficient dataset diversity.
  - **Processing lag under multi-task load**: Running all three models simultaneously on limited hardware may introduce frame drops.
  - **IoU threshold sensitivity**: Tracking association fails when IoU drops below 0.3 threshold during rapid movement.
  - **Occlusion cascade**: Partial face occlusion -> MTCNN fails -> no embedding -> attendance not recorded.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation on held-out data**: Reproduce the reported metrics (97.42%, 86.45%, 85.89%) on independent test sets to confirm generalization before deployment.
  2. **Threshold sensitivity analysis**: Sweep face recognition similarity threshold (0.5-0.9) and plot precision-recall curves to identify optimal operating point for the target classroom size.
  3. **Load testing with concurrent models**: Measure frame rate and latency when all three detection models run simultaneously on the target ESP32-CAM or edge device to identify processing bottlenecks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent does the integration of audio signals and motion tracking with visual data improve the detection accuracy of student engagement compared to visual-only monitoring?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list "Multimodal Data Fusion" as a future research direction, suggesting that incorporating audio and motion data could provide a more comprehensive analysis.
- Why unresolved: The current system relies exclusively on visual cues (YOLOv8 and LResNet), leaving the potential benefits of auditory or kinesthetic data unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative benchmarks showing precision and recall rates of the current system against a version enhanced with audio-motion fusion.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can lightweight deep learning models deployed on edge devices (e.g., Jetson Nano) maintain the reported high accuracy while eliminating the real-time processing lag observed with the ESP32-CAM?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies "Delay and Lag in Live Processing" as a limitation of the current hardware and proposes "Edge AI Optimization" on more capable edge devices as a solution.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if model compression or porting to devices like the Jetson Nano will preserve the 97.42% sleep detection mAP without introducing new latency bottlenecks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Inference latency measurements and accuracy metrics (mAP@50) specifically collected from a Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi implementation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do attention-based models or contrastive learning techniques significantly reduce the error rate in face recognition caused by partial occlusions (e.g., masks) and extreme pose variations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Under "Future Research Directions," the authors propose using contrastive learning and attention-based models to address the limitation of "Body Occlusion Issues" and face coverings.
- Why unresolved: The current LResNet Occ FC model struggles with masks and lighting; the effectiveness of the proposed advanced techniques in these specific failure scenarios remains theoretical in this context.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validation accuracy comparisons on occluded-face datasets (e.g., masked vs. unmasked) between the current LResNet implementation and the proposed attention-based models.

## Limitations
- Validation accuracy (86.45%) significantly lower than training accuracy (96%) suggests potential overfitting to limited dataset
- System reliability degrades substantially with occlusion, masks, extreme angles, and poor lighting conditions
- Real-time processing may introduce frame drops when all three detection models run simultaneously on limited hardware

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The technical architecture and methodology are clearly described and implementable. The use of established frameworks (YOLOv8, MTCNN, SORT) and well-defined evaluation metrics provides a solid foundation for the approach.

- **Medium Confidence**: The reported performance metrics are likely achievable under controlled conditions matching the training data distribution. However, real-world deployment may reveal significant performance degradation due to environmental variability and edge cases not represented in the datasets.

- **Low Confidence**: The system's scalability and robustness in diverse classroom environments remain unproven. The paper does not address privacy concerns, ethical considerations, or regulatory compliance for student surveillance, which are critical for practical deployment.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization testing**: Evaluate the trained models on independent datasets (e.g., different drowsiness datasets for sleep detection, different face recognition benchmarks) to assess real-world robustness beyond the original training data.

2. **A/B testing in live classroom environments**: Deploy the system in actual classrooms with varying lighting conditions, student populations, and seating arrangements to measure performance degradation and identify specific failure modes that emerge in practice.

3. **Multi-camera synchronization validation**: Test the system's performance when scaling to multiple classrooms or larger spaces by evaluating frame rate consistency, tracking accuracy across camera boundaries, and network latency impacts on real-time monitoring capabilities.
