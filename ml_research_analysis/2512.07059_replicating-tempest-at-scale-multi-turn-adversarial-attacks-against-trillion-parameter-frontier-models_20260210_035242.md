# Replicating TEMPEST at Scale: Multi-Turn Adversarial Attacks Against Trillion-Parameter Frontier Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.07059
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07059
- **Authors**: Richard Young
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key result**: Six of ten frontier models showed 96-100% attack success rates to multi-turn adversarial attacks using TEMPEST across 1,000 harmful behaviors.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated the vulnerability of ten frontier language models to adaptive multi-turn adversarial attacks using the TEMPEST framework across 1,000 harmful behaviors, generating over 97,000 API queries. Results showed six models achieved 96% to 100% attack success rate (ASR), while four showed resistance with ASR ranging from 42% to 78%. Model scale showed no correlation with robustness, and extended reasoning mode reduced ASR by 55 percentage points on identical architecture. The findings demonstrate that current safety alignment techniques remain fundamentally vulnerable to sophisticated multi-turn attacks regardless of model scale, while identifying deliberative inference as a promising defense direction.

## Method Summary
The study employed the TEMPEST framework to conduct adaptive multi-turn adversarial attacks against ten frontier language models. Researchers generated over 97,000 API queries targeting 1,000 harmful behaviors curated from the HarmBench dataset. The evaluation systematically measured attack success rates across different model architectures and parameter scales, comparing standard inference modes with extended reasoning modes where available. The methodology focused on measuring the percentage of harmful behaviors successfully elicited despite safety interventions.

## Key Results
- Six models achieved 96% to 100% attack success rates against multi-turn adversarial attacks
- Four models demonstrated resistance with attack success rates of 42% to 78%
- Extended reasoning mode reduced attack success rates by 55 percentage points on identical architectures
- Model scale (ranging from 8B to 175B parameters) showed no correlation with robustness to attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The TEMPEST framework succeeds through adaptive multi-turn interactions that systematically probe and bypass safety mechanisms. By maintaining conversational context across multiple turns, attackers can gradually wear down defenses, exploit inconsistencies in safety alignment, and leverage the model's own reasoning capabilities against its safeguards. The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to dynamically adjust attack strategies based on model responses, identifying and exploiting specific vulnerabilities in the alignment process rather than relying on static prompt engineering.

## Foundational Learning
- **TEMPEST Framework**: An adaptive multi-turn adversarial attack methodology that maintains conversational context across multiple interactions to systematically bypass safety mechanisms. Needed to understand the attack methodology being evaluated.
- **HarmBench Dataset**: A curated collection of 1,000 harmful behaviors used as attack targets, providing standardized evaluation across different models. Needed to understand the scope and standardization of harmful behavior testing.
- **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: The percentage of harmful behaviors successfully elicited despite safety interventions, serving as the primary metric for measuring model vulnerability. Needed to interpret the quantitative results.
- **Deliberative Inference**: An extended reasoning mode that enables models to perform more thorough internal reasoning before responding, shown to reduce vulnerability to attacks. Needed to understand the defense mechanism explored.
- **API-based Evaluation**: The methodology of accessing models through application programming interfaces rather than local deployment, introducing potential confounding factors. Needed to understand evaluation constraints and limitations.
- **Safety Alignment Techniques**: Methods used to train models to avoid generating harmful content, which the study found remain fundamentally vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Needed to understand the broader implications for AI safety.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: TEMPEST Attack Engine -> API Interface -> Frontier Language Model -> Safety Alignment Layer -> Output Response
**Critical Path**: Attack generation → API query → Model processing → Safety filtering → Response evaluation → Success measurement
**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritized comprehensive coverage of harmful behaviors over depth of analysis per behavior, choosing breadth to identify systematic vulnerabilities rather than detailed exploitation of specific weaknesses.
**Failure Signatures**: High attack success rates (96-100%) indicate fundamental vulnerabilities in safety alignment; resistance (42-78%) suggests more effective alignment techniques but still leaves room for exploitation.
**3 First Experiments**: 1) Replicate TEMPEST attacks using alternative frameworks like AutoDAN to validate whether results are framework-specific. 2) Test multilingual prompts to assess if vulnerability patterns extend beyond English. 3) Conduct controlled comparisons of identical architectures with systematic variation in reasoning depth.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The study evaluated only one class of adversarial attack techniques, potentially missing vulnerabilities to alternative approaches.
- API-based evaluation introduces confounding factors including rate limiting and infrastructure-level content filtering.
- The evaluation focused exclusively on English-language prompts, limiting generalizability to multilingual contexts.

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The finding that six models demonstrated 96-100% attack success rates is well-supported by the extensive 97,000+ query evaluation.
**Medium Confidence**: The claim that model scale shows no correlation with robustness is statistically sound but may oversimplify complex relationships.
**Medium Confidence**: The observation that deliberative reasoning mode reduced ASR by 55 percentage points is compelling but requires cautious interpretation due to comparison across different model variants.
**Low Confidence**: The assertion that "current safety alignment techniques remain fundamentally vulnerable" represents a strong claim about the entire field's approach.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Attack Methodology Validation**: Replicate the study using alternative adversarial attack frameworks (such as AutoDAN or Greedy Coordinate Gradient) to determine whether TEMPEST-specific tactics or fundamental model vulnerabilities drive the observed high success rates.

2. **Multilingual and Multimodal Extension**: Conduct parallel evaluations using non-English prompts and multimodal inputs to assess whether the observed vulnerability patterns persist across linguistic and sensory modalities, addressing the current study's English-language limitation.

3. **Controlled Architecture Comparison**: Perform head-to-head comparisons of identical model architectures with and without deliberative reasoning capabilities under identical conditions, including systematic variation of reasoning depth and alternative inference-time intervention strategies.
