## Quick Facts

## Executive Summary
DISK introduces a training-free adaptive inference framework for autoregressive world models that coordinates visual and trajectory diffusion transformers through dual-branch controllers with cross-modal skip decisions. The method uses per-step local smoothness testing to decide when to compute or reuse denoising predictions, while a safety gate ensures appearance-motion consistency during complex maneuvers. Controller statistics propagate through the autoregressive chain to maintain long-horizon stability. When integrated into closed-loop driving rollouts on 1500 NuPlan and NuScenes samples using an NVIDIA L40S GPU, DISK achieves 2x speedup on trajectory diffusion (20ms → 10ms) and 1.6x speedup on video diffusion (244ms → 155ms) while preserving L2 planning error, visual quality (FID 12.5, FVD 88.1), collision rates, and NAVSIM PDMS scores.

## Method Summary
DISK wraps existing diffusion samplers with a dual-branch skip controller that performs local smoothness testing in latent space to decide when to compute or reuse denoising predictions. The method implements unidirectional cross-modal safety gating where trajectory complexity forces visual computation, and propagates controller statistics across rollout steps to maintain long-horizon stability. No training is required - the approach operates directly on pretrained Epona world models (1.3B MST, 1.2B VisDiT, 50M TrajDiT) using a rectified flow training scheme. Default configuration uses θ=0.01 curvature tolerance, W=3 warm-up steps, Cmax=4 max consecutive skips, and K=100 diffusion steps.

## Key Results
- 2x speedup on trajectory diffusion (20ms → 10ms) and 1.6x speedup on video diffusion (244ms → 155ms)
- Preserved L2 planning error and collision rates in closed-loop driving
- Maintained visual quality with FID 12.5 and FVD 88.1
- NAVSIM PDMS scores (NC/DAC/TTC/Comf/EP) remain stable across all metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Local Latent Linearity Skipping
The controller computes second-order finite-difference residuals on recent latent changes. If the residual indicates local smoothness, the model skips expensive forward passes and reuses cached velocity/noise predictions from previous steps. This exploits segments of low curvature in the diffusion ODE trajectory where numerical updates are predictable. Break condition occurs during rapid scene transitions or high-curvature latent regions.

### Mechanism 2: Unidirectional Cross-Modal Safety Gating
A safety signal generated when trajectory branches trigger safety guards forces the vision branch to compute, overriding its own skip decision. This ensures visual updates during complex maneuvers when trajectory complexity indicates scene changes. The unidirectional design optimizes throughput by only forcing vision when trajectory is complex, though it may miss visual complexity without trajectory complexity.

### Mechanism 3: Long-Horizon Stability Propagation
Controller statistics representing step difficulty propagate to subsequent steps, adjusting warm-up windows and skip thresholds. This re-calibrates the sampler to prevent error accumulation, assuming difficulty is temporally correlated in autoregressive chains. Break condition occurs in non-stationary environments where past difficulty poorly predicts future volatility.

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion ODE Solvers (Euler/Heun)**: Understanding how Ψ updates x_k is required to grasp caching vs. computing decisions. Quick check: If you reuse a cached velocity prediction from step k at step k-1, what geometric assumption are you making about the ODE trajectory?
- **Autoregressive Drift (Error Accumulation)**: Small errors compound over time in closed-loop rollouts, necessitating stability mechanisms. Quick check: Why does a small error at t=1 degrade the frame predicted at t=5 in closed-loop?
- **Latent Space Geometry**: Skip decisions rely on curvature in compressed video feature space, not pixel space. Quick check: Why is calculating smoothness in latent space more efficient than analyzing pixel differences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Context c → Controllers (Traj + Vis) → Safety Gate (Traj→Vis) → Diffusion Loop (K→1) → Update Latent → Log Stats → Output x_0
- **Critical path**: Controllers initialize stats from previous step → Diffusion Loop: Check Safety Gate → Calculate/Cache ū → Update Latent → Rollout Step End: Log stats → Output
- **Design tradeoffs**: Unidirectional gating optimizes throughput but risks desync; high θ enables aggressive skipping but increases drift risk
- **Failure signatures**: Visual "pop/jitter" indicates excessive skipping; motion blur during turns suggests safety gate failures; divergent trajectories indicate insufficient warm-up or stall thresholds
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Sanity check on static scene with zero ego-motion, 2) Safety gate ablation during lane changes, 3) θ sweep from 0.005 to 0.02 plotting latency vs. L2 error

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can joint step-wise coupling of both branches within a single sampler loop improve coordination beyond the current safety-gate approach?
- Does DISK generalize to multi-sensor world models with additional modalities like LiDAR or radar?
- Would bidirectional cross-modal coupling (vision↔trajectory) improve consistency compared to unidirectional design?

## Limitations
- Cross-modal safety gating effectiveness is limited by weak corpus evidence for bidirectional drift in autoregressive driving models
- Threshold sensitivity may require dynamic adaptation beyond current summary statistic propagation
- Generalization to non-driving domains remains untested beyond NuPlan and NuScenes datasets

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Local latent linearity skipping mechanism and mathematical formulation
- **Medium Confidence**: Long-horizon stability propagation through controller statistics
- **Medium Confidence**: Unidirectional cross-modal safety gating effectiveness

## Next Checks
1. Safety gate ablation in complex maneuvers: Disable safety gate and measure PDMS score and FVD degradation during lane changes
2. Threshold sensitivity across driving styles: Sweep θ from 0.005 to 0.02 across diverse scenarios and plot latency vs. L2 error
3. Long-horizon error accumulation analysis: Track cumulative L2 error, collision rate, and NAVSIM PDMS metrics over 100+ step rollouts to validate drift prevention
