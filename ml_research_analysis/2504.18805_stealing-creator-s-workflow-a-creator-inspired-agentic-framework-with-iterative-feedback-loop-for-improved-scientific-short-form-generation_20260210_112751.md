# Stealing Creator's Workflow: A Creator-Inspired Agentic Framework with Iterative Feedback Loop for Improved Scientific Short-form Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.18805
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18805
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SciTalk, a multi-agent framework for generating short-form scientific videos, shows improved accuracy and engagement over single-agent baselines through iterative feedback loops, though still falls short of human creators in coherence and polish.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SciTalk, an agentic framework that generates short-form scientific videos by mimicking human creators' workflows. The system uses specialized LLM agents for content summarization, visual scene planning, and text/layout editing, combined with an iterative feedback loop where vision-language models evaluate and refine outputs. Experiments demonstrate that the multi-agent approach improves compositional quality and factual accuracy compared to single-agent baselines, with modest progressive improvements across feedback iterations. However, generated videos still fall short of human creators in coherence and polish, and visual-audio synchronization degrades over time. The study provides early insights into agent-driven scientific video generation and highlights challenges in aligning automated feedback with human perception.

## Method Summary
SciTalk is a multi-agent framework for generating short-form scientific videos from research papers. It extracts paper content (text, figures, tables) and uses six specialized generation agents: Flashtalk Generator creates the narrative script, Sceneplan Generator defines sub-scenes with timing, and Background/Text/Effect Assistants produce component parameters. The Layout Allocator coordinates composition using MoviePy. An iterative feedback loop employs LLaVA-NeXT-Video 34B evaluators to assess sub-scenes against role-specific metrics, with Reflection Agents filtering and integrating feedback into revised prompts. The system emphasizes source grounding by compositing actual paper-derived assets rather than generative synthesis, ensuring factual accuracy. Videos are evaluated by human annotators and model-based metrics against single-agent baselines and human creators.

## Key Results
- Multi-agent architecture improves compositional quality, coherence, and alignment with scientific messaging compared to single-agent approaches
- Iterative feedback loops produce modest progressive improvements in engagement and content accuracy, though gains may not align with human perception
- Source-grounded compositional editing preserves factual accuracy and visual fidelity compared to generative synthesis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A specialized multi-agent architecture improves video composition quality and coherence compared to single-agent approaches for scientific video generation.
- Mechanism: The framework decomposes video creation into specialized roles (Flashtalk Generator, Sceneplan Generator, Background/Text/Effect Assistants, Layout Allocator), where each agent receives structured inputs and produces formatted outputs. This modularity enables fine-grained control across planning, production, and editing phases—mirroring human creator workflows.
- Core assumption: Scientific video generation benefits from task decomposition with explicit handoffs, where domain-specific constraints (factual grounding, source image alignment) are enforced at each stage rather than attempting end-to-end synthesis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SciTalk uses specialized agents for content summarization, visual scene planning, and text and layout editing"
  - [section] "Results (Figure 4) demonstrate that the multi-agent system improves compositional quality, coherence, and alignment with scientific messaging" (Section 4.2)
  - [corpus] CAL-RAG demonstrates multi-agent layout design improvements. Prompt-Driven Agentic Video Editing System shows agents aid narrative comprehension. Limited direct corpus on scientific video generation specifically.
- Break condition: If agent interfaces become ambiguous or handoff formats cannot be operationalized, decomposition overhead may exceed benefits and introduce coordination failures.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Iterative feedback loops with vision-language model evaluators produce modest progressive improvements in engagement and content accuracy, though gains may not align with human perception.
- Mechanism: After video composition, Feedback Agents (LLaVA-NeXT-Video 34B) evaluate sub-scenes against role-specific metrics. Reflection Agents filter and integrate relevant feedback into revised prompts, creating a gradient signal across iterations.
- Core assumption: Multimodal LLMs can approximate human evaluative judgments sufficiently to guide prompt refinement, and metric improvements translate to perceived quality gains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "incorporates an iterative feedback mechanism where video agents simulate user roles to give feedback on generated videos from previous iterations and refine generation prompts"
  - [section] "Figure 3a reveals slight but consistent improvements in agent-assigned scores across iterations" (Section 4.1); "model scores in the engagement dimension generally improved over time, peaking at the 4th iteration" (Section 4.3)
  - [corpus] FlowSteer demonstrates agentic workflow orchestration with iterative optimization. Weak direct evidence for multimodal feedback loops specifically.
- Break condition: If VLM evaluators systematically misalign with human perception (observed with visual-audio synchronization), feedback loops optimize wrong objectives or amplify errors.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Grounding generated videos in source materials via programmatic composition rather than pure generative synthesis preserves factual accuracy and visual fidelity.
- Mechanism: Preprocessing extracts paper content (text, figures, tables, screenshots). The Editing Stage composites actual paper-derived assets using MoviePy rather than generating synthetic visuals, ensuring source-grounded outputs.
- Core assumption: Factual accuracy in scientific communication requires preserving source material provenance; generative models' "creative contexts" are unsuitable for precise scientific knowledge representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "grounding videos in various sources, such as text, figures, visual styles, and avatars"
  - [section] "The final video is composed using a video editing library, not generative models, ensuring high visual fidelity and factual accuracy" (Page 2)
  - [corpus] Doc2PPT and Pub2Vid demonstrate source-grounding approaches for scientific dissemination using actual figures and key sentences.
- Break condition: If source materials are insufficient or composition logic cannot handle edge cases (overlapping text, timing mismatches), outputs may be cluttered despite accurate sourcing.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-agent orchestration patterns (specialization + coordination)
  - Why needed here: SciTalk requires decomposing a creative pipeline into agent roles with clear responsibilities and interfaces. Engineers must understand when decomposition helps versus introduces overhead.
  - Quick check question: Given a video generation task, can you identify three distinct subtasks with non-overlapping agent responsibilities?

- Concept: Iterative refinement with automated feedback (VLM-as-judge)
  - Why needed here: The feedback loop relies on multimodal models evaluating content and driving prompt improvements. Understanding automated evaluation limitations is critical.
  - Quick check question: If a VLM rates visual-audio sync highly but humans report degradation, what failure modes should you investigate?

- Concept: Source grounding vs. generative synthesis tradeoffs
  - Why needed here: SciTalk chooses compositional editing over end-to-end generation for factual accuracy. Engineers must understand when each approach applies.
  - Quick check question: For explaining a statistical result, would you use generated visuals or source figures? What accuracy risks does each introduce?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Preprocessing: Paper scraper, text/figure/screenshot extractors → structured assets
  - Planning: Flashtalk Generator (narrative), Sceneplan Generator (sub-scenes), Audio/Avatar Assistants
  - Editing: Background/Text/Effect Assistants, Layout Allocator → MoviePy composition
  - Feedback & Evaluation: Flashtalk/Sceneplan/Text Feedback Agents (LLaVA-NeXT-Video 34B), Reflection Agents, Evaluation Agent

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocessing extracts paper content (bottleneck: figure quality, PDF parsing)
  2. Flashtalk Generator creates narrative (determines downstream complexity)
  3. Sceneplan Generator defines sub-scenes with timing (constrains editing agents)
  4. Editing agents produce component parameters (requires valid tool descriptions)
  5. MoviePy composites final video (sanity checks for clutter, overlap)
  6. Feedback loop evaluates and revises prompts (iterates up to N times)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sub-scene vs. full-video feedback: Token limits force granularity, may miss global coherence
  - Automated vs. human evaluation: Model scores improve but diverge on audio-visual alignment
  - Fixed vs. adaptive prompts: Reflection can revise but may propagate errors
  - Compositional vs. generative: Chose composition for accuracy, sacrifices visual polish

- Failure signatures:
  - Visual clutter: Text overlap, dense subtitles, layout misalignments despite feedback (Figure 6)
  - Audio-visual desynchronization: Human AVA scores degrade (4.2→2.7)
  - Feedback misalignment: Model scores improve while human scores decline (Section 4.3)
  - Prompt instability: Autonomous regeneration may propagate errors (Section 5)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Single-agent baseline comparison: Run single-prompt vs. multi-agent on 3 papers; measure accuracy, clarity, engagement. Expected: multi-agent outperforms on coherence.
  2. Feedback loop ablation: Generate with 0, 1, 3, 5 iterations; track model and human scores. Expected: model scores improve modestly, human sync scores may decline.
  3. Source-grounding validation: Compare videos using actual figures vs. synthetic visuals; measure factual accuracy via expert review. Expected: source-grounded scores higher on scientific integrity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can iterative prompt refinement be stabilized to prevent the propagation of errors and visual clutter over multiple feedback loops?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion notes that "autonomous prompt regeneration may propagate small changes, leading to instability," and the Reflection Agent often adds density, causing "visual clutter introduced by longer scripts."
- Why unresolved: The current mechanism allows prompts to drift or accumulate excessive constraints without a filtering mechanism for overall complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the current unconstrained prompt updates against a constrained optimization approach (e.g., maintaining a fixed prompt length or complexity budget) on the "Scene Readability" metric.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does evaluating sub-scenes individually, rather than the full video context, contribute to global incoherence?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.1 notes that MLLMs evaluate "sub-scenes individually" due to token limits, while Section 4.5 highlights "layout misalignments" and text relevance issues that require a global view to resolve.
- Why unresolved: Local optimization of scenes may mathematically conflict with global narrative flow and visual consistency, but the isolated evaluation obscures this.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using long-context models to evaluate the full video sequence compared against the current sub-scene chunking method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can automated evaluation metrics be better aligned with human perception, particularly regarding audio-visual synchronization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.3 highlights a "clear gap between model-driven refinements and human perception," where model scores for synchronization fluctuated while human scores showed a "significant decline."
- Why unresolved: Current MLLM evaluators lack precise timestamp alignment capabilities and struggle to detect the "visual clutter" humans find distracting.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing a reward model fine-tuned on human synchronization preferences and correlating its scores with human evaluations of the generated videos.

## Limitations
- The framework's evaluation is limited to short-form videos without validation on longer formats or different domains
- Automated feedback loops show model score improvements but reveal concerning misalignment with human perception, particularly for visual-audio synchronization
- The multi-agent architecture's effectiveness is constrained by ambiguous agent interfaces and handoff formats that could introduce coordination failures

## Confidence
- Multi-agent architecture improves compositional quality: Medium confidence
- Iterative feedback loops produce progressive improvements: Low confidence
- Source grounding preserves factual accuracy: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. **Interface validation test:** Implement and test the agent communication protocols with actual JSON schemas for 3 diverse papers to identify handoff failures or ambiguity issues before scaling.
2. **Human-model alignment study:** Conduct a controlled comparison where the same videos are evaluated by both the LLaVA-NeXT-Video 34B and human annotators across all metrics, specifically measuring correlation and identifying where automated feedback diverges from human judgment.
3. **Edge case stress test:** Generate videos from papers with complex layouts (multiple overlapping figures, dense tables, long mathematical expressions) and systematically evaluate whether the compositional editing approach maintains visual clarity and factual accuracy.
