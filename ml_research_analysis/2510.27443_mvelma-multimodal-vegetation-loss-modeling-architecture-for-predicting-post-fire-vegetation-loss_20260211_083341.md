## Executive Summary
This study presents MVeLMA, a stacked ensemble architecture for predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss at the county level. The framework integrates multimodal data including meteorological variables, topographical features, and vegetation indices through a specialized processing pipeline. Evaluated on California wildfire data, MVeLMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with R² of 0.7232, MAE of 0.0109, and generates uncertainty estimates for targeted recovery planning. The model demonstrates robustness through cross-regional validation on Oregon data, though with reduced accuracy requiring further fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
MVeLMA employs a three-stage stacked architecture: (1) A bidirectional LSTM with attention processes 30-day meteorological sequences to extract temporal patterns, (2) A Gaussian Process Regression model with composite Matérn-Periodic kernel handles spatial correlations and provides uncertainty estimates, and (3) A Random Forest model corrects residual errors by integrating the latent representations with enriched static features. The framework uses a joint training approach where BiLSTM and GPR are optimized together via negative marginal likelihood, followed by RF training on the concatenated outputs. The target variable is post-fire vegetation loss calculated as mean pre-fire NDVI minus minimum post-fire NDVI.

## Key Results
- Achieved R² of 0.7232, MAE of 0.0109, MAPE of 4.77%, and NRMSE of 0.5261 on California test data
- Outperformed five state-of-the-art baselines by approximately 10% in R² and 11% in NRMSE
- Generated vegetation loss confidence maps enabling targeted recovery planning
- Cross-regional validation on Oregon data showed robustness with MAE of 0.0247, though requiring additional fine-tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Stacked Ensemble for Multimodal Feature Specialization
Processing temporal, spatial, and static features through specialized components before fusion improves prediction accuracy over monolithic models. BiLSTM processes 30-day meteorological sequences into a 20-dimensional latent vector, concatenated with 27 enriched static features and passed to GPR. Each component handles the modality it's best suited for: BiLSTM for sequential dependencies, GPR for spatial correlation and uncertainty, RF for non-linear feature interactions.

### Mechanism 2: Attention-Weighted Temporal Context Aggregation
The attention mechanism allows the model to learn which days within the 30-day pre-fire window matter most for vegetation loss prediction. Instead of treating all 30 days uniformly, the model can focus on specific time periods like dry spells that occurred 10 days before the fire, improving temporal pattern recognition.

### Mechanism 3: GPR-Based Uncertainty as Epistemic Confidence
Gaussian Process Regression provides calibrated uncertainty estimates indicating model confidence. The predictive variance from GPR represents epistemic uncertainty—higher in regions far from training data. This variance enables generation of vegetation loss confidence maps, helping identify counties where predictions are less reliable and recovery planning should be prioritized.

## Foundational Learning

- **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**: Processes 30-day weather sequences in both forward and backward directions, capturing patterns that may not be strictly causal. *Quick check*: Given a sequence [2, 5, 3, 8, 1], can you explain why a bidirectional model might capture different patterns than a unidirectional one?

- **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Kernel Functions**: Provides both predictions and uncertainty estimates. Kernel choice (RBF, Matérn, Periodic) encodes assumptions about function smoothness and structure. *Quick check*: What does the length-scale parameter in an RBF kernel control, and how would it affect predictions if set too large vs. too small?

- **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**: The target variable measuring vegetation health, ranging from -1 to 1 with higher values indicating healthier vegetation. Post-fire vegetation loss is computed as mean pre-fire NDVI minus minimum post-fire NDVI. *Quick check*: If a region has NDVI of 0.7 before fire and 0.3 after, what is the vegetation loss? What factors besides fire could cause NDVI to drop?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  ```
  [30-day Weather Sequence] → BiLSTM (64 hidden) → Attention → Dense → [20-dim latent z]
                                                                    ↓
  [27 Enriched Features] ─────────────────────────────────→ [Concat] → GPR → μ, σ²
                                                                              ↓
  [Latent z + GPR mean μ] ────────────────────────────────────────→ Random Forest → ŷ
  ```

- **Critical path**: Data preprocessing (temporal alignment of NDVI, weather, fire events) → BiLSTM training jointly with GPR (minimize negative MLL) → RF training on concatenated features. The GPR-BiLSTM joint optimization is the most complex step.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Composite kernel (Matérn + Periodic) vs. simpler RBF: More flexible but risks overfitting with limited data
  - 30-day window: Captures seasonal patterns but may miss longer-term drought effects
  - County-level aggregation: Computationally tractable but masks within-county heterogeneity

- **Failure signatures**:
  - GPR training diverges or produces NaN variances (check kernel parameters, data normalization)
  - RF feature importance dominated by a single feature (suggests data leakage or insufficient diversity)
  - Cross-regional validation shows large MAE increase (region-specific overfitting)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Ablation by component**: Run the 6 ablation variants (w/o BiLSTM, w/o GPR, w/o RF, etc.) to establish each component's contribution. Expected: full model > any ablation.
  2. **Kernel comparison**: Test RBF-only vs. Matérn vs. Composite kernels on validation set. Expected: Composite best if seasonal patterns exist.
  3. **Attention visualization**: Plot attention weights for sample fire events to verify the model attends to meaningful time steps (e.g., dry periods, temperature spikes) rather than random uniform weights.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Calibration Integration**: Can calibration techniques be effectively integrated into the MVeLMA framework to mitigate model overconfidence and align predicted uncertainty intervals with actual error rates? The authors acknowledge that uncertainty bounds may not perfectly correspond to true error likelihood, limiting reliability in critical decision-making scenarios.

2. **Anthropogenic Data Impact**: To what extent does the inclusion of anthropogenic data, such as landmarks and human-centered activities, improve the accuracy of post-fire vegetation loss predictions? The current model omits key human-infrastructure factors that may influence fire severity and recovery.

3. **Cross-Regional Generalization**: How can the architecture be modified to better generalize to diverse ecological regions without requiring extensive region-specific fine-tuning? The performance gap between California and Oregon data suggests potential overfitting to specific climatic characteristics.

## Limitations
- Stacked ensemble design relies on untested assumptions about modality-specific feature encoding
- Uncertainty estimates from GPR are not empirically calibrated to actual prediction errors
- County-level aggregation may mask important within-county heterogeneity in vegetation loss patterns

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: R² = 0.7232, MAE = 0.0109, MAPE = 4.77%, NRMSE = 0.5261 on California test set
- **Medium confidence**: Relative performance gains over baselines (10% R² improvement)
- **Low confidence**: Uncertainty calibration and cross-regional generalization without further validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct calibration analysis by plotting predicted vs. actual uncertainty quantiles and testing if high-variance predictions correlate with higher errors
2. Perform k-fold cross-validation within California data to assess variance in model performance across different spatial-temporal splits
3. Test the model on additional wildfire-prone regions (e.g., Australia, Mediterranean) with diverse vegetation types and fire regimes to validate robustness claims
