core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of maintaining many per-task models
  for automated scoring in educational assessment, which is computationally expensive
  and difficult to deploy at scale. To solve this, the authors propose UniMoE-Guided,
  a knowledge-distilled multi-task Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model that combines a
  shared encoder, a gated MoE block, and task-specific heads.

# Generalizable and Efficient Automated Scoring with a Knowledge-Distilled Multi-Task Mixture-of-Experts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17601
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17601
- Authors: Luyang Fang; Tao Wang; Ping Ma; Xiaoming Zhai
- Reference count: 3
- One-line primary result: UniMoE-Guided achieves comparable scoring performance to per-task models while being ~6× smaller in model count and ~87× smaller in parameters.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the scalability challenge in automated educational scoring, where maintaining separate models for each scoring task is computationally expensive and difficult to deploy. The authors propose UniMoE-Guided, a knowledge-distilled multi-task Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model that combines shared representation learning with task-specific adaptation. By leveraging a gated MoE block and knowledge distillation from large per-task teacher models, UniMoE-Guided achieves performance comparable to individually trained models while being dramatically more compact and efficient. The approach demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across multiple NGSS-aligned science reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
UniMoE-Guided addresses automated scoring scalability through a knowledge-distilled multi-task Mixture-of-Experts architecture. The model features a shared encoder that processes input text, followed by a gated MoE block that dynamically routes information through task-specific expert networks. Task-specific heads then produce final scoring predictions. Knowledge distillation transfers expertise from large per-task teacher models into this compact student architecture, allowing it to maintain high performance while sharing parameters across tasks. The MoE gating mechanism enables selective activation of task-relevant pathways, balancing between shared and task-specific processing.

## Key Results
- Achieves average Cohen's κ of 0.656 vs. 0.651 for individually trained models on nine NGSS-aligned tasks
- Maintains Macro-F1 of 0.757 vs. 0.744 compared to per-task baselines
- Reduces model footprint by ~6× compared to maintaining separate models and ~87× compared to the 20B-parameter teacher model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model leverages knowledge distillation to transfer expertise from large per-task teacher models into a compact shared architecture, while the MoE gating mechanism enables dynamic task-specific routing without maintaining separate full models for each task. This combination allows the model to capture both shared linguistic patterns across scoring tasks and task-specific nuances through selective expert activation.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge Distillation**: Why needed - Transfers learned expertise from large teacher models to smaller student models; Quick check - Verify teacher model performance exceeds student baseline before distillation.

**Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**: Why needed - Enables selective activation of task-specific pathways while sharing common representations; Quick check - Monitor expert utilization rates across different tasks.

**Multi-Task Learning**: Why needed - Shares representations across related tasks to improve generalization; Quick check - Compare single-task vs. multi-task performance on shared tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Text -> Shared Encoder -> Gated MoE Block -> Task-Specific Heads -> Scoring Output

Critical Path: The shared encoder processes input text, the MoE gating determines which experts to activate for the current task, and task-specific heads generate final predictions based on the routed expert outputs.

Design Tradeoffs: Balances between model compactness (shared parameters) and task-specific performance (MoE experts), with knowledge distillation providing a bridge between large teacher expertise and compact student architecture.

Failure Signatures: Poor distillation quality from teacher models, imbalanced expert utilization across tasks, or insufficient task-specific capacity in the MoE layer.

First Experiments: 1) Evaluate knowledge distillation quality by comparing teacher vs. student performance on held-out tasks; 2) Analyze expert utilization patterns across different scoring tasks; 3) Test generalization to new, unseen scoring tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on knowledge distillation requires access to large per-task teacher models during training
- Evaluation limited to narrow domain of NGSS-aligned science reasoning tasks
- Generalization claims based on only one held-out task may not fully demonstrate robustness

## Confidence

High: Efficiency gains (6× reduction in model count, 87× parameter reduction) and comparable performance metrics on evaluated tasks

Medium: Generalization claims due to limited cross-task validation

Low: Practical deployment benefits, as real-world factors like inference optimization and fairness considerations are not explored

## Next Checks

1. Test UniMoE-Guided on diverse educational domains (e.g., mathematics, language arts, social studies) to assess cross-domain generalization

2. Evaluate the model's fairness and bias properties across demographic subgroups to ensure equitable scoring

3. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis comparing inference-time efficiency (FLOPs, latency) of UniMoE-Guided against both per-task models and standard multi-task baselines in realistic deployment scenarios
