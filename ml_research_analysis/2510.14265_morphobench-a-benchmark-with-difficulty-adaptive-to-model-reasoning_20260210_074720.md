## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MORPHOBENCH, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models across multiple disciplines. Unlike existing benchmarks, MORPHOBENCH dynamically adjusts the difficulty of questions based on the model's reasoning performance using two key strategies: agent recognition (perturbing visual or textual cues) and agent reasoning (modifying key reasoning steps or adding misleading hints). The benchmark includes over 1,300 test questions drawn from Olympiad-level competitions, open-source datasets, and expert-designed scenarios. Evaluation results show that MORPHOBENCH effectively distinguishes between models of varying reasoning abilities, with models like o3 and GPT-5 demonstrating strong performance.

## Method Summary
MORPHOBENCH aggregates questions from open-source benchmarks, Olympiad competitions, and simulation-generated scenarios, then applies three adaptive difficulty mechanisms. The Agent-Reasoning Adapter modifies questions by injecting simplifying or complicating hints based on the model's own reasoning chain. The Agent-Recognition Adapter perturbs key visual or textual elements identified by the model. The Auto-Generation Adapter uses simulation software to create questions with tunable complexity parameters. All questions are evaluated using a judge model (o3-mini) for automated answer verification, with accuracy as the primary metric.

## Key Results
- MORPHOBENCH contains 1,307 questions across mathematics, engineering, natural sciences, and social sciences
- Models show strong performance on original questions but degrade predictably when difficulty is increased through adaptations
- o3 and GPT-5 demonstrate the highest reasoning capabilities, with GPT-5 showing smaller performance degradation than o3 when questions become more challenging
- Frontier models perform significantly better on social sciences (56.04%) than natural sciences (34.40%) despite both requiring multi-step reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Modifying guidance at intermediate reasoning steps can systematically increase or decrease problem-solving difficulty.
- Mechanism: The benchmark formalizes reasoning as path search on a proof graph where vertices are intermediate statements and edges are inference steps. Difficulty is tied to expected solution path cost. The system identifies key lemmas in reasoning traces and injects simplifying or complicating hints to change the search space.
- Core assumption: Model problem-solving can be abstracted as graph path search where edge costs approximate cognitive effort.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "MorphoBench adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key statements generated during the model's reasoning process." [Section 3.2.1-3.2.3, Section 3.3] Formalizes reasoning as path search on proof graph G_Q = (V, E, c).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Perturbing visual or textual cues that a model itself identifies as critical can increase task difficulty by testing robustness and generalization.
- Mechanism: Models first analyze questions and return essential elements. The benchmark then systematically obfuscates or alters these identified elements, forcing models to rely on alternative reasoning paths rather than surface-level feature matching.
- Core assumption: Models rely disproportionately on specific cues for correct answers, and degrading these cues reveals reasoning brittleness or robust generalization.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "It includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption." [Section 3.3, Appendix A.3] Describes "Agent Recognition" where perturbations are based on the model's own identified key visual information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Automatically generated questions with controllable parameters provide scalable, difficulty-graded evaluation.
- Mechanism: Questions are generated using simulation software where key parameters defining complexity are exposed. For circuit black-box tasks, increasing external terminals increases combinatorial complexity. Correctness is verified by simulator.
- Core assumption: Controlled parameter (e.g., terminal count) is the primary driver of reasoning difficulty, and performance generalizes to reasoning capability.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "It includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption." [Section 3.3, Table 3, Appendix A.3] Details automatic question generation for circuit black-box tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Proof Graph / Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The core theoretical construct used to formalize problem difficulty and reasoning steps. Understanding vertices as intermediate conclusions and edges as logical inferences is essential to grasp how difficulty is manipulated.
  - Quick check question: Given a simple arithmetic word problem, can you sketch a 3-4 node proof graph from the problem statement to the final answer?

- Concept: **Kolmogorov Complexity / Conditional Complexity**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses conditional Kolmogorov complexity K(A|Q) to define the "information gap" and formalize why certain modifications increase reasoning difficulty.
  - Quick check question: Explain in simple terms why a hint that reveals an intermediate step would reduce K(Answer | Question_with_hint) compared to K(Answer | Question).

- Concept: **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**
  - Why needed here: The benchmark evaluates these models, which integrate visual and textual processing. Understanding their general architecture helps in interpreting why visual cue perturbation is a relevant test.
  - Quick check question: Name two key components in a typical MLLM architecture and briefly describe their role in processing an image-text pair.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Curation Module -> Difficulty Adaptation Engine (Agent-Reasoning Adapter, Agent-Recognition Adapter, Auto-Generation Adapter) -> Evaluation Framework -> Result Analysis
- Critical path: Data Collection → Standardization → (Optional) Difficulty Adaptation (via 3 adapters) → Model Inference → Automated Evaluation → Result Analysis. The adaptation step is the key innovation, branching into three parallel strategies.
- Design tradeoffs:
  1. Manual vs. Automated Generation: Olympiad questions are high-quality but scarce; auto-generated questions are scalable but may lack nuance
  2. Adaptivity vs. Comparability: Adapting difficulty to each model allows fine-grained assessment but makes cross-model comparison less direct
  3. Perturbation Informativeness vs. Solvability: Aggressive perturbations better test robustness but risk making problems unsolvable
- Failure signatures:
  1. Metric Saturation: Models consistently score near 100% or 0% on adapted variants
  2. Misaligned Difficulty: Performance on auto-generated tasks doesn't correlate with natural science Olympiad questions
  3. Judge Model Bias: Automated judge systematically favors certain answer styles
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate all target models on original MORPHO-v0 dataset to establish baseline performance
  2. Create R(Lite) and R(Complex) versions for subset of questions via Agent-Reasoning Adapter; expect monotonic accuracy decrease from Lite → Original → Complex
  3. Generate circuit black-box problems across terminal count levels; plot accuracy vs. difficulty to confirm parameter scales as intended

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can automated generation of novel scientific reasoning problems from reference literature outperform perturbation-based difficulty adaptation in revealing model limitations? Current MorphoBench relies on modifying existing problems; generating genuinely novel problems requires understanding scientific context and creating valid reasoning chains.
- What architectural or training differences explain why GPT-5 shows smaller performance degradation than o3 when question difficulty increases? The paper observes this phenomenon but doesn't investigate underlying causes related to training distributions or inference strategies.
- Why do frontier models consistently underperform in natural sciences (34.40%) compared to social sciences (56.04%) despite both requiring multi-step reasoning? The paper identifies the gap but doesn't determine whether it stems from training data biases, the nature of scientific reasoning, or evaluation design.

## Limitations

- The mechanism relies heavily on models' Chain-of-Thought decomposition into discrete proof-graph steps, which may not generalize to all reasoning paradigms
- Agent-recognition perturbations depend on models consistently identifying the "right" cues, which could vary significantly across architectures
- Simulation-based auto-generation assumes parameter changes directly map to reasoning difficulty rather than perceptual complexity

## Confidence

- High confidence in the benchmark construction methodology and evaluation framework
- Medium confidence in the adaptive difficulty calibration mechanisms (Mechanisms 1-3)
- Low confidence in cross-model comparability when using model-specific adaptations

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies testing whether alternative graph-based reasoning decompositions (not from the target model) produce similar difficulty adjustments
2. Perform human evaluation on a sample of adapted questions to verify the perturbations actually increase reasoning difficulty rather than just perceptual noise
3. Test the simulation-generated questions with external domain experts to validate that parameter changes correspond to genuine reasoning complexity rather than artificial complexity
