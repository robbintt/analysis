# Are LLMs Ready for Practical Adoption for Assertion Generation?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.20633
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20633
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Current LLMs produce significant fraction of incorrect assertions, highlighting inadequacy for practical adoption

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates the readiness of Large Language Models for generating hardware assertions through the introduction of AssertionBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing both syntactic and semantic correctness. The authors demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle with assertion generation, producing many incorrect outputs that limit their practical utility in hardware verification workflows. To address these limitations, they propose AssertionLLM, a fine-tuned model specifically trained for assertion generation tasks. Initial experiments show promising improvements in assertion quality, suggesting that specialized training can significantly enhance LLM performance for this domain-specific task.

## Method Summary
The authors developed AssertionBench as a systematic evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance on assertion generation tasks. They conducted comprehensive experiments comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs against their proposed AssertionLLM model. The evaluation framework tested both syntactic correctness (proper syntax and structure) and semantic correctness (logical validity of assertions). The fine-tuning approach for AssertionLLM involved training on curated datasets of correct assertions and their corresponding natural language descriptions. Performance was measured using precision, recall, and overall assertion validity metrics across various hardware design scenarios.

## Key Results
- Current state-of-the-art LLMs produce a significant fraction of incorrect assertions
- AssertionLLM achieves up to 25% improvement in assertion validity compared to off-the-shelf LLMs
- Fine-tuning LLMs specifically for assertion generation substantially improves both syntactic and semantic correctness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assertion generation requires precise understanding of hardware design specifications and formal verification concepts. General-purpose LLMs lack the specialized training needed to accurately translate natural language requirements into formal assertions. By fine-tuning on domain-specific data, AssertionLLM develops better understanding of assertion syntax patterns and semantic relationships. The improvement stems from exposure to correct assertion examples during training, enabling the model to learn the mapping between design descriptions and appropriate assertion patterns. This specialized training helps overcome the generalization limitations of standard LLMs when applied to formal verification tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- Assertion syntax: Formal structure and grammar rules for hardware assertions (why needed: ensures syntactic validity; quick check: verify assertion parses correctly)
- Semantic correctness: Logical validity and meaningfulness of assertions (why needed: prevents false positives/negatives; quick check: formal verification of assertion logic)
- Hardware design patterns: Common verification scenarios and requirements (why needed: enables accurate translation; quick check: match assertions to design specifications)
- HDL integration: Interface between assertions and hardware description languages (why needed: ensures compatibility; quick check: successful compilation with HDL code)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Natural language input -> LLM encoder -> Assertion generation module -> Validation layer -> Output assertions
Critical path: Input processing and encoding is the bottleneck, as complex hardware descriptions require substantial context understanding before assertion generation can begin
Design tradeoffs: The model balances between generating comprehensive assertions versus maintaining syntactic correctness; aggressive generation may produce more assertions but with higher error rates
Failure signatures: Common failure modes include missing temporal operators, incorrect signal references, and malformed property specifications
First experiments:
1. Compare assertion validity rates across different hardware design complexities
2. Measure fine-tuning convergence with varying dataset sizes
3. Evaluate assertion generation speed versus quality tradeoffs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on specific assertion types and may not represent all practical scenarios
- Industrial-scale validation was not performed, limiting scalability assessment
- Benchmark design may not capture all edge cases present in real-world hardware verification

## Confidence
- Overall assessment of LLM inadequacy: Medium
- 25% improvement claim for AssertionLLM: Low
- Scalability assessment: Low
- Identified research challenges: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test AssertionLLM on diverse industrial designs with varying complexity levels
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of fine-tuning parameters
3. Evaluate assertion generation across multiple HDL languages and assertion frameworks to assess generalizability
