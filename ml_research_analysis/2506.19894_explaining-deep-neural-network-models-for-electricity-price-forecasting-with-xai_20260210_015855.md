# Explaining deep neural network models for electricity price forecasting with XAI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.19894
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19894
- Authors: Antoine Pesenti; Aidan OSullivan

- Key outcome: This paper applies explainable AI (XAI) methods to understand deep neural network (DNN) models used for day-ahead electricity price forecasting across five major markets. It introduces novel techniques—SSHAP values and SSHAP lines—to interpret high-dimensional tabular DNN models by aggregating SHAP values into super-variables, enhancing explainability. The study reveals that DNN models use more recent price variables rather than simple hour-matching, with distinct market-specific dynamics: renewable generation strongly influences Germany, while load forecasts drive France, Belgium, Nord Pool, and ComEd. Early morning high load forecasts correlate with lower prices later in the day, particularly in France, Belgium, and ComEd. The SSHAP lines help visualize how super-variables influence price predictions across price bands, showing offsetting effects between lagged and current forecasts. Overall, the research provides actionable insights into electricity market mechanisms and improves transparency in complex AI-driven price forecasts.

## Executive Summary
This research addresses the critical need for interpretability in deep neural network models used for day-ahead electricity price forecasting across five major markets. The study introduces SSHAP (Super-Variable SHAP) methodology, which aggregates SHAP values into interpretable super-variables to explain complex DNN predictions in high-dimensional tabular data. By applying this novel XAI approach, the researchers uncover that DNN models capture sophisticated market dynamics beyond simple hour-matching, utilizing more recent price variables and demonstrating distinct regional patterns in how different factors influence price predictions.

The SSHAP methodology provides actionable insights for electricity market operators and traders by revealing the relative importance of various super-variables and their interactions across different price bands. The research demonstrates that while DNN models outperform traditional linear approaches, their predictive power comes from capturing nuanced relationships between renewable generation, load forecasts, and price dynamics that vary significantly by market. These findings not only improve transparency in AI-driven forecasting but also offer practical guidance for understanding electricity market mechanisms and potential policy implications for market design and renewable integration.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comprehensive methodology combining deep neural networks with advanced explainable AI techniques to analyze electricity price forecasting models. The researchers develop SSHAP values by aggregating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values from individual features into interpretable super-variables, reducing dimensionality while preserving explanatory power. The DNN architecture uses LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies in electricity price data, trained on five day-ahead markets: Germany, France, Belgium, Nord Pool, and ComEd. The SSHAP lines visualization technique extends traditional SHAP analysis by showing how super-variables influence predictions across different price bands, revealing offsetting effects between lagged and current forecasts. The methodology is validated through comparative analysis with linear models and cross-market performance evaluation, demonstrating superior interpretability without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

## Key Results
- DNN models consistently outperform linear models across all five tested markets, with SSHAP analysis revealing they use more recent price variables rather than simple hour-matching
- Market-specific dynamics identified: renewable generation strongly influences Germany prices, while load forecasts drive France, Belgium, Nord Pool, and ComEd markets
- SSHAP lines visualization reveals offsetting effects between lagged and current forecasts, with early morning high load forecasts correlating with lower prices later in the day, particularly in France, Belgium, and ComEd

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SSHAP methodology works by aggregating individual SHAP values into super-variables that represent meaningful groupings of features, making high-dimensional tabular DNN models interpretable. This aggregation preserves the additive properties of SHAP while reducing complexity, allowing visualization of how groups of features collectively influence predictions. The SSHAP lines technique extends this by showing how super-variable contributions vary across different price prediction bands, revealing the dynamic nature of feature importance. This approach works particularly well for electricity markets because it captures both the temporal dependencies (through LSTM layers) and the complex interactions between physical factors (renewables, load) and price formation mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning
- **SHAP values**: Explainability method based on game theory that attributes prediction contributions to individual features; needed to provide local explanations for DNN predictions in interpretable terms
- **Super-variables**: Aggregated feature groups that combine related inputs into higher-level concepts; needed to reduce dimensionality while maintaining explanatory power in high-dimensional tabular data
- **SSHAP methodology**: Novel approach combining SHAP aggregation with super-variable concepts; needed to make complex DNN models interpretable for domain experts
- **LSTM networks**: Recurrent neural network architecture that captures temporal dependencies; needed to model the time-series nature of electricity price data
- **Day-ahead market structure**: Trading mechanism where prices are determined 24 hours in advance; needed context for understanding forecasting challenges and market dynamics
- **Electricity price formation**: Complex process influenced by supply, demand, renewables, and grid constraints; needed to interpret model predictions and identify meaningful super-variables

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Raw market data → Feature engineering → DNN with LSTM layers → SHAP value computation → SSHAP aggregation → SSHAP lines visualization → Interpretability insights

**Critical Path:**
Feature engineering → DNN training → SHAP computation → SSHAP aggregation → Visualization and interpretation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The study prioritizes interpretability over raw predictive performance, accepting slight accuracy reductions for the benefit of explainable insights. The choice of LSTM over simpler architectures balances temporal modeling capability with computational efficiency. SSHAP aggregation trades granular feature-level explanations for higher-level super-variable insights that are more actionable for domain experts.

**Failure Signatures:**
Poor SSHAP aggregation may indicate inappropriate feature grouping or insufficient SHAP computation quality. Model performance degradation could signal overfitting to specific market conditions or inadequate temporal modeling. Visualization artifacts in SSHAP lines might indicate numerical instability in SHAP calculations or inappropriate binning of price bands.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate SSHAP aggregation stability across different random seeds and market conditions
2. Compare SSHAP-based interpretations with domain expert knowledge of electricity markets
3. Test sensitivity of SSHAP results to different feature grouping strategies and aggregation methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on five European and North American markets may limit generalizability to other regional electricity markets with different regulatory frameworks
- Two-year testing period may not capture long-term market dynamics and structural changes
- SSHAP methodology relies on aggregation that may obscure some granular relationships between individual features and predictions

## Confidence
- High: DNN models' superiority over linear approaches, identification of super-variables' influence on price predictions
- Medium: Specific market-level interpretations due to potential regional market structure differences and relatively short testing period

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the SSHAP methodology across additional electricity markets (e.g., Australia, Japan) to test generalizability of findings
2. Conduct out-of-sample testing using multi-year datasets to assess model stability across different market conditions
3. Perform ablation studies removing specific super-variables to quantify their individual contribution to prediction accuracy
