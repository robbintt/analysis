# Delta-XAI: A Unified Framework for Explaining Prediction Changes in Online Time Series Monitoring

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.23036
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23036
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces Delta-XAI framework with SWING method achieving 23.87 correlation score on MIMIC-III, outperforming GradSHAP (13.73) and IG (13.42)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Delta-XAI, a comprehensive framework for explaining prediction changes in online time series monitoring. The framework adapts 14 existing XAI methods to explain differences between adjacent time steps rather than single predictions, addressing limitations of static attribution methods. The authors propose SWING, an extension of Integrated Gradients that incorporates historical context to capture temporal dependencies and mitigate out-of-distribution effects. Through extensive experiments across clinical, activity recognition, and synthetic datasets, the framework demonstrates superior performance on multiple evaluation metrics including faithfulness, sufficiency, coherence, and efficiency.

## Method Summary
Delta-XAI introduces a novel approach to time series explanation by shifting focus from explaining single predictions to explaining prediction changes between adjacent time steps. The framework adapts existing XAI methods for this temporal difference setting and introduces comprehensive evaluation metrics. Building on this foundation, the authors propose SWING (Smooth Weighting with Integrated Gradients), which extends Integrated Gradients by incorporating historical context through a weighting mechanism that captures temporal dependencies and addresses out-of-distribution effects. SWING uses a hyperparameter λ to balance current and historical contributions, providing more stable and interpretable explanations for prediction changes in streaming time series data.

## Key Results
- SWING achieves 23.87 correlation score on MIMIC-III with LSTM backbone, significantly outperforming GradSHAP (13.73) and IG (13.42)
- Framework demonstrates superior performance across faithfulness, sufficiency, coherence, and efficiency metrics
- Comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets including clinical (MIMIC-III), activity recognition, and synthetic data
- Computational efficiency maintained despite historical context incorporation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by reframing the explanation problem from explaining absolute predictions to explaining prediction deltas between time steps. This temporal difference approach captures the actual signal of interest in monitoring scenarios - what caused the prediction to change rather than what caused the prediction itself. SWING specifically works by extending Integrated Gradients with a historical weighting mechanism that aggregates gradients over multiple time steps, allowing it to capture temporal dependencies and smooth out noise from individual time points. The λ parameter controls the trade-off between current and historical information, enabling adaptation to different temporal dynamics in various domains.

## Foundational Learning

**Integrated Gradients**: A gradient-based XAI method that provides attribution by integrating gradients along a path from a baseline to the input. Why needed: Forms the basis for SWING's extension. Quick check: Verify path integral computation matches theoretical definition.

**Temporal Difference Explanation**: Explaining prediction changes between adjacent time steps rather than absolute predictions. Why needed: More relevant for monitoring applications where change detection is the primary goal. Quick check: Confirm delta explanations correlate with actual prediction changes.

**Faithfulness Metrics**: Measures how well explanations reflect the true model behavior. Why needed: Essential for validating explanation quality beyond correlation with ground truth. Quick check: Compare faithfulness scores across different explanation methods.

**Sufficiency Metrics**: Evaluates whether explanations contain enough information to approximate model predictions. Why needed: Ensures explanations are complete and not missing critical information. Quick check: Test prediction reconstruction from top-k features.

**Coherence Metrics**: Measures consistency of explanations across similar inputs or time steps. Why needed: Important for stable explanations in streaming scenarios. Quick check: Verify explanation stability under small input perturbations.

**Efficiency Metrics**: Quantifies computational overhead of explanation methods. Why needed: Critical for real-time monitoring applications. Quick check: Measure runtime per explanation relative to model inference time.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Time series data -> Model (LSTM) -> Prediction delta computation -> Explanation methods (14 adapted methods + SWING) -> Evaluation metrics

**Critical Path**: Data preprocessing -> Model inference -> Delta computation -> Explanation generation -> Metric calculation

**Design Tradeoffs**: SWING trades some computational overhead for improved temporal stability and out-of-distribution robustness. The λ parameter introduces tunability but requires domain-specific optimization.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor λ selection can lead to over-smoothing or under-smoothing of explanations. Extreme λ values may cause explanations to ignore important recent changes or fail to capture long-term trends.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare SWING explanations with ground truth feature importance on synthetic data with known temporal patterns
2. Ablation study varying λ parameter to identify optimal range for different temporal dynamics
3. Stress test SWING on out-of-distribution time series to evaluate robustness claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on LSTM backbones, limiting generalizability to other architectures like Transformers or temporal convolutional networks
- Practical significance of performance improvements remains unclear despite statistical significance
- Requires λ parameter tuning without systematic guidance for optimal selection across different domains
- Assumes equal suitability of 14 adapted XAI methods for temporal explanations without addressing potential methodological mismatches

## Confidence

**Major Claims Confidence:**
- Framework novelty and adaptation of existing methods: **High** - well-documented and clearly presented
- SWING performance improvements: **Medium** - statistically significant but practical impact needs validation
- Evaluation metric comprehensiveness: **High** - metrics are well-justified and systematically applied

## Next Checks

1. Validate SWING performance across diverse model architectures (Transformers, TCNNs) beyond LSTM to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies on the λ parameter to provide concrete guidance for practitioners
3. Implement real-world deployment testing to evaluate the practical utility of explanations in clinical decision-making scenarios
