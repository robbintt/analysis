# When Embedding Models Meet: Procrustes Bounds and Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13406
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13406
- Reference count: 40
- Shows orthogonal Procrustes alignment effectively makes embedding models interoperable while preserving geometric properties

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning two sets of embeddings that approximately preserve dot products but cannot be directly compared. The authors establish theoretical bounds showing that when two embedding models preserve pairwise dot products within bounded error, there exists an orthogonal transformation that closely aligns them. They demonstrate a practical post-processing method using orthogonal Procrustes transformation to make embedding models interoperable without modifying training procedures or distorting embedding geometry.

The approach is evaluated across three applications: maintaining compatibility across model retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving mixed-modality search. The results show that orthogonal alignment consistently outperforms baselines while preserving the geometric structure of embedding spaces, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MixBench for multimodal retrieval tasks.

## Method Summary
The core method applies orthogonal Procrustes transformation to align two sets of embeddings. Given two embedding matrices A and B that approximately preserve dot products, the transformation finds an orthogonal matrix Q that minimizes the Frobenius norm ||AQ - B||_F. This transformation is computed using singular value decomposition: if B^T A = U Σ V^T, then Q = U V^T. The method requires access to paired data points (same items represented in both embedding spaces) to compute the alignment. Once aligned, the transformed embeddings can be used interchangeably for downstream tasks while maintaining geometric properties of the original spaces.

## Key Results
- On MovieLens, orthogonal alignment achieves the best performance among alignment methods for both similar movie retrieval and genre classification tasks
- For text retrieval, orthogonal Procrustes enables successful cross-model retrieval and improves performance when upgrading to stronger query models
- On MixBench, the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent work by Li et al. (2025) in multimodal retrieval tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The orthogonal Procrustes transformation works because it finds the optimal rotation/reflection that aligns two point clouds while preserving distances and angles within each space. When two embedding models approximately preserve dot products, their respective embedding spaces have similar geometric structures but may differ in orientation. The orthogonal transformation corrects for this rotational difference without introducing scaling or shearing that would distort the internal geometry of either embedding space.

## Foundational Learning

**Orthogonal Procrustes Problem**
- Why needed: Core mathematical framework for finding optimal rotation between point sets
- Quick check: Verify that Q^T Q = I (orthogonality constraint)

**Dot Product Preservation**
- Why needed: Theoretical foundation for why alignment is possible
- Quick check: Compute pairwise dot product correlations between embedding spaces

**Frobenius Norm Minimization**
- Why needed: Optimization objective for finding best alignment
- Quick check: Confirm that ||AQ - B||_F decreases after applying Q

**Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
- Why needed: Computational method to solve the Procrustes problem
- Quick check: Ensure decomposition yields correct orthogonal matrices

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Paired data -> Embedding model A -> Embedding model B -> Orthogonal Procrustes transformation -> Aligned embeddings -> Downstream task

**Critical Path**
1. Obtain paired representations from both models
2. Compute orthogonal transformation matrix Q
3. Apply transformation to align embedding spaces
4. Evaluate aligned embeddings on downstream task

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Simplicity vs. optimality: Simple orthogonal alignment vs. more complex nonlinear transformations
- Data requirements: More paired data improves alignment quality but increases computational cost
- Preservation vs. alignment: Strict orthogonality preserves geometry but may limit achievable alignment

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor alignment quality when dot product preservation assumption is violated
- Performance degradation when models have fundamentally different objectives
- Suboptimal results with insufficient paired data

**First Experiments**
1. Measure dot product preservation correlation between embedding models
2. Apply orthogonal Procrustes to synthetic data with known rotation
3. Compare retrieval performance before and after alignment on validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical bounds assume dot product preservation within bounded error, which may not hold for models with different training objectives
- Method requires access to paired data for alignment, which may not always be available
- Performance may degrade when embedding models have significantly different architectures or training procedures

## Confidence

**High**: Orthogonal Procrustes alignment method is well-established; theoretical bounds for dot product preservation are mathematically sound; consistent empirical improvements across three distinct applications

**Medium**: Claim that orthogonal alignment "preserves embedding geometry" while achieving state-of-the-art results needs more extensive ablation studies; MixBench results comparison is promising but field is rapidly evolving

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying the amount of paired data used for alignment to determine minimum requirements for effective orthogonal Procrustes transformation across different model pairs

2. Test the alignment approach on embedding models with fundamentally different architectures (e.g., transformer-based vs. CNN-based) to evaluate robustness when dot product preservation assumptions are less strictly met

3. Perform long-term stability analysis by repeatedly retraining models over extended periods to assess whether orthogonal alignment maintains consistent performance across multiple model generations
