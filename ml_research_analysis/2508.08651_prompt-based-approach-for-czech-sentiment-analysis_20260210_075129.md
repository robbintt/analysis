# Prompt-Based Approach for Czech Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08651
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08651
- Reference count: 28
- This paper presents the first prompt-based approach for sentiment analysis in Czech, achieving state-of-the-art results

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel prompt-based approach for Czech sentiment analysis, focusing on both aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) and traditional sentiment classification (SC). The authors propose using sequence-to-sequence models with prompt-based fine-tuning to solve multiple ABSA tasks simultaneously, including aspect category detection, aspect term extraction, aspect category sentiment analysis, and target-aspect sentiment detection. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of Czech monolingual BERT-like models for aspect polarity detection and sentiment classification tasks. The experiments show that prompting significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios with as few as 10-20 training examples.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a comprehensive approach to Czech sentiment analysis using prompt-based fine-tuning of sequence-to-sequence models. For ABSA tasks, they employ T5 and BART models with carefully designed prompts that enable simultaneous solving of multiple tasks including aspect category detection, aspect term extraction, aspect category sentiment analysis, and target-aspect sentiment detection. For sentiment classification, they use Czech monolingual BERT-like models with task-specific prompts. The approach includes domain-specific pretraining on restaurant reviews for ABSA and movie reviews for sentiment classification, which significantly improves zero-shot performance. The authors evaluate their methods on multiple Czech datasets, comparing prompt-based fine-tuning against traditional fine-tuning approaches and establishing new state-of-the-art results.

## Key Results
- Prompting improved ABSA micro F1 scores by up to 19 points compared to traditional fine-tuning
- In few-shot sentiment classification with 10-20 examples, prompting achieved 60.4% and 65.2% accuracy versus 50.3% and 51.5% for traditional fine-tuning
- FERNET model achieved state-of-the-art 88.2% accuracy on sentiment classification
- Domain-specific pretraining significantly improved zero-shot performance for both ABSA and sentiment classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Prompt-based fine-tuning leverages the inherent knowledge and generalization capabilities of large language models by framing tasks as natural language prompts. This approach allows models to better understand task semantics and transfer knowledge from pretraining to downstream tasks. For Czech sentiment analysis specifically, this method overcomes the limitations of traditional fine-tuning by providing contextual cues that guide the model's predictions. The sequence-to-sequence architecture enables handling of multiple ABSA tasks simultaneously through unified prompt design, while domain-specific pretraining on relevant corpora (restaurant and movie reviews) provides task-relevant representations that enhance zero-shot and few-shot performance.

## Foundational Learning
- Prompt engineering for Czech NLP: Why needed - Czech has complex morphology and requires task-specific prompting; Quick check - Evaluate prompt variations on validation set
- Sequence-to-sequence fine-tuning vs. discriminative fine-tuning: Why needed - Enables multi-task learning for ABSA; Quick check - Compare joint vs. individual task training
- Domain adaptation through pretraining: Why needed - Czech domain-specific data is limited; Quick check - Measure zero-shot performance before/after pretraining
- Few-shot learning evaluation: Why needed - Real-world Czech NLP applications often have limited labeled data; Quick check - Test with varying numbers of examples per class
- Czech language model architectures: Why needed - Standard multilingual models underperform on Czech; Quick check - Compare Czech monolingual vs. multilingual models

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Czech text -> Prompt encoder -> Sequence-to-sequence model (T5/BART/FERNET) -> Task-specific output decoder

Critical path: Input text + prompt template -> Model encoding -> Cross-attention mechanism -> Generation head -> Task output

Design tradeoffs: Prompt-based approaches offer better generalization and few-shot performance but require careful prompt engineering and may be computationally more expensive than traditional fine-tuning. The choice between T5 and BART depends on task complexity and available computational resources.

Failure signatures: Poor performance on morphologically complex Czech words, inability to handle domain-specific terminology without pretraining, degradation in few-shot scenarios with insufficient examples per class.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate prompt variations on a held-out validation set to optimize prompt design
2. Compare zero-shot performance with and without domain-specific pretraining
3. Test few-shot learning with 5, 10, and 20 examples per class to establish learning curves

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation focuses on specific datasets and model architectures, limiting generalizability to other Czech NLP tasks
- No ablation studies isolate the contribution of prompting versus domain-specific pretraining
- Few-shot learning results are based on only 10-20 examples per class, which may not represent realistic deployment scenarios
- Lacks error analysis to understand failure modes of the prompt-based approach

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The claim that prompting improves ABSA performance over traditional fine-tuning on tested Czech datasets, demonstrated with multiple metrics and large effect sizes.

**Medium confidence**: The superiority of prompting in few-shot SC scenarios, shown with limited data points and no statistical significance testing reported.

**Medium confidence**: The state-of-the-art claim for FERNET on SC, based on comparison with unspecified baselines without clear methodology description.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing prompting performance with and without domain-specific pretraining to isolate the effects of each technique.

2. Test the prompt-based approach on additional Czech NLP tasks beyond sentiment analysis to evaluate generalizability.

3. Perform statistical significance testing on few-shot learning results and include error analysis to understand when and why the prompt-based approach fails.
