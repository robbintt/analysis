# Expanding Vietnamese SentiWordNet to Improve Performance of Vietnamese Sentiment Analysis Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.08758
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08758
- **Reference count:** 31
- **Primary result:** Combines extended Vietnamese SentiWordNet with PhoBERT-V2 to achieve state-of-the-art F1-scores of 0.95 (VLSP 2016) and 0.94 (AIVIVN 2019) on Vietnamese sentiment analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a method to expand the Vietnamese SentiWordNet and combines it with the PhoBERT-V2 language model to improve sentiment analysis performance on Vietnamese review datasets. The approach extracts sentiment features from the extended lexicon and integrates them with deep contextual representations from PhoBERT. Experiments on VLSP 2016 and AIVIVN 2019 datasets show that the proposed CombViSA model achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming previous models including PhoBERT-V2 alone and multilingual BERT. The extended lexicon improves coverage and boosts classification accuracy, especially for long and irregular review texts.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines two complementary approaches: an expanded Vietnamese SentiWordNet lexicon and the PhoBERT-V2 language model. The expansion process involves extracting sentiment-bearing words from Vietnamese review datasets and adding them to the original lexicon with sentiment scores. For each input text, the system first extracts sentiment features from the extended lexicon, then feeds both the original text and these features into PhoBERT-V2. The model architecture concatenates PhoBERT's contextual embeddings with lexicon-based sentiment features before passing them through classification layers. This hybrid approach leverages both the deep contextual understanding of transformer models and the explicit sentiment knowledge encoded in the lexicon.

## Key Results
- CombViSA achieves F1-scores of 0.95 on VLSP 2016 and 0.94 on AIVIVN 2019 datasets
- Outperforms PhoBERT-V2 alone and multilingual BERT baselines
- Extended lexicon improves coverage and accuracy, particularly for long and irregular review texts
- State-of-the-art results on Vietnamese sentiment analysis benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The combination of extended lexicon features with PhoBERT-V2's contextual representations creates a synergistic effect. The lexicon expansion captures sentiment-bearing words specific to Vietnamese review contexts that may not be well-represented in general language models. By explicitly providing these sentiment features alongside contextual embeddings, the model can better distinguish between nuanced sentiment expressions, particularly in complex or lengthy reviews where context alone may be insufficient. The approach effectively combines symbolic knowledge (lexicon) with statistical learning (transformer embeddings).

## Foundational Learning
- **Vietnamese sentiment lexicon construction:** Why needed - Vietnamese lacks comprehensive sentiment resources; quick check - compare coverage against English SentiWordNet equivalents
- **Transformer-based language modeling:** Why needed - capture contextual word representations; quick check - ablation study removing PhoBERT
- **Lexicon-to-embedding feature fusion:** Why needed - combine symbolic and statistical sentiment signals; quick check - different fusion strategies (concatenation vs. attention)
- **Vietnamese text preprocessing:** Why needed - handle diacritics and tokenization challenges; quick check - compare results with/without normalization
- **Multi-task learning potential:** Why needed - sentiment analysis benefits from related NLP tasks; quick check - joint training with POS tagging or NER

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Vietnamese text -> PhoBERT-V2 tokenizer -> Contextual embeddings + Lexicon features -> Concatenation -> Classification layers -> Sentiment prediction

**Critical Path:** Text preprocessing → Lexicon feature extraction → PhoBERT encoding → Feature fusion → Classification → Prediction

**Design Tradeoffs:** Lexicon expansion vs. model complexity (richer lexicon increases coverage but requires more memory); end-to-end learning vs. explicit feature engineering (combines benefits of both approaches)

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on out-of-domain text (lexicon may not generalize); over-reliance on lexicon features (may miss contextual nuances); computational overhead (dual processing path)

**3 First Experiments:** 1) Ablation study: PhoBERT-V2 alone vs. with lexicon features; 2) Lexicon-only baseline comparison; 3) Cross-domain validation on non-review Vietnamese text

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Generalization to non-review Vietnamese text domains remains untested
- Integration mechanism between lexicon and PhoBERT representations needs further investigation
- Focus on Vietnamese limits broader applicability to other low-resource languages

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Methodology for expanding Vietnamese SentiWordNet and technical integration with PhoBERT-V2 are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium confidence:** Reported F1-scores and performance improvements over baseline models, pending verification of experimental setup and baseline comparisons
- **Low confidence:** Generalization of results to other Vietnamese text domains and long-term stability of the extended lexicon approach

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset validation by testing the extended SentiWordNet approach on Vietnamese text from different domains (e.g., social media, news articles) to assess generalization
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the extended lexicon from PhoBERT-V2's contextual representations, determining if improvements are additive or synergistic
3. Compare the proposed approach against a broader range of Vietnamese sentiment analysis models, including recent transformer-based methods, to verify the state-of-the-art claims
