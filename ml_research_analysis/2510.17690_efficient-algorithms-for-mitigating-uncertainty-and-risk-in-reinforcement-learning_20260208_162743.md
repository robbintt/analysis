## Executive Summary
This dissertation addresses uncertainty and risk in reinforcement learning through three main contributions. First, it proposes the Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm for Multi-Model MDPs (MMDPs), which iteratively adjusts model weights to guarantee monotone policy improvements to a local maximum, outperforming existing dynamic programming algorithms on benchmark problems. Second, it establishes sufficient and necessary conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and proves the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. It also proposes exponential value iteration, policy iteration, and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies. Third, it proposes model-free Q-learning algorithms for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC objectives, proving their convergence to optimal risk-averse value functions using the monotonicity of the Bellman operators.

## Method Summary
The dissertation presents three algorithms addressing uncertainty and risk in RL. CADP solves MMDPs by alternating between policy optimization and model weight updates, ensuring monotone improvements. For ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC, it establishes theoretical conditions for Bellman operator contraction and proposes model-based exponential value iteration, policy iteration, and LP formulations. Finally, it develops model-free Q-learning algorithms using exponential loss functions, with convergence proofs relying on bounded TD residuals and proper step size conditions. The algorithms are evaluated on benchmark domains including Riverswim, Population, HIV, Inventory, Gambler's ruin, and Cliff walking.

## Key Results
- CADP guarantees monotone policy improvements and outperforms existing dynamic programming algorithms on benchmark MMDP problems
- Sufficient and necessary conditions established for exponential ERM Bellman operator contraction and existence of stationary optimal policies for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC
- Model-free Q-learning algorithms proven to converge to optimal risk-averse value functions under proper parameter selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by leveraging monotonicity properties in their update rules. CADP alternates between optimizing policies given current model weights and updating weights given current policies, ensuring each iteration improves or maintains performance. The exponential Bellman operators for risk measures provide contraction mappings under specific conditions on the exponential parameter β, enabling iterative algorithms to converge to optimal policies. The Q-learning algorithms use stochastic gradient descent on risk-sensitive losses with bounded temporal difference residuals, ensuring convergence to optimal risk-averse value functions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-Model MDPs (MMDPs)**: Framework for handling uncertainty when multiple transition models exist. Needed to capture model uncertainty in decision-making. Quick check: Verify CADP improves policy monotonically across model weight updates.
- **Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)**: Risk measure capturing expected return in the worst α-fraction of outcomes. Needed for risk-averse optimization. Quick check: Confirm EVaR policies become more conservative as α increases in Gambler's ruin.
- **Exponential Risk Measures (ERM/EVaR)**: Mathematical formulations for risk-sensitive optimization using exponential utilities. Needed to enable tractable computation of risk measures. Quick check: Verify Bellman operator contraction conditions hold for chosen β values.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: CADP (policy optimization -> weight update -> policy optimization); ERM-TRC (exponential VI -> policy evaluation -> improvement); EVaR-TRC (β discretization -> ERM optimization -> max selection); Q-learning (loss computation -> TD update -> policy improvement)
- **Critical path**: For Q-learning: TD residual computation -> exponential loss evaluation -> q-value update -> policy improvement
- **Design tradeoffs**: Model-based approaches offer stronger theoretical guarantees but require full MDP knowledge; model-free approaches scale better but need careful parameter tuning
- **Failure signatures**: Q-learning divergence when β too large; CADP oscillation when weight updates not properly constrained; EVaR policies becoming too conservative with improper β selection
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Run CADP on Riverswim to verify Table 2.1 returns; 2) Implement LP for Gambler's ruin and compare EVaR policies across α values; 3) Validate Q-learning convergence on Cliff Walking for α=0.4

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can CADP and risk-averse Q-learning algorithms be effectively extended to deep RL using neural network approximation? (Section 2.7, 5)
- Is it possible to develop rigorous, model-free methodology for selecting boundedness parameters and initial risk level without prior knowledge? (Section 4.6)
- Can TRC framework be extended to infinite-state problems, average rewards, or partial-state observations? (Section 3.6, Chapter 5)

## Limitations
- Algorithms limited to tabular settings with finite state and action spaces
- Model-free approaches require careful parameter tuning for boundedness parameters and initial risk levels
- Theoretical guarantees rely on transience assumptions and specific conditions on exponential parameters

## Confidence
- High confidence: CADP monotone improvement guarantee and convergence to local optimum (Theorem 2.1)
- Medium confidence: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC Bellman operator contraction properties (Theorems 3.1 and 3.3)
- Medium confidence: Q-learning convergence proofs for risk-averse objectives with proper parameter selection

## Next Checks
1. Implement CADP on Riverswim with M=100 models and verify reported mean returns in Table 2.1 across at least 5 random seeds
2. Reproduce EVaR policy comparisons for Gambler's ruin (K=7, q=0.68) across all α values in Figure 3.3 using LP formulation
3. Validate Q-learning convergence on Cliff Walking for α=0.4 by confirming EVaR value reaches LP-computed optimum within 20,000 samples
