# Efficient Medical VIE via Reinforcement Learning
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.13363
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13363
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: RLVR method achieves SOTA on medical VIE with only 100 annotated samples

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of extracting structured information from medical images, which is critical for applications like report analysis and online consultations. Traditional approaches rely on OCR followed by language models, but domain-specific schemas and high annotation costs limit their effectiveness. The authors propose a novel method based on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that requires only 100 annotated samples. Their approach ensures dataset diversity, uses a balanced precision-recall reward mechanism to reduce hallucinations and improve field coverage, and employs innovative sampling strategies to enhance reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B with their RLVR method achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical VIE tasks, significantly improving F1, precision, and recall scores.

## Method Summary
The proposed RLVR approach fine-tunes Qwen2.5-VL-7B for medical VIE tasks by incorporating verifiable rewards during training. The method addresses domain-specific challenges through balanced precision-recall reward mechanisms and innovative sampling strategies. By requiring only 100 annotated samples, the approach significantly reduces annotation costs while maintaining high performance. The training process ensures dataset diversity and enhances reasoning capabilities through carefully designed reward functions that encourage both accuracy and comprehensive field coverage.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical VIE tasks with minimal annotation requirements
- Significantly improves F1, precision, and recall scores compared to existing models
- Demonstrates superior performance on medical reports while showing limitations on dissimilar tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RLVR approach works by incorporating verifiable rewards during the fine-tuning process, which directly optimizes the model for the specific task of structured information extraction. The balanced precision-recall reward mechanism addresses the fundamental trade-off between accuracy and completeness in VIE tasks. The innovative sampling strategies ensure diverse training data that better represents real-world scenarios. By requiring only 100 annotated samples, the method reduces the barrier to entry for medical VIE applications while maintaining high performance through targeted reinforcement learning.

## Foundational Learning
- Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR): Why needed - provides task-specific optimization with measurable outcomes; Quick check - verify reward signals are both meaningful and computable
- Precision-Recall Trade-off: Why needed - balances completeness vs. accuracy in structured extraction; Quick check - monitor both metrics during training to ensure neither degrades
- Domain-specific Sampling Strategies: Why needed - ensures diverse training data representative of medical scenarios; Quick check - verify sampling covers all expected field types and edge cases

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Input Images -> OCR Processing -> RLVR Fine-tuning Module -> Structured Output
**Critical Path:** Image ingestion → Text extraction → Reward computation → Model parameter updates → Structured field prediction
**Design Tradeoffs:** Minimal annotations vs. comprehensive coverage; precision vs. recall balance; reasoning depth vs. computational efficiency
**Failure Signatures:** Hallucinations in rare field types; missing fields in complex layouts; incorrect associations between extracted text and structured fields
**First Experiments:** 1) Test on held-out medical reports from same domain; 2) Evaluate performance on medical images with known challenging layouts; 3) Compare reasoning vs. non-reasoning inference modes on edge cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance drop on dissimilar tasks suggests limited generalizability beyond medical domain
- Small sample size (100 annotations) may not represent optimal trade-off for all medical specialties
- Reasoning improvements shown in case studies lack quantitative validation of when reasoning helps versus hurts

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The methodology is sound and the experimental results on medical reports are well-documented and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim of achieving SOTA with minimal annotations is supported but needs broader validation across different medical domains and annotation qualities.
- **Medium confidence**: The reasoning improvements shown in case studies are promising but lack quantitative validation of when and why reasoning helps versus hurts.

## Next Checks
1. Test the 100-sample RLVR approach across multiple medical specialties (radiology, pathology, dermatology) to verify consistent performance gains and identify domain-specific limitations.
2. Conduct ablation studies varying annotation quality and quantity (e.g., 50, 200, 500 samples) to determine optimal annotation trade-offs and identify failure modes.
3. Implement controlled experiments comparing reasoning-augmented inference against standard inference on out-of-distribution medical images to quantify when reasoning helps versus introduces errors.
