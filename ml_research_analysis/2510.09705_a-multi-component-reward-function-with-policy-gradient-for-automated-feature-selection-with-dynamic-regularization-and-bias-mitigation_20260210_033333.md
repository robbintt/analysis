# A Multi-Component Reward Function with Policy Gradient for Automated Feature Selection with Dynamic Regularization and Bias Mitigation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09705
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09705
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed framework achieved improved AUC and bias mitigation on credit default risk data compared to logistic regression and random forest baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for automated feature selection that integrates fairness-aware bias mitigation. The core innovation is a multi-component reward function that balances predictive accuracy, sparsity, and fairness through direct and indirect penalties for biased features. The approach uses a policy gradient method (REINFORCE) to navigate feature selection decisions while maintaining equitable treatment across demographic groups. Tested on credit default risk data, the model outperformed baseline methods in both accuracy and bias mitigation.

## Method Summary
The framework combines policy gradient methods with a multi-component reward function for automated feature selection. The reward function incorporates three components: accuracy maximization, sparsity regularization, and fairness-aware bias mitigation. The policy gradient method (REINFORCE) is used to learn optimal feature selection policies by directly optimizing this reward function. The fairness component dynamically prevents bias reintroduction through correlated features rather than relying on static pre-processing or post-hoc corrections.

## Key Results
- Achieved higher AUC scores compared to logistic regression and random forest baselines on credit default risk datasets
- Demonstrated effective bias mitigation across demographic groups while maintaining predictive performance
- Showed stable policy convergence through the multi-component reward structure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by integrating fairness considerations directly into the feature selection process through a carefully designed reward function. By including both direct penalties for biased features and indirect penalties that account for correlated features, the model prevents the reintroduction of bias during the selection process. The policy gradient approach allows for continuous optimization of feature subsets while maintaining awareness of fairness constraints, rather than treating fairness as a post-processing step.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Policy Gradient Methods (REINFORCE)**: Why needed - To optimize feature selection policies in environments with sparse rewards and continuous action spaces; Quick check - Verify gradient estimation accuracy and variance reduction techniques
2. **Multi-Component Reward Functions**: Why needed - To balance competing objectives (accuracy, sparsity, fairness) simultaneously; Quick check - Confirm reward weight tuning and stability during training
3. **Fairness Metrics in ML**: Why needed - To quantify and mitigate bias across demographic groups; Quick check - Validate metric sensitivity to different types of bias
4. **Feature Selection Dynamics**: Why needed - To understand how feature removal affects both performance and fairness; Quick check - Analyze feature importance stability across training iterations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Feature Space -> Policy Network -> Action Selection -> Reward Calculation -> Policy Update

**Critical Path**: Input features → Policy network outputs feature selection probabilities → Selected features generate predictions → Predictions evaluated for accuracy and fairness → Reward signal updates policy parameters

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for integrated fairness optimization, sacrificing some scalability for the ability to jointly optimize accuracy and fairness without post-processing.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failure modes include policy collapse to trivial solutions (selecting no features), reward function misalignment causing bias reintroduction, and gradient instability in high-dimensional feature spaces.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison with logistic regression and random forest on synthetic biased datasets
2. Ablation study removing fairness components to quantify their contribution
3. Sensitivity analysis across different reward function weight configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for high-dimensional feature spaces beyond credit risk datasets
- Limited fairness metrics focusing on specific demographic comparisons without addressing intersectional fairness
- Lack of computational complexity analysis for real-world deployment assessment
- Absence of statistical significance testing for performance improvements

## Confidence

**High**: The core framework design combining policy gradient methods with multi-component reward functions for feature selection appears technically sound based on the methodology described. The integration of fairness-aware components into the reward structure is well-articulated.

**Medium**: The experimental results showing improved AUC and bias mitigation are convincing within the tested domain, but generalization claims to other domains remain uncertain without broader validation. The absence of statistical significance testing and confidence intervals for performance improvements reduces certainty about the magnitude of gains.

**Low**: The claim that fairness and predictive performance can be jointly optimized without trade-offs requires further validation across different problem domains and fairness definitions, as this may be highly context-dependent.

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on high-dimensional datasets with thousands of features to assess scalability and computational efficiency
2. Evaluate performance across multiple fairness definitions (e.g., equal opportunity, equalized odds) and demographic distributions
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each reward component and assess sensitivity to hyperparameter choices
