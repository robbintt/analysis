# TD-Interpreter: Enhancing the Understanding of Timing Diagrams with Visual-Language Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.16844
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16844
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ML tool achieving 95.9 BLEU-4 and 96.7 ROUGE-1 scores for timing diagram interpretation

## Executive Summary
TD-Interpreter is a machine learning tool designed to help engineers interpret timing diagrams during digital design and verification. The system was developed by fine-tuning the LLaVA model using synthetic data generated from Verilog modules and datasheets. The fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance compared to untuned GPT-4o, successfully handling complex timing diagram questions across various hardware protocols and design scenarios.

## Method Summary
The research team developed TD-Interpreter by fine-tuning the LLaVA (7B) model with a vision encoder and Vicuna LLM using LoRA adapters. They generated synthetic training data from Verilog simulations and datasheets, creating approximately 10k training samples covering both caption generation and reasoning tasks. The model was trained for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-4 using 8 NVIDIA A800 GPUs. The resulting system achieved high text similarity scores on timing diagram interpretation tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 95.9 BLEU-4 and 96.7 ROUGE-1 scores on timing diagram interpretation
- Outperformed untuned GPT-4o by a large margin on caption and reasoning tasks
- Successfully handled complex timing diagram questions across hardware protocols including SPI, AXI, and Async FIFO

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of TD-Interpreter stems from its specialized training on synthetic timing diagram data that captures the visual patterns and temporal relationships unique to digital design. By fine-tuning LLaVA with domain-specific data generated from Verilog simulations and datasheets, the model learned to recognize signal transitions, timing constraints, and protocol-specific behaviors that generic vision-language models would miss.

## Foundational Learning
- **Timing Diagrams**: Visual representations of digital signal behavior over time - needed for understanding digital circuit timing requirements and debugging
- **Verilog Simulation**: Hardware description language simulation environment - needed to generate realistic timing diagrams from digital designs
- **WaveDrom**: Waveform description language and rendering tool - needed to convert timing data into standardized visual formats
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: Parameter-efficient adapter-based model adaptation - needed to specialize large models without full retraining
- **VQA (Visual Question Answering)**: Task of answering questions about visual content - needed as the core capability being enhanced
- **Digital Design Protocols**: SPI, AXI, and other hardware communication standards - needed to create relevant test scenarios and reasoning questions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Verilog Modules -> Simulation -> VCD -> JSON -> WaveDrom -> Images + Text Generation -> LLaVA + LoRA -> Fine-tuned Model

**Critical Path**: The data generation pipeline (Verilog to WaveDrom images) and LoRA fine-tuning process represent the critical components that enable domain adaptation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The team chose synthetic data generation over real-world data collection for scalability and control, accepting potential domain shift risks. LoRA was selected over full fine-tuning for computational efficiency while maintaining performance.

**Failure Signatures**: The model may hallucinate generic textbook definitions when encountering novel protocols, or fail to recognize signal patterns if the synthetic data distribution doesn't match real-world timing diagrams.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test caption generation on simple signal transition diagrams to verify basic understanding
2. Evaluate FSM synthesis reasoning on known protocol examples
3. Assess cross-protocol generalization by testing on protocols outside the training corpus

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance on real-world timing diagrams from actual hardware design projects remains unvalidated
- Evaluation relies exclusively on text similarity metrics rather than engineering correctness or utility
- Training data limited to 310 question types across few protocol families, risking overfitting

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The synthetic data generation pipeline and LoRA fine-tuning approach are technically sound and clearly specified.

**Medium Confidence**: The impressive text similarity scores may not translate to actual engineering value or correct timing analysis.

**Low Confidence**: Generalization to real-world timing diagrams and novel protocols cannot be assessed from current evaluation framework.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TD-Interpreter on timing diagrams from actual hardware design projects with expert review of engineering correctness
2. Test model generalization on timing diagrams for protocols not present in training data (PCIe, DDR, custom ASIC timing)
3. Conduct user study with digital design engineers to measure practical utility and time savings compared to traditional tools
