# From Fragile to Certified: Wasserstein Audits of Group Fairness Under Distribution Shift

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26241
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26241
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes ε-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness framework that certifies worst-case group fairness under distribution shift

## Executive Summary
Standard fairness metrics like equalized odds are highly sensitive to small perturbations in training data and distribution shifts, undermining reliable audits. This paper introduces a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test distributions centered at the empirical law. The authors propose ε-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness (ε-WDF) as the audit target and leverage strong duality to derive tractable reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for ε-WDF.

Across standard benchmarks and classifiers, ε-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness beyond observational data. The approach proves feasibility and consistency, and establishes finite-sample certification guarantees for auditing fairness under distribution shift.

## Method Summary
The paper addresses distribution shift in group-fairness auditing by introducing ε-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness (ε-WDF) as a distributionally robust optimization framework. The key insight is to certify worst-case group fairness over a Wasserstein ball of plausible test distributions around the empirical distribution. The authors leverage strong duality to reformulate the optimization problem into a tractable form and develop DRUNE, an efficient estimator for ε-WDF. This framework moves beyond traditional observational fairness metrics by accounting for potential distribution shifts, providing certification guarantees for fairness audits even when test distributions differ from training data.

## Key Results
- ε-WDF provides stable fairness assessments under distribution shift compared to standard metrics
- DRUNE estimator enables efficient computation of distributionally robust fairness measures
- The framework proves feasibility and consistency while establishing finite-sample certification guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the Wasserstein distance to define a robust optimization problem over a ball of plausible distributions. This distributional robustness captures uncertainty about how the test distribution might differ from the training distribution. By optimizing the worst-case fairness within this ball, the framework provides certification guarantees that hold even under distribution shift. The strong duality theorem enables transforming the potentially intractable robust optimization into a tractable form, while DRUNE provides an efficient computational method for practical implementation.

## Foundational Learning

**Wasserstein Distance**: Measures distance between probability distributions
- Why needed: Defines the geometry of the uncertainty set for distribution shifts
- Quick check: Can be computed via linear programming or Sinkhorn iterations

**Distributionally Robust Optimization**: Optimization under uncertainty about the true data distribution
- Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for certifying fairness under shift
- Quick check: Reformulation via strong duality should yield tractable problems

**Strong Duality**: Conditions under which primal and dual optimization problems have equal optimal values
- Why needed: Enables conversion of the robust fairness problem to a tractable form
- Quick check: Verify Slater's condition holds for the reformulated problem

**Empirical Distribution**: Probability distribution estimated from finite samples
- Why needed: Serves as the center point for the Wasserstein ball
- Quick check: Convergence to true distribution as sample size increases

**Group Fairness Metrics**: Measures like equalized odds that quantify fairness across protected groups
- Why needed: Target metrics that need certification under distribution shift
- Quick check: Sensitivity to small perturbations in data

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Distribution → Wasserstein Ball → Robust Fairness Optimization → DRUNE Estimator → ε-WDF Certification

**Critical Path**: 
1. Estimate empirical distribution from training data
2. Define Wasserstein ball with radius ε
3. Formulate distributionally robust fairness optimization
4. Apply strong duality to obtain tractable reformulation
5. Compute DRUNE estimator for ε-WDF
6. Generate fairness certification under distribution shift

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Larger ε provides stronger robustness but may yield looser certification bounds
- Computational efficiency vs. accuracy in DRUNE estimation
- Theoretical guarantees vs. practical applicability to complex, real-world distributions

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Vacuous fairness certifications (bounds too loose to be useful)
- Computational intractability for high-dimensional data
- Sensitivity to estimation errors in empirical distribution or ε parameter

**First Experiments**: 
1. Validate DRUNE's convergence and accuracy on synthetic distributions with known shifts
2. Compare ε-WDF stability vs. standard metrics under controlled synthetic distribution shifts
3. Test certification bounds on benchmark datasets with documented demographic shifts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework focuses on binary protected attributes and binary predictions, limiting applicability to multi-class settings
- Selecting the Wasserstein radius ε involves tradeoffs that can lead to vacuous certifications if chosen conservatively
- Empirical validation relies on synthetic shifts rather than real-world distribution changes

## Confidence

Theoretical framework and duality results: High
Empirical validation on benchmark datasets: Medium
Practical applicability to real-world distribution shifts: Low

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate DRUNE's performance and certification bounds on multi-class fairness problems with multiple protected attributes
2. Test the framework's sensitivity to estimation errors in the empirical distribution and ε parameter selection
3. Validate the approach on real-world datasets with documented distribution shifts, comparing certification results to traditional fairness metrics under shift
