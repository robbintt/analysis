# OmniBench-RAG: A Multi-Domain Evaluation Platform for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Tools

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.05650
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05650
- Authors: Jiaxuan Liang; Shide Zhou; Kailong Wang
- Reference count: 18
- One-line primary result: Introduces automated multi-domain platform for systematic evaluation of RAG systems across nine knowledge domains

## Executive Summary
OmniBench-RAG addresses the lack of systematic, reproducible evaluation methods for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by introducing an automated multi-domain platform. The platform employs parallel evaluation tracks to measure both accuracy gains (Improvements) and efficiency trade-offs (Transformation) between baseline and RAG-enhanced models across nine knowledge domains. Evaluation using Qwen shows significant domain-dependent variability, with accuracy improvements ranging from +17.1% in culture to -25.6% in mathematics, highlighting that RAG effectiveness varies substantially across domains.

## Method Summary
OmniBench-RAG implements a parallel evaluation framework that compares baseline and RAG-enhanced models across nine knowledge domains. The platform automates knowledge base construction, dynamic test generation, and standardized metric computation. It employs two evaluation tracks: Improvement track measuring accuracy gains through metrics like semantic similarity and domain-specific precision, and Transformation track quantifying efficiency trade-offs combining latency and computational cost factors. The evaluation methodology uses synthetic test data generated through knowledge graph-based approaches, enabling scalable and reproducible assessment of RAG systems across heterogeneous models and domains.

## Key Results
- Accuracy improvements vary dramatically across domains: +17.1% in culture to -25.6% in mathematics
- Transformation metric reveals moderate efficiency overhead in most domains, except mathematics where efficiency improved despite accuracy decline
- RAG effectiveness shows substantial domain dependency, emphasizing the critical role of retrieval content quality
- Automated evaluation pipeline demonstrates technical feasibility for systematic RAG system assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The platform's effectiveness stems from its automated parallel evaluation architecture that decouples accuracy assessment from efficiency measurement. By generating synthetic test data through knowledge graphs, the system creates reproducible evaluation scenarios across diverse domains. The dual-track approach (Improvements vs Transformation) provides comprehensive assessment by capturing both performance gains and computational trade-offs simultaneously, enabling systematic comparison of RAG-enhanced versus baseline models.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge Graph Generation**
- Why needed: Enables scalable, domain-specific test data creation without manual annotation
- Quick check: Verify generated questions cover expected domain concepts and difficulty levels

**Parallel Evaluation Tracks**
- Why needed: Separates accuracy assessment from efficiency measurement for clearer insights
- Quick check: Ensure baseline and RAG-enhanced models receive identical test inputs

**Synthetic Data Validation**
- Why needed: Guarantees evaluation quality when using automatically generated test cases
- Quick check: Manual spot-checking of synthetic questions for domain relevance and complexity

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Knowledge Base Construction -> Synthetic Test Generation -> Parallel Evaluation (Improvements Track -> Accuracy Metrics; Transformation Track -> Efficiency Metrics) -> Result Aggregation

**Critical Path**
Test generation → Parallel model evaluation → Metric computation → Result aggregation. The synthetic data generation and parallel evaluation stages are most critical for reproducibility and scalability.

**Design Tradeoffs**
Automated synthetic generation vs. manual test creation (scalability vs. quality control), single-model evaluation vs. multi-model comparison (simplicity vs. generalizability), combined efficiency metrics vs. separate latency/cost tracking (simplicity vs. interpretability).

**Failure Signatures**
Poor synthetic data quality manifests as domain accuracy outliers, inconsistent improvement patterns across similar domains, or artificially inflated efficiency metrics. Model-specific biases appear as systematic accuracy drops in particular knowledge domains.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Run parallel evaluation on a single domain with both baseline and RAG-enhanced configurations
2. Generate synthetic test data for one domain and manually verify question quality
3. Compare accuracy metrics between baseline and RAG-enhanced models using identical test inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct as sole evaluation model may limit generalizability
- Synthetic test data generation introduces potential bias through knowledge graph-based approach
- Transformation metric combines multiple efficiency factors without clear weighting methodology
- Parallel evaluation assumes equal test complexity distribution across domains

## Confidence
- High confidence: Platform architectural design and automated evaluation pipeline are technically sound and reproducible
- Medium confidence: Observed domain-dependent accuracy variations are real but require validation across multiple model families
- Medium confidence: Transformation metric provides useful comparative insights but needs refinement for specific efficiency trade-off analysis

## Next Checks
1. Replicate evaluation using smaller, commercially viable models (7B-13B parameter range) to assess scalability and practical applicability
2. Implement manual verification of synthetic test data quality across all nine domains to validate knowledge graph generation approach
3. Conduct ablation studies removing specific efficiency factors from Transformation metric to isolate individual contributions to overall score
