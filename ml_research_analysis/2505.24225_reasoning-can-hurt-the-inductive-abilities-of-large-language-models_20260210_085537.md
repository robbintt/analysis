# Reasoning Can Hurt the Inductive Abilities of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24225
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24225
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Reasoning-enabled LLMs consistently underperform non-reasoning models on inductive reasoning tasks involving hidden rules

## Executive Summary
This work investigates how chain-of-thought reasoning impacts inductive reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Through controlled game-based tasks requiring models to infer hidden rules from gameplay transcripts, we find that reasoning-enabled models (LRMs) consistently underperform non-reasoning LLMs on special rules involving hidden structures. We identify three failure modes—incorrect sub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer summarization—and demonstrate that targeted interventions can improve inductive accuracy without retraining. The results show that effective reasoning depends not just on taking more steps, but on ensuring each step is well-structured and reliable.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates inductive reasoning by having LLMs infer hidden rules from gameplay transcripts across four domains: chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack. Each game has Normal Rules (NRs) and hidden Special Rules (SRs) that models must discover. The evaluation uses GPT-4o judge with majority voting for semantic alignment assessment. No training is involved—models are evaluated directly. The study tests multiple models including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen2.5-Max, Grok-2 (non-reasoning) and GPT-o3, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, Grok-3-Mini (reasoning). Three interventions are applied: structured decomposition templates, non-numeric worked examples for solving, and 1000-token budget constraints.

## Key Results
- Reasoning-enabled models (LRMs) consistently underperform non-reasoning LLMs on special rules (SRs) involving hidden structures
- Over 80% of reasoning failures stem from the solving stage, with "Math Overuse" as the dominant subtype (>40-60% of failures across tasks)
- Targeted interventions (structured decomposition, non-numeric examples, token constraints) consistently improve inductive accuracy across all games without retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Error Propagation Through Belief State Updates
Chain-of-thought reasoning can amplify rather than reduce errors when sub-tasks are misaligned or noisy. Each reasoning step updates a belief state, and when task alignment is low or negative, or when solving noise is high, errors compound rather than contract.

### Mechanism 2: U-Shaped Error Curve From Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Expected error is U-shaped in reasoning depth, with a unique optimal stopping point. Error decomposes into bias (decreases with N) and variance (increases with N), creating a non-monotonic curve where additional reasoning initially reduces error but eventually increases it.

### Mechanism 3: Solving Errors Dominate Through Math Overuse
Over 80% of reasoning failures stem from the solving stage, with "Math Overuse" as the dominant subtype. Models inappropriately apply arithmetic operations to symbolic domains, representing structured noise in the reasoning process.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Chain-of-thought as sequential computation**
  - Why needed: Understanding that CoT is a computational process where each step depends on prior outputs, creating error propagation opportunities
  - Quick check: Can you explain why a single misaligned sub-question (αk < 0) might cause more harm than no reasoning at all?

- **Concept: Bias-variance tradeoff in sequential estimation**
  - Why needed: The U-shaped error curve is a specific instance of this classic tradeoff; deeper reasoning reduces bias but adds variance
  - Quick check: If you double the noise σ² while keeping initial bias b₀ constant, does optimal reasoning depth N* increase or decrease?

- **Concept: Inductive vs. deductive reasoning in LLMs**
  - Why needed: The paper focuses on inductive reasoning (inferring rules from examples), where pattern completion heuristics can interfere with genuine hypothesis formation
  - Quick check: Why might a model trained heavily on arithmetic perform worse on symbolic rule induction tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (gameplay transcripts) -> [Decomposition stage] -> [Solving stage] -> [Summarization stage] -> Output (induced rule)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Detect failure mode from reasoning trace (breakdown vs. solving vs. summary)
  2. Apply targeted intervention (decomposition template, non-numeric examples, or token budget)
  3. Validate improvement via semantic alignment check (GPT-4o judge)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Stricter decomposition templates reduce αk variance but may miss valid reasoning paths
  - Token budgets prevent over-reasoning but may truncate correct long-form reasoning
  - Combined interventions help most on SRs but can conflict on simpler NRs

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Breakdown error: reasoning explores irrelevant features (prime sums, suit colors when rule involves movement structure)
  - Solving error (math overuse): arithmetic operations on non-numeric attributes (Euclidean distance for chess moves)
  - Summary error: correct intermediate reasoning but incorrect final rule articulation

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate the chess task with your target model; compare baseline CoT vs. combined intervention on SR accuracy
  2. Isolate math overuse by replacing numeric cards with symbolic labels (♠♥♦♣ → αβγδ); measure if SR accuracy improves
  3. Vary token budget (500/1000/2000) to empirically estimate optimal N* for your model on dice games

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical analysis assumes zero-mean noise εk and positive expected value for alignment αk, but these assumptions weren't empirically validated
- The study focuses on 4 specific game domains, leaving open whether failure modes generalize to broader inductive reasoning tasks
- The semantic alignment evaluation via GPT-4o judge introduces potential bias, though majority voting mitigates some concerns

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Core empirical finding that reasoning-enabled models underperform non-reasoning models on special rules is well-supported by direct comparisons across multiple models and games
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical framework explaining error propagation is internally consistent but relies on assumptions about noise distributions not empirically validated
- **Low confidence**: Specific claim that "over 80% of failures stem from solving-stage errors" depends heavily on error categorization methodology

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical N* validation**: Systematically vary reasoning depth N across tasks to empirically measure the U-shaped error curve and identify optimal stopping points, comparing against theoretical predictions

2. **Generalization test**: Apply the same evaluation framework to non-game inductive reasoning tasks (e.g., pattern completion, rule discovery in text) to verify whether math overuse and other failure modes persist

3. **Cross-model error analysis**: Compare error distributions across different model families (open vs. proprietary, different reasoning architectures) to determine if failure mode prevalence is model-dependent or task-dependent
