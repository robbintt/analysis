# LLM-Supported Formal Knowledge Representation for Enhancing Control Engineering Content with an Interactive Semantic Layer

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02759
- Reference count: 7
- Method transforms LaTeX source into knowledge graph with ~700 tooltip elements via LLM-assisted formalization

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a semi-automated approach for converting control engineering textbooks from LaTeX source code into a structured knowledge graph using a two-step pipeline: first converting to Formal Natural Language (FNL) with LLM assistance, then algorithmically generating PyIRK code. The method creates an "interactive semantic layer" by embedding tooltip elements in HTML documents that provide additional context when readers hover over technical terms and symbols. Applied to two sections of a textbook, the approach successfully generated approximately 700 tooltip elements while requiring manual review of about 10-20% of FNL statements. The authors argue that formal knowledge graphs offer advantages over direct LLM querying, including transparency, version control, and computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a two-step pipeline to transform LaTeX source documents into a formal knowledge graph. First, LaTeX text is subdivided into small snippets (1-5 sentences) and processed through a 240-line prompt template that includes FNL grammar rules, previously processed examples, current snippet content, and following context. An LLM (Google Gemini) generates FNL statements using a controlled vocabulary with subject-predicate-object structure. Human reviewers then manually check and correct approximately 10-20% of these statements. Second, an algorithmic parser converts the FNL statements into PyIRK Python code, performing entity unification to maintain consistency across snippets. The resulting knowledge graph is then used to generate an interactive HTML document with tooltip elements providing contextual information about technical terms and symbols.

## Key Results
- Successfully generated ~700 tooltip elements from 2 textbook sections (8 pages)
- Manual review required for 10-20% of FNL statements generated by LLM
- Interactive HTML documents successfully embedded tooltip elements with contextual knowledge
- Knowledge graph approach enables version control and computational efficiency compared to direct LLM querying

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Intermediate formalization language improves LLM extraction quality over direct code generation
- Mechanism: The pipeline converts LaTeX → FNL via LLM, then algorithmically generates PyIRK code. FNL uses controlled vocabulary with strict subject-predicate-object structure, making it easier to specify in prompts than the full PyIRK specification
- Core assumption: LLMs can reliably follow simplified grammar rules defined in-context even when the target format lacks training data coverage
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "first converting to Formal Natural Language (FNL) with LLM assistance, then algorithmically generating PyIRK code"; [section 3] "Naively, the LLM could be used to generate the required python code directly... In practice, this does not produce good results because the PyIRK specification is likely not part of the training data"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contextual snippet processing with extensive prompt templates reduces ambiguity in formalization
- Mechanism: LaTeX documents are subdivided into small snippets (1-5 sentences). Each prompt includes: (1) FNL grammar rules, (2) previously processed LaTeX + formalized output, (3) current snippet, (4) following LaTeX context. This provides local coherence and reference examples
- Core assumption: LLMs benefit from in-context examples and surrounding context to maintain consistent entity naming and notation interpretation
- Evidence anchors: [section 3] Template is "≈ 11 KB (240 lines) of detailed instructions" with 7 structured parts including previous and following context; [section 3] "monographs... use consistent notation and language conventions over hundreds of pages"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge graphs provide advantages over direct LLM querying for domain knowledge retrieval
- Mechanism: Formalized knowledge stored as URI-addressed SPO triples enables precise reference, version control via text files, cross-source integration, and efficient lookup compared to implicit LLM weight storage
- Core assumption: The downstream value of queryability and transparency exceeds the upfront formalization cost
- Evidence anchors: [section 5] Lists four advantages: explicit/transparent knowledge, version-control compatibility, non-redundant integration, computational efficiency; [section 5] "We only use the LLM as an auxiliary tool in intermediate steps along with human supervision"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge graphs / SPO triples
  - Why needed here: The entire PyIRK framework represents knowledge as subject-predicate-object triples forming a semantic graph
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how "PID controller —is_a—> Controller" differs from "PID controller —has_parameter—> gain"?

- Concept: LaTeX syntax for mathematics
  - Why needed here: Source documents are LaTeX; mathematical expressions must be parsed with unambiguous syntax for formalization
  - Quick check question: Given `\dot{x} = Ax + Bu`, what would the state variable and input variable be?

- Concept: LLM prompt engineering with examples
  - Why needed here: The 240-line template relies heavily on structured instructions and few-shot examples to guide FNL generation
  - Quick check question: Why might providing a previously-processed example in a prompt improve output consistency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LaTeX source -> Snippet delimiters -> LLM (Gemini) -> FNL draft -> Human review/correction -> Algorithmic parser -> PyIRK code -> Entity unification -> Knowledge graph -> LaTeX to HTML -> Tooltip injection -> Interactive HTML document

- Critical path: Step 1b (manual FNL review) is the stated bottleneck. Until this is reduced via LLM-based supervision or algorithmic QA, scaling beyond monograph chapters is labor-constrained

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. decidability: OWL is limited for decidability; PyIRK uses Python for higher expressiveness (e.g., higher-order logic for theorems) but sacrifices automated reasoning guarantees
  - Automation vs. quality: Fully automated FNL generation was rejected in favor of semi-automated with human review
  - LaTeX dependency vs. accessibility: Current approach requires LaTeX source; PDF support is a future goal with "significant technical challenges"

- Failure signatures:
  - FNL statements requiring correction: 10-20% of output (varies by snippet complexity)
  - Entity inconsistencies across snippets if context window misses earlier definitions
  - Incomplete tooltip coverage if knowledge graph lacks entries for referenced terms

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate on a single textbook section (~5 pages) with consistent notation; measure FNL correction rate against reported 10-20%
  2. Ablate the context parts (remove parts 3-4 or 6 from template) to quantify impact on entity naming consistency
  3. Build a minimal tooltip-enabled HTML output for a 2-page excerpt to validate end-to-end pipeline integration before scaling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the actual knowledge transfer effects of the interactive semantic layer on readers with different expertise levels?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 6: "Additionally, a user study to evaluate the knowledge transfer effects of the interactive semantic layer would be interesting"
- Why unresolved: The current work only demonstrates technical feasibility through a prototype applied to two textbook sections; no empirical evaluation of reader comprehension, learning speed, or usability has been conducted
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled user study comparing comprehension and task completion between readers using the enhanced documents versus standard documents, across reader populations (e.g., domain experts, adjacent engineers, students)

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can LLM-based supervision and algorithmic quality assurance reduce the 10-20% manual correction rate for FNL statements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify step 1b (manual review) as "the bottleneck in the current approach" and explicitly state: "we are optimistic to further reduce the necessity of manual intervention in future versions" and "we aim to reduce the manual correction work significantly by inserting an LLM-based supervisor along with algorithmic quality assurance measures before the human corrector"
- Why unresolved: The current pipeline relies on human review to catch LLM errors in FNL generation; automated validation methods have not yet been developed or tested
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of an LLM-based or rule-based validator that can detect and correct common FNL errors, demonstrated through reduced manual intervention rates while maintaining knowledge graph accuracy

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the approach maintain quality when processing PDF documents instead of LaTeX source code?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 states: "Another limitation of the current approach is its reliance on the availability of LaTeX source code of the source document. In a future version, we aim to enable the processing of PDF documents without losing quality. However, this comes with significant technical challenges"
- Why unresolved: PDFs lack explicit structure and unambiguous mathematical syntax that LaTeX provides; extracting structured knowledge from PDFs requires handling formatting ambiguity, formula recognition, and cross-reference resolution
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study applying the pipeline to both LaTeX and PDF versions of the same documents, measuring precision and recall of extracted knowledge statements and tooltip quality

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the approach scale to heterogeneous document collections with inconsistent notation and terminology?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes the approach "is best suited to be applied to books, and more precisely monographs" because "such books use consistent notation and language conventions over hundreds of pages and thus prevent the necessity of identifying and aligning symbols and words across multiple sources." The approach has only been tested on two sections of a single textbook
- Why unresolved: Knowledge base construction for the control engineering domain requires integrating multiple sources (papers, books from different authors) that use conflicting notation; entity unification across sources remains unaddressed
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the pipeline to multiple textbooks or paper collections from different authors, evaluating the accuracy of automated entity alignment and the human effort required for disambiguation

## Limitations
- Manual review bottleneck: 10-20% of FNL statements require human correction, limiting scalability
- LaTeX dependency: Current approach requires LaTeX source code; PDF support faces significant technical challenges
- Monograph-specific: Best suited for consistent notation in monographs; heterogeneous document collections remain challenging

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (supported by direct evidence and clear mechanisms):
- The two-step pipeline (LaTeX → FNL → PyIRK) is technically feasible and reduces the complexity of the LLM task compared to direct code generation
- The tooltip functionality in HTML output works as described, based on the semantic layer concept
- The stated advantages of knowledge graphs over direct LLM querying (transparency, version control, computational efficiency) are valid in principle

**Medium Confidence** (mechanisms plausible but empirical validation limited):
- The 10-20% manual review rate is representative of broader application
- Entity unification effectively handles cross-snippet references
- The approach can scale to full-length technical documents with similar quality

**Low Confidence** (claims not directly tested or quantified):
- The approach generalizes to other technical domains beyond control engineering
- Full monograph processing maintains acceptable error rates
- PDF input capability will be technically feasible

## Next Checks

1. **Scaling Validation**: Process a complete 50-page technical monograph section using the same approach. Measure: (a) total FNL correction rate, (b) entity unification failures, (c) tooltip coverage completeness. Compare against the 10-20% baseline to assess scalability.

2. **Cross-Snippet Reference Test**: Create a controlled experiment with a document that defines concepts early and references them late (beyond typical context window). Measure: (a) entity unification success rate, (b) tooltip accuracy for late references, (c) need for manual intervention when context window is exceeded.

3. **Domain Transfer Test**: Apply the exact same pipeline to a 10-page excerpt from a different technical domain (e.g., mechanical engineering or computer science theory). Measure: (a) FNL generation quality without domain-specific prompt modifications, (b) manual review rate, (c) whether the FNL grammar requires adaptation for new terminology patterns.
