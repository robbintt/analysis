# Understanding User Preferences for Interaction Styles in Conversational Recommender Systems: The Predictive Role of System Qualities, User Experience, and Traits

## Quick Facts

- Key outcome: This paper investigates how users prefer different interaction styles in conversational recommender systems (CRSs), contrasting task-oriented and exploratory dialogues. The study used a within-subjects design with 139 participants who experienced scripted CRS dialogues in an apparel-shopping context and evaluated system qualities and user experience (UX) dimensions. Binary logistic regression revealed that preference for exploratory interaction was significantly associated with higher ratings of novelty, conversation quality, enjoyment, usefulness, and perceived effectiveness, while accuracy and response quality did not predict task-oriented preference. Clustering analysis identified five latent user profiles based on CRS quality priorities, each showing distinct interaction styles. Moderation analyses showed that age, gender, and control preference significantly influenced how CRS qualities affected interaction preferences. The findings challenge the assumption that instrumental attributes like usefulness and effectiveness favor task-oriented interactions, instead suggesting that these qualities are perceived in terms of informational completeness and clarity, aligning them more closely with exploratory dialogues. The results support a predictive framework for CRS personalisation, where system adaptation can be guided by user-valued qualities, experiential dimensions, and individual traits. These insights inform the design of adaptive dialogue management systems that dynamically align with users' cognitive and affective needs, enhancing satisfaction and engagement in CRS and broader conversational AI applications.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates user preferences for interaction styles in conversational recommender systems (CRSs), contrasting task-oriented and exploratory dialogues. Using a within-subjects design with 139 participants in an apparel-shopping context, the research examines how system qualities and user experience dimensions predict interaction style preferences. The findings challenge conventional assumptions about instrumental attributes, revealing that qualities like novelty and conversation quality significantly predict preference for exploratory interactions, while accuracy and response quality do not predict task-oriented preference. The study identifies five distinct user profiles based on CRS quality priorities and demonstrates that demographic factors and control preferences moderate these relationships.

## Method Summary
The study employed a within-subjects design with 139 participants who engaged with scripted conversational recommender system dialogues in an apparel-shopping context. Participants experienced both task-oriented and exploratory interaction styles and evaluated system qualities and user experience dimensions. Binary logistic regression was used to identify predictors of interaction style preference, while clustering analysis identified five latent user profiles based on CRS quality priorities. Moderation analyses examined the influence of age, gender, and control preference on the relationship between system qualities and interaction preferences.

## Key Results
- Preference for exploratory interaction was significantly associated with higher ratings of novelty, conversation quality, enjoyment, usefulness, and perceived effectiveness
- Accuracy and response quality did not predict task-oriented preference
- Five distinct user profiles were identified based on CRS quality priorities, each showing unique interaction style preferences
- Age, gender, and control preference significantly moderated how CRS qualities affected interaction preferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's findings suggest that users perceive instrumental attributes like usefulness and effectiveness in terms of informational completeness and clarity rather than task completion speed. This perception aligns these qualities more closely with exploratory dialogues, where users seek comprehensive information and engaging conversation. The moderation effects of individual traits indicate that personal characteristics significantly influence how users value different system qualities, supporting the need for adaptive dialogue management that can dynamically respond to individual preferences.

## Foundational Learning
1. **System Quality Dimensions**: Understanding how different system qualities (novelty, accuracy, response quality) influence user preferences
   - Why needed: To identify which attributes drive interaction style preferences
   - Quick check: Measure user ratings of system qualities and correlate with interaction preferences

2. **User Experience (UX) Dimensions**: Evaluating how enjoyment, usefulness, and perceived effectiveness impact CRS adoption
   - Why needed: To understand experiential factors beyond task completion
   - Quick check: Compare UX ratings between interaction styles

3. **Latent User Profiling**: Identifying distinct user segments based on prioritized system qualities
   - Why needed: To enable personalized CRS adaptation
   - Quick check: Validate cluster stability across different user samples

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Input -> Dialogue Manager -> Recommendation Engine -> Response Generator -> User Output

**Critical Path**: User query → Dialogue style selection → Quality attribute assessment → Recommendation generation → Response delivery

**Design Tradeoffs**: Scripted vs. adaptive dialogues (ecological validity vs. experimental control); within-subjects design (individual differences control vs. carryover effects); apparel domain (exploratory suitability vs. generalizability)

**Failure Signatures**: Preference prediction failure when quality attributes misaligned with user profiles; moderation effects breakdown when sample size insufficient; cluster instability when quality dimensions poorly measured

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Validate the five-cluster model using independent samples
2. Test preference prediction accuracy using holdout data
3. Examine cluster stability across different recommendation domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scripted dialogues may limit ecological validity compared to dynamic, adaptive systems
- Apparel-shopping context may not generalize to other domains like factual search or transactional tasks
- Within-subjects design could introduce carryover effects despite counterbalancing

## Confidence

**High confidence**:
- Novelty and conversation quality significantly predict exploratory preference
- Five distinct user profiles based on CRS quality priorities

**Medium confidence**:
- Instrumental attributes like usefulness and effectiveness align more with exploratory dialogues than task-oriented ones
- Moderation effects of age, gender, and control preference

## Next Checks
1. Replicate findings with a between-subjects design using an adaptive, non-scripted CRS to assess ecological validity
2. Conduct domain transfer studies across different recommendation contexts (e.g., factual search, entertainment, services) to test the robustness of the predictive framework
3. Validate the five-cluster model using independent samples and explore whether cluster membership predicts long-term CRS adoption and satisfaction
