# Neural Video Compression using 2D Gaussian Splatting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.09324
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09324
- Reference count: 20
- Achieves 88% faster encoding than previous Gaussian splatting-based image codecs

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the computational inefficiency of neural video codecs, which currently limit their use in real-time applications like video conferencing. The proposed method introduces a region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model using 2D Gaussian Splatting, achieving 88% faster encoding than previous Gaussian splatting-based image codecs. By leveraging a content-aware initialization strategy and a novel Gaussian inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, the approach enables the first video-codec solution in the neural video codec space.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces a region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model using 2D Gaussian Splatting. The approach leverages a content-aware initialization strategy and a novel Gaussian inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism. This combination enables real-time decoding capabilities while maintaining competitive quality, with significant bitrate savings compared to existing approaches. The codec achieves 88% faster encoding by reducing I-frame encoding time from 13 seconds to 1.5 seconds per frame and P-frame encoding to 1 second.

## Key Results
- 88% faster encoding than previous Gaussian splatting-based image codecs
- I-frame encoding time reduced from 13 seconds to 1.5 seconds per frame
- P-frame encoding time reduced to 1 second
- Real-time decoding capabilities with significant bitrate savings
- Maintains competitive quality while enabling practical deployment in video conferencing applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by introducing a region-of-interest approach that focuses computational resources on areas of the video frame that contain more information. The content-aware initialization strategy optimizes the starting parameters for Gaussian splatting based on the specific characteristics of each frame. The Gaussian inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism efficiently encodes differences between frames by identifying and removing redundant information across consecutive frames, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining quality.

## Foundational Learning
1. Gaussian Splatting Fundamentals
   - Why needed: Provides the core representation technique for efficient 3D/2D rendering
   - Quick check: Understand how 2D Gaussians can represent image content efficiently

2. Region-of-Interest (ROI) Processing
   - Why needed: Enables focus on important regions, reducing computational overhead
   - Quick check: Can identify which regions of an image contain most information

3. Inter-frame Redundancy Analysis
   - Why needed: Essential for video compression to avoid encoding similar content repeatedly
   - Quick check: Understand how motion and temporal correlation can be exploited

4. Content-aware Initialization
   - Why needed: Improves convergence speed and final quality by starting from better initial parameters
   - Quick check: How initialization affects optimization trajectory and quality

5. Neural Rendering Basics
   - Why needed: Underpins the modern approach to image generation and manipulation
   - Quick check: Understand the relationship between latent representations and final output

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Video -> ROI Detection -> Content-aware Initialization -> Gaussian Splatting Encoding -> Redundancy Reduction -> Compressed Output

Critical Path: ROI Detection → Content-aware Initialization → Gaussian Splatting → Redundancy Reduction → Compression

Design Tradeoffs: Speed vs. Quality (88% faster encoding with competitive quality), Computational Efficiency vs. Compression Ratio (reduced encoding time with maintained bitrate savings)

Failure Signatures: Poor ROI detection leading to quality degradation in important regions, ineffective redundancy reduction causing higher bitrates, suboptimal initialization resulting in convergence issues

First Experiments:
1. Test ROI detection accuracy on various video content types
2. Measure redundancy reduction effectiveness across different motion scenarios
3. Benchmark encoding/decoding speed across different hardware configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability across diverse video content types remains to be fully validated
- Performance in real-world video conferencing scenarios with varying network conditions needs extensive testing
- Comparison against state-of-the-art traditional and neural codecs across different quality metrics is limited

## Confidence
- 88% faster encoding claim: High confidence (supported by concrete timing measurements)
- First video-codec solution using Gaussian splatting: Medium confidence (lack of exhaustive comparison)
- Real-time video conferencing claims: High confidence (based on reported metrics)
- Generalizability across video content: Medium confidence (evaluation focused on specific conditions)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the codec's performance across a broader range of video content types and resolutions to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct extensive real-time testing in actual video conferencing scenarios with varying network conditions to verify practical deployment claims.
3. Compare the proposed approach against state-of-the-art traditional video codecs (e.g., H.264, H.265) and other neural codecs across different quality metrics and bitrates to establish its competitive position in the broader video compression landscape.
