# Translution: Unifying Self-attention and Convolution for Adaptive and Relative Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.10060
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10060
- Reference count: 29
- Introduces Translution operation unifying self-attention and convolution for adaptive relative modeling

## Executive Summary
Translution addresses a fundamental limitation in current sequence modeling: self-attention excels at adaptive identification of relevant elements but relies on absolute positional embeddings, while convolution encodes elements relatively but uses a fixed receptive field. This paper proposes a novel operation that unifies these strengths by employing separate parameters for each direction and distance when computing query, key, and value. To address the resulting parameter explosion, the authors introduce α-Translution, a lightweight variant that reduces parameters while maintaining performance. Experiments on ImageNet-1K and OpenWebText demonstrate superior accuracy compared to standard self-attention, with α-Translution improving ImageNet top-1 accuracy from 46.28% to 48.36% with minimal parameter increase.

## Method Summary
The Translution operation unifies self-attention and convolution by using separate parameters for each directional and distance combination when computing queries, keys, and values. This allows the model to adaptively identify relevant elements (like self-attention) while encoding relative positions (like convolution). The key innovation is that for any element pair separated by distance d in direction θ, Translution computes query, key, and value using dedicated parameters Q_d,θ, K_d,θ, and V_d,θ. This enables modeling of relative structures while maintaining adaptivity. However, this approach leads to a quadratic increase in parameters with sequence length. To address this, α-Translution is proposed as a parameter-efficient variant that maintains performance while significantly reducing the parameter count.

## Key Results
- α-Translution improves ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy from 46.28% to 48.36% with minimal parameter increase
- Translution achieves 52.41% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, outperforming standard self-attention
- Dynamic MNIST experiments show Translution maintains high accuracy when digit positions vary, demonstrating better modeling of relative structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Translution works by resolving the fundamental tension between adaptive identification (self-attention's strength) and relative encoding (convolution's strength). Traditional self-attention uses absolute positional embeddings, which limits its ability to capture relative positional relationships. Convolution, while encoding relative positions, uses a fixed receptive field that cannot adaptively identify relevant elements. Translution bridges this gap by using dedicated parameters for each directional and distance combination, allowing the model to learn optimal relative encodings while maintaining adaptivity. The α-Translution variant further optimizes this by introducing parameter sharing strategies that reduce the quadratic parameter growth while preserving the core relative modeling capability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Positional Encoding**: Why needed - To provide sequence order information to models that process elements in parallel; Quick check - Can the model distinguish between sequences "ABC" and "CBA" without positional information?
- **Receptive Field**: Why needed - Defines the context window a neuron can access; Quick check - For a convolution with kernel size 3, can the center element see elements beyond its immediate neighbors?
- **Query-Key-Value Mechanism**: Why needed - Enables efficient computation of pairwise relationships in self-attention; Quick check - Can you trace how Q·K^T produces attention weights between all element pairs?
- **Parameter Sharing**: Why needed - Controls model capacity and generalization; Quick check - What happens to model performance when all parameters are shared versus when each position has unique parameters?
- **Relative Positional Encoding**: Why needed - Captures relationships based on element distances rather than absolute positions; Quick check - Does the model's output change when the entire sequence is shifted but relative distances remain constant?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input sequence → Translution blocks → Output sequence
Each Translution block: Multi-head Translution → Feed-forward network → Residual connections

**Critical Path**
The computation of query, key, and value matrices for each directional and distance combination forms the computational bottleneck, as it requires O(L²) parameters for sequence length L.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The primary tradeoff is between modeling capacity and parameter efficiency. Translution offers superior relative structure modeling but at quadratic parameter cost, while α-Translution reduces parameters through sharing strategies but may lose some fine-grained relative encoding capability.

**Failure Signatures**
- Excessive memory usage for long sequences due to quadratic parameter scaling
- Potential overfitting on small datasets due to high parameter count
- Reduced performance if directional/distance parameter sharing is too aggressive

**First Experiments**
1. Compare α-Translution vs standard self-attention on ImageNet with varying sequence lengths
2. Ablate the directional vs distance-specific parameters to isolate their contributions
3. Test dynamic MNIST with varying digit displacement ranges to validate relative structure modeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Substantial parameter increase in base Translution operation, scaling quadratically with sequence length
- Performance gains on evaluated benchmarks are modest (e.g., 2.08% improvement on ImageNet-1K), raising questions about practical impact versus computational cost
- Evaluation focuses on standard vision and language tasks, leaving uncertainty about effectiveness on long-sequence or structurally complex domains

## Confidence
- Translution operation design and mathematical formulation: **High** - The unification approach is clearly defined and theoretically grounded
- Performance improvements on evaluated benchmarks: **Medium** - Results are consistent but modest gains may not justify parameter overhead
- Relative structure modeling claims: **Medium** - Supported by MNIST experiments but not thoroughly validated on complex datasets

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Translution variants on long-sequence tasks (document summarization, protein structure prediction) to assess scalability and effectiveness for extended dependencies
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of directional versus distance-specific parameters to understand which aspect drives performance improvements
3. Test computational efficiency and memory requirements across different sequence lengths to establish practical deployment constraints and identify breaking points for the parameter explosion problem
