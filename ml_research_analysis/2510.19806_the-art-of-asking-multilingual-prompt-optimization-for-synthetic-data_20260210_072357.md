# The Art of Asking: Multilingual Prompt Optimization for Synthetic Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19806
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19806
- Reference count: 31
- One-line primary result: Prompt-space optimization improves multilingual synthetic data quality by reducing translation artifacts and injecting cultural context, yielding +4.7% accuracy on Global-MMLU over translation-only baselines.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a novel approach to multilingual synthetic data generation by optimizing the prompt space rather than the completion space. The method addresses the limitation of translation-based prompts that inherit English-centric framing and cultural bias by applying three targeted transformations—Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement—to translated prompts using a multilingual LLM. Evaluated across 12 languages spanning 7 families, the approach substantially improves downstream performance over translation-only baselines and demonstrates that prompt optimization is a more powerful lever for multilingual adaptation than traditional completion-focused methods.

## Method Summary
The method begins with a seed pool of 280k English prompts, which are translated into 12 target languages using an in-house expert translation model. These translated prompts then undergo targeted transformations using Gemma3-27B-it: Naturalness removes translation artifacts to restore idiomatic phrasing, Cultural Adaptation recontextualizes entities for local relevance (e.g., replacing Thanksgiving with local equivalents), and Difficulty Enhancement increases task complexity by adding constraints and multi-step instructions. The transformed prompts generate completions with the same model, which are filtered for language consistency using FastText. The resulting data (~590k examples) is used to fine-tune a smaller student model (CommandR7B) via supervised fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- +4.7% accuracy on Global-MMLU over translation-only baselines
- +2.4% accuracy on Flores XCometXL benchmark
- +35.3% win-rates on mArenaHard and PolyWrite evaluation
- Cultural Adaptation yields 7% improvement on culturally-sensitive subsets
- Difficulty Enhancement increases average prompt length by 2.2x, providing more target-language tokens for training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Inductive Bias via Input Distribution Shift
By optimizing the input prompt distribution, the method creates a stronger inductive bias for multilingual adaptation than solely optimizing completions. The transformations shift the training distribution closer to the true user distribution before any completions are generated, conditioning the student model on linguistically and culturally grounded inputs.

### Mechanism 2: Artifact Suppression and Cultural Grounding
The Naturalness transformation reduces "translationese" artifacts and restores idiomatic phrasing, while Cultural Adaptation recontextualizes entities to align with local knowledge. This improves fluency and cultural accuracy in downstream tasks, with Cultural Adaptation showing 7% improvement on culturally-sensitive subsets.

### Mechanism 3: Complexity-Induced Signal Amplification
Difficulty Enhancement increases prompt complexity by adding constraints and multi-step instructions, forcing the teacher model to generate longer, more complex completions. This provides 2.2x more target-language tokens for the student to learn from, effectively amplifying the training signal for reasoning tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Translationese vs. Natural Language**
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on the premise that machine-translated prompts are distinguishable from native text and carry English-centric bias.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a "perfect" semantic translation of a prompt might still be "unnatural" for training a model in the target language?

- **Concept: Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) Paradigms**
  - Why needed here: To differentiate between the standard "generation-focused" approach and this paper's "prompt-focused" approach.
  - Quick check question: In a standard SDG pipeline, where is the "prompt distribution" usually fixed, and how does this paper propose changing it?

- **Concept: Teacher-Student Distillation**
  - Why needed here: The architecture uses a strong LLM to transform prompts and generate completions for a smaller student model.
  - Quick check question: Why is the capability gap between the teacher and student critical when applying "Difficulty Enhancement"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Seed Pool (280k English prompts) → Translator (expert model) → Transformation Layer (Gemma3-27B-it) → Completion Generator (Gemma3-27B-it) → Filter (FastText) → Student (CommandR7B)

- **Critical path:** The transformation prompts in Table 8 are crucial. The success depends on specific instructions given to the LLM to perform Naturalness (remove artifacts) or Cultural Adaptation (swap entities), with safety rails like forbidding "fabricating facts."

- **Design tradeoffs:** Difficulty vs. Diversity - Difficulty transformation yields highest quality gains but lowers n-gram diversity (0.77 vs 0.88), risking template-like outputs. Mixing Strategy - 50/50 mix of Cultural + Difficulty is best; pure Difficulty wins on math/reasoning, pure Cultural wins on local knowledge.

- **Failure signatures:** Language confusion if teacher struggles with low-resource languages; Naturalness paradox where transformations improve text but don't always lower completion perplexity as expected.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Take 100 English prompts, translate to Spanish, run Naturalness transformation, manually verify if "translationese" is reduced.
  2. Run Difficulty transformation on a math dataset, calculate average prompt length, check if model adds genuine multi-step logic vs. filler constraints.
  3. Fine-tune student model on only Translated data vs. only Naturalness data, evaluate on generative benchmark (PolyWrite) to confirm win-rate delta.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does model merging yield better performance than data mixing when combining Cultural Adaptation and Difficulty Enhancement transformations?
- **Open Question 2:** Can this prompt optimization framework succeed in "cold start" scenarios with extremely low resource languages?
- **Open Question 3:** Do human evaluations align with the win-rates and quality improvements reported by LLM judges?

## Limitations

- The method relies heavily on a strong multilingual teacher model's ability to execute transformations across all languages, which may fail for truly low-resource or unsupported languages.
- The evaluation framework may have blind spots regarding LLM judge bias toward transformation styles, potentially inflating win-rates.
- The paper doesn't provide detailed error analysis on why specific languages or task types fail, limiting interpretability.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Overall performance gains over translation-only baselines are well-supported by experimental data.
- **Medium Confidence:** Mechanism claims are logically sound and partially supported, but causal chain from transformation to performance gain not fully validated.
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability to truly unsupported languages and robustness across all linguistic families not empirically validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Teacher Model Capability Validation:** Test Gemma3-27B-it's ability to execute each transformation across all 12 languages, measuring success rates and consistency of output quality.

2. **Judge Bias Audit:** Conduct ablation study where LLM judges evaluate outputs from only Translated data vs. only Difficulty-enhanced data without knowing source, investigating potential evaluation bias.

3. **Low-Resource Language Stress Test:** Apply pipeline to truly unsupported languages (e.g., Icelandic, Swahili) using only translation and teacher model capabilities, evaluating on minimal benchmark to test generalizability.
