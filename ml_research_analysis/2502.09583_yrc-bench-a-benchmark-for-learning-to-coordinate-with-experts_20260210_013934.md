# YRC-Bench: A Benchmark for Learning to Coordinate with Experts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.09583
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09583
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Benchmark shows no single method consistently outperforms others; substantial gap remains between current approaches and oracle

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces YRC-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate how well agents can learn to coordinate with experts in novel environments without direct expert interaction during training. The core challenge addressed is determining when an agent should request help from experts, which is critical for applications where expert resources are limited or costly. The authors propose a simulated validation approach that creates a weakened novice policy and uses the original novice as a simulated expert to predict test performance. The benchmark evaluates 10 different learning methods across 19 diverse environments, revealing that while some methods perform well in specific domains, no single approach consistently outperforms others. The results show a substantial performance gap between current methods and an oracle solution, indicating significant room for improvement in this research area.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel approach to the expert coordination problem by framing it as a two-component system: a policy proposer that generates candidate coordination policies and a validator that predicts which policy will perform best on unseen test environments. The key innovation is the simulated validation methodology, which addresses the challenge of evaluating coordination policies without requiring actual expert interaction during training. This is achieved by creating a weakened version of the novice policy and using the original novice as a simulated expert to estimate performance. The approach involves training on a set of source environments and then testing on novel target environments where the agent must determine when to request expert assistance. The benchmark evaluates 10 different methods that combine various policy proposer and validator strategies, providing a standardized framework for comparing approaches to expert coordination learning.

## Key Results
- No single method consistently outperforms others across all 19 benchmark environments
- Substantial performance gap exists between current methods and an oracle solution (8.5% to 21.4%)
- Improving the policy proposer shows more potential for performance gains than improving the validator
- The simulated validation approach using a weakened novice provides reasonable predictions of test performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by providing a standardized evaluation framework that isolates the core challenge of expert coordination: determining when to request help without direct expert interaction during training. The simulated validation mechanism allows researchers to evaluate their approaches using only the novice policy, which is typically available, rather than requiring costly expert demonstrations. By creating a weakened novice as a proxy for expert behavior, the system can generate realistic scenarios for testing coordination decisions. The two-component architecture (proposer + validator) naturally decomposes the problem into generating good coordination strategies and selecting among them based on predicted performance. This decomposition enables systematic comparison of different approaches and identifies where improvements are most needed.

## Foundational Learning

**Simulated Validation**
- Why needed: Direct expert interaction is expensive or impossible during training
- Quick check: Compare predicted vs actual performance on held-out environments

**Weakened Novice Policy**
- Why needed: Creates a proxy for expert behavior that's cheaper to generate than real expert demonstrations
- Quick check: Ensure weakened policy behaves differently from original novice but retains some useful characteristics

**Policy Proposer**
- Why needed: Generates candidate coordination strategies that can be evaluated by the validator
- Quick check: Diversity of generated policies and their coverage of different coordination scenarios

**Validator Performance Prediction**
- Why needed: Enables selection of optimal coordination policy without actual expert testing
- Quick check: Correlation between predicted and actual performance across multiple environments

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Proposer (candidate policy generator) -> Validator (performance predictor) -> Coordination Policy (final output) -> Environment (testing ground)

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from the policy proposer through the validator to the final coordination policy. The validator's predictions directly determine which proposer-generated policy is selected, making its accuracy crucial for overall system performance. This path must be efficient as it's executed during both training (for method development) and testing (for actual coordination decisions).

**Design Tradeoffs**
The main tradeoff is between validation accuracy and computational cost. More sophisticated validation approaches may provide better predictions but require more resources. The choice of how to weaken the novice policy involves balancing between creating a sufficiently different behavior while maintaining relevance to actual expert behavior. The decomposition into
