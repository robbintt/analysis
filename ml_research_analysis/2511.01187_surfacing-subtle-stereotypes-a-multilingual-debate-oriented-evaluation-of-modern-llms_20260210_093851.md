# Surfacing Subtle Stereotypes: A Multilingual, Debate-Oriented Evaluation of Modern LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01187
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01187
- Authors: Muhammed Saeed; Muhammad Abdul-mageed; Shady Shehata
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: All safety-aligned LLMs reproduce strong demographic stereotypes despite alignment, with biases intensifying in lower-resource languages.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DebateBias-8K, a multilingual benchmark using debate-style prompts to evaluate social bias in modern LLMs across 4 domains and 7 languages. The study finds that despite safety alignment, models consistently reproduce entrenched stereotypes, with Arabs overwhelmingly linked to terrorism and religion (≥95%), and biases growing sharply in lower-resource languages. The generative evaluation paradigm reveals subtle culturally coded biases that classification-style benchmarks miss.

## Method Summary
The study employs a multi-stage pipeline: (1) generates debate prompts with demographic placeholders and MODERN/STEREOTYPED framing, (2) translates prompts to 6 languages with back-translation validation, (3) queries 4 target models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, DeepSeek-Chat, LLaMA-3-70B) with randomized demographic ordering, and (4) classifies outputs using a 3-judge LLM ensemble to determine demographic attribution. The approach collects 100,800+ generations and uses majority voting for bias quantification.

## Key Results
- All models reproduce strong stereotypes despite safety alignment (e.g., Arabs linked to terrorism/religion ≥95%)
- Biases grow sharply in lower-resource languages, revealing alignment coverage gaps
- Debate-style prompting reveals culturally coded biases missed by classification benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Debate-Style Prompting Forces Narrative Framing
- Claim: Open-ended debate prompts expose implicit demographic associations that classification-style benchmarks miss.
- Mechanism: By instructing models to generate both "Modern-region" and "Stereotyped-region" perspectives, the benchmark forces models to assign demographic groups based on internalized associations rather than refusing or randomizing. This bypasses surface-level safety refusals while remaining instruction-following.
- Core assumption: Models will follow the debate structure and assign demographics based on learned associations rather than uniform random selection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results show that all models reproduce entrenched stereotypes despite safety alignment: Arabs are overwhelmingly linked to terrorism and religion (≥95%)"
  - [section 3.2]: "This design elicits ideological reasoning and moral justification revealing subtle culturally coded bias that may remain undetected in forced choice settings"
  - [corpus]: SESGO and EuroGEST similarly argue generative evaluation surfaces biases missed by classification paradigms.
- Break condition: If models uniformly refuse to generate stereotyped perspectives or assign demographics randomly regardless of topic.

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Lingual Alignment Gap
- Claim: Safety alignment trained predominantly on English data does not transfer effectively to lower-resource languages.
- Mechanism: Alignment techniques (RLHF/DPO) operate primarily on English instruction-response pairs. When prompts shift to low-resource languages (Swahili, Nigerian Pidgin), the alignment signal weakens and pretraining corpus biases dominate output behavior.
- Core assumption: The observed bias amplification in low-resource languages stems from alignment coverage gaps, not translation artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Biases grow sharply in lower-resource languages, revealing that alignment trained primarily in English does not generalize globally"
  - [section 5.3]: "In socioeconomic debates, African attribution rises from 58.4% in English to 77.3% in Nigerian Pidgin for GPT-4o"
  - [corpus]: Shen et al. (2024, "The language barrier") document related multilingual safety transfer failures.
- Break condition: If back-translation audits reveal semantic drift as the primary driver of cross-lingual differences.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Judge Demographic Classification
- Claim: Using multiple LLM judges to classify demographic framing provides scalable, reliable bias quantification.
- Mechanism: Three independent judge models classify which demographic is portrayed as "Modern" vs. "Stereotyped." Majority voting reduces individual model classification bias and noise.
- Core assumption: Judge models can reliably detect demographic framing across languages despite potential judge-model biases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3]: "A manual audit of 500 responses across languages yielded >90% inter-judge agreement in unanimous cases"
  - [section 6]: "the magnitude of effects we observe—such as 95–100% Arab attribution in terrorism—greatly exceeds what could be explained by classifier noise alone"
  - [corpus]: Limited external validation for multi-judge demographic classification specifically; related work uses similar approaches but not for this paradigm.
- Break condition: If judges show systematic preference for certain demographics regardless of content, or inter-judge agreement drops substantially.

## Foundational Learning

- **RLHF/DPO Alignment Coverage**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that models underwent extensive safety alignment yet still produce biased outputs is central to interpreting results—the paper explicitly tests "safety-aligned" models.
  - Quick check question: Why would RLHF reduce explicit toxicity but not prevent biased narrative framing?

- **Language Resource-Level Gradients**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core finding—that bias intensifies in low-resource languages—requires understanding what distinguishes high- from low-resource languages in training data volume and quality.
  - Quick check question: Name two factors that make Swahili "lower-resource" than English for LLM training.

- **Generative vs. Classification Evaluation Paradigms**
  - Why needed here: The paper critiques existing benchmarks (BBQ, StereoSet) as classification-focused and argues open-ended generation reveals different bias patterns.
  - Quick check question: Why might a multiple-choice bias benchmark miss stereotypes that appear in debate-style generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Prompt Generator -> Translation Module -> Target Model Interface -> Classification System -> Aggregation Pipeline

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate schema-compliant prompts (demographic placeholder + 3 debate points)
  2. Translate with back-translation validation (≥0.90 cosine similarity threshold)
  3. Probe target models with randomized demographic ordering (3 runs per prompt)
  4. Classify outputs via multi-judge voting
  5. Aggregate into probability distributions per cell

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Automated translation + spot audits vs. full human translation (scale vs. quality)
  - Temperature 0.7 vs. lower (natural behavior vs. reproducibility)
  - 3-judge automation vs. human annotation (throughput vs. ground-truth validity)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Schema violations (missing placeholder, wrong debate point count)
  - Back-translation similarity below 0.90 threshold
  - Judge disagreement >10% on clear cases
  - Target model refusals or malformed responses

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run 50 English prompts through the full pipeline end-to-end to validate schema compliance and judge agreement before scaling.
  2. Compare two models (GPT-4o vs. LLaMA 3) on a single domain (terrorism) across 3 languages to test cross-lingual amplification hypothesis.
  3. Audit 100 manually classified outputs against judge decisions to establish ground-truth baseline for classification accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Which specific alignment strategy (e.g., RLHF, DPO, or constitutional approaches) most effectively transfers fairness mitigations from high-resource (English) to low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states in the Limitations section: "Comparing different alignment strategies such as RLHF, DPO, and constitutional approaches could clarify which techniques best transfer fairness across languages."
- Why unresolved: The study evaluated flagship models as "black boxes" with undisclosed or mixed alignment strategies, preventing the isolation of the alignment method as a variable.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled ablation study where identical base models are aligned using distinct strategies (RLHF vs. DPO, etc.) and then evaluated on the DebateBias-8K benchmark to measure bias reduction deltas across languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do the high rates of stereotype reproduction observed in debate-style prompts generalize to real-world application domains such as healthcare or education?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note: "Studying bias in real-world use cases (e.g., education, healthcare, and customer support) is essential, as our debate-style prompts likely capture only a subset of the stereotypes that arise during everyday interaction with LLMs."
- Why unresolved: The benchmark uses a specific "role-play" debate structure which explicitly elicits contrasting perspectives; it is unclear if the same stereotypes persist in standard, non-adversarial user interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing bias metrics from DebateBias-8K against metrics derived from domain-specific evaluation sets (e.g., medical QA or educational tutoring) using the same models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the use of LLM-based classifiers (LLM-as-a-Judge) systematically introduce "circularity" or blind spots when evaluating subtle narrative biases against human standards?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper relies entirely on automated LLM judges for its 100,800 generations. The Limitations section acknowledges "potential circularity, as models evaluate outputs generated by other models," and admits "residual bias may persist" despite majority voting.
- Why unresolved: While spot checks were performed, the scalability of the study required trusting the judge models to detect nuances they might themselves be biased against or indifferent to.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive gold-standard human annotation of a statistically significant subset of the generated debates to calculate the precision and recall of the automated judges specifically for "subtle" stereotypes.

### Open Question 4
- Question: To what extent do translation artifacts or tone shifts in the prompt translation pipeline contribute to the exacerbated bias observed in low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper observes that "Translation quality may also affect results" and that "subtle differences in tone, idiom, or register across languages could influence model behavior," yet it attributes the bias spike primarily to alignment failure.
- Why unresolved: The translation pipeline used automated validation (back-translation similarity) which verifies semantic content but may miss cultural connotations that trigger bias in the target model.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation using human-translated prompts versus machine-translated prompts for the same low-resource scenarios to isolate the effect of translation quality on bias manifestation.

## Limitations

- The evaluation's reliance on LLM-based demographic classification introduces inherent methodological uncertainty despite manual audits showing >90% inter-judge agreement on clear cases.
- The automated translation pipeline, despite back-translation validation, cannot fully capture cultural nuance that might influence demographic attribution patterns.
- The temperature setting of 0.7 creates non-deterministic outputs that complicate exact replication and may affect bias manifestation.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The finding that safety-aligned models reproduce strong demographic stereotypes (>95% Arab attribution to terrorism/religion) is supported by multiple independent sources including manual audits and consistent patterns across languages.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that alignment gaps specifically cause cross-lingual bias amplification requires further validation. While the correlation between resource level and bias intensity is clear, establishing causal mechanisms would require controlled experiments.
- **Low Confidence:** The mechanism explanation for why debate-style prompting reveals different bias patterns than classification benchmarks remains largely theoretical without direct controlled comparisons.

## Next Checks

1. **Judge Reliability Audit:** Manually classify 200 randomly sampled outputs (50 per language domain) and compute Cohen's kappa against judge predictions to establish true classification accuracy beyond inter-judge agreement.

2. **Alignment Coverage Experiment:** Systematically vary the proportion of target language data in the alignment phase using a controllable model (e.g., LLaMA with synthetic alignment) to directly test whether reduced language-specific alignment causes the observed bias amplification.

3. **Cross-Paradigm Comparison:** Run an identical content set through both debate-style generation and traditional multiple-choice classification formats to empirically measure what additional bias patterns, if any, the generative approach uncovers beyond established benchmarks.
