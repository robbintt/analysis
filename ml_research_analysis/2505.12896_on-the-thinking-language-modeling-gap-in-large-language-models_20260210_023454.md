# On the Thinking-Language Modeling Gap in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.12896
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12896
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Language-of-Thoughts (LoT) prompting consistently improves reasoning accuracy over CoT baselines across 11 benchmarks and 4 LLMs by reducing language-modeling biases from implicitness and non-topological order.

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies a fundamental gap between language modeling and thought modeling in large language models (LLMs), showing that language biases—particularly from implicit expressions and non-topological order—can lead to flawed reasoning. Using structural causal models, the authors formalize how next-token prediction in language modeling marginalizes over unseen premises, causing models to rely on priors rather than true causal logic. To address this, they propose Language-of-Thoughts (LoT), a prompting method that instructs models to observe, expand, and echo all relevant information. Evaluated on 11 reasoning benchmarks and 4 LLMs, LoT consistently improves accuracy, especially on tasks with strong implicitness, and reduces language-modeling biases compared to standard CoT approaches.

## Method Summary
The method, Language-of-Thoughts (LoT), is a prompting technique that mitigates language-modeling bias in LLM reasoning. It uses a two-part instruction prefix—either "observe, expand, echo" (LoT_2) or variants—to guide models to surface latent premises before reasoning. The "echo" step surfaces q-implicit (contextual) cues, while "expand" rewrites L-implicit expressions. LoT is applied as a zero-shot prompt prefix, often combined with standard CoT instructions, and evaluated via accuracy on benchmarks like GPQA, FOLIO, and WinoBias.

## Key Results
- LoT consistently outperforms CoT across 11 benchmarks and 4 LLMs, especially on tasks with high implicitness.
- The "echo" intervention effectively reduces q-implicitness errors, while "expand" targets L-implicitness, with gains confirmed via WinoControl ablation.
- LoT reduces language-modeling biases and improves accuracy over baselines, though minor performance drops are observed on LSAT (where expansion may introduce noise).

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reducing implicitness improves reasoning accuracy.
- Mechanism: LoT's "echo" step surfaces q-implicit (contextual) cues, while "expand" rewrites L-implicit expressions, lowering the misrecognition term (1 − Ψ(c∗₁, … | L₁, …)) in Theorem 2.4.
- Core assumption: The model's reasoning improves when latent premises are explicitly recognized; the bound in Theorem 2.4 correctly links recognition error to KL divergence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Abstract shows LoT reduces language-modeling biases and improves accuracy over CoT on 11 benchmarks and 4 LLMs.
  - [section] Section 3.3 and Figure 3 show accuracy patterns with controlled implicitness and gains from Echo vs Expand interventions.
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbor "Do Biased Models Have Biased Thoughts?" indicates CoT can alter bias propagation, weakly supporting the role of prompting in bias reduction.
- Break condition: If premise recognition accuracy (Ψ(c∗ | L)) is already near 1, further echo/expand steps yield diminishing returns and may add noise.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Non-topological order in language introduces modeling bias.
- Mechanism: When text order deviates from the causal graph order, next-token prediction marginalizes over unseen premises (Proposition 2.3), leading the model to rely on priors rather than true causes.
- Core assumption: Language training reflects a mixture of topological and non-topological orderings, and the model does not internally reorder tokens causally.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 2.2 and Equation 1 formalize the marginalization bias when language is anti-topological.
  - [section] Running example and Figure 1 illustrate how order (C1, A, C2) omits C2 during prediction of A.
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbors do not directly address topological order; relevant evidence is absent.
- Break condition: If the model jointly models the full context (e.g., via bidirectional attention) and infers latent causality, the marginalization effect may be mitigated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LoT instructions can be combined with reasoning methods to improve task performance.
- Mechanism: By prefixing prompts with explicit observe/expand/echo instructions, LoT guides the model to retrieve and restate premises before reasoning steps, which can integrate with CoT or other methods.
- Core assumption: Models can reliably follow multi-step prompt instructions and maintain focus across the instruction and reasoning phases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 3.2 describes LoT prompting variants and their combination with CoT.
  - [section] Section 5.2 (Figure 5) shows LoT consistently outperforms CoT across 8 benchmarks and 6 LLMs.
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbor "Understanding Reasoning in Thinking Language Models via Steering Vectors" suggests reasoning can be steered, but does not provide direct evidence on LoT-style instructions.
- Break condition: If models have weak instruction-following capabilities, additional instructions may be ignored or misapplied, reducing or reversing gains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and topological order
  - Why needed here: The paper uses SCMs to formalize how language order and latent variables affect reasoning; understanding SCMs is essential for interpreting Proposition 2.3 and Theorem 2.4.
  - Quick check question: Given a causal graph X → Y ← Z, which token orderings are topological with respect to this graph?

- **Concept:** Implicit vs explicit expression (L- and q-implicitness)
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes two types of implicitness and designs interventions for each; this framing is critical for applying LoT correctly.
  - Quick check question: For a sentence "Bob arrived, and he looked tired," is the gender information L-implicit or q-implicit?

- **Concept:** KL divergence and its lower bound in Theorem 2.4
  - Why needed here: The theorem links reasoning loss to misrecognition of premises; understanding this bound helps diagnose when LoT is likely to help.
  - Quick check question: What does the term (1 − Ψ(c∗₁, c∗₂ | L₁, L₂)) represent in the lower bound, and how does LoT aim to reduce it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** LoT consists of two core prompt components—Echo (observe and echo relevant information) and Expand (observe and expand relevant information)—which can be combined into LoT_1 or LoT_2 prefixes. These are placed before the task description and any reasoning instructions (e.g., "think step by step").

- **Critical path:** Start with LoT_2 prefix (observe, expand, echo), then task context, then CoT-style reasoning steps. Ensure the model generates the echo/expansion before reasoning.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Echo adds fewer tokens and is effective for q-implicitness; Expand rewrites for L-implicitness but may increase token cost and risk over-interpretation. LoT_2 combines both but may be unnecessary for simple tasks.

- **Failure signatures:** If the model ignores the echo/expand step (e.g., jumps straight to reasoning) or expands with incorrect reinterpretations, performance may degrade.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Benchmark LoT_2 vs CoT on GPQA and FOLIO using GPT-4o-mini, recording accuracy and token count.
  2. Ablate Echo and Expand separately on WinoControl's controlled implicitness levels to confirm which intervention targets which implicitness type.
  3. Test LoT_2 on LSAT (where the paper shows smaller gains) to identify failure modes and adjust instructions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can training-based interventions (e.g., instruction tuning) succeed in fully bridging the language-thought gap where prompt-level interventions like LoT fall short?
- Basis in paper: The authors conclude that "it calls for in-depth investigation and a better strategy... such as developing better instruction tuning methods in the future work" to fully mitigate the gap (Section 5.2, Section 6).
- Why unresolved: This work focuses on inference-time interventions (LoT), which cannot alter the fundamental next-token prediction biases learned during pre-training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments evaluating LoT against models specifically fine-tuned on datasets designed to decouple language expression from causal logic.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the efficacy of LoT depend on a model's inherent instruction-following capability rather than its reasoning capacity?
- Basis in paper: In Section 5.2, the authors note that smaller models like Mistral-7B did not consistently benefit from LoT, leading to the conjecture that "LLMs with weaker instruction following capabilities may not be able to follow the LoT instructions."
- Why unresolved: The study evaluates models of varying sizes and architectures but does not isolate the specific variable of instruction-following proficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study controlling for model size while varying the degree of instruction tuning to measure the correlation between instruction adherence and LoT success rates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the "Expand" intervention be modified to prevent performance degradation in tasks where language expansion introduces noise (e.g., LSAT)?
- Basis in paper: The authors report that LoT sometimes led to minor performance decreases on the LSAT benchmark and note that "the expansion prompt may exacerbate the language modeling biases" (Section 5.2).
- Why unresolved: The current implementation of "Expand" is heuristic; it is unclear how to selectively expand information without triggering spurious correlations or "shortcuts" in logical domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: A fine-grained analysis of error types in LSAT tasks under the "Expand" condition versus a constrained expansion method that limits semantic drift.

## Limitations
- LoT's effectiveness is task-dependent; it shows diminishing or negative returns on tasks with low implicitness (e.g., LSAT), suggesting it is not universally beneficial.
- The method relies on models' instruction-following capabilities, which may be weak in smaller models, limiting its applicability across model sizes.
- The paper does not fully explore or mitigate the risk of LoT instructions introducing new biases or errors if models misinterpret the "expand" directive.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The identification of language-modeling bias as a source of flawed reasoning in LLMs is well-supported by structural causal modeling and empirical results. The formalization of L-implicitness and q-implicitness is clear and actionable.
- **Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of LoT prompting in reducing bias and improving accuracy is supported by ablation studies and benchmark results, but the extent of gains depends on task type and model capability. The interaction between LoT and model size is not fully characterized.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that LoT instructions can be universally combined with any reasoning method is not fully validated. The paper shows integration with CoT, but does not explore combinations with other advanced reasoning strategies or their potential conflicts.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-task Robustness:** Test LoT prompting on a broader set of reasoning tasks, including those with minimal implicitness (e.g., arithmetic, logic puzzles), to determine if gains are task-dependent and to identify failure modes.
2. **Model Scaling Study:** Evaluate LoT across a wider range of model sizes (e.g., 1B, 7B, 70B, 405B parameters) to assess whether benefits scale with model capability and to detect any diminishing returns or overfitting at larger scales.
3. **Instruction-Following Reliability:** Conduct a systematic study of LoT instruction adherence across model families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) and prompt templates to quantify the variance in instruction-following and its impact on final reasoning accuracy.
