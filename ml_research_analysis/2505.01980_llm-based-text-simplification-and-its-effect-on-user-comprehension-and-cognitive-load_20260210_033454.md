# LLM-based Text Simplification and its Effect on User Comprehension and Cognitive Load

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01980
- Reference count: 0
- Major improvement in comprehension when complex texts are simplified using LLMs

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can effectively simplify complex texts across multiple domains while maintaining comprehension levels. The researchers developed a Gemini-based simplification system using automated evaluation models and iterative prompt refinement. A randomized controlled trial with 4,563 participants showed that readers of simplified texts scored 3.9% higher on comprehension tests compared to those reading original texts, with the largest gains in medical literature (14.6% improvement).

The findings suggest LLM-driven text simplification could significantly improve information accessibility for non-expert audiences across various domains including finance, aerospace, legal, and medical content. The study provides empirical evidence that automated text simplification can bridge the gap between expert knowledge and general audiences while preserving essential information content.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed a Gemini-based text simplification system using automated evaluation models and iterative prompt refinement across six domains. They conducted a randomized controlled trial with 4,563 participants who read either original or simplified versions of 31 texts from different domains. Comprehension was measured using multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and participants also reported on ease of comprehension and confidence levels. The study employed statistical analysis to compare comprehension scores between original and simplified text conditions.

## Key Results
- 3.9% absolute improvement in comprehension scores for simplified texts (p<0.05)
- 14.6% improvement in PubMed/medical text comprehension
- Participants reported greater ease of comprehension and confidence with simplified texts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on LLMs' ability to understand complex text structures and rephrase them using simpler vocabulary and sentence structures while preserving semantic meaning. The automated evaluation models help identify areas where simplification is most needed, and iterative prompt refinement ensures the output maintains accuracy across different domains. The system leverages the model's understanding of context and domain-specific terminology to create accessible versions without losing critical information.

## Foundational Learning
- Text simplification algorithms - Why needed: To systematically reduce complexity while preserving meaning. Quick check: Compare automated vs manual simplification quality.
- Automated evaluation metrics - Why needed: To objectively measure simplification quality and comprehension impact. Quick check: Correlation between metric scores and human comprehension.
- Domain adaptation - Why needed: Different fields require different simplification approaches. Quick check: Domain-specific vs generic simplification performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Original Text -> LLM Processing -> Automated Evaluation -> Prompt Refinement -> Simplified Text

Critical path: The key workflow involves text input, LLM processing with domain-specific prompts, automated evaluation scoring, iterative refinement based on evaluation feedback, and final simplified output generation.

Design tradeoffs: The system prioritizes comprehension improvement over maximal simplification, uses automated evaluation for scalability rather than pure human review, and focuses on multiple-choice assessment over open-ended evaluation for standardization.

Failure signatures: Poor simplification quality may occur with highly technical terminology, ambiguous domain contexts, or when automated evaluation models misjudge domain-specific accuracy requirements.

Three first experiments:
1. Test simplification on medical texts with known comprehension difficulties
2. Compare automated vs human evaluation scores across different domains
3. Measure comprehension impact on texts with varying baseline complexity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Automated evaluation models may not capture all nuances of human comprehension
- Multiple-choice questions may not fully reflect true understanding or application
- Convenience sample limits generalizability across diverse demographics and cultures

## Confidence

| Claim Cluster | Confidence |
|---------------|------------|
| Comprehension improvement | High |
| Domain-specific effectiveness | Medium |
| Cognitive load reduction | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with stratified sampling across education levels, age groups, and cultural backgrounds to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct a follow-up study using mixed methods, including think-aloud protocols and application-based assessments, to validate comprehension beyond MCQs.
3. Implement a blinded evaluation where domain experts assess content fidelity and accuracy in simplified texts across all six domains to ensure minimal information loss.
