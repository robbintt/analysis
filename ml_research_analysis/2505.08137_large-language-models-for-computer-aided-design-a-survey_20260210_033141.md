# Large Language Models for Computer-Aided Design: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.08137
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08137
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: First comprehensive review of LLM applications in CAD, identifying multimodal approaches using intermediate representations for automation across six key application categories

## Executive Summary
This survey represents the first comprehensive review of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Computer-Aided Design (CAD), identifying a significant trend toward using multimodal LLMs to automate and enhance CAD workflows. The research systematically categorizes existing approaches into six main application areas: data generation, code generation, parametric CAD generation, image generation, model evaluation, and text generation. Most surveyed methods rely on intermediate representations such as Python scripts or JSON files rather than directly generating final 3D models, indicating the field remains in early development stages. GPT-4o and GPT-4 emerge as the most frequently used models, with manufacturing applications dominating current research efforts while other domains like home design and fashion design show growing interest.

## Method Summary
The survey conducted a systematic review of academic publications from multiple databases to identify and categorize LLM applications in CAD. The methodology involved searching for peer-reviewed papers and analyzing their reported capabilities, input-output patterns, and application domains. The classification framework was developed based on the primary function each approach serves within the CAD workflow, distinguishing between direct CAD generation and supporting tasks like data creation or evaluation. The analysis focused on identifying common patterns in model selection, input modalities, and output formats across the surveyed literature.

## Key Results
- LLMs predominantly use multimodal inputs and generate intermediate representations (Python scripts, JSON) rather than direct 3D models
- GPT-4o and GPT-4 are the most frequently utilized models in CAD applications
- Manufacturing represents the primary industry focus, though applications in home design, building compliance checking, and fashion design are emerging
- Future research opportunities include expanding to additional data formats and integrating with AEC compliance systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLMs excel at CAD applications because they can process multimodal inputs (text, images, structured data) and generate structured outputs that interface with existing CAD tools. Their natural language understanding capabilities enable them to interpret design requirements and translate them into executable code or intermediate representations. The pattern recognition abilities allow them to learn from existing design datasets and generate new content following established conventions. Their flexibility in handling different data formats makes them suitable for various CAD-related tasks beyond just 3D model generation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Input Processing**: LLMs can simultaneously process text descriptions and visual inputs to understand design requirements - needed for interpreting both verbal specifications and reference images in CAD workflows; quick check: verify model can process combined text-image prompts effectively
- **Intermediate Representation Generation**: Creating Python scripts or JSON files as bridge between natural language and CAD software - needed because direct 3D generation remains challenging; quick check: validate generated code can be executed in target CAD environment
- **Domain-Specific Language Understanding**: LLMs must comprehend CAD-specific terminology and constraints - needed for accurate interpretation of technical specifications; quick check: test comprehension of industry-standard CAD vocabulary
- **Structured Output Formatting**: Generating well-formed code or configuration files - needed for interoperability with existing CAD tools; quick check: verify syntax validity of generated outputs
- **Context Window Management**: Handling complex design specifications that may exceed typical context limits - needed for detailed CAD projects; quick check: test performance with varying input lengths
- **Parametric Design Logic**: Understanding relationships between design parameters - needed for generating flexible, modifiable designs; quick check: validate parameter interdependencies in generated outputs

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: User Input -> Multimodal LLM -> Intermediate Representation (Python/JSON) -> CAD Software -> 3D Model
- **Critical Path**: The most critical path involves accurate translation from natural language requirements through intermediate representation to functional CAD output, where errors at any stage propagate to final results
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The choice between direct 3D generation versus intermediate representations represents a fundamental tradeoff between simplicity and reliability - intermediate representations offer better control and error handling but require additional processing steps
- **Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include incorrect parameter values in generated code, misinterpretation of spatial relationships from text descriptions, and syntax errors in intermediate representations that prevent CAD software execution
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test LLM's ability to generate valid Python scripts for basic geometric shapes in target CAD software
  2. Evaluate multimodal comprehension by providing text + image inputs and measuring accuracy of generated intermediate representations
  3. Benchmark different LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-4o, alternatives) on identical CAD generation tasks to identify performance variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The survey relies primarily on academic publications, potentially missing industrial implementations and pre-print works that may not yet be peer-reviewed
- Classification of application categories is based on reported capabilities rather than direct experimental validation, introducing uncertainty about practical performance
- Current emphasis on GPT-4o and GPT-4 may reflect publication bias rather than comprehensive evaluation of alternative models

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The survey successfully identifies the core trend of using multimodal LLMs for CAD automation with intermediate representations being standard approach
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about GPT-4o/GPT-4 dominance and manufacturing industry focus reflect publication patterns rather than systematic market analysis
- **Low confidence**: Future research opportunities and underexplored domains are speculative based on current publication gaps

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic literature review extending beyond academic publications to include industrial white papers, patents, and technical reports to verify completeness of current survey
2. Implement representative sample of surveyed approaches (data generation, code generation, parametric CAD) to benchmark actual performance versus claimed capabilities
3. Survey CAD software companies and industrial users to validate reported industry adoption patterns and identify practical constraints not captured in academic publications
