# Human-Artificial Interaction in the Age of Agentic AI: A System-Theoretical Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.14000
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14000
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces communication spaces with layered abstraction (Surface, Observation, Computation) to unify Multi-Agent Systems and Centaurian paradigms, formalized using Colored Petri Nets and high-level reconfigurable networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a system-theoretical framework for human-AI interaction that addresses the challenge of coordinating heterogeneous agents with different capabilities and goals. The authors introduce communication spaces—structured into surface, observation, and computation layers—to unify multi-agent systems (MAS) and Centaurian systems paradigms. While MAS maintains agent autonomy through structured protocols, Centaurian systems create unified decision-making entities through deep integration. The framework is formalized using colored Petri nets for Centaurian systems and high-level reconfigurable networks for MAS. The approach is validated through two use cases: satellite and swarm robotics demonstrating MAS characteristics with Centaurian integration points, and Large Action Models showing Centaurian principles with feedback loops. The research provides a foundation for next-generation hybrid intelligence systems that balance structured coordination with emergent behavior.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize the proposed interaction framework using Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) for Centaurian systems and high-level reconfigurable networks for MAS. The system is structured into three layers: Surface Space (mediating external contact), Observation Space (handling message transformations and routing), and Computation Space (executing decision-making logic). For Centaurian systems, CPNs use typed tokens where transitions fire only when specific combinations are present (e.g., human approval AND AI plan tokens). For MAS, a Group-Agent manages dynamic agent lists with register, deliver, and deregister behaviors. The framework is validated through two use cases: satellite and swarm robotics (MAS with Centaurian integration points) and Large Action Models (Centaurian principles with feedback loops).

## Key Results
- Introduces communication spaces with three-layer abstraction (Surface, Observation, Computation) for heterogeneous agent coordination
- Formalizes Centaurian systems using Colored Petri Nets with typed tokens and transition guards
- Proposes high-level reconfigurable networks for dynamic MAS agent management
- Demonstrates framework through satellite/swarm robotics and Large Action Models use cases
- Provides foundation for hybrid intelligence systems balancing structured coordination with emergent behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Layered Abstraction via Communication Spaces
The framework partitions interactions into Surface, Observation, and Computation layers, allowing heterogeneous agents (humans, LLMs, robots) to coordinate despite asymmetric capabilities. The Surface layer normalizes external inputs (text, sensor data); the Observation layer handles transformation and routing; the Computation layer executes logic. This decouples the "interface" from the "logic," allowing agents to interact without understanding each other's internal states. Core assumption: agents share common syntactic/semantic format in Observation layer or translators exist to bridge gaps.

### Mechanism 2: Synchronization via Colored Petri Nets (CPN)
Colored Petri Nets provide formal structure to enforce "Centaurian" tight coupling between human and AI decision-making. CPNs use typed ("colored") tokens where transitions fire only when specific combinations are present (e.g., a "human approval" token AND an "AI plan" token). This enforces rigid, verifiable dependency where neither human nor AI can proceed alone. Core assumption: interaction logic is deterministic enough to be captured by discrete states and transitions.

### Mechanism 3: Dynamic Reconfiguration via Group-Agents
Multi-Agent Systems maintain resilience through dynamic group management, allowing agents to enter/exit interactions without central coordination failure. A "Group-Agent" manages lists of active/inactive agents with `register`, `deliver`, and `deregister` behaviors ensuring messages are broadcast only to relevant/active agents, preserving system's "localization constraints." Core assumption: agents act rationally regarding registration and topics; network connectivity allows message delivery.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Colored Petri Nets (CPN)**
  - Why needed here: Mathematical engine used to formalize "Centaurian" architecture; without understanding tokens and transitions, implementation details are opaque.
  - Quick check question: How does a guard function on a transition enforce a specific data type or condition before firing?

- **Concept: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) vs. Centaurian Systems**
  - Why needed here: Entire paper hinges on distinguishing these paradigms; MAS = autonomy/protocols, Centaurian = integration/fusion.
  - Quick check question: Does the system preserve distinct agent identities (MAS) or create new composite identity (Centaurian)?

- **Concept: Living Systems Theory (Boundaries)**
  - Why needed here: Theory used to explain how systems maintain identity; informs design of "permeable" vs. "rigid" boundaries in architecture.
  - Quick check question: In Centaurian system, is boundary between human and AI defined by interface or by shared cognitive processing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Surface Agents (UI, APIs, Sensors) -> Observer Agents (Transformers, Routers, Group-Agents) -> Executive Agents (AI Models, Control Units) -> Communication Space (shared environment connecting above)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Input arrives at Surface Agent
  2. Observer Agent (Group-Agent) validates registration and `delivers` message
  3. Executive Agent processes message in Computation Space
  4. (If Centaurian) CPN Transition waits for paired Human/AI tokens before firing

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - MAS Mode: High flexibility and resilience (agents can fail independently); lower coordination efficiency
  - Centaurian Mode: High efficiency and synergy; tighter coupling increases risk of cascade failures
  - Formalism: CPNs offer verification but lack fluidity of neural networks; paper suggests hybrid approaches (Reconfigurable Networks) for dynamic MAS components

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Deadlock: Tokens (Human/AI inputs) never align at CPN transition (Centaurian failure)
  - Isolation: Agent remains in `nonActive` list but needs to be `active`, missing critical messages (MAS failure)
  - Boundary Confusion: Treating Centaurian interaction as MAS transaction, leading to loss of shared context

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement Group-Agent Protocol: Code `register` and `deliver` pseudo-code to simulate dynamic chat room where agents join/leave
  2. Model Centaurian Workflow: Build simple Colored Petri Net where "Task" token created only when both "UserGoal" and "AIPlan" tokens present in "Computation" place
  3. Test Mode Switching: Create simulation where robot swarm operates autonomously (MAS) until "Emergency" token triggers switch to Centaurian mode (Human-in-the-loop override)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can high-level reconfigurable networks be formally integrated with colored Petri nets to enable dynamic agent registration and deregistration while preserving system-wide consensus guarantees? Basis: Authors state "Standard Petri nets... have difficulty accommodating scenarios where agents join or leave while maintaining consensus" and that "smooth coordination requires high-level reconfiguration mechanisms." Unresolved because paper provides pseudo-code but integration mechanism with reconfigurable networks remains unspecified. Resolution would require formal specification with proofs of consensus properties during agent transitions.

### Open Question 2
What formal mechanisms enable seamless transitions between Centaurian (tight coupling) and MAS (loose coupling) modes within same system architecture? Basis: Authors propose "hybrid approach that bridges MAS and Centaurian systems" using "communication spaces as intermediate layer for seamless coordination." Unresolved because specific triggering conditions, transition protocols, and state-preservation mechanisms for mode-switching are not formalized. Resolution would require formal model defining transition conditions, implemented and tested in scenarios requiring dynamic shifts.

### Open Question 3
How can set-theoretic models complement Petri net formalizations to address scalability limitations in large-scale dynamic multi-agent systems? Basis: Authors state they "will explore how set-theoretic models can complement Petri nets to ensure both formal rigor and practical applicability" and that such approaches "abstract agent relationships without rigid network structures." Unresolved because paper doesn't specify how set-theoretic abstractions would interface with token-flow semantics or maintain equivalent analytical guarantees. Resolution would require comparative formal analysis showing reduced computational complexity with equivalent system properties.

## Limitations

- Theoretical framework lacks quantitative performance benchmarks or real-world deployment data
- Critical implementation details remain underspecified, particularly transition guard conditions for complex interaction patterns
- Dynamic reconfiguration mechanisms for MAS mode switching are not fully formalized
- Colored Petri Net formalism may face practical scalability limitations with high agent counts or continuous state spaces
- Use cases presented as conceptual demonstrations rather than rigorous evaluations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Layered communication space architecture (Surface, Observation, Computation layers) is well-specified and theoretically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Colored Petri Net formalization provides verifiable structure for Centaurian systems but faces practical implementation challenges
- **Low Confidence**: Performance claims regarding system efficiency and resilience are not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. **Implement and Benchmark Group-Agent Protocol**: Code register/deliver/deregister pseudocode and measure message delivery latency and failure rates under varying agent counts (10, 50, 100 agents). Compare against baseline broadcast protocols to quantify coordination overhead.

2. **CPN State Space Analysis for Centaurian Workflows**: Build "Assign Task" Colored Petri Net example and conduct formal verification for liveness and boundedness properties. Systematically vary number of concurrent human-AI pairs to identify scalability thresholds where verification becomes computationally intractable.

3. **Prototype Dynamic Mode Switching**: Implement hybrid simulation where multi-agent system (e.g., drone swarm) autonomously operates in MAS mode until triggered to switch to Centaurian mode. Measure transition latency, system stability during mode changes, and coordination accuracy in both operational modes.
