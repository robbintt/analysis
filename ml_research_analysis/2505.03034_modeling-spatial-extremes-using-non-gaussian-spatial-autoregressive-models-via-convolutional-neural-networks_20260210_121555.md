# Modeling Spatial Extremes using Non-Gaussian Spatial Autoregressive Models via Convolutional Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.03034
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03034
- Authors: Sweta Rai; Douglas W. Nychka; Soutir Bandyopadhyay
- Reference count: 7
- One-line primary result: CNN-trained SAR-GEV model estimates spatial extreme parameters efficiently, achieving results in milliseconds vs hours with good accuracy on NA-CORDEX precipitation data.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of modeling spatial extremes in large gridded datasets with heavy-tailed distributions. The authors propose a Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) model with Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) innovations, trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to bypass intractable likelihood calculations. The method is validated through simulations comparing CNN estimates to Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and applied to North American CORDEX precipitation data, demonstrating computational efficiency and strong statistical performance.

## Method Summary
The approach generates 50,000 synthetic 16×16 spatial fields using SAR-GEV simulation via R packages extRemes and LatticeKrig, with parameters ξ ∈ (0.01, 0.9), κ² ∈ (0.001, 2), τ² ∈ (0.0001, 0.1). A CNN with 2 Conv2D layers, GlobalAveragePooling, and 2 Dense layers is trained on these standardized fields using MAE loss with ADAM optimizer. The trained CNN predicts parameters for new spatial fields, with 95% confidence intervals derived via quantile regression. The method is applied to NA-CORDEX WRF annual max precipitation data through 16×16 tiling.

## Key Results
- CNN achieves parameter estimation in milliseconds vs hours for MLE on synthetic data
- Coverage probability of 95% confidence intervals ranges from 80-95% across parameter space
- Applied to NA-CORDEX data shows good agreement with observed extreme precipitation patterns across North America
- Higher shape parameter estimates in Gulf Coast and Pacific West regions match physical expectations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The SAR model with GEV innovations captures spatial dependence in heavy-tailed extreme events.
- **Mechanism:** Constructs spatial process using basis functions with random coefficients generated via Bc = e where e are iid GEV random variables, with SAR matrix B introducing spatial dependence.
- **Core assumption:** Spatial field can be represented by basis expansion where stochastic weights follow specific non-Gaussian SAR structure (tridiagonal B with fixed diagonal κ² and off-diagonal -1).
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "combining the SAR framework with GEV innovations to capture spatial dependence in extreme events"; Section 2.2 details the coefficient generation process.
- **Break condition:** May fail if true spatial dependence cannot be approximated by sparse SAR matrix structure or if grid is not regular.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** CNN serves as computationally efficient surrogate for MLE when likelihood is intractable.
- **Mechanism:** Simulation-based inference where CNN trained once on synthetic (field, parameters) pairs learns inverse mapping from spatial patterns to parameters by minimizing MAE.
- **Core assumption:** CNN can learn inverse mapping and training distribution covers practical parameter space.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract notes "CNN trained on simulated data to estimate parameters efficiently, avoiding intractable likelihood calculations"; Section 3 describes training procedure.
- **Break condition:** Inference fails if input field is from outside training parameter distribution or if optimizer converges to local minimum.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Quantile regression applied to CNN estimates provides valid uncertainty quantification.
- **Mechanism:** Empirical uncertainty modeling where quantile regression fits 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles using CNN estimates as covariates to construct confidence intervals.
- **Core assumption:** Relationship between CNN estimate and true parameter is regular enough for quantile regression capture.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "95% confidence intervals derived via quantile regression"; Section 4.3 proposes using quantile regression for bounds.
- **Break condition:** Coverage probability may drop if high confounding between parameters or insufficient training data in specific parameter regions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) Models**
  - **Why needed here:** Extends traditional Gaussian SAR models to non-Gaussian domain; understanding how matrix B induces spatial correlation is fundamental.
  - **Quick check question:** How does sparsity of matrix B contribute to computational efficiency of simulation?

- **Concept: Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) Distribution**
  - **Why needed here:** Core building block for innovations; shape parameter ξ controls tail behavior (heavy-tailed Fréchet vs light-tailed Gumbel).
  - **Quick check question:** Why does paper restrict ξ > 0 (Fréchet) for modeling spatial extremes?

- **Concept: Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)**
  - **Why needed here:** Paradigm shift from optimizing likelihood function to training neural network on synthetic data for "amortized" inference.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is CNN approach described as "amortized inference" compared to per-sample optimization of MLE?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Generator (R scripts with LatticeKrig/extRemes) → Preprocessor (standardization) → Neural Estimator (CNN) → UQ Layer (Quantile Regression)
- **Critical path:** Simulation-to-training pipeline; correctly generating GEV innovations and applying SAR matrix B is single point of failure.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Fixed 16×16 window allows processing large domains via tiling and reduces computational load but limits receptive field; increasing replications improves accuracy but increases inference time; simple CNN architecture trades potential capacity for speed and reduced overfitting risk.
- **Failure signatures:** Low coverage (below 95%), bias in extreme estimates (systematic underestimation/overestimation of ξ), tile edge effects (discontinuities between adjacent tiles).
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Validation run: reproduce simulation study by generating 1,000 test configurations and evaluating trained CNN to verify reported bias reduction as replication size increases; 2) Ablation on input size: test network robustness on different window sizes (8×8 vs 32×32) to understand sensitivity of κ² to field of view; 3) Real data sanity check: apply to NA-CORDEX and verify higher estimated ξ values in Gulf Coast/Pacific West vs central US.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can covariate effects be robustly integrated and estimated within GEV-SAR model for spatial extremes?
  - **Basis in paper:** Authors state iterative backfitting approach is proposed but "more comprehensive analysis incorporating covariates is focus of our future work."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current analysis omits covariates for simplicity; proposed iterative method not implemented or validated.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstration of iterative estimation procedure on data with known covariates showing accurate recovery of regression coefficients alongside spatial parameters.

- **Open Question 2:** Can alternative architectures like transformers or normalizing flows improve flexibility over proposed CNN estimator?
  - **Basis in paper:** Conclusion explicitly notes plans to "explore alternative architectures, such as transformers and normalizing flows, for improved flexibility in modeling complex spatial dependencies."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current work relies solely on standard CNN which may have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative study benchmarking CNN against transformer-based models on same GEV-SAR simulations evaluating accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

- **Open Question 3:** How can framework be adapted to handle larger spatial domains without relying on fixed-size tiling?
  - **Basis in paper:** Authors acknowledge "use of CNNs imposes restrictions based on input shape, necessitating local likelihood estimation and defining moving tiles."
  - **Why unresolved:** Model requires fixed 16×16 input window forcing use of tiles which may introduce edge artifacts or lose global context.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of fully convolutional or resolution-agnostic architecture accepting variable input dimensions validated on full-domain spatial fields.

## Limitations
- Strong dependence on simulation framework fidelity; if training data generation doesn't accurately represent true spatial dependence, CNN learns incorrect mappings
- Fixed 16×16 window size may fail to capture long-range spatial dependence patterns, potentially biasing κ² estimates
- Quantile regression UQ approach showed coverage probabilities dropping to 80% in some regions during testing
- Method assumes stationarity within each tile which may not hold for real climate extremes with complex teleconnections

## Confidence

- SAR-GEV model correctly captures spatial dependence in extreme events: **Medium**
- CNN provides computationally efficient and accurate parameter estimation: **High**
- Quantile regression provides valid 95% confidence intervals: **Low-Medium**

## Next Checks

1. **Coverage validation on synthetic extremes**: Generate 10,000 synthetic fields spanning full parameter space and compute empirical coverage rates of 95% CI; compare performance across replication sizes (r=1, 10, 30) to identify regimes where UQ breaks down.

2. **Long-range dependence sensitivity**: Test model on synthetic fields with known long-range spatial dependence (e.g., larger basis function support or non-local SAR structures); evaluate whether κ² estimates systematically underestimate dependence when long-range patterns exist.

3. **Real-data cross-validation**: Apply model to multiple independent climate datasets (e.g., ERA5, different CORDEX domains); verify spatial patterns of estimated parameters (ξ, κ², τ²) are physically consistent and reproducible across datasets, particularly for known extreme-prone regions like Gulf Coast.
