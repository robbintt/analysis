# Unsupervised Learning and Representation of Mandarin Tonal Categories by a Generative CNN

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.17859
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17859
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Generative CNN can learn Mandarin tonal categories without labeled data, with male-only models showing clearest acquisition patterns

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that a generative CNN (ciwGAN) can learn Mandarin Chinese tonal categories without explicit labeling. The model was trained on the Tone Perfect dataset using three conditions: all speakers, males only, and females only. The male-only model successfully encoded all four tonal categories in its categorical variables with statistically significant F0 trajectory differences, achieving an adjusted R² of 0.12. The results show that generative models can acquire tonal contrasts through unsupervised learning and replicate stages of human tonal acquisition, with tonal representations encoded in intermediate convolutional layers rather than earlier ones.

## Method Summary
The study employed a conditional information-weighted GAN (ciwGAN) architecture trained on the Tone Perfect dataset of Mandarin Chinese monosyllables. Three separate models were trained: one on all speakers, one on males only, and one on females only. The ciwGAN architecture used categorical variables to control generated outputs, allowing analysis of how tonal information was encoded. The models were evaluated by examining whether categorical variables consistently mapped to Mandarin's four tonal categories (high level T1, rising T2, dipping T3, and falling T4), analyzing F0 trajectories, and measuring statistical significance of differences. Convolutional layer activations were extracted and correlated with output F0 to determine where tonal information was encoded within the network.

## Key Results
- Male-only model consistently encoded all four tonal categories with statistically significant F0 differences
- Whole-set model partially learned tonal contrasts, acquiring analogues to falling T4 and high level T1
- Female-set model did not consistently map categorical variables to tonal categories
- Tonal representations were encoded in intermediate layers (Conv3 and Conv4) with Pearson correlations of r=0.26 and r=0.078 respectively
- Adjusted R² of 0.12 approached naturalistic Mandarin data (R²=0.267)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ciwGAN architecture successfully learned tonal categories through its conditional generation framework, where categorical variables were manipulated to control output characteristics. The model discovered statistical regularities in F0 patterns across different tonal categories without explicit supervision. The male-only model's superior performance suggests that consistent phonetic patterns within speaker groups facilitate unsupervised learning. The encoding of tonal information in intermediate convolutional layers indicates that the model developed hierarchical representations, with early layers processing basic acoustic features and later layers integrating these into tonal categories.

## Foundational Learning
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Deep learning framework with generator and discriminator networks competing to produce realistic data; needed to create synthetic speech that captures tonal patterns without labels
- **Mandarin tonal system:** Four contrastive pitch patterns (T1-T4) that distinguish lexical meaning; needed as target categories the model must discover
- **F0 trajectory analysis:** Statistical examination of fundamental frequency patterns over time; needed to verify that generated outputs match naturalistic tonal contours
- **ciwGAN architecture:** Conditional information-weighted GAN variant that allows categorical control of outputs; needed to test whether model learns discrete tonal categories
- **Convolutional neural networks:** Layered architectures that extract hierarchical features from input data; needed to understand where tonal information is encoded

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Raw audio -> Convolutional layers (Conv1, Conv2, Conv3, Conv4) -> Latent space with categorical variables -> Generator output
**Critical Path:** Audio input -> Convolutional feature extraction -> Latent representation encoding -> Categorical variable manipulation -> Generated output synthesis
**Design Tradeoffs:** Unsupervised learning sacrifices some accuracy for eliminating need for labeled data; ciwGAN chosen over standard GAN for categorical control; convolutional layers preferred over recurrent for local feature extraction
**Failure Signatures:** Inconsistent categorical variable mapping to tonal categories (female model); low R² values indicating incomplete tonal representation; failure to encode tonal information in intermediate layers
**3 First Experiments:**
1. Manipulate individual categorical variables and analyze resulting F0 trajectories for systematic changes
2. Compare activation patterns across convolutional layers to identify where tonal information emerges
3. Test model on held-out speakers to assess generalization beyond training data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper raises questions about the model's generalizability across different tonal systems and recording conditions. It questions whether similar architectures can learn tonal categories in other tonal languages such as Vietnamese, Thai, or Cantonese. The differential performance between male and female models prompts investigation into whether this reflects genuine phonetic differences or limitations in model architecture or training data.

## Limitations
- Results limited to one dataset (Tone Perfect) with clean studio recordings, reducing external validity
- Female-only model failed to consistently encode tonal categories, raising questions about gender-specific patterns or model limitations
- Adjusted R² of 0.12 still represents substantial unexplained variance compared to naturalistic data (0.267)

## Confidence
- Tonal categories can be learned unsupervised: **Medium** - Male model shows clear evidence, but inconsistent results in other conditions
- Intermediate layers encode tonal information: **High** - Multiple correlation analyses support this finding
- Results replicate human tonal acquisition stages: **Low** - This theoretical claim extends beyond direct empirical evidence

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on spontaneous speech datasets with varied recording conditions and background noise
2. Evaluate whether similar architectures can learn tonal categories in other tonal languages (Vietnamese, Thai, Cantonese)
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine whether gender-specific phonetic patterns or model architecture caused the differential performance between male and female models
