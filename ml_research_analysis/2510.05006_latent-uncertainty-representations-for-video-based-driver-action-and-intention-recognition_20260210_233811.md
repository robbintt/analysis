# Latent Uncertainty Representations for Video-based Driver Action and Intention Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.05006
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05006
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Latent Uncertainty Representations (LUR) and Repulsively Trained LUR (RLUR) match top OOD detection performance while being more efficient to train and easier to tune than MCMC-based alternatives.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Latent Uncertainty Representations (LUR) and Repulsively Trained LUR (RLUR) for uncertainty estimation in video-based driver action and intention recognition. The method extends pre-trained deep neural networks with transformation layers to generate multiple latent representations for uncertainty estimation. LUR is evaluated against eight probabilistic deep learning methods across four video datasets, showing comparable in-distribution classification performance while achieving top-tier out-of-distribution detection. The approach is more computationally efficient than MCMC-based alternatives and requires less hyperparameter tuning.

## Method Summary
The method extends a pre-trained video encoder (VideoMAE) with randomly initialized linear transformation layers that produce multiple latent representations. Both the original and transformed representations are passed through a shared classification layer, with the loss being the sum of prediction losses for all representations. The transformation layers are trained to capture diverse aspects of the latent space, enabling uncertainty estimation. The approach is evaluated on four video datasets (AIDE, Brain4Cars, ROAD, NuScenes) for classification performance, calibration, and OOD detection using metrics including Accuracy, F1, ACE, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC.

## Key Results
- LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution classification performance to other probabilistic methods
- For OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing approaches while being more efficient to train
- LUR is easier to tune than methods requiring MCMC sampling or repulsive training procedures
- The authors contribute 28,000 frame-level action labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LUR works by generating multiple diverse latent representations through transformation layers, which capture different aspects of the input uncertainty. By training these transformations alongside the original representation, the model learns to identify when inputs deviate from the training distribution based on the consistency (or lack thereof) across representations. The approach leverages the pre-trained encoder's ability to extract meaningful features while the transformation layers provide the variability needed for uncertainty estimation.

## Foundational Learning
- **VideoMAE architecture**: Pre-trained video encoder based on Vision Transformer, why needed for extracting spatiotemporal features from video inputs, quick check: verify input shape compatibility (16 frames × 224×224)
- **Transformation layers**: Linear layers that map latent representations to new spaces, why needed to generate diverse representations for uncertainty estimation, quick check: monitor layer outputs for diversity
- **OOD detection metrics**: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, FPR95 for evaluating out-of-distribution performance, why needed to assess model reliability on unseen data, quick check: ensure correct calculation of true/false positive rates
- **AdamW optimizer**: Weight decay variant of Adam, why needed for stable training with regularization, quick check: verify weight decay parameter (0.05) is correctly implemented
- **Early stopping**: Training stops after 5 epochs without validation improvement, why needed to prevent overfitting and reduce training time, quick check: confirm patience parameter is set correctly
- **Calibration metrics**: ACE (expected calibration error) for measuring confidence reliability, why needed to ensure predicted probabilities reflect true likelihoods, quick check: verify proper binning for ECE calculation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Video input → VideoMAE encoder → Latent representation z → [Original path + N transformation layers] → Shared classification head → Output predictions

**Critical Path:**
Video frames → VideoMAE (finetuned) → Latent space → Transformation layers → Classification head → Predictions

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Linear vs non-linear transformation layers (linear chosen for efficiency)
- Number of transformation layers N (impacts diversity vs computational cost)
- Fine-tuning encoder vs freezing (finetuning chosen for better adaptation)
- Weight decay strength (0.05 balances regularization and learning)

**Failure Signatures:**
- Transformation collapse: All transformation layers output nearly identical representations
- Poor OOD performance on small datasets (high variance across seeds)
- Calibration degradation when encoder features are not task-aligned
- Overfitting when training encoder and transformations simultaneously without sufficient regularization

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Verify LUR produces diverse transformation layer outputs by checking variance across representations
2. Compare single vs multiple transformation layers for OOD detection performance
3. Test different numbers of transformation layers (N=2,4,8) to find optimal balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can deeper or non-linear transformation layers yield better uncertainty estimates than the linear layers currently implemented?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state future work should investigate "the effects of deeper or alternative transformation layers to produce additional latent representations."
- Why unresolved: The current study restricted the transformation layers to simple fully connected linear layers to minimize computational overhead.
- Evidence: Benchmarking classification and OOD detection performance of LUR using non-linear layers (e.g., MLPs) versus the linear baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust are LUR methods to real-world data corruptions such as adverse weather, lighting changes, or sensor blur?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest "future research could evaluate the robustness of LUR or last layer PDL approaches under such corruptions."
- Why unresolved: The current experiments focus on semantic OOD detection (maneuvers excluded from training) rather than covariate shifts caused by environmental noise.
- Evidence: Evaluation using corruption benchmarks (e.g., nuScenes-C) to measure shifts in predictive entropy and calibration under input perturbations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does adding a reconstruction term to the loss function improve the quality of the latent uncertainty representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion proposes extending "the loss function with a reconstruction term, as in [78]."
- Why unresolved: The current training objective relies solely on the prediction loss for the transformation layers, without explicitly enforcing reconstruction capabilities.
- Evidence: Comparison of model calibration (ACE) and OOD detection rates (PR-AUC) for models trained with and without a reconstruction objective.

## Limitations
- Results show high variance on smaller datasets (ROAD), suggesting sensitivity to initialization
- Classification performance improvements over baselines are modest and not always statistically significant
- Method may fail when pre-trained encoder's latent space is not sufficiently rich for the downstream task
- Paper does not address computational efficiency claims with rigorous wall-clock time comparisons

## Confidence
- **LUR achieves comparable classification performance**: High
- **LUR matches top OOD detection performance**: Medium (high variance on small datasets)
- **LUR is more efficient than MCMC methods**: Medium (efficiency claim plausible but not rigorously quantified)
- **LUR is easier to tune than MCMC methods**: High

## Next Checks
1. Run LUR with multiple random seeds (at least 5) on the ROAD dataset to quantify variance and assess stability
2. Profile training time per epoch for LUR vs MCMC methods to empirically validate the efficiency claim
3. Test LUR on a dataset where the pre-trained encoder is not well-aligned with the target task to assess robustness to poor feature representations
