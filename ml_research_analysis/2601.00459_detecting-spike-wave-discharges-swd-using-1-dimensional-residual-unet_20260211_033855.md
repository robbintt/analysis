# Detecting Spike Wave Discharges (SWD) using 1-dimensional Residual UNet

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.00459
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00459
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AugUNet1D achieves F1-score of 0.90 vs 0.69 for Twin Peaks algorithm

## Executive Summary
Automated detection of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in EEG recordings is critical for absence epilepsy research but remains challenging due to inter-subject variability. This study compares 15 machine learning classifiers for SWD detection in C3H/HeJ mice, finding that a 1D residual U-Net architecture performs best. The proposed AugUNet1D model incorporates data augmentation (amplitude scaling, Gaussian noise, signal inversion) during training, achieving superior cross-subject generalization. AugUNet1D outperforms a recently published time-and frequency-based algorithm called "Twin Peaks," demonstrating higher F1-scores (0.90 vs 0.69) and detecting events with features more similar to manually labeled SWDs. The model maintains robust performance during sleep periods where other methods fail and achieves strong results even when trained on only 25% of available data.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates 15 machine learning classifiers for SWD detection in EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice. The proposed AugUNet1D model uses a 1D residual U-Net architecture with skip connections and incorporates data augmentation including amplitude scaling, Gaussian noise, and signal inversion during training. The model processes single-channel EEG resampled to 100Hz, segmented into 20-second epochs with point-wise labels. Training uses Dice loss with Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-3) and cosine annealing schedule, with early stopping on validation loss. Cross-subject validation is performed on held-out mice not used in training.

## Key Results
- AugUNet1D achieves F1-score of 0.90 versus 0.69 for Twin Peaks algorithm
- Model trained on 25% of data achieves F1 of 0.854, demonstrating efficiency
- AugUNet1D maintains robust performance during sleep periods where other methods fail
- Amplitude scaling augmentation alone produces dramatic improvement (F1 0.86 vs 0.43 without augmentation)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Skip Connections Preserve Temporal Precision for Dense Segmentation
The encoder-decoder structure with skip connections enables point-wise temporal labeling without losing fine-grained event boundaries. The encoder progressively downsamples input to capture hierarchical temporal features; the decoder upsamples to recover temporal resolution. Skip connections bridge corresponding encoder-decoder layers, merging high-level semantic context with low-level temporal detail. This yields per-sample predictions rather than coarse event blocks. Core assumption: SWD boundaries require sample-level precision, and downsampling does not irreversibly destroy edge information recoverable via skip pathways.

### Mechanism 2: Residual Connections Enable Stable Gradient Flow in Deep Temporal Networks
Residual connections within each encoding/decoding block allow deeper networks to train without vanishing gradients. Shortcut connections provide identity pathways for gradient propagation during backpropagation, bypassing successive nonlinear transformations. This stabilizes optimization and permits deeper feature hierarchies. Core assumption: Deeper representations improve SWD detection and the optimization landscape permits convergence given sufficient gradient signal.

### Mechanism 3: Amplitude Scaling Augmentation Addresses Inter-Subject Variability
Random amplitude scaling during training is the primary driver of cross-subject generalization. EEG amplitude varies across subjects due to electrode impedance, skull thickness, and amplifier gain. Scaling augmentation (multiplying signals by random factors drawn from a uniform distribution) forces the model to learn amplitude-invariant features rather than overfitting to absolute magnitude thresholds. Core assumption: SWD detection depends on relative waveform morphology rather than absolute voltage levels, and scaling does not distort diagnostic features.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dense Temporal Segmentation vs. Chunked Classification
  - Why needed here: AugUNet1D labels every time point (sample-level) rather than classifying pre-segmented epochs. This differs from chunked approaches that lose boundary precision.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why predicting a label for each of 2000 samples per 20-second epoch yields better event boundaries than classifying the entire 20-second window?

- Concept: Dice Loss for Class-Imbalanced Segmentation
  - Why needed here: SWDs comprise at most 5% of the dataset. Dice loss optimizes for overlap between predicted and true regions rather than treating each sample independently, reducing bias toward the majority (non-seizure) class.
  - Quick check question: Why would standard cross-entropy loss tend toward predicting "non-seizure" for most time points in this dataset?

- Concept: Cross-Subject Generalization via Augmentation
  - Why needed here: Models trained on one set of subjects often fail on new subjects due to variability in signal characteristics. Augmentation simulates variability during training.
  - Quick check question: If you trained only on Mouse 1-8 without augmentation, what would you expect to happen when testing on Mouse 9-10?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: EEG signal -> Resample to 100Hz -> Min-max normalization -> 20-second epochs (2000 samples) -> 1D residual U-Net -> Per-sample binary classification

- Critical path:
  1. Data loading → resampling to 100Hz → min-max normalization
  2. Augmentation pipeline (scaling p=0.5, noise max SNR=0.005, inversion p=0.2)
  3. Forward pass through residual 1D U-Net
  4. Dice loss computation between predicted and ground-truth masks
  5. Backpropagation with early stopping (patience=10 epochs)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Augmentation probability: p=0.1-0.4 yields higher precision but lower recall; p=0.5 balances both (F1=0.884)
  - Training data fraction: 25% of data achieves F1=0.854; 90% achieves F1=0.862—diminishing returns beyond 50%
  - Precision vs. recall: Without augmentation, precision=0.95 but recall=0.28; adding scaling trades some precision for substantially higher recall

- Failure signatures:
  - Model predicts all zeros: Check class balance, verify Dice loss implementation, ensure labels are correctly aligned
  - High variance across subjects: Increase scaling augmentation probability, verify holdout set separation
  - False positives during sleep: Twin Peaks shows this pattern; AugUNet1D should not—verify model is not learning from spectral power alone
  - Training fails to converge: Check residual connections are properly implemented, verify gradient flow through skip connections

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce ablation: Train AugUNet1D with no augmentation, then with only scaling (p=0.5). Confirm F1 jumps from ~0.43 to ~0.86. This validates the scaling mechanism.
  2. Cross-subject holdout test: Train on mice 1-8, test on mice 9-10. Compute per-mouse F1 scores to verify generalization (target: 0.87-0.93 range per subject).
  3. Sleep epoch analysis: Isolate predictions during sleep periods. Compare false positive rate of AugUNet1D vs. Twin Peaks (paper reports 0.18 vs 0.46 proportion of events during sleep).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can AugUNet1D effectively detect non-SWD EEG events (e.g., sleep spindles, interictal spikes) without architectural modification?
- Does training on more diverse subject populations overcome the performance plateau observed when simply increasing data quantity?
- Is AugUNet1D transferable to human EEG data for clinical absence epilepsy monitoring?
- Are transformer-based detection models fundamentally unsuited for dense temporal segmentation of EEG?

## Limitations
- The exact 1D residual U-Net architecture details (layer depths, filter counts, residual block structure) are not specified in the paper text
- Cross-subject generalization results are based on a single mouse strain (C3H/HeJ), limiting generalizability to other strains or species
- The ablation analysis cannot isolate the contribution of skip connections versus residual connections within blocks

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core finding that AugUNet1D outperforms Twin Peaks in cross-subject generalization (F1 0.90 vs 0.69) is well-supported by the ablation study and cross-validation results
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism explanation for skip connections preserving temporal precision is logical but relies on architectural assumptions not fully detailed in the paper
- **Medium Confidence**: The residual connections' role in enabling deeper networks is plausible but lacks direct empirical validation beyond performance improvements

## Next Checks
1. Implement the exact 1D residual U-Net architecture from the GitHub repository and verify that it achieves comparable F1-scores (target: 0.85-0.90) on the test set
2. Systematically vary the amplitude scaling range (e.g., U(0.3,1.7) vs U(0.5,1.5)) and evaluate the impact on cross-subject generalization F1-scores to confirm the mechanism
3. Train and test AugUNet1D on EEG data from a different mouse strain or species to assess whether the model's strong performance generalizes beyond C3H/HeJ mice
