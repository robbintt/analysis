# Stability as a Liability:Systematic Breakdown of Linguistic Structure in LLMs
## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18588

- Key outcome: Training stability under MLE induces mode collapse and repetitive outputs by minimizing forward KL divergence to empirical distribution

## Executive Summary
This work reveals that training stability, typically viewed as essential for reliable optimization, can paradoxically induce systematic degradation of generative quality in large language models. Under maximum likelihood estimation with stabilized training dynamics, models converge to solutions that minimize forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, implicitly reducing generative entropy and concentrating probability mass on a limited subset of observed data modes. This stability-induced mode collapse manifests as repetitive, low-entropy outputs despite smooth loss convergence. Empirical validation using a feedback-based training framework across architectures and random seeds demonstrates a deterministic relationship between stabilization intensity and mode concentration, with extreme stabilization leading to complete collapse (100% high-frequency word proportion). The results show that optimization stability and generative expressivity are fundamentally misaligned, challenging the assumption that stability alone indicates model quality.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a feedback-based training framework that systematically varies stabilization intensity while monitoring output entropy and mode coverage. The framework trains models under maximum likelihood estimation while adjusting optimization parameters to control stability levels. Across different architectures and random seeds, the method measures generative quality through metrics including high-frequency word proportion and output diversity. The experimental design isolates the effect of stability on generative expressivity by maintaining consistent data and model architectures while varying only the stabilization parameters.

## Key Results
- Training stability under MLE leads to systematic reduction in generative entropy
- Mode collapse occurs as models minimize forward KL divergence to empirical distribution
- Extreme stabilization produces complete output collapse (100% high-frequency word proportion)
- Stability and generative expressivity are fundamentally misaligned objectives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The phenomenon occurs because stabilized training under maximum likelihood estimation drives models to minimize forward KL divergence to the empirical data distribution. This optimization objective implicitly favors solutions that concentrate probability mass on high-frequency modes while suppressing low-probability regions. As stabilization increases, the training process becomes more conservative, avoiding exploration of less frequent but potentially important modes. The mathematical framework shows that minimizing forward KL divergence creates a bias toward mode-seeking behavior, where the model learns to reproduce only the most common patterns in the training data. This mechanism explains why smooth loss convergence can coexist with degraded generative quality - the optimization has found a local minimum that satisfies the stability objective but fails to capture the full diversity of the data distribution.

## Foundational Learning
**KL Divergence and Mode Collapse**: Understanding how forward KL divergence minimization leads to mode-seeking behavior - needed to grasp why stability induces collapse; quick check: derive the mode-seeking property from KL divergence definition
**Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: How MLE training relates to KL divergence minimization - needed to connect standard training objectives to observed behavior; quick check: prove that MLE optimizes forward KL divergence
**Generative Entropy**: The relationship between output diversity and entropy metrics - needed to quantify the degradation in generative quality; quick check: compute entropy for different output distributions
**Optimization Stability**: Tradeoffs between training stability and exploration - needed to understand how stabilization parameters affect learning dynamics; quick check: analyze how learning rate affects stability-exploration balance
**Empirical Data Distribution**: Characteristics of real-world data that make it multimodal - needed to appreciate why mode collapse is problematic; quick check: visualize mode structure in typical language datasets
**Feedback-based Training**: Methods for systematically varying training parameters - needed to understand experimental methodology; quick check: design a simple feedback loop for parameter control

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Data Distribution -> MLE Training -> Stability Control -> Output Generation -> Quality Metrics
Critical Path: MLE objective optimization -> Stability parameter adjustment -> Mode collapse emergence -> Quality degradation
Design Tradeoffs: Stability vs. diversity, convergence speed vs. exploration, training efficiency vs. output quality
Failure Signatures: Repetitive outputs, high-frequency word dominance, reduced entropy, mode concentration
First Experiments:
1. Replicate stability-mode collapse relationship using standard training protocols
2. Test alternative objectives (adversarial, entropy regularization) for maintaining stability with diversity
3. Evaluate downstream task performance on collapsed models to measure practical impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Deterministic relationship between stabilization and collapse may not generalize beyond feedback-based framework
- Extreme stabilization conditions may not reflect typical training scenarios
- Practical impact on deployed systems requires further validation

## Confidence
High: Empirical demonstration of reduced generative entropy under stabilized training is well-supported
Medium: Claim of fundamental tradeoff depends on generalization beyond experimental conditions
Low: Implication for current practices lacks evidence from real-world deployment scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the stability-mode collapse relationship using standard training protocols without the feedback-based framework to isolate the effect from potential experimental artifacts.
2. Test whether alternative training objectives (e.g., adversarial training, minimum entropy regularization) can maintain stability while preserving generative diversity, providing evidence for or against the claimed fundamental tradeoff.
3. Evaluate model outputs from the collapsed regimes on downstream tasks to quantify the practical impact of stability-induced degradation on task performance and user experience.
