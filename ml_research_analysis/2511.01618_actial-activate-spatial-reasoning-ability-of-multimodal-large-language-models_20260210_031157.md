# Actial: Activate Spatial Reasoning Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01618
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01618
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces Viewpoint Learning task and Viewpoint-100K dataset to activate spatial reasoning in MLLMs, achieving 99.2% accuracy on viewpoint tasks

## Executive Summary
Actial addresses the challenge of activating spatial reasoning abilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for complex 3D tasks. The authors introduce Viewpoint Learning, a task designed to evaluate and improve spatial reasoning by teaching MLLMs to understand 3D consistency across multiple views. They present the Viewpoint-100K dataset containing 100K object-centric image pairs with corresponding questions and answers. Their two-stage fine-tuning approach first injects foundational knowledge through Supervised Fine-Tuning on Viewpoint-100K, then enhances generalization through Reinforcement Learning using GRPO on a broader spatial dataset.

## Method Summary
The authors propose Actial, a method for enhancing spatial reasoning in MLLMs through viewpoint learning. The approach consists of two main components: the Viewpoint-100K dataset containing 100K object-centric image pairs with questions and answers, and a two-stage fine-tuning strategy. The first stage uses Supervised Fine-Tuning to inject foundational knowledge about 3D consistency across multiple views. The second stage employs Reinforcement Learning with GRPO on a broader spatial dataset to enhance generalization. This combination aims to improve the model's ability to understand spatial relationships and 3D structures from different viewpoints.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99.2% accuracy on the viewpoint task
- Demonstrated significant improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain spatial reasoning tasks
- Comprehensive performance gains across multiple benchmarks for spatial reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly training models to understand 3D consistency across multiple viewpoints, which is a fundamental aspect of spatial reasoning. The two-stage approach first establishes a strong foundation of viewpoint understanding through supervised learning, then refines this capability through reinforcement learning that encourages generalization to broader spatial contexts. This progressive training strategy helps the model develop robust spatial reasoning capabilities that transfer across different tasks and scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- Viewpoint consistency: Understanding that objects maintain their 3D structure across different viewing angles is fundamental to spatial reasoning
  - Why needed: Without this understanding, models cannot correctly interpret spatial relationships between objects
  - Quick check: Verify model can identify the same object across different viewpoints with high accuracy

- Multi-view spatial relationships: The ability to infer spatial relationships between objects from different viewing angles
  - Why needed: Real-world spatial reasoning requires understanding how objects relate to each other in 3D space
  - Quick check: Test model's ability to correctly answer questions about relative positions of objects in different views

- 3D structure inference: Extracting 3D structural information from 2D images
  - Why needed: MLLMs primarily operate on 2D inputs but need to reason about 3D space
  - Quick check: Evaluate model's ability to predict occluded parts of objects based on visible portions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Base MLLM -> SFT Stage (Viewpoint-100K) -> RL Stage (GRPO) -> Enhanced Spatial Reasoning Model

Critical Path:
Input images → Feature extraction → Spatial reasoning module → Output prediction
The spatial reasoning module is the critical component that determines overall performance

Design Tradeoffs:
- Dataset size vs. quality: 100K pairs provide extensive training but may introduce bias
- Supervised learning vs. reinforcement learning: SFT provides stable initial learning, while RL enables generalization
- Computational cost vs. performance: Two-stage training increases computational requirements but improves results

Failure Signatures:
- Overfitting to specific viewpoints or object types in the training data
- Inability to generalize to novel viewing angles or object configurations
- Confusion between similar-looking objects when viewed from different perspectives

First Experiments:
1. Baseline accuracy on viewpoint consistency task before any training
2. Performance comparison between SFT-only and two-stage (SFT+RL) approaches
3. Ablation study removing GRPO stage to quantify its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions.

## Limitations
- The Viewpoint-100K dataset may contain inherent biases that aren't fully characterized
- Evaluation focuses primarily on accuracy metrics without exploring computational efficiency or inference speed
- The model's ability to reason about spatial relationships in dynamic or interactive 3D environments isn't investigated

## Confidence
The major claims about Actial's effectiveness receive a Medium confidence rating. While the reported accuracy of 99.2% on the viewpoint task and improvements across multiple benchmarks are impressive, the paper lacks detailed analysis of potential overfitting to the Viewpoint-100K dataset. The reinforcement learning stage using GRPO may have led to optimizations that don't generalize well to truly unseen scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic ablation study removing the RL stage to quantify its specific contribution to performance improvements, and compare against alternative fine-tuning strategies to establish whether the two-stage approach is truly optimal.

2. Perform extensive out-of-distribution testing using objects, viewing angles, and environmental conditions not represented in the Viewpoint-100K dataset to validate the claimed generalization capabilities and identify potential failure modes.

3. Implement qualitative error analysis by examining model predictions on challenging viewpoint pairs where spatial reasoning is ambiguous, documenting specific types of reasoning errors and their frequency to better understand the model's limitations in spatial cognition.
