# Probing Preference Representations: A Multi-Dimensional Evaluation and Analysis Method for Reward Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.12464
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12464
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: MRMBench achieves up to +5.2 win rate points improvement over baselines by providing detailed performance information across six preference dimensions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MRMBench, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark for reward models that addresses the limitations of existing pairwise ranking evaluation methods. Current evaluation approaches only provide overall ranking performance without insight into which preference dimensions reward models actually capture. MRMBench evaluates reward models across six dimensions: harmlessness, helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, revealing that existing models struggle to capture multiple dimensions simultaneously. The authors demonstrate strong correlation between MRMBench performance and LLM alignment outcomes, with up to +5.2 win rate points improvement over baselines.

## Method Summary
The authors construct MRMBench by creating probing tasks for each of six preference dimensions, moving beyond traditional pairwise ranking evaluation that only measures overall performance. They introduce an inference-time probing method to analyze which preference dimensions reward models rely upon during prediction. The benchmark is evaluated across four representative reward models, revealing dimension-specific weaknesses and the inability of current models to capture multiple preference dimensions effectively. The evaluation framework includes correlation analysis with LLM alignment performance and investigation of dimension-specific optimization potential.

## Key Results
- MRMBench correlates strongly with LLM alignment performance, achieving up to +5.2 win rate points improvement over baselines
- Reward models struggle to capture multiple preference dimensions simultaneously, showing dimension-specific weaknesses
- Helpfulness and correctness dimensions show strongest correlation with alignment performance, while complexity and verbosity show weaker correlations
- The inference-time probing method successfully identifies which preference dimensions reward models rely upon during prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MRMBench works by decomposing preference learning into interpretable dimensions, allowing researchers to identify specific weaknesses in reward models rather than treating them as black boxes. By evaluating across multiple dimensions, the benchmark reveals that current reward models optimize for certain preferences at the expense of others. The inference-time probing method provides insight into the internal representations used during prediction, showing how reward models actually process different preference types. This multi-dimensional approach enables targeted improvements through multi-objective optimization, addressing the fundamental limitation that single-dimensional evaluation masks important performance differences across preference types.

## Foundational Learning
- **Preference Learning**: The process of training models to predict human preferences, needed to understand what reward models are optimizing for; quick check: can the model distinguish between high and low preference pairs
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Optimization across multiple, potentially competing objectives; needed to address the limitation that reward models struggle with multiple dimensions; quick check: can performance on all dimensions be improved simultaneously
- **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical methods to measure relationships between variables; needed to validate MRMBench's connection to real alignment performance; quick check: do higher MRMBench scores predict better alignment win rates
- **Inference-Time Probing**: Analyzing model behavior during prediction rather than just outputs; needed to understand which dimensions models actually use; quick check: does probing reveal dimension-specific patterns
- **LLM Alignment**: The process of aligning large language models with human preferences; needed as the practical target that MRMBench aims to predict; quick check: does MRMBench score correlate with human preference alignment
- **Pairwise Ranking**: Traditional evaluation method comparing two responses; needed as the baseline that MRMBench improves upon; quick check: does MRMBench provide more granular information than pairwise ranking

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
MRMBench Generator -> Probing Task Constructor -> Inference-Time Prober -> Correlation Analyzer -> Multi-Objective Optimizer

**Critical Path:**
1. Construct probing tasks for each dimension
2. Evaluate reward models on all dimensions
3. Apply inference-time probing to analyze dimension usage
4. Measure correlation with alignment performance
5. Identify optimization opportunities through multi-objective analysis

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The main tradeoff is between evaluation granularity and practical implementation complexity. MRMBench provides detailed dimension-specific insights but requires more sophisticated evaluation infrastructure than simple pairwise ranking. The probing method adds analytical depth but increases evaluation time and computational requirements.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Low correlation between MRMBench scores and alignment performance indicates the benchmark may not capture relevant preference dimensions
- Uniform performance across dimensions suggests the probing tasks may not be discriminative enough
- Inconsistent inference-time probing results indicate potential issues with the probing methodology or reward model architecture

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate a baseline reward model on MRMBench to establish dimension-specific performance profiles
2. Apply inference-time probing to identify which dimensions the model relies upon most heavily
3. Measure correlation between MRMBench scores and alignment win rates to validate benchmark effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Correlation between MRMBench performance and alignment is strongest for helpfulness and correctness, weaker for complexity and verbosity
- Experiments based on only four reward models, limiting generalizability of findings
- Reliance on carefully constructed preference instances may not capture full complexity of real-world preference learning
- Unclear extent to which multi-dimensional evaluation translates to improved practical alignment outcomes

## Confidence

**High**: Strong correlation between MRMBench performance and LLM alignment win rates; clear observation of dimension-specific weaknesses in existing reward models

**Medium**: Claims about multi-objective optimization addressing limitations; generalizability of probing results across different reward model architectures

**Low**: Extent to which MRMBench captures all relevant dimensions of human preference; practical impact of dimension-specific weaknesses on real-world alignment

## Next Checks
1. Test MRMBench's predictive power across a broader range of reward models and alignment objectives beyond the current four models
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine which preference dimensions most strongly influence alignment performance
3. Evaluate whether dimension-specific fine-tuning or multi-objective optimization strategies can systematically improve reward model performance across all six dimensions
