# Scalable and Interpretable Scientific Discovery via Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SVGP KAN)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00260
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00260
- Authors: Y. Sungtaek Ju
- Reference count: 10
- Proposes SVGP-KAN method for scalable uncertainty quantification and interpretability in scientific datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Sparse Variational GP-KAN (SVGP-KAN), a novel architecture that combines sparse variational inference with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network topology to enable scalable scientific discovery. The method addresses the computational limitations of traditional GP-KAN approaches by employing inducing points, reducing complexity from O(N³) to O(NM²) or O(BM²) per mini-batch. SVGP-KAN maintains uncertainty quantification through analytic moment matching while achieving interpretability through feature selection and functional relationship classification.

## Method Summary
SVGP-KAN integrates sparse variational inference with KAN architecture by modeling univariate edge functions as independent Gaussian Processes and using inducing points for computational efficiency. The method employs analytic moment matching to propagate uncertainty through layers while maintaining closed-form layer means and variances. This approach enables scalable uncertainty quantification and interpretability for large scientific datasets, with complexity reduction achieved through variational inference techniques that approximate the full GP with a sparse representation.

## Key Results
- Correctly identified relevant features and learned appropriate functional forms on synthetic dataset with periodic, linear, and noise features
- Demonstrated uncertainty quantification during extrapolation in 2D surface reconstruction task
- Achieved mean Test RMSE of 0.36 ± 0.05 and 100% selection rate for true features on Friedman #1 benchmark with 10 features (5 relevant, 5 noise) across 5 trials

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SVGP-KAN works by combining the interpretability of KAN architecture with the uncertainty quantification of Gaussian Processes through sparse variational inference. The independent GP priors on edge functions allow for uncertainty propagation while the inducing points dramatically reduce computational complexity. Analytic moment matching enables closed-form computation of layer statistics, maintaining tractability even as uncertainty flows through multiple layers.

## Foundational Learning
- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks**: Multi-layer architecture representing multivariate functions as compositions of univariate functions; needed for interpretable function approximation
  - Quick check: Verify each layer represents univariate transformations correctly
- **Sparse Variational Inference**: Approximation technique using inducing points to reduce GP computational complexity; needed for scalability
  - Quick check: Confirm inducing point count M << N in practical implementations
- **Analytic Moment Matching**: Technique for propagating Gaussian distributions through non-linear transformations; needed for uncertainty quantification
  - Quick check: Validate closed-form layer mean and variance calculations
- **Permutation Importance**: Feature importance measurement through random permutation; needed for interpretability
  - Quick check: Test that feature importance scores correlate with ground truth relevance
- **Lengthscale Analysis**: GP hyperparameter indicating functional smoothness; needed for relationship classification
  - Quick check: Verify learned lengthscales distinguish between different functional types

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input -> GP Edge Functions -> Moment Matching -> Output Layer -> Uncertainty Quantification
**Critical Path**: Data flows through GP edge functions, undergoes moment matching at each layer, with inducing points enabling efficient computation throughout
**Design Tradeoffs**: Independent GP priors enable computational efficiency but may limit correlation modeling; inducing point count balances accuracy vs. scalability
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance with highly correlated edge functions; uncertainty underestimation with insufficient inducing points; interpretability issues with complex functional relationships
**First Experiments**:
1. Test on synthetic dataset with known functional relationships to verify interpretability claims
2. Evaluate uncertainty quantification on extrapolation tasks beyond training distribution
3. Benchmark computational scaling with varying inducing point counts and dataset sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational complexity improvement depends on maintaining small inducing point count M, which may become challenging for very large datasets
- Independent GP priors may limit ability to capture correlated behaviors across different edges in highly structured datasets
- Interpretability claims require validation on real-world scientific datasets where ground truth functional relationships are unknown

## Confidence
- High: Computational framework and variational inference approach are technically sound with clear mathematical foundations
- Medium: Interpretability claims and functional relationship identification supported by synthetic experiments but need real-world validation
- Low: Scalability claims for extremely large datasets and effectiveness of independent GP priors for complex correlations not thoroughly tested

## Next Checks
1. Apply SVGP-KAN to real-world scientific dataset with known physical relationships (e.g., climate or materials science data) to validate interpretability beyond synthetic experiments
2. Systematically evaluate trade-off between inducing point count M and model performance on datasets of increasing size to characterize practical scalability limits
3. Compare SVGP-KAN's uncertainty quantification against established Bayesian methods (e.g., MC dropout, ensemble methods) on benchmark regression tasks to validate uncertainty estimate quality
