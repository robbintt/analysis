# Deep Learning for Unrelated-Machines Scheduling: Handling Variable Dimensions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19527
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19527
- Authors: Diego Hitzges; Guillaume Sagnol
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Achieves 2.51% optimality gap on small instances and generalizes to 100-job problems, outperforming dispatching rules by 22.22%

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel deep learning approach for unrelated-machines scheduling problems where processing times vary across job-machine pairs. The proposed architecture handles the inherent variability in both input dimensions (different numbers of jobs and machines) and output dimensions (different numbers of assigned jobs). Using a sophisticated combination of bidirectional LSTMs, transformer encoders, and action-pointer decoders, the model learns to schedule jobs offline across entire environments rather than sequentially. Trained on small instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, the network achieves near-optimal performance with only 2.51% above optimal cost while demonstrating remarkable generalization to much larger problems with up to 100 jobs and 10 machines.

## Method Summary
The authors tackle unrelated-machines scheduling by developing a deep learning architecture that processes entire scheduling environments offline. The approach combines sequential embedding through bidirectional LSTMs, transformer encoders for capturing inter-job context, and an action-pointer decoder to handle variable-sized outputs. The model is trained using supervised learning on optimal solutions from small problem instances (8 jobs, 4 machines) and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to larger instances. The architecture is specifically designed to handle the variable dimensions characteristic of scheduling problems, where both the number of jobs and the number of assignments can change between instances.

## Key Results
- Achieves only 2.51% cost above optimal solutions on small instances (8 jobs, 4 machines)
- Successfully generalizes to larger problems (up to 100 jobs, 10 machines) despite being trained only on small instances
- Outperforms advanced dispatching rules by 22.22% on average across all tested configurations
- Demonstrates strong adaptability with fast retraining capabilities for different problem settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's success stems from its ability to handle the fundamental variability in unrelated-machines scheduling problems. By combining NLP-inspired architectures with scheduling-specific components, the network can process variable-sized inputs and outputs while maintaining context awareness across jobs. The bidirectional LSTM embedding captures sequential job characteristics, while the transformer encoder establishes inter-job relationships. The action-pointer decoder then generates variable-length assignment sequences, making the architecture well-suited for the unpredictable nature of real-world scheduling environments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bidirectional LSTMs**: Needed to capture both forward and backward sequential dependencies in job characteristics; quick check: verify gradient flow through both directions during training
- **Transformer Encoders**: Essential for establishing context between different jobs; quick check: monitor attention weight distributions to ensure meaningful inter-job relationships
- **Action-Pointer Decoders**: Required to handle variable-length output sequences for job assignments; quick check: validate pointer accuracy on known optimal solutions
- **Supervised Learning from Optimal Solutions**: Enables learning near-optimal policies; quick check: measure training loss convergence and optimality gap reduction
- **Variable Input/Output Handling**: Critical for real-world scheduling where problem sizes vary; quick check: test on instances with different job and machine counts

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Features -> Bidirectional LSTM Embedding -> Transformer Encoder -> Action-Pointer Decoder -> Job Assignments

**Critical Path**: The sequence from job feature embedding through transformer context establishment to final job assignment generation represents the critical path for producing schedules. The bidirectional LSTM must effectively encode job characteristics, the transformer must establish meaningful relationships between jobs, and the pointer decoder must accurately select job assignments.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture trades computational complexity for generalization capability, using sophisticated NLP components to handle variable dimensions rather than simpler fixed-size approaches. This increases model capacity and adaptability but requires more training data and computational resources. The offline processing approach sacrifices real-time responsiveness for potentially better global solutions.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on larger instances despite good small-instance results would indicate overfitting or scaling issues. Inconsistent attention patterns in the transformer could suggest inadequate context establishment between jobs. High variance in pointer decoder outputs might indicate instability in the assignment selection process.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate bidirectional LSTM embedding quality by comparing job similarity metrics before and after embedding
2. Test transformer attention patterns to ensure meaningful job-job relationships are being established
3. Benchmark pointer decoder accuracy on small instances with known optimal solutions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited systematic validation of performance degradation as instance size increases from 8 to 100 jobs
- Optimality gap measurement only validated on small instances, with unknown scaling behavior
- Comparison limited to a single baseline dispatching rule rather than comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art heuristics
- Reliance on optimal solutions for supervised learning raises questions about scalability of training data generation

## Confidence
- Generalization claims: Medium confidence due to limited systematic scaling analysis
- Small-instance performance: High confidence from extensive evaluation on small problems
- Baseline comparison: Medium confidence due to limited number of comparison methods

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic experiments measuring optimality gap growth as instance size increases from 8 to 100 jobs
2. Benchmark against additional state-of-the-art scheduling heuristics to verify the claimed 22.22% improvement
3. Test the model's performance when trained on near-optimal rather than optimal solutions to assess robustness
