# SPACT18: Spiking Human Action Recognition Benchmark Dataset with Complementary RGB and Thermal Modalities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.16151
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16151
- Reference count: 40
- First video action recognition dataset captured using spike camera alongside RGB and thermal modalities

## Executive Summary
SPACT18 introduces the first comprehensive benchmark dataset for spiking video action recognition, featuring synchronized RGB, thermal, and spiking camera captures of 18 daily actions across 44 subjects. The dataset operates at ultra-high temporal resolution (20,000 Hz) with spike cameras while maintaining complementary RGB (60 FPS) and thermal imaging. A novel compression algorithm reduces spiking data latency from 100k to 10k and 1k time steps while preserving temporal information. The dataset establishes a new foundation for research in spiking neural networks, multimodal fusion, and energy-efficient video understanding.

## Method Summary
The SPACT18 dataset was captured using synchronized spike, RGB, and thermal cameras in controlled indoor and outdoor environments. Spike cameras operate at 20,000 Hz temporal resolution, while RGB captures at 60 FPS and thermal provides synchronized imaging. A custom compression algorithm processes the high-frequency spiking data, reducing time steps while maintaining action recognition performance. The dataset includes 3,168 videos with standardized preprocessing including normalization, augmentation, and temporal alignment across modalities. Experimental evaluation employs state-of-the-art lightweight models including X3D and UniFormer for comparative analysis across different compression ratios and modality combinations.

## Key Results
- Thermal data outperforms RGB and spiking modalities, achieving 85.7% accuracy with UniFormer
- Spiking data compressed to 10k time steps matches RGB performance, but extreme compression (1k) degrades accuracy significantly
- Direct SNN training remains challenging with accuracy below 60%, while ANN-SNN conversion shows high latency trade-offs
- Hybrid ANN-SNN models improve performance but lack energy efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its unique combination of ultra-high temporal resolution spike cameras with complementary RGB and thermal modalities. The spike cameras capture fine-grained temporal dynamics at 20,000 Hz, enabling precise motion trajectory analysis that conventional cameras cannot achieve. The thermal modality provides robust performance under varying lighting conditions, while RGB offers standard visual information. The proposed compression algorithm preserves critical temporal information during the reduction from 100k to 10k time steps, maintaining action recognition accuracy while enabling practical processing.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spike Camera Technology**: Event-based cameras that capture temporal changes rather than intensity frames. Needed for understanding the dataset's unique temporal characteristics and why it differs from conventional video datasets.
- **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**: Brain-inspired neural networks that process temporal spike data directly. Quick check: Verify understanding of temporal coding versus rate coding in SNNs.
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Integration of complementary data sources (RGB, thermal, spiking) for enhanced recognition. Quick check: Assess fusion strategies like early, late, and hybrid fusion methods.
- **Temporal Data Compression**: Algorithms that reduce data volume while preserving essential temporal information. Quick check: Evaluate trade-offs between compression ratio and information loss.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Spike Camera -> Compression Algorithm -> SNN/ANN -> Action Recognition -> Output
- **Critical Path**: Data Acquisition → Preprocessing → Compression → Model Inference → Classification
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Ultra-high temporal resolution vs. computational efficiency, modality complementarity vs. fusion complexity, direct SNN training vs. ANN-SNN conversion
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor SNN performance indicates training algorithm limitations, compression artifacts cause recognition errors, modality misalignment degrades fusion accuracy
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test compression algorithm with varying ratios on benchmark spike datasets, 2) Implement baseline SNN training on compressed spike data, 3) Evaluate unimodal performance comparison across all three modalities
