# T2I-Diff: fMRI Signal Generation via Time-Frequency Image Transform and Classifier-Free Denoising Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.20822
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20822
- **Reference count**: 30
- **Primary result**: T2I-Diff achieves 66.87±3.22% classification accuracy at 1× augmentation for brain disorder classification using generated fMRI signals

## Executive Summary
T2I-Diff introduces an innovative framework for generating functional MRI (fMRI) signals using classifier-free denoising diffusion models combined with time-frequency image transforms. The method converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via time-dependent Fourier transform, generates class-conditioned frequency spectrograms using diffusion models, and then reverts them back to BOLD signals through inverse Fourier transforms. This approach effectively captures both temporal dynamics and spectral evolution of fMRI signals while avoiding the need for additional classifiers. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance across multiple evaluation metrics compared to state-of-the-art time-series generative models.

## Method Summary
The T2I-Diff framework operates by transforming fMRI BOLD signals into time-frequency representations through windowed spectrograms using time-dependent Fourier transforms. These spectrograms serve as inputs to a classifier-free denoising diffusion model that learns to generate class-conditioned frequency representations. The generated spectrograms are then converted back to time-domain BOLD signals through inverse Fourier transforms. This approach leverages the strengths of diffusion models in capturing complex distributions while the time-frequency transformation provides a structured representation that preserves both temporal and spectral characteristics of brain activity patterns.

## Key Results
- Achieved classification accuracy of 66.87±3.22% at 1× augmentation setting for brain disorder classification
- Demonstrated competitive performance across context-FID, correlation, discriminative, and predictive metrics compared to state-of-the-art time-series generative models
- Successfully generated fMRI signals that maintain structural and functional patterns necessary for downstream classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by converting the complex spatiotemporal nature of fMRI signals into a more tractable time-frequency representation that preserves essential information while being amenable to diffusion model generation. The classifier-free approach eliminates the need for separate classification models, reducing complexity and potential error propagation. The time-dependent Fourier transform captures both local and global temporal patterns, while the diffusion model learns the joint distribution of frequency patterns conditioned on class labels, enabling generation of physiologically plausible brain activity patterns.

## Foundational Learning

**Time-Frequency Analysis**
*Why needed*: fMRI signals contain both temporal dynamics and frequency characteristics that need to be captured for realistic generation
*Quick check*: Verify that spectrogram representations preserve essential signal features across different brain regions

**Classifier-Free Denoising Diffusion**
*Why needed*: Enables conditional generation without requiring separate classifier models, simplifying the architecture
*Quick check*: Assess generation quality across different noise levels and sampling steps

**BOLD Signal Characteristics**
*Why needed*: Understanding the specific properties of blood-oxygen-level dependent signals is crucial for realistic generation
*Quick check*: Validate that generated signals exhibit expected hemodynamic response patterns

**Class-Conditioned Generation**
*Why needed*: Medical applications require the ability to generate signals corresponding to specific conditions or diagnoses
*Quick check*: Evaluate class-conditional generation quality across different disease states

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
fMRI BOLD signals -> Time-Dependent Fourier Transform -> Spectrogram Representation -> Classifier-Free Diffusion Model -> Generated Spectrogram -> Inverse Fourier Transform -> Generated BOLD signals

**Critical Path**
The most critical sequence is: BOLD signal transformation → spectrogram generation → diffusion model generation → inverse transformation. Each step must maintain signal integrity to ensure realistic output.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The method trades direct time-series generation for the more structured spectrogram approach, which simplifies the generation task but may lose some fine-grained temporal information. The classifier-free approach reduces complexity but may limit the strength of class conditioning compared to classifier-guided methods.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor spectrogram generation would manifest as unrealistic frequency patterns or loss of temporal coherence. Issues in the inverse transform could produce signals with incorrect timing or amplitude characteristics. Insufficient class conditioning would result in generated signals that don't differentiate well between conditions.

**First Experiments**
1. Test spectrogram generation quality on held-out data before attempting full BOLD signal reconstruction
2. Evaluate the impact of different window sizes in the time-dependent Fourier transform on generation quality
3. Compare classifier-free generation against classifier-guided approaches for the same dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Relatively modest sample size (250 healthy controls and 227 MDD patients) may limit generalizability across different populations and acquisition protocols
- Time-frequency transformation may introduce artifacts or lose fine-grained temporal information during spectrogram conversion
- Limited assessment of functional plausibility of generated BOLD signals in capturing true neural dynamics

## Confidence

**Methodology innovation and framework design**: High
**Experimental results and comparisons**: Medium
**Generalizability to other fMRI datasets and disorders**: Low
**Biological plausibility of generated signals**: Low

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on independent fMRI datasets from different MRI scanners and acquisition protocols to assess robustness and generalizability
2. Conduct qualitative evaluation by expert neuroscientists to assess whether generated BOLD signals exhibit realistic spatiotemporal patterns and functional connectivity
3. Evaluate the impact of varying augmentation levels (beyond 1×) on downstream classification performance to identify optimal augmentation strategies for different clinical applications
