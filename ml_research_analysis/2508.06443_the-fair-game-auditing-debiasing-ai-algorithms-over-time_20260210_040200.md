# The Fair Game: Auditing & Debiasing AI Algorithms Over Time

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.06443
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06443
- **Authors:** Debabrota Basu; Udvas Das
- **Reference count:** 36
- **Primary result:** Introduces "Fair Game," a dynamic framework that audits and debiases AI algorithms over time by leveraging reinforcement learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces "Fair Game," a dynamic framework that audits and debiases AI algorithms over time by leveraging reinforcement learning. It addresses the limitations of static fairness measures in machine learning, which often fail to adapt to evolving societal norms and dynamic environments. The framework integrates an auditor and a debiasing algorithm in a loop around an ML model, enabling continual adaptation. The auditor provides feedback on bias, and the debiasing algorithm uses this to adjust the model's predictions iteratively. Key properties include data frugality, manipulation proofness, adaptability, structured feedback, and stable equilibrium. The approach is demonstrated using a recruitment prediction model, highlighting its potential to ensure fairness in dynamic, real-world applications. The paper emphasizes the need for a legal and technical framework to support such dynamic auditing and debiasing systems.

## Method Summary
The Fair Game framework employs a reinforcement learning-based approach to dynamically audit and debias AI algorithms. It consists of three main components: an ML model, an auditor, and a debiasing algorithm. The auditor evaluates the model's predictions for bias and provides structured feedback, which the debiasing algorithm uses to iteratively adjust the model's outputs. This feedback loop ensures continuous adaptation to changing environments and societal norms. The framework is designed to be data frugal, manipulation-proof, and capable of maintaining stable equilibrium while ensuring fairness. The approach is validated using a recruitment prediction model, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Key Results
- Introduces a dynamic framework for auditing and debiasing AI algorithms using reinforcement learning.
- Demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in a recruitment prediction model.
- Highlights the need for a legal and technical framework to support dynamic auditing and debiasing systems.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Fair Game framework works by creating a continuous feedback loop between an auditor and a debiasing algorithm, both of which interact with an ML model. The auditor evaluates the model's predictions for bias and provides structured feedback, which the debiasing algorithm uses to iteratively adjust the model's outputs. This process ensures that the model adapts to evolving societal norms and dynamic environments, addressing the limitations of static fairness measures. The framework's reinforcement learning-based approach enables it to learn and improve over time, making it effective in maintaining fairness in real-world applications.
