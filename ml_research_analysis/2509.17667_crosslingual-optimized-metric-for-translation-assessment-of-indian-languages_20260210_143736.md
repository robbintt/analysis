# Crosslingual Optimized Metric for Translation Assessment of Indian Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.17667
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17667
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Achieved 0.54 Kendall's Tau correlation, a 25% improvement over existing models for Indian language translation assessment

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces COMTAIL, a large-scale human evaluation dataset and trained neural metrics for translation quality assessment of Indian languages. The dataset contains 219,939 items across 21 translation directions covering 13 Indian languages. The study demonstrates that neural metrics trained on specialized Indian language data can substantially improve translation quality assessment, achieving a 25% performance gain over existing state-of-the-art models. The work addresses the scarcity of evaluation data for Indian languages and provides insights into data volume requirements, domain robustness, and language family effects through extensive ablation experiments.

## Method Summary
The authors created COMTAIL by collecting human evaluations for 13 Indian languages using Direct Assessment (DA) and Source-based Quality Metric (SQM) scoring scales. They implemented rigorous quality control by administering Reading Comprehension tests to filter raters, followed by consistency and discernment tests to ensure rating reliability. The neural metrics were trained using the COMET architecture with XLM-RoBERTa as the encoder, fine-tuned on the normalized human scores. The models were evaluated using Kendall's Tau correlation against human judgments, with both reference-based (DA) and reference-less (QE) variants tested. Additional experiments explored LLM-based evaluation approaches using Llama-3.1-8B.

## Key Results
- Best variant achieved 0.54 Kendall's Tau correlation, representing 25% improvement over existing models
- QE models outperformed DA models (0.54 vs 0.53) when references were of poor quality
- Data volume significantly impacts performance, with diminishing returns after certain thresholds
- Cross-lingual transfer showed directional asymmetry between Hindi and Urdu models
- LLM-based approaches showed promise but require more computational resources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuning multilingual encoders on specialized Indian language data aligns model embeddings with human quality judgments more effectively than generic multilingual training. The COMET architecture uses XLM-RoBERTa to generate embeddings, which are then processed by a feed-forward regressor trained on human-assigned DA+SQM scores. This allows the model to learn to weight semantic and syntactic errors specific to Indian languages that generic metrics miss. The assumption is that XLM-RoBERTa has sufficient representational capacity for the 13 target Indian languages. Evidence includes the significant performance gains reported and related work confirming existing metrics are developed mostly for high-resource languages. The mechanism could break if the base encoder has seen insufficient pre-training data for extremely low-resource languages.

### Mechanism 2
Filtering human raters via source-language Reading Comprehension tests ensures higher-quality gold labels than crowd-sourcing alone. The authors administered RC tests to filter raters lacking bilingual proficiency, ensuring DA scores reflect true bilingual evaluation rather than monolingual fluency guesses. The assumption is that reading comprehension proficiency correlates with translation evaluation ability. Evidence includes the detailed QC process description and the fact that 84 raters failed the discernment test. The mechanism could fail if the RC test is too simple or domain-mismatched with the translation task.

### Mechanism 3
Reference-less Quality Estimation models can outperform reference-based metrics for low-resource languages when gold references are of poor quality. QE models ingest only the (source, hypothesis) pair, bypassing potentially noisy references common in low-resource settings. The assumption is that the model can infer semantic correctness and fluency from the source-hypothesis pair alone. Evidence includes QE models achieving higher correlation (0.54) than DA models (0.53). The mechanism could fail when source sentences are ambiguous or hypotheses contain hallucinated content semantically distant from the source.

## Foundational Learning

**Z-score Normalization & Min-Max Scaling**
- Why needed: Human ratings are subjective; standardizing by rater handles leniency/severity differences
- Quick check: Why is raw DA score (0-100) insufficient for training without normalization?

**Kendall's Tau (τ) Correlation**
- Why needed: Primary evaluation metric measuring ordinal association between model predictions and human judgments
- Quick check: Does high Kendall's Tau indicate exact score prediction or relative ranking of quality?

**Quality Control in Data Collection**
- Why needed: Understanding how consistency and discernment tests filter bad raters explains dataset reliability
- Quick check: What's the difference between failing the "Consistency Test" vs "Discernment Test"?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** (Source, Hypothesis, Reference) -> XLM-RoBERTa Encoder -> Mean Pooling -> Feed-Forward Network -> Kendall's Tau Score

**Critical path:** The data pipeline (raw ratings → Z-scores → Filtering → Min-Max scaling) dictates model performance more than architecture tweaks

**Design tradeoffs:**
- DA vs QE: DA usually better but relies on references; QE competitive when references are poor
- LLM vs Encoder: LLMs show promise but require more computational resources for fine-tuning

**Failure signatures:**
- Domain Shift: Correlation drops significantly between governance and health domains
- Low-Resource Saturation: Lower correlation on high-quality translation subsets
- Reference Noise: QE models can outperform DA when references are unreliable

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Implement Discernment Test on raw ratings to verify rater filtering (target ~14.6% failure rate)
2. Train COMET-DA model on only 10% of COMTAIL data to establish performance floor
3. Test baseline comet-wmt22-da on held-out COMTAIL test set to quantify Indian language gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** How does utilizing Indic-specific pre-trained encoders (e.g., IndicBERT) compare to XLM-RoBERTa for training translation evaluation metrics for Indian languages? The study exclusively used XLM-RoBERTa due to project constraints, leaving the potential performance gains of Indic-specific architectures untested.

**Open Question 2:** What linguistic or data quality factors drive the asymmetrical cross-transfer performance between Hindi and Urdu models? The authors observed directional bias that couldn't be definitively explained by current analysis.

**Open Question 3:** Can synthetic data augmentation and semantic perturbations improve metric robustness against specific error types like hallucinations or copy-source errors? The current metrics struggled with underrepresented error types in the human evaluation dataset.

## Limitations
- Assumes RC test performance correlates with translation evaluation ability without empirical validation
- Limited cross-domain evaluation (only governance and health domains tested)
- LLM evaluation experiments lack detailed prompt formatting and LoRA parameter specifications
- Does not analyze potential rater bias or cultural context effects across Indian languages

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Correlation results (0.54 τ) and data volume ablation studies are well-supported
**Medium Confidence:** QE vs DA performance explanation is plausible but needs additional error analysis
**Low Confidence:** LLM evaluation claims are based on limited experiments with unspecified configurations

## Next Checks

1. Conduct correlation study between Reading Comprehension test scores and actual translation evaluation performance to validate filtering mechanism
2. Perform cross-domain evaluation on additional domains (news, literature) to assess generalization beyond governance and health
3. Replicate LLM evaluation experiments with fully specified prompts, LoRA parameters, and temperature settings to verify performance gains
