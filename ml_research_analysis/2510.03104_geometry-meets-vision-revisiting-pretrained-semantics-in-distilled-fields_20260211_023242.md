# Geometry Meets Vision: Revisiting Pretrained Semantics in Distilled Fields

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.03104
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03104
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Visual-geometry features (VGGT) contain higher geometric fidelity but do not improve performance in distilled radiance fields compared to visual-only features (DINOv2/DINOv3) for robotics applications.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether geometry-grounded semantic features improve performance in distilled radiance fields for robotics applications. Through extensive experiments across three key tasks—semantic content analysis, object localization, and radiance field inversion—the authors find that while VGGT features contain higher geometric fidelity, they do not outperform visual-only DINO features in downstream tasks. The study introduces SPINE, a novel framework for radiance field inversion without initial guesses, which demonstrates superior performance but still favors DINO features over VGGT for pose estimation. These results suggest that visual-only semantic features offer greater versatility despite containing less geometric detail, highlighting the need for effective geometry-grounding strategies that preserve feature versatility.

## Method Summary
The method trains radiance fields (both Gaussian Splatting and NeRF) jointly with semantic fields that distill either visual-geometry (VGGT) or visual-only (DINOv2/DINOv3) features. A shared hashgrid encoding is used between VGGT and CLIP features, optimized with a loss combining RGB reconstruction, Frobenius norm, and cosine similarity. For pose estimation, SPINE uses a two-stage approach: first learning an inverse model pψ that maps semantic embeddings to pose distributions, then refining with photometric PnP using RANSAC. The evaluation spans nine scenes from LERF, 3D-OVS, and robotics datasets, with performance measured through GFF for semantic content, SSIM/PSNR/LPIPS for localization/inversion, and rotation/translation errors for pose estimation.

## Key Results
- VGGT features have higher Geometric Fidelity Factor (GFF) indicating more geometric edge content than DINO features
- VGGT and DINO features perform similarly in semantic object localization despite VGGT's higher structural detail
- VGGT features underperform DINO features in radiance field inversion pose estimation
- SPINE framework outperforms existing methods but still achieves better accuracy with DINO features than VGGT
- Visual-only semantic features demonstrate greater versatility for robotics applications despite lower geometric fidelity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Co-Supervised Semantic Field Distillation
Distilling both visual-geometry (VGGT) and language-aligned (CLIP) features into shared hashgrid encodings enables open-vocabulary queries while preserving spatial detail. The base semantics module (hashgrid encoding) is shared between fs (VGGT, ds=128) and fl (CLIP, dl=768/1024), with training minimizing L = Lr + Σ||If,c - Îf,c||²_F - Σ csim(If,c - Îf,c). Shared encodings force semantic embeddings to associate with the same visual and geometric features, enabling cross-modal queries.

### Mechanism 2: Geometric Fidelity Factor (GFF) as Edge-Retention Metric
VGGT features retain more geometric edge information than DINO features, quantified by GFF = ΣIe,sem / ΣIe,rgb (ratio of semantic edges to RGB edges). Higher GFF indicates more structural detail preserved, with VGGT achieving highest GFF at low thresholds (0.1-0.4) compared to DINO.

### Mechanism 3: SPINE Two-Stage Pose Estimation
Coarse semantic-to-pose regression followed by photometric PnP refinement enables initialization-free radiance field inversion. Stage 1 learns inverse model pψ: Rd → P mapping semantic embeddings to pose distributions. Stage 2 renders at coarse pose, matches features to rendered depth points, and solves PnP with RANSAC, with DINOv2 achieving lowest rotation/translation error.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gaussian Splatting vs. NeRF representations**: GS uses explicit ellipsoidal primitives with tile-based rasterization (faster), NeRFs use implicit MLPs with ray-marching (slower but more flexible). *Quick check*: Can you explain why GS enables easier depth estimation and mesh extraction than NeRFs?

- **PCA for semantic visualization**: PCA projects d-dimensional semantic features to 3D for visualization (Iv = Îf V[:,:3]). *Quick check*: What does it mean if the first 3 principal components capture most variance vs. very little variance?

- **SE(3) pose representation and so(3) parameterization**: SPINE parameterizes rotation in Lie algebra so(3) (3D vectors) to avoid SO(3) orthogonality constraints. *Quick check*: Why is exp: so(3) → SO(3) necessary after optimization, and what is the rotation error formula using trace?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Backbone extractor -> Semantic fields (fs, fl) sharing hashgrid encodings -> Radiance field (GS/NeRF) -> Inverse model pψ -> PnP refinement

- **Critical path**: 1) Pre-extract semantic embeddings for all training images (VGGT/DINO/CLIP) 2) Train radiance field + semantic fields jointly (30k iterations) 3) Train inverse model pψ with detached gradients 4) For query image: extract embedding → pψ → coarse pose → render → PnP refine

- **Design tradeoffs**: VGGT has higher geometric detail but worse pose estimation; DINO has better versatility and pose accuracy but less spatial fidelity; GS is faster to train/render than NeRF; fully-supervised geometry grounding may impair feature versatility

- **Failure signatures**: Coarse pose too far from ground truth → PnP refinement diverges; GFF > 1.0 indicates semantic features may encode spurious edges; semantic relevancy score requires threshold tuning; hashgrid capacity insufficient → semantic quality degrades

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison: Train GS with DINOv2 features on LERF Teatime, visualize PCA projections and compute GFF at thresholds [0.1, 0.4] 2) Localization accuracy: Query 10 objects across 3 scenes, compute SSIM/PSNR/LPIPS between predicted relevancy masks and GroundingDINO+SAM2 ground truth 3) SPINE inversion test: Train inverse model, test on 100 held-out poses, report rotation error (degrees) and translation error (meters) for DINOv2 vs VGGT

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Self-supervised geometry-grounding**: Can self-supervised approaches preserve the versatility of pretrained features better than fully-supervised methods used by VGGT? The authors suggest this may be due to the fully-supervised approach degrading feature versatility.

- **Co-supervision strategies**: What strategies can effectively establish synergy between geometry-oriented and visual-oriented semantic features to improve both spatial fidelity and semantic localization accuracy? Current approaches lack principled co-supervision.

- **Feature versatility paradox**: Why does VGGT achieve lower pose estimation accuracy than DINOv2 despite containing richer spatial content (higher GFF)? The mechanism remains unexplained beyond speculation about feature versatility degradation.

- **Lightweight geometry-grounded models**: Can lightweight variants of geometry-grounded vision backbones achieve comparable performance while enabling real-time inference for robot manipulation tasks? Existing models require notable compute overhead.

## Limitations

- The counterintuitive finding that VGGT's higher geometric fidelity doesn't translate to better pose estimation lacks mechanistic explanation
- Feature performance depends heavily on threshold selection for GFF and semantic relevancy metrics
- Shared hashgrid encoding assumption lacks capacity analysis to determine if capacity constraints explain geometry-grounding limitations
- The study doesn't investigate which specific aspects of VGGT encoding cause versatility degradation

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: GFF metric validity and demonstration that VGGT features contain more geometric edges than DINO features
- **Medium confidence**: SPINE framework architecture and its superiority over existing methods
- **Low confidence**: The claim that geometry-grounding impairs feature versatility (observed empirically but lacks mechanistic explanation)

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on hashgrid capacity**: Train semantic fields with varying hashgrid resolutions (16³ vs 32³ vs 64³) to analyze how joint VGGT/CLIP training performance scales with capacity.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate pose estimation accuracy when training SPINE on LERF scenes and testing on robotics datasets (Office/Kitchen/Drone) to clarify whether VGGT's underperformance stems from scene-specific biases.

3. **Edge attribution analysis**: For VGGT features showing GFF > 1.0, perform visualization to determine whether semantic edges without RGB correspondence represent meaningful structural details or spurious artifacts.
