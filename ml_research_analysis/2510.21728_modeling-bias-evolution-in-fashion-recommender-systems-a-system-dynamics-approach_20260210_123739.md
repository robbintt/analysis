# Modeling Bias Evolution in Fashion Recommender Systems: A System Dynamics Approach

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.21728
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21728
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** System dynamics model reveals inductive biases amplify faster than user biases in fashion recommender systems, requiring more sophisticated debiasing strategies

## Executive Summary
This study develops a system dynamics model to capture the temporal evolution of bias in Fashion Recommender Systems (FRS). The nonlinear framework incorporates feedback loops among data biases, user interactions, and recommendation performance. Through simulation experiments, the model demonstrates that inductive biases have a stronger impact on system quality than user biases, and that current debiasing strategies like data rebalancing and algorithmic regularization are insufficient to fully mitigate bias amplification over time. The research underscores the need for enhanced mitigation strategies and broader system design incorporating contextual factors like user demographics and item diversity to promote fairness and inclusivity in recommendations.

## Method Summary
The study employs system dynamics methodology using VensimPLE software to model bias evolution in fashion recommender systems. The approach integrates stocks and flows representing system components (FRE, HCI, Performance, Distribution of Bias) with 43 nonlinear equations capturing feedback loops. The model simulates a 100-day window with a time step of 0.0078125 using Euler integration. Experiments include base simulation with all biases set to 1, sensitivity analysis varying inductive bias by 2× and 5×, and debiasing interventions. The framework relies on conceptual simulation parameters defined in Appendix B rather than real-world datasets.

## Key Results
- Inductive biases degrade system performance more severely than user biases in sensitivity experiments
- Current debiasing strategies (data rebalancing and algorithmic regularization) improve performance but fail to fully mitigate bias amplification
- Bias distribution shows exponential growth over time without intervention
- System quality deteriorates progressively when bias feedback loops remain unchecked

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model captures how biases propagate through interconnected feedback loops in recommender systems. Data biases influence user interactions, which in turn affect recommendation quality and further reinforce biased patterns. The system dynamics approach allows for temporal modeling of these nonlinear relationships, revealing how small initial biases can amplify over time through reinforcing loops.

## Foundational Learning
- **System Dynamics Modeling**: Required to understand stock-and-flow representations of complex adaptive systems. Quick check: Verify understanding of positive vs negative feedback loops in Figure 1.
- **Bias Types in Recommender Systems**: Essential to distinguish between inductive (algorithmic), popularity, and user biases. Quick check: Map each bias type to its corresponding equation in Appendix B.
- **VensimPLE Software**: Needed for implementing and simulating the stock-and-flow model. Quick check: Confirm ability to set TIME STEP and FINAL TIME parameters correctly.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: FRE (Fashion Recommender Engine) -> HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) -> Performance -> Distribution of Bias -> Skewed Patterns in Model
- **Critical Path**: User interactions → recommendation output → performance metric → bias distribution → system degradation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Conceptual simulation vs. real-world validation; complexity of 43 equations vs. model interpretability
- **Failure Signatures**: Simulation instability (oscillation), logic errors in feedback loops, incorrect distribution mapping
- **First Experiments**: 1) Recreate base simulation with all biases at 1, 2) Run sensitivity analysis with 2× inductive bias, 3) Implement debiasing intervention and measure performance recovery

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: Can the proposed system dynamics model accurately predict bias evolution when calibrated with real-world FRS clickstream logs? [explicit] The authors note the model is conceptual and requires calibration with real FRS data.
- **Open Question 2**: What is the precise functional relationship between data skewness and bias distribution over time? [explicit] The discussion emphasizes the need for further research into this relationship.
- **Open Question 3**: How does the inclusion of contextual factors, specifically user demographics and item diversity, quantitatively alter bias feedback loops? [explicit] The paper advocates for extending system boundaries to incorporate these factors.

## Limitations
- Relies on simulated rather than real-world data, constraining generalizability
- Exact implementation of statistical distributions from Table 1 into the model remains unclear
- Intervention magnitude for debiasing experiments is not explicitly stated
- 100-day simulation window may not capture long-term dynamics fully

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the theoretical framework and feedback loop structure
- **Medium confidence** in the simulation results due to unknown intervention parameters
- **Low confidence** in the real-world applicability without validation on actual FRS data

## Next Checks
1. Request clarification from authors on the exact intervention values used in Experiment 4
2. Verify the mechanism for mapping Table 1 statistical distributions into the RANDOM NORMAL function in Equation 33
3. Validate model predictions against real-world FRS performance metrics from public datasets
