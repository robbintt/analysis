# Leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generative LLMs For Automated Metadata Description Generation to Enhance Data Catalogs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.09003
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09003
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: Automated framework achieves 87-88% acceptance rate for generated metadata descriptions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an automated framework for generating metadata descriptions in data catalogs using retrieval-augmented generative LLMs. The approach addresses the challenge of incomplete metadata by leveraging existing catalog content through semantic retrieval and few-shot prompting. By enriching prompts with expanded abbreviations, similar column examples, and business glossaries, the framework guides LLM generation to produce high-quality, context-aware descriptions that reduce manual effort in metadata curation.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a retrieval-augmented approach where relevant context is first gathered from the data catalog through semantic similarity search. This context includes similar column examples, expanded abbreviations, and business glossary terms. The retrieved information is then used to construct rich prompts that provide the LLM with sufficient background to generate accurate and contextually appropriate metadata descriptions. The system was evaluated using both pretrained models (Llama2-13B, GPT3.5 Turbo) and fine-tuned models (Llama2-7B) on proprietary datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieved over 80% Rouge-1 F1 score for generated content quality
- 87-88% of generated metadata instances accepted as-is or requiring only minor edits by data stewards
- Framework significantly reduces manual effort in metadata curation while improving catalog searchability and usability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by combining the generative power of LLMs with targeted retrieval of relevant catalog context. By providing the model with similar examples, expanded terminology, and business definitions, the generated descriptions maintain consistency with existing catalog standards while accurately describing the data. The retrieval component ensures that the LLM has sufficient domain-specific information to produce contextually appropriate descriptions rather than generic or potentially inaccurate content.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**: Combines information retrieval with text generation to provide LLMs with relevant context
   - Why needed: Prevents hallucinations and ensures factual accuracy in generated content
   - Quick check: Verify retrieved documents are semantically relevant to the query

2. **Semantic search for metadata**: Uses vector embeddings to find similar columns and concepts in the catalog
   - Why needed: Identifies relevant examples and patterns from existing metadata
   - Quick check: Test similarity search with known related columns

3. **Few-shot prompting**: Provides the LLM with examples to guide generation style and content
   - Why needed: Ensures consistency with existing catalog standards
   - Quick check: Validate generated descriptions match example patterns

4. **Business glossary integration**: Incorporates domain-specific terminology and definitions
   - Why needed: Ensures technical accuracy and business relevance
   - Quick check: Confirm glossary terms are correctly used in generated descriptions

5. **Abbreviation expansion**: Expands shortened terms to improve clarity and searchability
   - Why needed: Makes metadata more accessible to diverse users
   - Quick check: Verify abbreviations are consistently expanded

6. **Metadata quality metrics**: Uses Rouge scores and acceptance rates to evaluate output
   - Why needed: Provides quantitative measures of generation quality
   - Quick check: Establish baseline metrics on test dataset

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data Catalog -> Semantic Retriever -> Context Aggregator -> Prompt Builder -> LLM Generator -> Quality Evaluator

**Critical path**: Semantic retrieval (finding similar columns and glossary terms) → Context aggregation (building comprehensive prompt) → LLM generation (producing description) → Quality evaluation (validation)

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework balances retrieval comprehensiveness with prompt efficiency. More context improves quality but increases token costs and potential for irrelevant information. The semantic search threshold and number of examples are key hyperparameters.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Low-quality retrieval returns irrelevant examples, leading to off-topic descriptions
- Over-reliance on abbreviations without expansion creates cryptic descriptions
- Insufficient business context results in technically accurate but business-meaningless descriptions
- Model hallucination when retrieved context is inadequate

**Three first experiments**:
1. Test semantic retrieval accuracy by measuring similarity between retrieved and ground truth related columns
2. Evaluate prompt effectiveness by comparing generated descriptions with and without business glossary context
3. Assess model performance across different data domains to identify domain-specific limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on proprietary datasets, limiting external validation and generalizability
- Absence of detailed error analysis makes it difficult to assess systematic failure modes
- Does not address potential biases in LLM-generated content or variations in output quality across different data domains

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Retrieval-augmented architecture and prompt engineering approach
**Medium confidence**: Reported performance metrics due to proprietary dataset constraints  
**Medium confidence**: Scalability claims without larger-scale testing across diverse data catalogs

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments on public benchmark datasets to verify generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing individual retrieval components to quantify their contribution
3. Implement long-term monitoring of generated metadata quality in production environments to assess drift and maintenance requirements
