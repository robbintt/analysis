# Synthetic Financial Data Generation for Enhanced Financial Modelling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.21791
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21791
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: TimeGAN outperforms ARIMA-GARCH and VAEs in generating realistic, temporally coherent synthetic financial data with strong downstream utility and privacy preservation.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a unified multi-criteria framework for evaluating synthetic financial data, comparing ARIMA-GARCH, VAEs, and TimeGAN using S&P 500 returns. The evaluation covers distributional fidelity (MMD, KS), temporal structure (ACF, volatility clustering), downstream utility (portfolio optimization, volatility forecasting), and privacy leakage (NNDT, MIA). TimeGAN achieves the lowest MMD (1.84×10⁻³), highest temporal coherence, and best downstream performance (portfolio Sharpe similarity 0.91, volatility forecasting RMSE 0.103), while VAEs produce smoothed trajectories underestimating extremes and ARIMA-GARCH offers interpretability but limited realism. TimeGAN also exhibits the strongest privacy (MIA accuracy 51.1%, NN distance 0.153). Results indicate that model selection should balance fidelity, interpretability, and computational cost, with TimeGAN best suited for high-fidelity applications.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three synthetic data generation methods—ARIMA-GARCH, VAEs, and TimeGAN—on S&P 500 daily returns (Jan 2000–Mar 2024). Returns are computed, stationarity-checked (ADF), and normalized. Data are split chronologically (70/15/15) and transformed into overlapping sequences (length 30, stride 1). VAEs use dense layers (64,32 latent dim 16, 32,64) with MSE+KL loss; TimeGAN employs 2-layer GRUs (hidden 24) with reconstruction, supervised, and adversarial losses; ARIMA-GARCH is selected via AIC and estimated by MLE. Models are trained (5 seeds) and synthetic data generated for comparison across MMD (Gaussian RBF), KS, ACF, volatility clustering, downstream portfolio optimization and volatility forecasting, and privacy (NNDT, MIA). TimeGAN is run on RTX 3090 for ~4.5 hours; VAE and ARIMA-GARCH are faster.

## Key Results
- TimeGAN achieves lowest MMD (1.84×10⁻³) and best temporal coherence.
- TimeGAN outperforms others in downstream tasks: Sharpe ratio similarity 0.91, volatility forecasting RMSE 0.103.
- VAEs underestimate extremes due to over-smoothing; ARIMA-GARCH lacks nonlinear realism.
- TimeGAN offers strongest privacy (MIA accuracy 51.1%, NN distance 0.153).

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
TimeGAN combines adversarial training (a generator-discriminator game pushing synthetic distribution toward real data) with a supervised temporal loss that explicitly aligns latent temporal embeddings with observed sequences. This dual objective jointly enforces realism and temporal structure, allowing recurrent networks to capture autocorrelation and volatility clustering. Core assumption: Financial returns exhibit nonlinear, time-dependent dynamics that cannot be fully captured by linear parametric models or static latent-variable generative models. Evidence: TimeGAN achieves lowest MMD (1.84e-3) and best temporal coherence; ablation shows MMD increases by ~61% without L_sup. Break condition: If supervised loss is removed, temporal coherence degrades significantly.

### Mechanism 2
VAEs tend to over-regularize and smooth out extreme financial events, underestimating kurtosis and volatility spikes. The ELBO objective includes a KL divergence term that encourages a smooth, well-regularized latent space. While this stabilizes training, it also suppresses high-frequency details and fat-tail behavior, leading to synthetic series that appear overly stable. Core assumption: The KL weight (β) is set to a default or moderate value; stronger regularization increases smoothing, while weaker regularization may cause instability or overfitting. Evidence: VAEs produce smooth trajectories that underestimate extreme events; kurtosis of synthetic data is lower than real. Break condition: If β is tuned too high (>2), smoothing intensifies; if too low (<0.5), reconstruction improves but regularization weakens, potentially increasing instability.

### Mechanism 3
ARIMA-GARCH provides interpretable parametric modeling but fails to capture nonlinear dependencies and regime shifts, limiting realism in complex market conditions. ARIMA models linear autocorrelation in the conditional mean, while GARCH models conditional heteroskedasticity (volatility clustering) via past squared residuals and lagged variances. The parametric structure ensures interpretability but cannot represent nonlinear interactions or structural breaks. Core assumption: Financial time series are adequately described by linear mean processes and GARCH volatility; any remaining structure is noise or can be ignored. Evidence: ARIMA-GARCH captures linear trends and conditional volatility but fails to reproduce nonlinear dynamics; MMD is higher than TimeGAN. Break condition: If data exhibit strong nonlinearities, leverage effects, or multiple regimes, ARIMA-GARCH will underfit, producing unrealistic synthetic trajectories.

## Foundational Learning

- **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**: Primary distributional fidelity metric; understanding it is essential to interpret how closely synthetic data matches real data. Quick check: If MMD between synthetic and real returns is near zero, what does that imply about their joint distributions?
- **Volatility clustering**: A core stylized fact in finance; models must preserve autocorrelation of squared returns to generate realistic synthetic series. Quick check: How would you visually confirm volatility clustering in a return series?
- **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) in VAEs**: Balances reconstruction accuracy and latent regularization; mis-tuning leads to smoothing or instability. Quick check: What happens to synthetic data quality if the KL term in ELBO dominates the reconstruction term?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: ARIMA(p,d,q) -> GARCH(p,q); Dense Encoder (64,32) -> Latent (16) -> Dense Decoder (32,64); Embedder (GRU) -> Generator (GRU) -> Supervisor (GRU) -> Discriminator (GRU)
- **Critical path**: Preprocess S&P 500 prices -> log-returns -> stationarity check -> normalization; Train each model on normalized log-returns (70/15/15 split); Generate synthetic sequences (length T=30) and evaluate across MMD, ACF, volatility clustering, downstream tasks, and privacy metrics.
- **Design tradeoffs**: TimeGAN: Highest fidelity and privacy but high compute (4.5 hrs) and hyperparameter sensitivity; VAE: Stable training and controllable latent space but smoothed extremes; ARIMA-GARCH: Interpretable and fast but limited to linear structures; higher privacy leakage risk.
- **Failure signatures**: TimeGAN: Mode collapse or instability if L_sup removed or network too shallow; manifested as repetitive or unrealistic sequences; VAE: Over-smoothed returns with low kurtosis; visible in QQ-plots and underestimated volatility spikes; ARIMA-GARCH: Poor tail matching and high MMD; PCA projections shifted relative to real data.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Replicate MMD comparison across all three models; verify TimeGAN achieves lowest MMD (~1.84×10⁻³); 2. Run ablation on TimeGAN: remove supervised loss and observe MMD increase; confirm importance of temporal alignment component; 3. Conduct downstream portfolio optimization on synthetic data from each model; compare Sharpe ratio and weight cosine similarity to real-data portfolio.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Does the proposed evaluation framework generalize to multi-asset settings where synthetic data must preserve cross-asset correlations and sector dependencies? Basis: Section 3.1.1 and Section 7.2 list "multi-asset data" as a necessary extension.
- Can sequential VAE architectures (e.g., VRNN, SRNN) bridge the performance gap with TimeGAN by mitigating the "over-smoothing" of extreme events? Basis: Section 7.1 notes the "Restricted VAE architecture" as a limitation, and Section 7.2 proposes assessing "sequential VAE architectures."
- Can hybrid models (e.g., GARCH-informed GANs) successfully resolve the "trilemma" between interpretability, realism, and computational efficiency? Basis: Section 7.2 lists "Hybrid model development" as future work to balance interpretability with nonlinear realism.
- What quantitative benchmarks are required to rigorously assess the variance and instability of TimeGAN across different seeds and training regimes? Basis: Section 7.2 calls for a "Formal stability benchmark" because the current analysis relied on qualitative observations.

## Limitations
- Single financial time series (S&P 500) may not generalize to other asset classes or markets.
- MIA shadow-model architecture and training details are not fully specified, limiting reproducibility.
- VAE smoothing mechanism is supported indirectly; more direct validation is needed.
- MMD metric's sensitivity to kernel bandwidth and interpretability of single-asset-based portfolio optimization are ambiguous.
- Assumption that linear models cannot capture regime shifts is not rigorously validated across diverse scenarios.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: TimeGAN achieves the best trade-off between realism and temporal coherence (consistently low MMD, high Sharpe similarity, strong privacy).
- **Medium confidence**: VAEs produce smooth trajectories that underestimate extreme events (direct support from results, indirect corpus validation).
- **Medium confidence**: ARIMA-GARCH models are interpretable but fail to capture nonlinear dependencies and regime shifts (supported by literature and distributional mismatches).

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a formal ablation study on TimeGAN to confirm that removal of the supervised temporal loss increases MMD by ~61% and degrades temporal coherence.
2. Perform a sensitivity analysis of VAE smoothing by varying β (KL regularization weight) and measuring changes in kurtosis and tail behavior of synthetic returns.
3. Replicate MMD comparisons using multiple bandwidth selection methods (e.g., median heuristic) to confirm robustness and rule out metric-induced artifacts.
