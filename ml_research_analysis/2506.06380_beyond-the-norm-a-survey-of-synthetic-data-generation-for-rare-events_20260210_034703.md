# Beyond the Norm: A Survey of Synthetic Data Generation for Rare Events

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.06380
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06380
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** First comprehensive survey specifically addressing synthetic data generation for rare extreme events across finance, climate, healthcare, and energy domains

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive overview specifically tailored to synthetic data generation for rare extreme events. Unlike general synthetic data generation focused on privacy preservation, this work systematically reviews techniques enhanced by statistical theory, large language models, and specialized training mechanisms designed to capture heavy-tailed distributions. The authors present a structured evaluation framework that organizes metrics across statistical similarity, dependence preservation, extreme coverage, visualization, and downstream task validation, providing actionable guidance for researchers and practitioners in this emerging field.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing research on generative modeling techniques for rare events by categorizing approaches based on their underlying statistical foundations and domain applications. The authors integrate statistical theory with modern generative approaches, including large language models and specialized training mechanisms, to create a comprehensive framework for understanding synthetic data generation in extreme event contexts. The methodology involves systematic review of existing literature across multiple domains including finance, climate science, healthcare, and energy, with particular attention to techniques that can effectively model heavy-tailed distributions characteristic of rare events.

## Key Results
- Establishes the first comprehensive survey specifically focused on synthetic data generation for rare extreme events, distinguishing it from privacy-preserving synthetic data approaches
- Presents a structured evaluation framework organizing metrics across statistical similarity, dependence preservation, extreme coverage, visualization, and downstream task validation
- Identifies underexplored research areas including behavioral finance, wildfires, and earthquakes while providing domain-specific adaptations for existing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's effectiveness stems from its systematic categorization of generative modeling techniques that specifically address the challenges of rare event simulation. By integrating statistical theory with modern generative approaches and providing domain-specific adaptations, the framework enables researchers to select appropriate methods based on the specific characteristics of the extreme events they need to model. The evaluation framework's multi-faceted approach ensures comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality across different aspects of extreme event representation.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Heavy-tailed distributions** - Why needed: Rare events typically follow heavy-tailed distributions where extreme values occur more frequently than normal distributions would predict
   Quick check: Verify that synthetic data exhibits appropriate tail behavior through statistical tests

2. **Statistical similarity metrics** - Why needed: Essential for validating that synthetic data preserves the distributional properties of real rare events
   Quick check: Compare empirical distributions and moments between real and synthetic data

3. **Dependence preservation** - Why needed: Rare events often exhibit complex temporal or spatial dependencies that must be captured
   Quick check: Validate autocorrelation structures and cross-correlation patterns

4. **Extreme coverage evaluation** - Why needed: Standard metrics may miss critical rare event characteristics
   Quick check: Assess coverage of extreme quantiles and rare event frequency

5. **Downstream task validation** - Why needed: Ultimate test of synthetic data utility is performance on real-world prediction tasks
   Quick check: Compare model performance using real versus synthetic data for rare event prediction

6. **Domain-specific adaptations** - Why needed: Different extreme event domains require tailored approaches and evaluation criteria
   Quick check: Validate framework applicability across diverse domains like finance and climate

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Collection -> Statistical Analysis -> Model Selection -> Training Enhancement -> Evaluation Framework -> Domain Adaptation

**Critical Path:** Statistical Analysis -> Model Selection -> Training Enhancement -> Evaluation Framework
The critical path involves identifying appropriate statistical properties of rare events, selecting generative models capable of capturing these properties, enhancing training procedures for extreme value representation, and validating results through comprehensive evaluation.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Generative model complexity vs. training data availability
- Evaluation metric comprehensiveness vs. computational efficiency
- Domain specificity vs. generalizability of approaches
- Statistical fidelity vs. practical utility for downstream tasks

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor tail behavior in synthetic data indicating inadequate model selection
- Failure to preserve temporal/spatial dependencies suggesting insufficient training enhancement
- Low performance on downstream tasks revealing evaluation framework gaps
- Domain-specific failures indicating need for better adaptation strategies

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Generate synthetic financial crisis data and validate tail behavior using statistical tests
2. Create synthetic climate extreme event data and evaluate temporal dependency preservation
3. Produce synthetic medical rare event data and test downstream prediction task performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The authors identify several underexplored areas requiring further research, including behavioral finance applications, wildfire modeling, and earthquake prediction. They also note that the effectiveness of their evaluation framework in real-world deployment scenarios requires empirical validation, and that metric applicability in extreme settings remains context-dependent with no universal protocol established.

## Limitations
- Metric applicability in extreme settings remains context-dependent with no universal evaluation protocol
- Framework effectiveness in real-world deployment requires further empirical validation
- Coverage of underexplored areas like behavioral finance and earthquakes is preliminary rather than exhaustive

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The survey successfully establishes the first comprehensive overview specifically tailored to extreme event modeling, with clear differentiation from general synthetic data generation approaches focused on privacy preservation

**Medium confidence:** The structured evaluation framework provides actionable guidance, but its universal applicability across all rare event domains requires further validation

**Medium confidence:** The identification of underexplored areas offers valuable research directions, though the depth of analysis in each area varies significantly

## Next Checks

1. Empirical validation of the proposed evaluation framework across multiple extreme event domains to test metric robustness and applicability
2. Implementation case studies demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in real-world rare event prediction scenarios, particularly in identified underexplored areas like behavioral finance and wildfire modeling
3. Comparative analysis of metric performance across different generative modeling techniques to establish which metrics best capture extreme event characteristics in various contexts
