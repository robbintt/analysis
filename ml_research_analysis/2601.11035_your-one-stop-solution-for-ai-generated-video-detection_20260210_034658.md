## Foundational Learning
- **Video Frame Sampling:** Extracting a consistent number of frames from videos (32 frames from first 128) ensures uniform input size for detectors. Why needed: Detectors require fixed-size inputs; Quick check: Verify frame extraction code preserves temporal order and frame quality.
- **Attribute-Balanced Prompt Selection:** Algorithm 1 ensures prompts cover diverse attributes to avoid bias in generated content. Why needed: Prevents detectors from overfitting to specific prompt patterns; Quick check: Analyze prompt distribution across selected videos.
- **Unified Compression:** Standardizing all videos to H.264 codec prevents compression artifacts from creating artificial detection cues. Why needed: Mixed codecs create spurious patterns detectors can exploit; Quick check: Compare detector performance on mixed vs. unified codecs.
- **Cross-Model Generalization:** Training detectors on one generator and testing on others evaluates real-world robustness. Why needed: Real-world deployment requires detecting unknown generation models; Quick check: Measure AUC drop when switching training/test generators.
- **VLM Prompt Engineering:** Crafting prompts that instruct VLMs to output binary classifications. Why needed: VLMs default to descriptive outputs, not classification; Quick check: Test prompt variations for "infinite loop" failures.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Data Generation -> Preprocessing (Frame Extraction, Resizing, Codec Standardization) -> Detector Training (I3D, DeCoF, UnivFD, VLMs) -> Evaluation (Cross-Model, Closed-Source)
- **Critical Path:** Prompt Selection (Algorithm 1) → Video Generation → Frame Extraction (32 frames, 256x256) → Unified H.264 Compression → Detector Training (50 epochs, 8 frames) → Cross-Model Evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Open-source models provide controllable generation for training but may not represent real-world threats as well as closed-source models, which are harder to evaluate due to unspecified generation parameters.
- **Failure Signatures:** High train accuracy but low test accuracy indicates overfitting to generation artifacts; VLM "infinite loops" suggest prompt format incompatibility with model architecture.
- **First Experiments:**
  1. Implement Algorithm 1 to select 20,000 balanced prompts and generate videos using Open-Sora v2.0.
  2. Train a simple I3D classifier on the Open-Sora subset (first 8 frames) and evaluate on held-out test sets.
  3. Test provided VLM prompt templates across multiple VLM versions to quantify performance variance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific characteristics define an "optimal" generative model for producing training data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Finding-2 states that training on higher-quality generative models (ranked by VBench) does not ensure better detector generalization. Analysis-2.2 further notes that "higher evaluation metrics... do not guarantee improved detection performance," leaving the actual determinants of training efficacy unidentified.
- Why unresolved: The authors establish that objective generation quality (e.g., aesthetic scores) does not correlate with training utility, but they do not isolate the specific artifacts or patterns that make a model suitable for training a detector.
- What evidence would resolve it: A correlation analysis between low-level generative artifacts (e.g., spectral fingerprints, temporal coherence errors) in the training data and the subsequent cross-model generalization performance of the detector.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can reconstruction-based detection methods maintain efficiency on large-scale benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 8 (Limitation) explicitly notes that "storage and time limitations led to the exclusion of certain approaches, such as reconstruction-based methods."
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates four detector paradigms but leaves the fifth paradigm (reconstruction-based, which is popular in image forensics) untested on this specific dataset due to the computational overhead of reconstructing 440,000 videos.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking a representative reconstruction-based detector (e.g., using diffusion reconstruction errors) on the AIGVDBench subset to measure the trade-off between computational cost and detection accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can Vision-Language Models (VLMs) be modified to overcome task confusion and "infinite loop" anomalies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Finding-1.2 states that current VLMs "lack reliable capability" and frequently suffer from specific failure modes like the "Dilemma" (ambiguous outputs) and "Infinite Loop" (repetitive generation).
- Why unresolved: The study identifies that standard zero-shot prompting fails, often causing the model to behave as if it is performing video captioning rather than binary classification, but it does not propose a solution to align the VLM's behavior with the detection task.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments utilizing instruction tuning or specific chain-of-thought prompts designed to stabilize VLM outputs and eliminate repetitive loops during the detection inference process.

## Limitations
- **Dataset Generation Transparency:** Exact prompt distributions and generation parameters for closed-source models remain underspecified, limiting exact reproduction of outputs.
- **Hyperparameter Specificity:** Exact training configurations (learning rates, batch sizes, optimizer settings) for the 33 evaluated detectors are not specified, though 50 epochs is mentioned.
- **VLM Prompt Template Stability:** Performance may vary with template modifications or model version updates, as templates "may require updates due to version changes."

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Benchmark construction methodology (Algorithm 1, H.264 standardization) is clearly specified and reproducible. Core findings about detection difficulty are well-supported.
- **Medium Confidence:** Evaluation results comparing 33 detectors are reliable within the controlled Open-Sora split, but real-world generalization may be limited by specific prompt distributions.
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about closed-source model evaluation are less certain due to unspecified prompt sources and generation parameters.

## Next Checks
1. **Compression Artifact Validation:** Reproduce the unified H.264 compression pipeline and verify that training on mixed codecs (MPEG-4 real / H.264 fake) produces artificially high AUC scores (~100), confirming the artifacts problem described in Section 7.6.
2. **Open-Source Model Reproduction:** Implement the attribute-balanced selection algorithm to generate 20,000 videos using Open-Sora v2.0 and a second open-source model (e.g., EasyAnimate), then train a simple detector (I3D or ResNet) to verify baseline performance metrics (e.g., I3D Open-Sora AUC ~100, cross-model generalization to EasyAnimate).
3. **VLM Prompt Template Testing:** Test the provided VLM prompt templates across multiple VLM versions to quantify performance variance and validate the claim that templates "may require updates due to version changes," particularly for models like Emu3-Stage1 that have known output format compliance issues.
