# TabReX : Tabular Referenceless eXplainable Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.15907
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15907
- **Reference count:** 32
- **Primary result:** Reference-less, property-driven evaluation framework for LLM-generated tables using knowledge graph alignment

## Executive Summary
TabReX addresses the challenge of evaluating generated tables without relying on reference tables, a critical gap in structured data generation. Existing methods either ignore structure or require fixed references, limiting generalization across domains. TabReX introduces a reference-less framework that converts text and tables into knowledge graphs, aligns them via LLM-guided matching, and computes interpretable scores. A new benchmark, TabReX-Bench, spans six domains and twelve perturbation types across three difficulty tiers. Results show TabReX achieves the highest correlation with expert rankings, remains stable under harder perturbations, and enables fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis.

## Method Summary
TabReX converts both source text and generated tables into canonical knowledge graphs using deterministic rules for tables and LLM-guided extraction for text. These graphs are aligned through a two-stage process: deterministic matching for exact schema-normalized pairs followed by LLM refinement for semantic paraphrases. The alignment produces Missing (MI) and Extra (EI) triplet counts, which feed into property-driven scoring combining TablePenalty (row/column level counts) and CellPenalty (cell-level counts plus normalized numeric deviations). Tunable weights (α, β) enable domain-adaptive sensitivity-specificity trade-offs while maintaining explainability through traceable score components.

## Key Results
- TabReX achieves highest correlation (Spearman's ρ, Kendall's τ) with expert human rankings across all domains
- Maintains stable performance across easy→hard perturbation tiers while other metrics shift dramatically
- Demonstrates fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis capabilities through interpretable, rubric-aware scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Converting text and tables into unified knowledge graph triplets enables structure-aware comparison that surface metrics miss
- Mechanism: Table2Graph uses deterministic rules (headers→predicates, rows→subjects, cells→objects) while Text2Graph uses LLM-guided extraction with entity-centric grammar, creating shared representational space where structural and factual discrepancies become explicitly enumerable
- Core assumption: Atomic triplets [s, p, o] capture sufficient information to assess both schema alignment and factual fidelity
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states TabReX converts both modalities into canonical knowledge graphs and computes interpretable scores; Section 2.1 describes common triplet space preparation; related papers (Map&Make, TabRAG) similarly leverage structured representations

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-stage graph alignment (deterministic + LLM refinement) handles exact matches and semantic paraphrases while maintaining interpretability
- Mechanism: First pass aligns triplets with identical or schema-normalized subject-predicate pairs deterministically; second pass uses LLM to resolve paraphrases, abbreviations, and compound attributes, with each matched pair receiving difference vectors tracking unit-aware numeric gaps, categorical mismatches, and missing/extra designations
- Core assumption: LLM can reliably identify semantic equivalence across surface variations
- Evidence anchors: Section 2.1 describes two-step alignment procedure; abstract mentions LLM-guided matching; weak corpus evidence from related papers focusing on generation/QA rather than evaluation alignment

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Property-driven scoring with tunable weights enables domain-adaptive sensitivity-specificity trade-offs while preserving explainability
- Mechanism: Final score combines TablePenalty (row/column level MI/EI counts) and CellPenalty (cell-level MI/EI plus normalized numeric deviations Γ); weights (α, β) control coverage vs hallucination control; all quantities derive from alignment set A making scores traceable to specific cells
- Core assumption: Linear combination of weighted penalties captures human judgment of table quality across domains
- Evidence anchors: Section 2.1 explains weighting parameters behavior; Figure 1 shows TabReX maintains optimal sensitivity-specificity trade-off across perturbation difficulties; ExPerT paper addresses explainable evaluation for personalized text

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Knowledge Graph Triplets / Atomic Facts
  - Why needed here: The entire TabReX pipeline hinges on representing both unstructured text and structured tables as [subject, predicate, object] triplets
  - Quick check question: Given a table row "Q1-2024 | Revenue | $2.3M", what are the triplet's subject, predicate, and object?

- **Concept:** Reference-less Evaluation
  - Why needed here: Unlike BLEU/ROUGE that compare against fixed reference outputs, TabReX evaluates generated tables directly against source text evidence
  - Quick check question: Why would a reference-based metric fail when evaluating a newly generated table from a quarterly report that has no pre-existing reference table?

- **Concept:** Sensitivity vs Specificity Trade-off
  - Why needed here: TabReX explicitly tunes this balance via β weights; high sensitivity catches all real errors but may over-flag benign variations; high specificity avoids false alarms but may miss subtle hallucinations
  - Quick check question: In a clinical dashboard context, would you prioritize sensitivity or specificity, and which β parameter would you adjust?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
Source Text → [Text2Graph + LLM] → GS (summary graph)
                    ↓
Generated Table → [Table2Graph + Rules] → GT (table graph)
                    ↓
              [Graph Alignment]
                    ↓
         Alignment Set A (matched/MI/EI triplets)
                    ↓
         [Property-Driven Scoring]
                    ↓
    TablePenalty + CellPenalty → STABREX (0-1 scale)

- **Critical path:** The Graph Alignment stage is the bottleneck—both accuracy and latency depend on LLM call quality for resolving paraphrases. Misalignments here cascade into incorrect MI/EI counts.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Rule-based Table2Graph (fast, deterministic, no training) vs. learned alternatives (potentially more robust to malformed tables)
  - LLM-guided alignment (handles semantic variation) vs. pure embedding similarity (faster but less interpretable)
  - Fixed hyperparameters (αr=0.9, αc=1.0, αcell=0.8, βMI=1.0, βEI=0.9) vs. domain-tuned configurations

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High tie ratio (πt) → scoring saturation, insufficient discrimination
  - Large sensitivity drop from easy→hard → over-reliance on surface cues
  - Low RBO despite high Spearman's ρ → rank instability at individual positions

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity check:** Run TabReX on TabReX-Bench subset with ground-truth tables (no perturbations)—should yield near-zero penalty scores
  2. **Ablation study:** Disable LLM refinement in Graph Alignment, keeping only deterministic matching—measure correlation drop (especially on paraphrased-cell-values perturbation type)
  3. **Domain transfer test:** Train optimal α, β on finance domain (FinQA), apply unchanged to healthcare (MIMIC-IV)—assess whether sensitivity-specificity balance remains in ideal zone or requires retuning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can TabReX be extended to evaluate tables extracted directly from visual formats, such as PDFs or images, without relying on pre-parsed structured markup?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Limitations section states the current implementation "supports only structured digital tables... and cannot yet handle tables embedded in images or PDFs requiring OCR or visual parsing"
- **Why unresolved:** The current Table2Graph converter relies on explicit HTML/Markdown tags to unroll structure; visual inputs introduce OCR errors and layout ambiguities that disrupt this deterministic rule-based unrolling
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An extension of the framework integrating a visual parsing module, evaluated on a benchmark of unstructured document images with human-annotated ground truths

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Is it possible to distill the LLM-guided graph alignment components into smaller, domain-specific models to improve computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Future work proposes "distilling its LLM components into lightweight, domain-adaptive evaluators for scalable deployment," addressing the limitation that the framework "relies on large language models... which adds computational cost"
- **Why unresolved:** The heavy reliance on large models (e.g., GPT-5-nano) for Text2Graph and Graph Alignment creates a bottleneck for high-volume or low-latency evaluation scenarios
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study fine-tuning smaller models (e.g., 7B parameters) on the alignment task and showing comparable correlation with human rankings on TabReX-Bench at lower latency

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does TabReX perform under real-world error distributions and multilingual contexts compared to the synthetic, English-only perturbations of the current benchmark?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Limitations section notes that TabReX-Bench "remains limited to English and synthetic perturbations, leaving real-world noise, multilingual data, and complex layouts for future exploration"
- **Why unresolved:** Synthetic perturbations (e.g., "Add-Row", "Data-Swap") are planner-driven and may not reflect the complex, correlated failure modes of generative models in production environments
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation results on a dataset of naturally occurring generation errors or a translated version of TabReX-Bench demonstrating cross-linguistic robustness

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How sensitive is the graph alignment accuracy to the specific prompt phrasing of the "entity-centric grammar" used in the Text2Graph stage?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper relies on strict prompts (Prompt C) to convert text to triplets, noting "mild variability due to model stochasticity" as a limitation; if the LLM fails to strictly follow the grammar (e.g., using "concept-centric" instead of "entity-centric" modeling), the downstream alignment may fail
- **Why unresolved:** The framework assumes the LLM perfectly adheres to the standardized grammar, but prompt adherence is known to be brittle across different domains or LLM versions
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study measuring the degradation of the final TabReX score when varying the prompt instructions or using different LLM families for the extraction phase

## Limitations
- Relies on GPT-5 variants for critical LLM steps, creating significant reproducibility barriers
- Benchmark limited to English and synthetic perturbations, not reflecting real-world error distributions
- Heavy computational cost due to large language model dependency for graph alignment

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core architectural design (knowledge graph conversion + alignment + property-driven scoring) is logically sound and internally consistent. The sensitivity-specificity trade-off mechanism is well-specified and interpretable.
- **Medium Confidence:** Empirical superiority claims rely on correlation metrics that measure rank ordering rather than absolute accuracy. The claim that TabReX "remains stable under harder perturbations" is supported by Figure 1 but lacks statistical significance testing.
- **Low Confidence:** The perturbation generation mechanism's exact reproducibility is uncertain without access to the same LLM planner outputs. The paper's assertion that TabReX enables "fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis" is demonstrated but not deeply explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproducibility Test:** Implement the perturbation planner using Prompt B on a small subset and compare output distributions with the paper's descriptions.
2. **Error Case Analysis:** Identify 20 cases where TabReX's ranking differs from human annotations and analyze whether differences stem from metric limitations or human inconsistency.
3. **Domain Transfer Experiment:** Train optimal weights on one domain (e.g., finance), then evaluate unchanged on a disjoint domain (e.g., healthcare) to test generalization claims.
