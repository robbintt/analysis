# SlideGen: Collaborative Multimodal Agents for Scientific Slide Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04529
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04529
- Reference count: 40
- Generates presentation slides from scientific papers using multimodal agents

## Executive Summary
SlideGen is a multimodal agentic framework that automatically generates presentation slides from scientific papers. The system employs six specialized agents to handle content planning, figure and equation mapping, layout selection from 19 templates, visual refinement, and speaker note generation. It produces editable PPTX slides with professional design, balanced visual density, and coherent narrative flow. The framework represents a significant advancement in automated slide generation, outperforming existing baselines on multiple evaluation metrics.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of six specialized agents working collaboratively: a planner agent that analyzes paper structure and determines key content, a figure mapper that extracts and maps visual elements to corresponding content, an equation mapper for mathematical content, a layout selector that chooses from 19 predefined templates, a visual refiner for aesthetic enhancement, and a speaker note generator. The system processes PDF papers to extract text, figures, and equations, then orchestrates these agents to create a complete slide deck. The modular design allows each agent to focus on its specific task while maintaining overall coherence through a centralized planning mechanism.

## Key Results
- Achieves higher SlideQA accuracy than baseline models for content fidelity
- Scores better on GAD (Graph Aesthetic Distance) metric for visual aesthetics
- Outperforms baselines on VLM-as-judge evaluations for content, design, and coherence
- Establishes new state-of-the-art performance in automated scientific slide generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by decomposing the complex slide generation task into specialized sub-tasks handled by dedicated agents. This agentic approach allows for focused optimization of each component - from content extraction to visual layout - while maintaining coordination through a central planning agent. The multimodal processing capabilities enable accurate mapping of figures and equations to relevant content sections, and the template library ensures consistent professional design. The collaborative nature of the agents allows for iterative refinement and quality control throughout the generation process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal processing**: Required to handle text, figures, and equations from PDF papers; check by verifying accurate extraction of all content types
- **Agent orchestration**: Needed to coordinate specialized agents while maintaining coherence; check by testing end-to-end generation quality
- **Template-based layout**: Essential for professional design consistency; check by evaluating visual density and aesthetic scores
- **Content planning**: Critical for identifying key paper elements and organizing them logically; check by assessing SlideQA accuracy
- **Visual refinement**: Important for enhancing aesthetic appeal; check by comparing GAD scores against baselines
- **Speaker note generation**: Valuable for presentation context; check by evaluating note relevance and completeness

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: PDF Parser -> Planner Agent -> (Figure Mapper, Equation Mapper, Layout Selector, Visual Refiner, Speaker Note Generator) -> PPTX Output
- **Critical path**: Planner analysis -> Content mapping -> Layout selection -> Visual refinement -> Final PPTX generation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Modular agent architecture vs. unified model (chosen for specialization and maintainability); template library vs. dynamic generation (chosen for design consistency)
- **Failure signatures**: Content mismatch between paper and slides, visual clutter from poor layout selection, missing mathematical notation, incoherent narrative flow
- **First experiments**: 1) Test PDF parsing accuracy with papers of varying complexity, 2) Validate individual agent performance on their specific tasks, 3) Evaluate end-to-end generation on a small set of papers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics and limited human evaluation (10 papers)
- "Professional design" claim is subjective without comprehensive validation against industry standards
- Limited generalizability assessment across diverse scientific domains beyond computer science papers

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in technical implementation and agent architecture
- **Medium confidence** in quantitative performance claims
- **Low confidence** in generalizability across diverse scientific domains

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive user study with researchers from multiple scientific disciplines
2. Perform A/B testing comparing SlideGen slides against professionally designed slides
3. Test framework robustness with papers containing complex mathematical notation and non-standard formatting
