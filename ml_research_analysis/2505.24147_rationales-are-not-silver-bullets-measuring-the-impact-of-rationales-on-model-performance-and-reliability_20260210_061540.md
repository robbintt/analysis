# Rationales Are Not Silver Bullets: Measuring the Impact of Rationales on Model Performance and Reliability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24147
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24147
- Reference count: 19
- Adding rationales to finetuning (RAFT) doesn't universally improve accuracy but consistently improves calibration across diverse NLP tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the common assumption that rationales universally improve language model performance when added during finetuning. Through systematic experiments across 18 diverse NLP tasks, the authors find that while rationales often harm accuracy, they consistently improve model calibration (reduce Expected Calibration Error). A significant linear correlation is discovered between accuracy and calibration improvements, both driven by task difficulty. The study provides actionable guidance for predicting RAFT benefits based on task characteristics and suggests a more nuanced, task-dependent approach to rationale-augmented training.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates Rationale-Augmented Finetuning (RAFT) by generating rationales for 18 NLP datasets using GPT-3.5-turbo, filtering to keep only those leading to correct answers, then finetuning LLaMA-2-7B models on both rationale-augmented and baseline data. Performance is measured using accuracy and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) with self-consistency voting (10 samples at temperature 0.8). The analysis examines how task difficulty correlates with RAFT effectiveness and develops predictive models for estimating performance gains.

## Key Results
- RAFT can harm accuracy on simple tasks but consistently improves calibration (reduces ECE)
- Significant linear correlation exists between accuracy and calibration improvements across tasks
- Task difficulty is the primary driver of both accuracy and calibration changes from RAFT
- Simple predictive models can estimate RAFT benefits based on task difficulty metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RAFT works by exposing models to explicit reasoning chains during training, which can improve their ability to generate calibrated confidence estimates. However, rationales can also introduce noise or irrelevant information that degrades performance, particularly on tasks the model already handles well. The consistent calibration improvement suggests rationales help models better align confidence with accuracy, even when raw performance suffers.

## Foundational Learning
- **RAFT (Rationale-Augmented Finetuning)**: Training method that includes rationales alongside questions and answers. Why needed: To test whether explicit reasoning improves model performance. Quick check: Compare model outputs with and without rationales on same dataset.
- **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**: Metric measuring how well predicted confidences match actual accuracy. Why needed: Accuracy alone doesn't capture reliability. Quick check: Compute ECE for models with different confidence calibration.
- **Self-consistency voting**: Inference method using multiple samples to determine final answer. Why needed: Improves reliability over single-sample inference. Quick check: Compare accuracy with 1 vs 10 samples per question.
- **Task difficulty metrics**: Quantitative measures of how challenging a task is for models. Why needed: To predict RAFT effectiveness before training. Quick check: Generate rationales and measure their length/entropy as difficulty proxy.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data Construction Pipeline -> Training Loop -> Evaluation Framework

**Critical path**: The Data Construction Pipeline is most critical, as RAFT's harmful effects are directly tied to rationale quality. The filtering step (keeping only correct-answer rationales) is the primary safeguard but isn't foolproof.

**Design tradeoffs**:
- Rationale Generator Quality vs. Cost: GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 affects rationale quality and potential benefits
- Filtering vs. Data Quantity: Quality filter ensures correctness but may discard valuable challenging examples
- Self-Consistency vs. Inference Speed: 10 samples improves reliability but increases cost 10x

**Failure signatures**:
1. Performance drop on simple tasks (negative ΔAcc)
2. "Off-topic" or "trivial" rationales from generator
3. Over-confidence on incorrect answers from learned plausible reasoning paths

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Establish baseline: Finetune student model on target dataset using only (question, answer) pairs. Measure accuracy and ECE.
2. Implement basic RAFT: Generate rationales with strong LLM, filter for correct answers, finetune same student model on (question, rationale, answer). Compare baseline vs RAFT.
3. Difficulty analysis: Measure task difficulty using rationale length/entropy. Plot on Figure 5 axes using linear regression equations to predict RAFT benefits before full training.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- What constitutes the "golden rationale" for a language model, and how can it be optimally constructed to maximize performance gains? (Appendix A.1)
- Does selectively adapting rationales in general-purpose SFT data based on task difficulty enhance the final instruction-following ability of aligned models? (Appendix A.2)
- Can a rigorous theoretical proof be established to explain the underlying mechanisms by which rationales impact model performance and calibration? (Limitations section)

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize beyond LLaMA-2-7B architecture and GPT-3.5 rationale generator
- Study focuses exclusively on English-language tasks with no cross-lingual validation
- Quality filtering may introduce selection bias by discarding challenging reasoning paths
- Self-consistency inference (10 samples) represents 10x inference cost that may not be practical

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: RAFT doesn't universally improve accuracy (negative ΔAcc cases); calibration consistently improves (negative ΔECE); significant linear correlation between accuracy and calibration changes; task-difficulty predictive model has statistical backing.

**Medium Confidence**: Calibration improvement driven by task difficulty; interpretation that negative ΔECE implies reduced overconfidence could benefit from more direct measurement.

**Low Confidence**: Claim that RAFT models can outperform untrained base models in calibration (Figure 2) based on small subset; lack of statistical significance testing for most comparisons.

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture Generalization Test**: Reproduce RAFT with different student architecture (Mistral-7B or Qwen-7B) on 3-5 tasks to assess architectural sensitivity.
2. **Rationale Generator Ablation**: Generate rationales with both GPT-3.5 and stronger model (GPT-4), train RAFT models on both, compare ΔAcc/ΔECE patterns.
3. **Calibration Behavior Analysis**: For tasks showing negative ΔECE, plot confidence-accuracy curves and reliability diagrams to validate calibration improvement interpretation.
