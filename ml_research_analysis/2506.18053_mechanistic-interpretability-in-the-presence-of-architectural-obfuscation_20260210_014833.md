# Mechanistic Interpretability in the Presence of Architectural Obfuscation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.18053
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18053
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Obfuscation degrades fine-grained interpretability without compromising global behavior, offering privacy benefits but posing new challenges for interpretability research.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether architectural obfuscation—such as permuting hidden-state tensors or linearly transforming embeddings—impairs mechanistic interpretability of transformer models. The authors train a GPT-2-small model with obfuscation, then apply interpretability tools like logit-lens attribution, causal patching, and attention-head ablation to locate and manipulate internal circuits. They find that while obfuscation significantly alters activation patterns within attention heads, the overall layer-wise computational graph remains intact. This disconnect makes causal traces harder to align with baseline semantics and reduces interpretability precision, though the model's top-level task performance is preserved.

## Method Summary
The authors train a GPT-2-small model with architectural obfuscation techniques including tensor permutation and linear embedding transformations. They then systematically apply interpretability methods including logit-lens attribution to analyze internal representations, causal patching to test for functional equivalence, and attention-head ablation to assess circuit importance. By comparing obfuscated and baseline models, they measure the impact of obfuscation on the ability to trace and manipulate internal computational mechanisms.

## Key Results
- Obfuscation significantly alters activation patterns within attention heads while preserving overall layer-wise computational structure
- Causal traces become misaligned with baseline semantics, reducing interpretability precision
- Model task performance remains preserved despite degraded interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The obfuscation techniques preserve the high-level computational graph of the transformer while scrambling the specific activation patterns within each component. This creates a scenario where the model's input-output behavior remains consistent, but the internal representations and circuit patterns that interpretability tools rely on are disrupted. The disconnect between preserved global behavior and altered local representations is what makes fine-grained mechanistic interpretability challenging.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Understanding how neural networks implement specific functions through their internal mechanisms
   - Why needed: Provides the baseline framework for measuring interpretability degradation
   - Quick check: Can you trace how a specific feature is computed through the network layers?

2. **Architectural Obfuscation**: Techniques that preserve functional behavior while obscuring implementation details
   - Why needed: The core intervention being studied and its relationship to privacy/interpretability
   - Quick check: Does the obfuscated model produce the same outputs for the same inputs?

3. **Causal Tracing**: Methods for identifying which components contribute to specific model behaviors
   - Why needed: Essential for understanding how obfuscation affects interpretability tools
   - Quick check: Can you identify which attention heads contribute to a specific output?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Embedding Layer -> Attention Heads -> Feed-Forward Networks -> Output Layer

**Critical Path**: The attention mechanism is the most critical path for interpretability, as it contains the richest internal representations and circuit patterns that are most vulnerable to obfuscation disruption.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The paper balances privacy benefits of obfuscation against the interpretability needs of model transparency. While obfuscation protects implementation details, it sacrifices the ability to understand and potentially intervene in model behavior.

**Failure Signatures**: When obfuscation works effectively, interpretability tools produce results that are internally consistent but misaligned with baseline semantics. Causal traces may appear valid but map to different underlying computations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Apply logit-lens to an obfuscated attention head and compare with baseline
2. Perform attention-head ablation on an obfuscated model to test circuit importance
3. Use causal patching to test functional equivalence between obfuscated and baseline components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study limited to GPT-2-small model, generalizability to larger models uncertain
- Only explores tensor permutation and linear transformations as obfuscation methods
- Does not investigate alternative interpretability tools that might be more robust to obfuscation

## Confidence
- Model Scope: Medium - Limited to GPT-2-small, needs validation on larger models
- Obfuscation Techniques: Medium - Only two methods explored, other techniques may yield different results
- Interpretability Tools: Medium - Established tools used, but their effectiveness in obfuscated settings needs further validation

## Next Checks
1. Extend the study to larger transformer models (GPT-3, GPT-4) and other architectures (BERT, T5) to assess generalizability
2. Investigate the impact of additional obfuscation methods such as non-linear transformations and dynamic tensor reordering
3. Explore alternative interpretability tools or develop new methods more resilient to architectural obfuscation
