# Pre-Tactical Flight-Delay and Turnaround Forecasting with Synthetic Aviation Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.02294
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02294
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Transformer-based synthetic data generation (REaLTabFormer) achieves 94-97% fidelity for pre-tactical aviation forecasting tasks

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates synthetic data generation for pre-tactical aviation prediction tasks where only scheduled flight information is available. Four generative models (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TabSyn, and REaLTabFormer) are assessed on European flight data (1.74M records) across three prediction tasks: departure delay, arrival delay, and turnaround time. Transformer-based REaLTabFormer achieves the highest fidelity (94-97% utility scores) while preserving operational feature relationships. Even with real data, R² values remain modest (≤0.44), establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. Results demonstrate that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to aviation analytics while maintaining commercial confidentiality.

## Method Summary
The study generates synthetic aviation data using four different generative models and evaluates their performance on three forecasting tasks: departure delay, arrival delay, and turnaround time prediction. The evaluation uses European flight data from EUROCONTROL's PRU database (1.74M records) covering 12 operational features. Model performance is assessed using utility scores that measure prediction accuracy preservation, along with fidelity metrics comparing synthetic and real data distributions. The transformer-based REaLTabFormer model is compared against statistical (Gaussian Copula), deep learning (CTGAN), and other transformer approaches (TabSyn) to establish baseline performance benchmarks.

## Key Results
- REaLTabFormer achieves highest fidelity scores (94-97%) across all three prediction tasks
- R² values remain modest (≤0.44) even with real data, establishing realistic accuracy baselines
- Synthetic data preserves operational feature relationships while maintaining commercial confidentiality
- All models show utility scores between 89-97% for departure delay prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The transformer architecture in REaLTabFormer effectively captures complex dependencies between aviation operational features through self-attention mechanisms, enabling accurate synthetic data generation that preserves predictive relationships. The model's ability to maintain feature correlations while generating realistic distributions allows downstream machine learning models to achieve comparable performance using synthetic versus real data. This mechanism addresses the critical need for data accessibility in aviation analytics while protecting commercial confidentiality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Synthetic data generation for tabular data**: Essential for creating privacy-preserving datasets that maintain statistical properties while enabling broader research access. Quick check: Verify generated data preserves marginal distributions and feature correlations.
- **Pre-tactical aviation forecasting**: Focuses on predictions made hours before operations using only scheduled information. Quick check: Confirm time horizon constraints (6-24 hours before operation) are respected.
- **Utility score methodology**: Measures how well machine learning models trained on synthetic data perform compared to those trained on real data. Quick check: Calculate utility score as ratio of R² values between synthetic and real data models.
- **Transformer-based tabular generation**: Uses self-attention mechanisms to capture complex feature interactions in structured data. Quick check: Verify attention weights show meaningful feature dependencies.
- **R² coefficient of determination**: Standard metric for evaluating regression model performance. Quick check: Ensure values fall within [0,1] range with higher values indicating better fit.
- **Feature correlation preservation**: Critical for maintaining operational relationships in synthetic aviation data. Quick check: Compare correlation matrices between real and synthetic datasets.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Real Aviation Data -> Feature Selection -> Train/Validation/Test Split -> Generative Models (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TabSyn, REaLTabFormer) -> Synthetic Data -> Downstream ML Models -> Utility Score Calculation

**Critical Path**
Scheduled Flight Data → Feature Engineering → Synthetic Data Generation → Model Training → Performance Evaluation → Utility Score Computation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Model complexity vs. training efficiency: Transformer models offer higher fidelity but require more computational resources
- Data utility vs. privacy preservation: Higher synthetic data quality enables better predictions while maintaining confidentiality
- Feature selection vs. model generalization: Including operational features improves forecasting but may limit applicability across different aviation contexts

**Failure Signatures**
- Utility scores below 80% indicate synthetic data fails to preserve predictive relationships
- Distribution drift between real and synthetic data suggests generation quality issues
- R² values approaching zero indicate poor model fit regardless of data source

**Three First Experiments**
1. Compare marginal distributions between real and synthetic data for key operational features
2. Evaluate utility score stability across different train-test splits
3. Test model performance sensitivity to synthetic data volume variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on European flight data may not generalize to other aviation contexts
- Modest R² values (≤0.44) indicate inherent limitations in pre-tactical forecasting accuracy
- Evaluation focuses on synthetic data fidelity without real-world implementation testing

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The comparative performance ranking of generative models (REaLTabFormer > TabSyn > CTGAN > Gaussian Copula) and the utility score methodology are well-supported by the experimental results.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that synthetic data can enable broader access to aviation analytics while maintaining confidentiality is plausible but would benefit from real-world implementation testing beyond the controlled experimental setting.

**Medium Confidence:** The assertion that pre-tactical forecasting has inherent accuracy limitations (R² ≤ 0.44) is supported by the data but may vary with different datasets or time horizons.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Regional Validation:** Test the synthetic data generation and forecasting models on aviation datasets from different continents (e.g., North American or Asian flight data) to assess generalizability across operational contexts.

2. **Temporal Robustness Testing:** Evaluate model performance across different seasons and years to determine stability of synthetic data fidelity and forecasting accuracy over time.

3. **Real-World Deployment Assessment:** Implement the synthetic data approach in a controlled operational environment with restricted data access to measure actual utility gains versus theoretical predictions.
