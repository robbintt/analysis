# FraPPE: Fast and Efficient Preference-based Pure Exploration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.16487
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16487
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes FraPPE, an asymptotically optimal algorithm for Preference-based Pure Exploration that achieves ~5-6X lower sample complexity than baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) problem in multi-objective bandits, where the goal is to identify the set of Pareto optimal arms under a preference cone. The challenge is that existing algorithms are either computationally intractable or only work for specific preference cones. The authors propose FraPPE, a computationally efficient and asymptotically optimal algorithm that works for arbitrary preference cones and exponential family distributions. Their key insight is a structural reduction that transforms an intractable optimization problem into a tractable one, combined with Frank-Wolfe optimization for efficient allocation computation.

## Method Summary
FraPPE is built on the Track-and-Stop framework and addresses the PrePEx problem by identifying Pareto optimal arms in a multi-objective bandit setting. The algorithm maintains empirical mean rewards, computes the current Pareto set using neighboring policies, and uses Frank-Wolfe optimization to determine the allocation of pulls. The stopping rule is based on a Chernoff-type test that checks when the empirical means are sufficiently close to the true means. The algorithm handles forced exploration to ensure convergence and works for arbitrary polyhedral preference cones with exponential family reward distributions.

## Key Results
- Achieves ~5-6X lower sample complexity compared to baselines PSIPS and TnS across synthetic and real datasets
- Shows better stability and lower error probability uniformly over time
- Computational complexity is O(max{K(log K)^max{1,L-2}, KL min{K,L}}), a significant improvement over existing O(K^L) algorithms
- Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness on both synthetic Gaussian instances and the real Cov-Boost dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structural Reduction of the Alternative Set
FraPPE reduces an intractable optimization problem over infinite alternative instances to a finite union of convex sets. The authors prove that the Pareto optimal policy set is spanned by a finite basis of "pure policies" (Theorem 2). Instead of searching all possible confusing instances, the algorithm restricts the search to "neighboring pure policies" (Definition 6). This transforms the inner optimization loop from an intractable search into a tractable minimization over O(K min{K, L}) convex sets.

### Mechanism 2: Projection-Free Optimization via Frank-Wolfe
The algorithm achieves fast allocation computation (O(1/tol)) by avoiding expensive projection steps common in standard gradient descent. FraPPE uses the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to solve the outer maximization (allocating arm pulls). It handles the non-smooth nature of the objective (which occurs when the minimizing neighbor changes) by constructing an r-sub-differential set (Equation 6). This allows the optimizer to linearize the problem at each step rather than projecting onto the simplex, significantly accelerating convergence.

### Mechanism 3: Polar Cone Characterization
The complexity of identifying confusing instances is reduced by mapping the problem to the boundary of the polar cone. The algorithm uses the property that for a confusing instance to exist, the difference in expected rewards must lie within the polar cone of the preference cone (Proposition 1). This allows the optimization to search over an L-dimensional vector on the cone boundary rather than a full K × L matrix, effectively decoupling the arm count K from the dimensionality L in the optimization cost.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pareto Dominance & Preference Cones**
  - Why needed here: The core objective is not finding a single "best" arm, but the set of non-dominated arms. Understanding how a "preference cone" defines the partial order (what it means to be "better") is required to interpret the output.
  - Quick check question: Given two arms with reward vectors [1, 10] and [10, 1], and a preference cone favoring the first objective, which arm is Pareto optimal?

- **Concept: Track-and-Stop Framework**
  - Why needed here: FraPPE builds on this standard pure exploration architecture. It involves tracking an optimal allocation rule derived from lower bounds and stopping when a generalized likelihood ratio test passes.
  - Quick check question: In Track-and-Stop, what two components determine when the algorithm terminates?

- **Concept: Exponential Families & KL Divergence**
  - Why needed here: The stopping rule and lower bounds rely on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between reward distributions. The paper assumes an "L-parameter exponential family" (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli) to ensure this divergence is well-behaved and computable.
  - Quick check question: Why does FraPPE require the log-partition function of the reward distribution to be differentiable?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Estimator -> Pareto Oracle -> Frank-Wolfe Optimizer -> C-Tracker -> Stopper
- **Critical path:** The optimization loop (Lines 7-11 in Algorithm 1). Specifically, the construction of the sub-differential set H_M̂_t and the subsequent Frank-Wolfe update.
- **Design tradeoffs:** FraPPE trades implementation complexity for statistical and computational efficiency. It is asymptotically optimal (statistically efficient) and O(KL^2) (computationally efficient), but requires maintaining complex data structures for the sub-differential set and neighbor tracking, unlike simpler "uniform sampling" baselines.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Premature stopping: If the forced exploration parameter r_t decays too fast, the empirical means M̂_t may not converge, leading to incorrect Pareto sets.
  - Optimization stall: If the Frank-Wolfe curvature constant is effectively unbounded (violating Lemma 1), the allocation ω_t may not converge to the oracle allocation.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check (Gaussian): Run FraPPE on a 2D Gaussian bandit with a known positive orthant cone. Verify that the stopping time scales logarithmically with 1/δ.
  2. Cone Sensitivity: Test the Cov-Boost dataset (provided in paper) using different preference cones (e.g., C_π/4 vs C_π/2). Confirm that the algorithm adapts the Pareto set correctly as the cone rotates.
  3. Compute Benchmark: Measure the wall-clock time per iteration t as K increases. Verify the empirical complexity is dominated by O(KL^2) (or the Pareto set computation) rather than O(K^L).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The structural reduction relies on Theorem 2's claim about finite pure policy basis, but the proof depends on technical conditions not fully verified in the paper (Medium confidence)
- Frank-Wolfe convergence proofs assume bounded gradients (Lemma 1), but this is only guaranteed under Assumption 1 regarding non-singular exponential families (Medium confidence)
- Polar cone characterization appears novel, but its general applicability beyond polyhedral cones is unclear (Low confidence)

## Confidence
- Structural reduction (Mechanism 1): Medium confidence - relies on Theorem 2's technical conditions
- Frank-Wolfe optimization (Mechanism 2): Medium confidence - assumes bounded gradients from non-singular exponential families
- Polar cone characterization (Mechanism 3): Low confidence - general applicability beyond polyhedral cones unclear

## Next Checks
1. **Theoretical validation**: Verify Theorem 2's finite pure policy basis claim by constructing explicit counterexamples for different cone geometries (e.g., non-polyhedral cones)
2. **Algorithmic robustness**: Test Frank-Wolfe convergence with near-singular exponential families (e.g., Bernoulli with p→0 or p→1) to confirm the algorithm degrades gracefully
3. **Empirical scalability**: Benchmark FraPPE on synthetic problems with L=10 and varying K to confirm the claimed O(KL^2) complexity and identify the actual computational bottleneck
