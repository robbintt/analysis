# Comorbidity-Informed Transfer Learning for Neuro-developmental Disorder Diagnosis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.09463
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09463
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CITL achieves 76.32% accuracy for ASD and 73.15% for ADHD detection

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Comorbidity-Informed Transfer Learning (CITL) framework to improve diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders (ASD and ADHD) using fMRI data. The method addresses the challenge of complex spatio-temporal fMRI features and limited labeled data by integrating comorbidity mechanisms between disorders with transfer learning and semi-supervised learning. CITL employs a pseudo-labeling approach combined with an autoencoder to filter low-correlation dynamic functional connectivity data and generate enhanced representations. The core idea is to leverage shared comorbid patterns between ASD and ADHD to improve feature learning.

## Method Summary
The CITL framework combines transfer learning with comorbidity-aware feature extraction for neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis. It uses pseudo-labeling to generate additional training data from unlabeled samples, then employs an autoencoder to filter dynamic functional connectivity data by removing low-correlation features. The enhanced representations are then used to train disorder-specific classifiers. The framework specifically targets the challenge of limited labeled data in neuroimaging studies by leveraging the comorbidity relationships between ASD and ADHD to transfer knowledge between the two disorders.

## Key Results
- CITL achieves 76.32% accuracy for ASD detection
- CITL achieves 73.15% accuracy for ADHD detection
- Outperforms existing transfer learning methods by 7.2% and 0.5% respectively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CITL framework works by leveraging the comorbidity mechanisms between ASD and ADHD to create shared feature representations that are informative for both disorders. The pseudo-labeling approach generates additional training data by propagating labels from the small labeled dataset to similar unlabeled samples, while the autoencoder filters out noisy or irrelevant dynamic functional connectivity features that might interfere with classification. This combination allows the model to learn more robust representations despite limited labeled data.

## Foundational Learning

Dynamic Functional Connectivity: Measures temporal variations in brain network connectivity
- Why needed: Captures time-varying brain states that are crucial for neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis
- Quick check: Verify temporal resolution matches neuroimaging acquisition parameters

Transfer Learning in Neuroimaging: Adapting models trained on one disorder to another
- Why needed: Addresses limited labeled data problem in medical imaging
- Quick check: Ensure source and target domains share sufficient similarity

Autoencoder-based Feature Filtering: Using neural networks to denoise input representations
- Why needed: Removes irrelevant or noisy connectivity features that could harm classification
- Quick check: Monitor reconstruction loss to ensure meaningful feature preservation

Comorbidity Mechanisms: Shared pathophysiological features between disorders
- Why needed: Provides basis for knowledge transfer between ASD and ADHD
- Quick check: Validate shared features are clinically meaningful, not just statistically correlated

Semi-supervised Learning: Combining labeled and unlabeled data for training
- Why needed: Leverages abundant unlabeled neuroimaging data
- Quick check: Monitor pseudo-label quality to prevent error propagation

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: fMRI data -> Autoencoder filter -> Pseudo-labeling -> Enhanced representations -> Disorder classifiers

Critical Path: Autoencoder filtering -> Pseudo-label generation -> Feature enhancement -> Classification

Design Tradeoffs:
- Filter threshold: Too strict loses information, too lenient includes noise
- Pseudo-label confidence: High threshold limits data, low threshold introduces errors
- Feature dimensionality: Higher dimensions capture more information but increase computational cost

Failure Signatures:
- Poor reconstruction loss indicates autoencoder not learning meaningful features
- Low pseudo-label agreement between iterations suggests model uncertainty
- Minimal performance improvement indicates insufficient comorbidity overlap

First Experiments:
1. Ablation test: CITL without autoencoder filtering to measure noise impact
2. Sensitivity analysis: Vary pseudo-label confidence threshold to find optimal setting
3. Cross-disorder validation: Test transfer from ADHD to ASD and vice versa

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Generalizability concerns when applying to disorders beyond ASD and ADHD
- Potential removal of diagnostically relevant features during autoencoder filtering
- Limited validation across different datasets and patient populations

## Confidence

High: Core methodology of integrating comorbidity with transfer learning is well-founded
Medium: Experimental results demonstrate improvements but limited by sample sizes
Low: Claims about generalizability to other disorders without extensive validation

## Next Checks

1. Cross-validation across multiple independent datasets to assess generalizability of the CITL framework beyond the initial experimental setup
2. Application of the CITL framework to additional neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders with different comorbidity patterns to test the limits of the comorbidity-informed transfer learning approach
3. Systematic analysis of the autoencoder's filtering impact on diagnostic features through comparison of filtered versus unfiltered dynamic functional connectivity data in terms of both classification performance and clinical interpretability
