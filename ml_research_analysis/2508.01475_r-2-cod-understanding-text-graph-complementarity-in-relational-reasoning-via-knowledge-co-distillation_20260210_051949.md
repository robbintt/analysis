# $R^2$-CoD: Understanding Text-Graph Complementarity in Relational Reasoning via Knowledge Co-Distillation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.01475
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01475
- **Reference count**: 26
- **Key outcome**: Hybrid text-graph models consistently outperform text-only and graph-only baselines across five relational reasoning tasks, with CoD providing additional gains when text and graph encode complementary information

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces R2-CoD, a unified framework for analyzing how text and graph representations complement each other during learning for relational reasoning tasks. The core method combines modality-specific encoders with a contrastive co-distillation (CoD) objective that encourages bidirectional knowledge transfer between text and graph representations in a shared latent space. The analysis spans five diverse tasks including event temporal relation extraction, multilingual relation extraction, reasoning pattern prediction, form understanding, and knowledge base question answering. Results show that hybrid models consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with CoD providing additional gains in tasks where text and graph encode complementary information.

## Method Summary
R2-CoD combines modality-specific encoders (text and graph) with a contrastive co-distillation objective that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between representations in a shared latent space. The framework uses BERT-based encoders for both text and graph modalities, with the graph encoder processing either human-curated or automatically constructed graphs. The CoD objective includes a contrastive loss component that aligns representations and a temperature-scaled distillation mechanism that facilitates knowledge transfer. During training, the framework jointly optimizes the task-specific objective along with the CoD objective, allowing the text and graph representations to inform each other while maintaining their complementary strengths.

## Key Results
- Hybrid text-graph models consistently outperform text-only and graph-only baselines across all five studied tasks
- CoD provides additional performance gains specifically in tasks where text and graph encode complementary information
- Representation analysis reveals three distinct patterns: complementarity (text and graph remain distinct), partial alignment (moderate convergence), and complete alignment (strong convergence)
- Task characteristics such as reasoning level (local vs. global), graph explicitness, and token-graph correspondence shape the observed complementarity patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The R2-CoD framework works by enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer between text and graph representations through a contrastive co-distillation objective. The method leverages the complementary strengths of both modalities - text provides rich contextual information while graphs capture explicit relational structures. By encouraging these representations to inform each other in a shared latent space, the framework can better capture complex relational patterns that may be difficult to learn from either modality alone. The contrastive component ensures meaningful alignment while the distillation mechanism facilitates smooth knowledge transfer, allowing the model to adaptively balance between preserving modality-specific information and leveraging cross-modal complementarity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge distillation**: Why needed - enables transfer of learned representations between modalities; Quick check - verify distillation loss decreases during training
- **Contrastive learning**: Why needed - aligns representations in shared space while preserving discriminative features; Quick check - visualize embedding space before/after contrastive training
- **Modality-specific encoding**: Why needed - captures domain-specific patterns in text and graph data; Quick check - ensure separate encoders don't degrade to identical representations
- **Bidirectional transfer**: Why needed - allows both modalities to mutually improve; Quick check - measure performance gains from both text→graph and graph→text directions
- **Latent space sharing**: Why needed - enables meaningful cross-modal comparison and transfer; Quick check - verify representations occupy same embedding space
- **Relational reasoning**: Why needed - core task type requiring understanding of relationships; Quick check - confirm task-specific accuracy improves

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text Encoder -> Shared Latent Space <- Graph Encoder -> Task-specific Heads

**Critical Path**: Input text/graph → respective encoders → shared latent space → contrastive loss + distillation → task heads → prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**: Separate modality encoders vs. shared encoder (maintains complementary strengths but increases parameters); temperature scaling in distillation (controls transfer strength but requires tuning); contrastive vs. reconstruction objectives (focuses on discriminative features vs. reconstruction accuracy)

**Failure Signatures**: Degraded performance when graph construction is poor; mode collapse when representations converge too strongly; imbalanced transfer when one modality dominates; training instability from conflicting loss signals

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Train unimodal text and graph baselines to establish performance floors
2. Train hybrid model without CoD to measure baseline complementarity
3. Train full R2-CoD model to measure CoD contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability of the three identified complementarity patterns across broader task domains beyond the five studied
- Reliance on specific graph construction methods with uncertain results for alternative or automatically constructed graphs
- Limited ablation studies on relative contributions of individual CoD components versus the full framework
- Potential confounding effects from using BERT-based encoders across tasks, limiting conclusions about modality complementarity
- Lack of computational overhead and scalability analysis for the dual-encoder CoD approach

## Confidence
- **High**: The empirical observation that hybrid text-graph models outperform unimodal baselines across multiple tasks
- **Medium**: The claim that CoD provides additional gains specifically in tasks with complementary text-graph information
- **Medium**: The characterization of three distinct complementarity patterns and their relationship to task characteristics
- **Low**: The broader implications for designing future hybrid text-graph architectures based on the observed patterns

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional task domains (e.g., scientific reasoning, social network analysis) to validate whether the three complementarity patterns generalize beyond the current five tasks
2. Conduct controlled experiments with alternative graph construction methods (e.g., automatically induced vs. human-curated graphs) to assess robustness to graph quality and structure
3. Perform ablation studies isolating the effects of individual CoD components (contrastive loss, temperature scaling, bidirectional distillation) to identify which mechanisms drive performance gains
