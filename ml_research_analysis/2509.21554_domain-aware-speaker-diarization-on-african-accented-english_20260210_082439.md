# Domain-Aware Speaker Diarization On African-Accented English
## Quick Facts

- African-accented English diarization suffers persistent clinical-domain degradation despite substantial fine-tuning gains

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates speaker diarization systems on African-accented English across clinical and general domains, revealing a consistent performance gap favoring general speech. Benchmarking eight state-of-the-art systems shows clinical conversations incur significantly higher error (DER 33.38%) compared to general ones (DER 15.18%). Fine-tuning the Pyannote segmentation model on 67.73 hours of in-domain data reduces overall DER by 50% (21.30% → 10.65%) but does not fully close the domain gap. Error analysis attributes the clinical penalty primarily to false alarms and missed detections, linked to short turns and frequent overlap in clinical speech. Results suggest overlap-aware segmentation and balanced clinical resources as key directions for improvement.

## Method Summary
The study benchmarks eight state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems on African-accented English, contrasting clinical and general domains. The primary model, Pyannote segmentation, is fine-tuned on 67.73 hours of in-domain African-accented clinical speech to assess adaptation benefits. Diarization error rates (DER) are measured across both domains, with detailed error analysis examining the sources of domain-specific degradation. The research isolates overlap and turn length as key factors contributing to higher errors in clinical speech, guiding recommendations for future system design.

## Key Results
- Clinical-domain speaker diarization error is significantly higher than general domain (DER 33.38% vs. 15.18%).
- Fine-tuning Pyannote segmentation on 67.73 hours of in-domain data reduces overall DER by 50% (21.30% → 10.65%).
- Despite adaptation gains, a persistent domain gap remains, mainly due to false alarms and missed detections linked to short turns and overlap in clinical speech.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying the observed domain gap is rooted in the distinct conversational dynamics of clinical versus general speech. Clinical interactions feature shorter speaker turns and higher overlap, which challenge diarization systems trained primarily on general speech. The adaptation process via fine-tuning on in-domain clinical data helps the model learn these patterns, but the limited overlap in the fine-tuning corpus prevents full mitigation of the domain-specific errors. The system’s reliance on segmentation accuracy means that overlap and turn length directly influence false alarms and missed detections, explaining the persistent gap even after adaptation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diarization Error Rate (DER)**: Measures overall diarization accuracy; needed to quantify domain performance differences.
  - Quick check: Compare DER across domains to identify performance gaps.
- **Speaker Segmentation**: Process of detecting speaker boundaries; critical for reducing false alarms and missed detections.
  - Quick check: Inspect segmentation outputs for overlap handling.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models on domain-specific data; essential for improving performance on underrepresented accents or settings.
  - Quick check: Measure DER improvement after fine-tuning.
- **Overlap Detection**: Identifying when multiple speakers talk simultaneously; vital in clinical conversations with frequent interruptions.
  - Quick check: Evaluate model’s ability to handle overlapping speech.
- **Turn Length Analysis**: Assessing duration of speaker turns; shorter turns in clinical speech increase segmentation challenges.
  - Quick check: Analyze distribution of turn lengths by domain.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Audio input → Feature extraction (X-vectors) → Segmentation (Pyannote) → Overlap detection → Clustering → Diarization output
- **Critical Path**: Feature extraction → Segmentation → Clustering; errors early in this chain cascade downstream.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balance between model complexity (for handling overlap) and generalization across domains; limited in-domain data constrains fine-tuning.
- **Failure Signatures**: High false alarms and missed detections in clinical domain, especially during short turns and overlap.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Compare DER before and after fine-tuning on held-out clinical data.
  2. Analyze segmentation accuracy for short versus long turns.
  3. Evaluate overlap detection rate in both clinical and general domains.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None.

## Limitations
- Clinical subset may not be fully representative of all African-accented clinical speech.
- Limited overlap in fine-tuning data restricts adaptation to high-overlap scenarios.
- Error attribution to short turns and overlap is plausible but not definitively proven; other factors may contribute.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: DER measurements and the 50% relative improvement from fine-tuning are methodologically sound and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: Attribution of clinical-domain penalties to overlap and short turns is plausible but not definitively proven.
- **Medium confidence**: Recommendation for overlap-aware segmentation is grounded in observed error patterns but requires further validation.

## Next Checks
1. Test the adapted Pyannote model on an independent, held-out subset of African-accented clinical speech to confirm robustness of DER reduction.
2. Conduct a controlled experiment varying overlap density and turn length to isolate their impact on diarization error in clinical versus general domains.
3. Expand the in-domain fine-tuning corpus with additional clinical speech, especially data with high overlap, to assess whether the domain gap can be further narrowed or closed.
