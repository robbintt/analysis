# HaluNet: Multi-Granular Uncertainty Modeling for Efficient Hallucination Detection in LLM Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24562
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24562
- Reference count: 30
- HaluNet is a lightweight framework for detecting hallucinations in LLM-generated question answering by integrating multiple token-level uncertainty signals

## Executive Summary
HaluNet addresses the critical challenge of detecting hallucinations in large language model (LLM) question answering systems through a novel multi-granular uncertainty modeling approach. The framework combines probabilistic confidence measures (log-likelihoods, entropy) with semantic embeddings in a multi-branch neural architecture that adaptively fuses these complementary uncertainty sources. Trained on pseudo-labels generated by LLM-as-a-Judge, HaluNet eliminates the need for human annotations while achieving strong performance across multiple benchmark datasets including SQuAD, TriviaQA, and NQ. The model demonstrates both high detection accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time deployment in production QA systems.

## Method Summary
HaluNet employs a lightweight framework that detects hallucinations by integrating multiple token-level uncertainty signals from LLM-generated answers. The core approach combines probabilistic uncertainty (log-likelihood scores and entropy measures) with semantic uncertainty captured through embedding-based representations. These signals are processed through a multi-branch neural architecture featuring a gating module that learns to adaptively fuse the complementary uncertainty sources. The model is trained using pseudo-labels generated by an LLM-as-a-Judge approach, eliminating dependency on human-annotated data. This architecture enables efficient computation while maintaining high detection accuracy across both context-present and context-free scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves strong performance with AUROC up to 0.839 on SQuAD dataset
- Demonstrates F1@B scores up to 0.601 on TriviaQA benchmark
- Shows favorable computational efficiency compared to sampling-based detection methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HaluNet's effectiveness stems from its multi-faceted approach to uncertainty modeling. By capturing both probabilistic uncertainty (through likelihood scores and entropy) and semantic uncertainty (through embedding representations), the framework addresses different failure modes that can lead to hallucinations. The multi-branch architecture with adaptive gating allows the model to learn which uncertainty signals are most relevant for different types of errors, while the use of pseudo-labels enables scalable training without manual annotation. The integration of multiple granularities of uncertainty provides a more comprehensive assessment of answer reliability than single-signal approaches.

## Foundational Learning

1. **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Automated evaluation framework where a pre-trained LLM assesses the quality and correctness of generated answers
   - Why needed: Enables scalable pseudo-label generation for training without human annotations
   - Quick check: Verify that the judging LLM's criteria align with human judgment standards

2. **Token-level uncertainty modeling**: Quantification of confidence at individual token level rather than just sentence or answer level
   - Why needed: Provides fine-grained detection capability to identify specific problematic regions in answers
   - Quick check: Ensure uncertainty signals capture both semantic and probabilistic aspects of token generation

3. **Multi-branch neural architecture**: Network design with parallel processing paths that are later fused
   - Why needed: Allows simultaneous processing of different uncertainty signal types while maintaining their distinct characteristics
   - Quick check: Validate that the gating mechanism effectively learns optimal fusion weights

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
LLM-generated answer → Uncertainty signal extraction (probabilistic + semantic) → Multi-branch neural network → Gating module → Fused uncertainty representation → Classification layer

**Critical Path:**
1. Extract token-level uncertainty signals from LLM output
2. Process signals through separate branches for probabilistic and semantic features
3. Apply gating module to learn adaptive fusion weights
4. Generate final hallucination detection probability

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Multi-branch architecture vs. single unified model: Chosen for better signal separation and adaptive fusion
- Pseudo-label training vs. human annotation: Enables scalability but introduces potential bias from judging LLM
- Token-level vs. answer-level detection: Provides granularity but increases computational complexity

**Failure Signatures:**
- Over-reliance on probabilistic signals may miss semantically plausible but incorrect answers
- Poor pseudo-label quality can propagate errors through training
- Context-free setting may underperform when context is actually available

**3 First Experiments to Run:**
1. Ablation study removing either probabilistic or semantic uncertainty branch to measure individual contribution
2. Cross-dataset evaluation to test generalization beyond training distribution
3. Human evaluation comparison between LLM-as-a-Judge pseudo-labels and expert annotations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Performance heavily dependent on quality of LLM-as-a-Judge pseudo-labels, which may not perfectly align with human judgments
- Limited evaluation to extractive QA tasks, restricting generalizability to other generation tasks
- Computational overhead of multi-branch architecture not fully quantified against simpler detection approaches

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Computational efficiency improvements over sampling-based methods are well-supported by empirical results
- **Medium Confidence:** Performance metrics on benchmark datasets are reliable but depend on pseudo-label quality
- **Medium Confidence:** Generalization claims are supported by cross-dataset testing but limited to extractive QA scope

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate alignment between LLM-as-a-Judge pseudo-labels and human judgments
2. Test HaluNet's performance on non-extractive QA tasks and other LLM outputs beyond the current scope
3. Perform extensive ablation studies isolating individual uncertainty signal contributions and analyze failure modes
