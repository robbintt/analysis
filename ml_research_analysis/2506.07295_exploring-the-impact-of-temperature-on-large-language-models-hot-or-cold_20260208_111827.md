# Exploring the Impact of Temperature on Large Language Models:Hot or Cold?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07295
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07295
- Reference count: 35
- This study systematically examines the impact of temperature (0.1-2.0) on six key capabilities of large language models (LLMs), addressing the challenge of selecting optimal temperature for different tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how temperature settings affect the performance of large language models across six core capabilities: causal reasoning, creativity, in-context learning, instruction following, machine translation, and summarization. Through systematic experimentation on 12 open-source models spanning small to large scales, the study reveals that temperature significantly impacts performance with effects varying by both model size and task type. The research introduces a BERT-based temperature selector that dynamically identifies optimal temperature settings for specific prompts, demonstrating improvements of up to 25.2 percentage points for small models on SuperGLUE tasks.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates temperature effects across 12 open-source models (1B-80B parameters) on six capability benchmarks using temperatures from 0.1 to 1.9 in 0.3 increments. Models run in 4-bit AWQ quantization with vLLM, and performance is measured using LLM-as-a-Judge for reasoning and creative tasks, plus reference-based metrics (spBLEU, Rouge-L) for translation and summarization. A BERT-based classifier is fine-tuned to predict optimal temperatures from prompts. The research examines performance variance, mutation temperatures, and correlation patterns across capabilities and model sizes.

## Key Results
- Temperature significantly affects performance across all capabilities, with effects varying by model size and task type
- Optimal temperature settings differ substantially across capabilities, with no universal optimal value
- The BERT-based temperature selector improves performance on SuperGLUE tasks by up to 25.2 percentage points for small models
- Mutation temperature (where performance drops sharply) increases with model size, indicating larger models are more robust to temperature variation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Logit Scaling Reshapes Output Distribution
Temperature modifies the probability distribution over tokens by scaling logits before softmax, controlling output randomness. Higher temperature flattens the distribution (more uniform probabilities), lower temperature sharpens it toward greedy selection. The relationship follows Boltzmann distribution principles from statistical mechanics.

### Mechanism 2: Task-Specific Optimal Temperature Ranges
Different capabilities exhibit distinct optimal temperature ranges based on their inherent determinism requirements. Tasks requiring precision (MT, IF, SUMM) perform better at low temperatures (near-deterministic sampling). Tasks benefiting from diversity (CT, complex CR) perform better at moderate temperatures (T≈1.0-1.3).

### Mechanism 3: Model Scale Increases Temperature Robustness
Larger models exhibit higher "mutation temperatures" and lower performance variance across temperature settings. Larger parameter counts create more robust internal representations that resist distribution perturbation, providing implicit regularization against sampling variance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Softmax Temperature Scaling**: Temperature mathematically transforms logits into probabilities by dividing each logit before softmax application. Understanding this relationship is essential as the entire paper's mechanism rests on how temperature reshapes output distributions. Quick check: If logits are [2.0, 1.0, 0.5] and T=0.5, does the resulting distribution become more or less peaked than T=1.0?

- **Sampling Strategies (Top-K, Top-P, Nucleus Sampling)**: Temperature interacts with other sampling parameters. Understanding their interplay is essential for interpreting results in Table 5. Quick check: Why does the paper find Top-P has the largest effect on creativity tasks among the three parameters tested?

- **Quantization Effects on Inference**: Main experiments use 4-bit AWQ quantization; the supplementary FP16 comparison validates whether findings generalize across precision levels. Quick check: What does the paper conclude about temperature effects when comparing 4-bit vs. FP16 inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input data -> vLLM inference with AWQ quantization -> Temperature sweep loop (T ∈ {0.1, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.6, 1.9}) -> Evaluation layer (GPT-3.5-turbo judge or reference-based metrics) -> Temperature selector (BERT classifier)

- **Critical path**: 1) Load model with AWQ quantization 2) For each temperature value, run inference on benchmark datasets 3) Route outputs to appropriate evaluation method 4) Collect performance distributions across T values per capability 5) (Optional) Deploy BERT selector for dynamic T selection on new prompts

- **Design tradeoffs**: Single-prompt evaluation avoids multi-turn assistance but may underestimate model capability; GPT-3.5 as judge provides scalable evaluation but introduces evaluator bias; 4-bit quantization enables efficient experimentation but shows 10-20% performance difference vs. FP16.

- **Failure signatures**: Mutation temperature exceeded (sudden performance cliff); evaluator mismatch (embedding-based similarity missing negation keywords); creative task collapse (negative correlations between Top-P settings and creativity metrics).

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline sweep: Run your target model on one capability across all 7 temperature values with 3 repetitions each; plot performance curve. 2) Selector validation: Train BERT classifier on 20% of your prompts, test whether predicted optimal T improves over default T=1.0 on held-out prompts. 3) Cross-precision check: Compare 4-bit vs. FP16 performance for your model on one high-sensitivity task to validate if temperature effects transfer.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What is the theoretical or mathematical explanation for how temperature affects model performance? The authors conclude that "a mathematical explanation of how temperature affects model performance requires further investigation," as the study relies on empirical correlations without formal theoretical framework.

- Can the proposed BERT-based temperature selector generalize effectively to model sizes and architectures beyond those tested? The conclusion states that "More testing is needed to determine whether the optimal temperature selector is effective for other models of similar or larger sizes," as it was only validated on three models.

- How does temperature influence capabilities not covered in this study, such as planning and coding? The authors note they "examined only the effect of temperature on six text-based ability; additional abilities, such as planning and coding, could also be evaluated in future work."

## Limitations

- The temperature selector's practical utility is limited, showing mixed results across model sizes with degradation for medium models
- LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation method introduces potential evaluator bias, though the study primarily examines relative performance differences
- Findings rely on 4-bit AWQ quantization, which may not generalize to other quantization methods or full precision

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The mathematical relationship between temperature scaling and output distribution
- The observation that optimal temperatures vary by task type
- The finding that larger models show higher mutation temperatures and lower performance variance

**Medium Confidence:**
- The magnitude of performance variation across temperature settings
- The BERT selector's effectiveness on SuperGLUE tasks
- The comparative performance between 4-bit AWQ and FP16 precision

**Low Confidence:**
- The generalizability of optimal temperature ranges across different model families
- The exact impact of temperature on nuanced reasoning capabilities
- The long-term stability of temperature-based optimization strategies

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Architecture Validation**: Test whether the identified optimal temperature ranges transfer consistently to different model families (e.g., test Llama 3.1 findings on Mistral or Qwen models of similar sizes).

2. **Real-World Task Generalization**: Evaluate the temperature selector on domain-specific tasks like code generation, medical text analysis, or legal document processing to assess practical utility beyond benchmark tasks.

3. **Dynamic Temperature Adjustment**: Implement and test a system that adjusts temperature mid-generation based on context (e.g., lowering temperature for factual statements, raising it for creative elaboration) to determine if adaptive approaches outperform static settings.
