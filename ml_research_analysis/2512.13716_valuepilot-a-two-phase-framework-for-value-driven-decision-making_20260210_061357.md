# ValuePilot: A Two-Phase Framework for Value-Driven Decision-Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13716
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13716
- Reference count: 40
- ValuePilot achieves 73.16% order-sensitive similarity with human decisions and 46.14% first-action accuracy, significantly outperforming LLM baselines

## Executive Summary
ValuePilot introduces a novel approach to personalized AI decision-making by explicitly modeling human values rather than task-oriented goals. The framework employs a two-phase methodology: first generating value-annotated decision scenarios through human-LLM collaboration, then training a Decision-Making Model (DMM) to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences. The system demonstrates superior performance in aligning AI decisions with human choices, achieving 73.16% order-sensitive similarity compared to baseline models.

The framework addresses the fundamental challenge of creating AI systems that make decisions reflecting individual human values rather than optimizing for generic task completion. By incorporating the PROMETHEE multi-criteria decision-making method and a Value Assessment Network, ValuePilot provides interpretable, generalizable, and personalized decision-making capabilities that outperform traditional LLM-based approaches in value alignment tasks.

## Method Summary
ValuePilot operates through a two-phase framework that separates scenario generation from decision evaluation. In the first phase (DGT), the system uses a human-LLM collaborative pipeline to create decision scenarios annotated with relevant human values. The second phase (DMM) employs a Value Assessment Network trained on these annotated scenarios to learn how individuals prioritize different values when making decisions. The system uses the PROMETHEE method to rank potential actions based on their alignment with personal value preferences. The framework is designed to be generalizable across different decision contexts while maintaining personalization through value-based learning rather than task-specific optimization.

## Key Results
- DMM achieved 73.16% order-sensitive similarity with human decisions and 46.14% first-action accuracy
- Outperformed strong LLM baselines including GPT-5 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in value-driven decision tasks
- Demonstrated 20-30% improvement over baseline models in both order-sensitive similarity and first-action accuracy metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ValuePilot succeeds by explicitly modeling the underlying human value systems that drive decision-making rather than optimizing for task completion. The framework captures the nuanced way individuals weigh different values in specific contexts through its Value Assessment Network, which learns from human-LLM annotated scenarios. The PROMETHEE method provides a systematic way to rank actions based on multi-criteria value alignment, making the decision process both interpretable and personalized.

## Foundational Learning
- **Value Annotation Process**: Human-LLM collaboration generates realistic scenarios with explicit value tags, necessary for training data quality and ensuring scenarios reflect genuine human decision contexts
- **PROMETHEE Method**: A multi-criteria decision-making approach that ranks alternatives based on pairwise comparisons, required for systematic value-based action evaluation
- **Value Assessment Network**: Learns individual value preferences from annotated scenarios, essential for personalization beyond generic decision rules
- **Order-Sensitive Similarity**: Evaluates how well AI decisions match human decision sequences, important for measuring true decision alignment rather than just final outcomes
- **Multi-Criteria Decision Making**: Balances multiple competing values simultaneously, needed because real decisions rarely optimize for single objectives

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** DGT (Scenario Generation) -> Value Annotation -> DMM (Decision-Making Model) -> Value Assessment Network -> PROMETHEE Ranking

**Critical Path:** Human input → LLM scenario generation → Value annotation → DMM training → Value Assessment Network → PROMETHEE evaluation → Decision output

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational efficiency for interpretability and personalization, choosing a two-phase approach over end-to-end learning to maintain transparency in how values influence decisions.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor scenario generation quality leads to misaligned value annotations; insufficient training diversity causes overfitting to specific decision contexts; value representation limitations result in oversimplification of complex human preferences.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate scenario generation quality through human evaluation of LLM-generated scenarios
2. Test Value Assessment Network performance with varying amounts of training data
3. Compare PROMETHEE-based ranking against alternative multi-criteria decision methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Reliance on LLM-generated value-annotated scenarios introduces potential biases and quality concerns without ground truth validation
- Limited evaluation dataset (20 test scenarios) raises concerns about overfitting and generalizability
- Framework assumes discrete value representation, potentially oversimplifying nuanced and context-dependent human value systems

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Technical implementation and architectural design are well-documented and methodologically sound

**Medium Confidence:** Performance metrics showing DMM's superiority are credible but should be interpreted cautiously due to limited evaluation data

**Low Confidence:** Claims about generalizability to novel scenarios and true value alignment require further validation through real-world deployment

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-cultural validation studies with diverse participant pools to assess framework performance across different value systems
2. Implement human-in-the-loop testing where DMM recommendations are evaluated through real decision-making tasks
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify contribution of each component and identify potential bottlenecks
