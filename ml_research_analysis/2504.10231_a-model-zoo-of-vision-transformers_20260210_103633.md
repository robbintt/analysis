# A Model Zoo of Vision Transformers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.10231
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10231
- Reference count: 31
- First comprehensive model zoo containing 250 Vision Transformer models with systematic variations across learning rates, optimizers, and initialization seeds

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive model zoo dedicated to Vision Transformers (ViTs), addressing a significant gap in existing model zoos that primarily focus on convolutional neural networks. The zoo contains 250 unique ViT-S models generated through a novel two-stage training protocol that combines pre-training and fine-tuning steps. The dataset is validated through extensive diversity analysis and demonstrates strong performance on standard vision benchmarks, achieving up to 72.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1k and 85.1% on CIFAR-100.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce a two-stage training protocol for generating the model zoo. The first stage involves pre-training models with fixed hyperparameters, while the second stage fine-tunes these models across multiple variations including different learning rates (3e-3, 1e-3, 1e-4), optimizers (AdamW, SGD), classification heads (linear, MLP), and initialization seeds. This systematic approach produces 10 pre-trained models and 240 fine-tuned models, enabling comprehensive diversity analysis and enabling new applications such as model lineage prediction and model weights averaging.

## Key Results
- Successfully created the first model zoo containing 250 diverse Vision Transformer models
- Models achieve up to 72.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1k and 85.1% on CIFAR-100
- Demonstrated distinct behavioral modes and weight-space variations through diversity analysis
- Preliminary experiments show promising results for model weights averaging and lineage prediction applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The systematic generation of diverse models through controlled hyperparameter variations enables robust population-based analysis of Vision Transformers. By varying learning rates, optimizers, and initialization seeds across a standardized architecture (ViT-S), the zoo captures the full spectrum of model behaviors and performance characteristics that emerge from different training configurations.

## Foundational Learning

### Vision Transformers
- **Why needed**: ViTs have emerged as powerful alternatives to CNNs for vision tasks, requiring specialized analysis approaches
- **Quick check**: Understanding self-attention mechanisms and patch embeddings in ViTs

### Model Zoos
- **Why needed**: Collections of trained models enable population-based analysis and meta-learning approaches
- **Quick check**: Familiarity with model diversity metrics and population analysis techniques

### Two-Stage Training
- **Why needed**: Separates backbone learning from task-specific adaptation, enabling more systematic variation
- **Quick check**: Understanding pre-training vs fine-tuning dynamics and their impact on final performance

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
ViT-S Backbone -> Pre-training Stage -> Fine-tuning Stage -> Diversity Analysis -> Performance Evaluation

### Critical Path
The critical path involves the two-stage training protocol: pre-training establishes the foundational transformer weights, while fine-tuning adapts these weights across hyperparameter variations to generate the diverse model population.

### Design Tradeoffs
- Focused exclusively on ViT-S architecture for consistency vs exploring multiple transformer variants
- Balanced model diversity with computational feasibility (250 models vs potentially thousands)
- Prioritized systematic hyperparameter variation over architectural innovation

### Failure Signatures
- Inconsistent performance across fine-tuning variants may indicate sensitivity to initialization or optimization choices
- Limited diversity in weight space could suggest insufficient hyperparameter variation
- Poor lineage prediction accuracy might indicate inadequate model diversity or insufficient training

### First Experiments
1. Replicate diversity analysis using different metrics to validate behavioral distinctions
2. Test model weights averaging across different backbone architectures
3. Evaluate lineage prediction accuracy using various feature extraction methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the preliminary nature of model weights averaging and lineage prediction experiments suggests opportunities for further investigation in these areas.

## Limitations
- Results are limited to ViT-S architecture, limiting generalizability to other transformer variants
- Model weights averaging experiments are preliminary with limited evaluation across diverse downstream tasks
- Diversity analysis relies on available metrics without establishing which measures best capture meaningful behavioral differences

## Confidence
- Dataset construction and diversity results: High
- Performance benchmarks: Medium  
- Averaging and lineage prediction experiments: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the zoo's models across additional vision benchmarks beyond ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-100 to test generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies on the two-stage training protocol to isolate contributions of pre-training versus fine-tuning variations
3. Systematically test model weights averaging across different initialization schemes and backbone architectures to establish robust protocols
