# Teach Me Sign: Stepwise Prompting LLM for Sign Language Production

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.10972
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10972
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: First method using off-the-shelf LLM for sign language production, achieving 18.7% and 20.9% improvements on Phoenix14T and How2Sign datasets respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TEAM-Sign, the first approach to leverage off-the-shelf large language models for sign language production without requiring gloss supervision. The key innovation is a stepwise prompting strategy that extracts the LLM's internal sign language knowledge to guide generation. By encoding sign language videos into discrete tokens via VQ-VAE and mapping them to spoken language using LLM reasoning, the method effectively bridges the modality gap between sign and spoken language. Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over strong baselines on standard sign language datasets.

## Method Summary
TEAM-Sign employs a stepwise prompting strategy to extract sign language knowledge from large language models without requiring gloss supervision. The method first encodes sign language videos into discrete tokens using a VQ-VAE, then leverages the LLM's reasoning ability to map these tokens to spoken language. Auxiliary sequences are generated through carefully designed prompts to improve alignment between modalities. This approach eliminates the need for parallel sign-spoken language corpora while maintaining generation quality through the LLM's inherent linguistic knowledge.

## Key Results
- Outperforms strong baseline by 18.7% on Phoenix14T dataset
- Achieves 20.9% improvement on How2Sign dataset
- Demonstrates effective bridging of sign-spoken language modality gap using LLM reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the LLM's internal knowledge of sign language structure through stepwise prompting, which extracts latent linguistic patterns without requiring explicit gloss annotations. The VQ-VAE discretizes continuous sign video into manageable token sequences that the LLM can process through its reasoning mechanisms. The stepwise prompting strategy guides the LLM to generate auxiliary sequences that align visual-spatial sign features with spoken language representations, effectively translating between modalities while preserving semantic content.

## Foundational Learning
- **VQ-VAE tokenization**: Converts continuous sign video into discrete tokens for LLM processing - needed for bridging continuous visual data with discrete language models; quick check: verify token reconstruction quality
- **Stepwise prompting**: Systematic extraction of LLM's sign language knowledge through sequential prompts - needed to access internal linguistic representations; quick check: test prompt sensitivity
- **Modality alignment**: Mapping between visual-spatial sign features and linguistic representations - needed to preserve meaning across different data types; quick check: evaluate cross-modal consistency

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Sign Video -> VQ-VAE -> Discrete Tokens -> LLM (Stepwise Prompting) -> Spoken Language Output

**Critical Path**: VQ-VAE tokenization → LLM reasoning → Spoken language generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses off-the-shelf LLM (accessible but limited by model knowledge) vs. fine-tuning (requires resources but customizable); discrete tokenization (computationally efficient) vs. continuous processing (more nuanced but complex)

**Failure Signatures**: Tokenization errors propagate through LLM; prompt engineering sensitivity affects output quality; modality alignment issues cause semantic drift

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Ablation study removing stepwise prompting to quantify its contribution
2. Cross-linguistic validation on Japanese Sign Language to test generalizability
3. Human evaluation comparing generated signs with professional interpreter productions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- VQ-VAE tokenization may not capture all sign language nuances, introducing systematic representation errors
- Stepwise prompting requires careful engineering that may not transfer across different sign languages or cultural contexts
- Evaluation metrics borrowed from speech/text domains may not fully capture visual-spatial quality of sign language

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Technical implementation details and dataset results are well-documented and reproducible; performance improvements clearly demonstrated on Phoenix14T and How2Sign datasets

**Medium confidence**: Claim about eliminating gloss supervision partially supported but may overstate practical independence from linguistic resources

**Medium confidence**: Assertion about LLM reasoning effectively bridging modality gap is promising but requires validation across diverse sign languages

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-linguistic validation on sign languages with different grammatical structures (e.g., Japanese Sign Language, German Sign Language) to assess generalizability beyond tested languages

2. Perform comprehensive human evaluation studies comparing generated sign sequences with professional sign language interpreters' productions to validate automated metric correlations with perceptual quality

3. Test model's robustness on sign language variants, including regional dialects and age-specific signing styles, to evaluate adaptability to linguistic diversity within sign languages
