# A Privacy-Preserving Cloud Architecture for Distributed Machine Learning at Scale

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10341
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10341
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: PACC-Health integrates federated learning, differential privacy, ZKPs, and RL governance for scalable, compliant ML in healthcare without centralizing patient data.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents PACC-Health, a cloud-native privacy-preserving architecture for distributed machine learning in healthcare. It integrates federated learning, differential privacy, zero-knowledge compliance proofs, and adaptive governance via reinforcement learning to enable secure, scalable, and verifiable model training and inference without centralizing sensitive patient data. The architecture addresses the challenge of deploying AI systems across heterogeneous, multi-cloud environments while ensuring compliance with HIPAA and GDPR. Experiments across clinical tasks show that models maintain utility under privacy constraints (e.g., X-ray AUROC drops from 0.92 to 0.87 under ε=2), membership-inference attacks are reduced from 39% to 7.5% success rate, and the RL controller improves privacy enforcement by 64%. ZKP verification adds less than 20 ms overhead, and end-to-end latency increases from 102 ms to 134 ms with privacy controls enabled. The framework provides a practical foundation for trustworthy, compliant, and adaptive distributed machine learning at scale.

## Method Summary
PACC-Health is a cloud-native architecture that enables distributed machine learning in healthcare without centralizing sensitive patient data. The system combines federated learning with secure aggregation, differential privacy, zero-knowledge proofs for compliance verification, and reinforcement learning-based governance. The architecture is deployed on hybrid Kubernetes clusters using KubeFed for federation and Istio for service mesh security. TensorFlow Federated handles model training across institutions, Opacus and TensorFlow Privacy inject differential privacy noise, and zk-SNARKs generate compliance proofs. An RL agent using PPO dynamically adjusts privacy parameters based on real-time telemetry to balance accuracy, privacy risk, and latency. The system processes clinical data via FHIR adapters and enforces policies through OPA/Gatekeeper.

## Key Results
- Model utility maintained under privacy constraints: X-ray AUROC drops from 0.92 to 0.87 under ε=2
- Membership-inference attacks reduced from 39% to 7.5% success rate under differential privacy
- RL controller improves privacy enforcement by 64% and reduces policy violations by 81%
- ZKP verification adds less than 20 ms overhead; end-to-end latency increases from 102 ms to 134 ms with privacy controls enabled

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Federated learning with secure aggregation enables collaborative model training across healthcare institutions without exposing raw patient data.
- Mechanism: Each institution computes local model updates on premises; updates are encrypted and aggregated via secure multi-party computation using weighted averaging (Formula 1: w_t+1 = Σ(n_i/n_total) × w_t^i). The aggregation coordinator receives only the combined result, preventing reconstruction of institution-specific gradients.
- Core assumption: Participating institutions follow the prescribed training protocol (honest-but-curious threat model); adversaries do not poison model updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "supports secure model training and inference without centralizing sensitive data"
  - [Section V.A] "secure aggregation protocols that prevent the central coordinator from reconstructing client-specific information"
  - [corpus] Related work on federated learning confirms feasibility but notes limited evaluation in production settings; corpus evidence for this specific architecture is weak (no direct citations yet)
- Break condition: If institutions become malicious and submit poisoned updates, the basic aggregation mechanism does not detect or filter them—additional Byzantine-resistance would be required.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Differential privacy provides quantifiable protection against membership inference and model inversion attacks while maintaining clinically useful model performance.
- Mechanism: Gaussian noise calibrated to sensitivity is injected into gradients during training (Formula 2: g̃ = g + N(0, σ²)) and into output logits during inference. Privacy budget (ε) is tracked and enforced at the compliance layer, preventing cumulative leakage across queries.
- Core assumption: The noise scale σ² correctly balances the privacy-utility tradeoff for the target clinical task; the privacy budget is not exhausted prematurely.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Key outcome] "membership inference risk drops from 39% to 7.5% under differential privacy"
  - [Table I] Model performance under ε=2 shows modest degradation (X-ray AUROC: 0.92→0.87) while maintaining clinical viability
  - [corpus] Related work on cloud-native homomorphic encryption workflows (arxiv:2510.24498) addresses similar privacy-utility tradeoffs but with different cryptographic primitives
- Break condition: If privacy budget is depleted or noise is misconfigured (too low), protection degrades; if noise is too high, model utility becomes clinically unusable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reinforcement learning–driven governance adapts privacy controls in real time to reduce policy violations and leakage risk.
- Mechanism: A PPO-based RL agent treats governance as a Markov decision process, consuming telemetry (privacy leakage signals, accuracy, latency, policy violations, cross-border flows) and dynamically adjusting ε, access rules, and federation participation. The reward function (Formula 3: R = αA - βP - γL) balances accuracy (A), privacy risk (P), and latency (L).
- Core assumption: Telemetry signals accurately reflect true privacy risk and system state; the reward function coefficients (α, β, γ) are correctly tuned for the operational context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Key outcome] "RL controller reduces policy violations by 81%"
  - [Section VI] "controller reduces policy violations by 81% and lowers privacy leakage risk by 64% compared to static configurations"
  - [corpus] Corpus does not contain comparable RL-driven governance systems for privacy-preserving ML; evidence is architecture-specific
- Break condition: If telemetry is spoofed, delayed, or incomplete, the RL agent may make suboptimal or harmful adjustments; reward hacking could cause the agent to game metrics rather than improve true privacy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Differential Privacy (DP) fundamentals**
  - Why needed here: Understanding ε (privacy budget), δ (failure probability), and noise calibration is essential to interpret Table I and configure the privacy layer correctly.
  - Quick check question: Given ε=2, would you expect higher or lower noise than ε=4? What happens to model accuracy?

- Concept: **Federated Learning workflow and secure aggregation**
  - Why needed here: The architecture relies on clients training locally and submitting encrypted updates; you must understand why raw data never leaves institutions.
  - Quick check question: If an adversary intercepts an aggregated update from 10 hospitals, can they reconstruct any single hospital's gradients? Why or why not?

- Concept: **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) basics**
  - Why needed here: ZKPs enable compliance verification without exposing PHI; you need to understand what is proved vs. what remains hidden.
  - Quick check question: A ZKP certifies that a DP budget threshold was met. Does the auditor learn the actual ε consumed, or just that it was below the limit?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Cloud Execution Layer: Hybrid Kubernetes (KubeFed), Istio service mesh, FHIR ingestion adapters
  - AI/Analytics Layer: TensorFlow Federated, Opacus/TF Privacy for DP, secure aggregation
  - Privacy/Compliance Layer: zk-SNARKs for ZKP verification, OPA/Gatekeeper policy enforcement
  - Governance Layer: PPO-based RL agent, Prometheus/OpenTelemetry telemetry

- Critical path:
  1. Data enters via FHIR adapters through Istio-secured service mesh
  2. Local model training with DP noise injection at each institution
  3. Encrypted updates aggregated via secure MPC
  4. ZKPs generated to certify compliance; verified in isolated namespace
  5. RL agent monitors telemetry and adjusts ε, access rules, federation settings via OPA

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Privacy vs. utility: Lower ε improves protection but degrades accuracy (Table I)
  - Latency vs. verifiability: ZKP adds ~142 ms generation / <20 ms verification overhead
  - Static vs. adaptive: RL governance adds complexity but reduces violations; requires stable telemetry

- Failure signatures:
  - Membership inference success >15%: DP noise likely misconfigured or budget exhausted
  - ZKP verification >100 ms: Check proof generation batch size or consider hardware acceleration
  - RL controller oscillation: Reward function coefficients may need retuning; check telemetry quality

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline FL without DP: Measure model accuracy and membership inference risk to establish reference.
  2. FL with DP at ε=4, ε=2: Compare accuracy degradation and inference attack resistance (target: <10% membership inference at ε=2).
  3. Enable RL governance: Run 800+ iterations, confirm convergence, and measure policy violation reduction (target: >70% improvement over static config).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the reinforcement learning governance framework be extended to a multi-agent paradigm where institutions autonomously negotiate privacy budgets and compliance constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Future Work section states the framework "could be extended to a multi-agent paradigm in which institutions autonomously negotiate privacy budgets."
- Why unresolved: The current prototype utilizes a centralized PPO-based controller, lacking the logic for decentralized negotiation between autonomous agents representing different institutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of stable equilibrium convergence in a multi-agent simulation where agents with conflicting utility functions successfully negotiate privacy parameters.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the architecture effectively support scalable, differentially private federated fine-tuning for emerging foundation models in imaging and multimodal diagnostics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Future Work section identifies "Emerging foundation models" as presenting "new challenges for scalable, differentially private federated fine-tuning."
- Why unresolved: The experimental evaluation is limited to specific clinical tasks (X-ray, ECG, lab values) and does not test the massive parameter counts or complex multimodal structures of foundation models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance and latency benchmarks when applying the PACC-Health pipeline to a large-scale foundation model (e.g., a medical vision transformer or LLM).

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific mechanisms are required to defend the federated learning component against model poisoning and inconsistent client behavior in a malicious environment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Discussion notes that federated learning "could benefit from additional defenses against adversarial manipulation, including poisoning attacks," which were not addressed in the evaluation.
- Why unresolved: While the Threat Model mentions malicious actors, the experimental results focus on membership inference and policy violations rather than robustness against gradient poisoning or Byzantine attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results quantifying model accuracy degradation under simulated poisoning attacks to verify the system's resilience beyond the honest-but-curious threat model.

## Limitations

- **Federated Learning Deployment**: No field deployment data provided; assumes honest-but-curious participants without Byzantine fault tolerance or model poisoning detection.
- **Differential Privacy Calibration**: Hyperparameters not disclosed, making reproducibility and optimization difficult for clinical stakeholders.
- **RL Governance Reproducibility**: Reward function weights and hyperparameters unspecified, preventing independent verification of claimed 64% reduction in privacy leakage risk.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Federated learning + secure aggregation mechanism is well-established and architectural integration is logically sound. ZKP verification overhead (<20 ms) is credible.
- **Medium Confidence**: Membership inference reduction (39%→7.5%) is plausible based on DP theory but depends on undisclosed attack models and dataset characteristics. 81% reduction in policy violations via RL is plausible but not independently verifiable.
- **Low Confidence**: Clinical utility thresholds are vaguely defined; "clinically viable" performance is asserted but not validated against specific clinical decision thresholds or regulatory standards.

## Next Checks

1. **DP Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Systematically vary σ and clipping norm to map the full privacy-utility frontier. Document the exact settings that achieve ε=2 with the reported 0.87 AUROC to establish reproducibility.

2. **Robustness to Malicious Participants**: Implement and test a Byzantine-robust federated aggregation variant (e.g., Krum or Bulyan) and measure its impact on model accuracy and privacy guarantees under simulated poisoning attacks.

3. **RL Controller Transferability**: Evaluate the RL governance agent on a held-out clinical task or dataset to test whether the learned policies generalize beyond the training distribution, and measure sensitivity to reward function tuning.
