# Evaluating LLM-Generated Q&A Test: a Student-Centered Study

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.06591
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06591
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** LLM-generated Q&A tests match human-authored assessments in psychometric quality and perceived user satisfaction.

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that LLM-generated Q&A tests can match human-authored assessments in psychometric quality and perceived user satisfaction. Using GPT-4o-mini, 17 usable NLP course items were generated with mean discrimination a = 0.75 and mean difficulty b = −4.31, comparable to expert-written benchmarks. Student-perceived quality averaged 3.8/5, expert-perceived quality 4.5/5, and 45 examinees showed moderate positive correlation (r = 0.48) between exam scores and item ratings. Differential Item Functioning analysis flagged two items for review, indicating some subgroup bias. The findings support using AI-assisted assessment pipelines in higher education, provided bias checks and refinement protocols are integrated.

## Method Summary
The study employed a systematic approach to generate and evaluate LLM-created assessment items for an NLP course. GPT-4o-mini was used to generate test items following a structured prompt template. These items underwent statistical validation including item difficulty and discrimination metrics, DIF analysis for subgroup bias, and comparative expert evaluation against human-authored items. Student satisfaction was measured through post-test surveys. The validation framework integrated psychometric testing with user perception metrics to assess both technical quality and educational acceptability.

## Key Results
- LLM-generated items achieved mean discrimination a = 0.75 and mean difficulty b = −4.31, comparable to expert benchmarks
- Student-perceived quality averaged 3.8/5, expert-perceived quality 4.5/5
- 45 examinees showed moderate positive correlation (r = 0.48) between exam scores and item ratings
- DIF analysis flagged two items for review, indicating some subgroup bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLM-generated Q&A tests work effectively because they leverage large-scale pattern recognition from training data to create diverse, contextually appropriate assessment items. The systematic prompting approach ensures consistency in item structure and difficulty calibration. The dual evaluation framework combining psychometric metrics with user satisfaction provides comprehensive quality assessment that captures both technical validity and educational effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning
- **Item Response Theory**: Why needed - to evaluate psychometric properties of test items; Quick check - can you calculate item difficulty and discrimination parameters?
- **Differential Item Functioning**: Why needed - to identify potential bias across examinee subgroups; Quick check - can you interpret DIF analysis results?
- **Psychometric validation**: Why needed - to ensure test items meet educational assessment standards; Quick check - can you distinguish between content validity and construct validity?
- **Prompt engineering**: Why needed - to generate consistent, high-quality LLM outputs; Quick check - can you design prompts that elicit specific item types?
- **Educational assessment design**: Why needed - to align test items with learning objectives; Quick check - can you map assessment items to specific course competencies?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: GPT-4o-mini -> Prompt Template -> Item Generation -> Psychometric Analysis -> DIF Analysis -> Expert Review -> Student Survey

Critical path: Item Generation -> Psychometric Analysis -> Expert Review -> Student Survey

Design tradeoffs: Using GPT-4o-mini balances computational efficiency with output quality, while the systematic validation framework ensures quality control despite potential LLM variability.

Failure signatures: Low item discrimination (a < 0.3), high DIF values (>0.5), significant score-rating correlation (<0.3), or low user satisfaction ratings (<3.0) indicate problematic items requiring revision.

First experiments:
1. Generate a small batch of 5 items using the established prompt template
2. Calculate basic psychometric metrics (difficulty and discrimination) for generated items
3. Conduct expert review comparing LLM items to human-authored benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size of 17 items and 45 examinees limits generalizability of psychometric validation
- Single course context and AI model constrain external validity to other disciplines and LLMs
- Expert ratings notably higher than student ratings suggest potential evaluator bias

## Confidence
- Psychometric comparability to human-authored benchmarks: Medium
- Practical applicability of AI-assisted pipeline: High
- Broader educational impact: Low

## Next Checks
1. Replication with larger, diverse course samples and multiple AI models to assess generalizability
2. Longitudinal studies tracking student performance and learning outcomes beyond immediate test scores
3. Expanded DIF analysis with larger, more diverse examinee populations to identify and mitigate subgroup biases systematically
