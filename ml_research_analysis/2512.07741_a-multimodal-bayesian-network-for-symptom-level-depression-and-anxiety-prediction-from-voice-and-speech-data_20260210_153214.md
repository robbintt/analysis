# A multimodal Bayesian Network for symptom-level depression and anxiety prediction from voice and speech data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.07741
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07741
- Reference count: 40
- Model predicts depression and anxiety symptoms from voice and speech data with ROC-AUC scores of 0.842 for depression and 0.831 for anxiety

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a Bayesian network model that predicts depression and anxiety symptoms from voice and speech data using multimodal acoustic and linguistic features. The model integrates predictions from three types of surrogate models (reading-MM, mood-audio, mood-linguistic) trained on over 30,000 speakers to estimate both overall condition status and individual symptom severity levels. The discrete Bayesian Network architecture enables explainable predictions, direct clinician intervention through do-operations, and demonstrated demographic fairness across age, gender, and ethnicity groups. The model achieves symptom-level performance above 0.74 for core symptoms while maintaining calibration error below 0.05.

## Method Summary
The model extracts acoustic embeddings via TRILLsson5 (1024-dim), speech timing features (3-dim), linguistic embeddings via ModernBERT-base (768-dim), and NLP features via spaCy (25-dim) from two speech tasks: reading "The North Wind and the Sun" and describing mood over past two weeks. Forty-five surrogate neural networks (3 per symptom) compress these features into symptom-level probability scores using Optuna-tuned hyperparameters via nested cross-validation. A discrete Bayesian Network with literature-informed structure integrates these predictions, with parameters estimated using BDeu priors (equivalent_sample_size=8000). Condition probabilities are calibrated using bagged IsotonicRegression (N=10) trained on a separate calibration set, with inference performed via Variable Elimination.

## Key Results
- Achieved ROC-AUC scores of 0.842 for depression and 0.831 for anxiety
- Symptom-level performance above 0.74 for core symptoms (low mood, anhedonia, sleep issues, low energy)
- Demonstrated demographic fairness across age, gender, and ethnicity groups with ECE ≤0.05

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Surrogate models compress high-dimensional multimodal features into tractable symptom-level predictions that a Bayesian Network can efficiently integrate. Neural networks trained on binary symptom targets reduce 1024-dim acoustic embeddings and 768-dim linguistic embeddings into single probability scores per symptom, preserving modality-specific signal while enabling discrete BN inference. Core assumption: The compression preserves sufficient symptom-relevant information; no critical signal is lost in dimensionality reduction.

### Mechanism 2
The Bayesian Network architecture enables principled arbitration between noisy multimodal inputs by learning conditional probability distributions that weight more informative signals higher. During parameter estimation, the network learns which surrogate predictions carry stronger signal for each symptom (e.g., mood-audio weighted higher than reading-MM for sleep issues), combining them via learned CPDs rather than fixed fusion rules. Core assumption: The network structure correctly captures symptom-to-symptom and symptom-to-condition relationships.

### Mechanism 3
Enforcing multimodal redundancy (requiring each symptom informed by at least one paralinguistic input) creates robustness to single-modality failures. Architecture constraint prevents over-reliance on linguistic features (vulnerable to disclosure patterns, vocabulary differences), ensuring acoustic/timing features provide backup signal. Core assumption: Paralinguistic features carry condition-relevant signal even when linguistic content is uninformative or misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- **Bayesian Network conditional probability distributions (CPDs)**: The entire model relies on understanding how parent node states influence child node probability distributions. Quick check: If P(Symptom=severe | SurrogateA=high, SurrogateB=low) = 0.7, what does this tell you about the model's belief?
- **Variable Elimination inference**: At prediction time, the model must query the network with observed surrogate outputs to compute posterior probabilities for unobserved nodes. Quick check: Why can't we simply read off condition probability directly from the network without performing inference?
- **Expected Calibration Error (ECE) vs discrimination (ROC-AUC)**: The paper emphasizes both metrics; understanding their independence is critical for evaluating clinical usefulness. Quick check: Can a model have ROC-AUC = 0.95 but ECE = 0.20? What would this mean clinically?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Speech Activities → Feature Extraction → Surrogate Models (×45) → Bayesian Network → Calibrators → Output
- **Critical path**: Mood task → linguistic surrogate → BN symptom nodes → condition probability (highest performance path for most symptoms)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Discrete BN chosen for efficient exact inference (requires quartile discretization, loses granularity); literature-informed vs data-driven structure (hybrid approach avoids pure structure learning fragility); compound vs binary condition targets (compound definition improved surrogate training but requires diagnosis history)
- **Failure signatures**: Concentration and restlessness show lower ROC-AUC (~0.67-0.68); equalized odds ratio differences for anxiety between birth sex groups (0.251); performance drops if mood-linguistic surrogate fails but doesn't collapse due to paralinguistic backup
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Ablation by surrogate type**: Query BN with only reading-MM, only mood-audio, only mood-linguistic to confirm redundancy claims
  2. **Do-operation simulation**: Implement clinician-intervention workflow by setting symptom nodes to observed values and measuring impact on condition probabilities
  3. **Demographic stratified evaluation**: Replicate fairness analysis on target population to identify calibration drift

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does model performance remain robust when validated against clinician-provided diagnostic labels rather than self-reported questionnaires? [explicit] Future validation efforts incorporating and testing against clinician-provided diagnostic labels and symptom estimates would therefore be valuable. Unresolved because current study relied on self-reported measures (PHQ-8 and GAD-7) and self-reported diagnostic history to facilitate large-scale data collection (N=30,135), which may not perfectly align with clinical assessment. What evidence would resolve it: A validation study comparing model outputs against structured clinical interviews (e.g., SCID) or clinician-rated symptom severity scales in a clinical sample.

### Open Question 2
Can the inclusion of cognitive task data improve the prediction accuracy for specific symptoms like concentration problems and restlessness? [explicit] Some symptoms may benefit from augmentation of the network with non-speech data sources: for example cognitive task data may provide additional information about concentration problems and restlessness symptoms. Unresolved because current speech-based model showed relatively lower discrimination performance for concentration (ROC-AUC 0.667) and restlessness (ROC-AUC 0.680) compared to core symptoms like low mood. What evidence would resolve it: An experiment integrating performance metrics from cognitive tasks (e.g., n-back tasks) into the Bayesian Network to determine if ROC-AUC scores for these specific symptoms improve significantly.

### Open Question 3
How robust is the model to variations in accent and language proficiency, specifically in non-first-language English speakers? [explicit] Additional testing of output robustness to a wider range of accent types, and in non-first language speakers, would be important prior to deployment. Unresolved because current dataset was restricted to first-language English speakers residing in the US or UK to control for linguistic variability during model development. What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of model calibration and discrimination metrics on a held-out test set comprising non-native English speakers and speakers with diverse regional accents.

### Open Question 4
Do sex-specific calibration strategies or training data stratification effectively mitigate the observed bias in anxiety prediction equalized odds? [explicit] This difference warrants further attention and may benefit from mitigation strategies such as sex-based stratification... and/or sex-specific calibration strategies. Unresolved because observed bias appears driven by differing base rates and true positive rates between males and females in the training data, which the current global calibration did not fully address. What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of model fairness metrics (specifically equalized odds) using models retrained with sex-stratified data or recalibrated using sex-specific isotonic regression layers.

## Limitations

- Discrete Bayesian Network discretization (quartile bins) may lose granular signal from surrogate predictions, potentially underestimating symptom severity gradations
- Model performance on non-US/UK populations and non-English speakers remains unvalidated; cultural differences in symptom expression could limit applicability
- Compound condition definitions (PHQ≥10 plus self-reported diagnosis) may not capture undiagnosed or untreated cases, creating potential sampling bias

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core prediction pipeline and reported performance metrics (ROC-AUC 0.842 depression, 0.831 anxiety); discrete BN architecture and its ability to integrate multimodal predictions
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about built-in redundancy and sufficiency of paralinguistic backup features; need systematic ablation studies across diverse recording conditions
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to populations outside US/UK, non-English speakers, and populations with different cultural expressions of symptoms; fairness claims based on limited demographic breakdowns

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-population validation**: Test model performance on speech data from different countries, languages, and cultural contexts to assess generalizability beyond US/UK populations
2. **Recording quality robustness**: Evaluate model performance across varying audio quality conditions (background noise, different microphones, compression levels) to confirm paralinguistic redundancy claims
3. **Clinician intervention workflow**: Implement the do-operation simulation to verify that manual symptom adjustments produce sensible counterfactuals for condition probabilities in realistic clinical scenarios
