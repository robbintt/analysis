core_contribution: This paper tackles the problem of memory recall in large-scale
  memory-augmented AI assistants, focusing on the challenge of accurate retrieval
  when many similar memories accumulate. The core idea is to build an associative
  memory graph that links each memory utterance to automatically extracted clues (entities,
  events, topics) and connects related memories, enabling importance-aware ranking.

# AssoMem: Scalable Memory QA with Multi-Signal Associative Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.10397
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10397
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Improves recall@10 by 24.93% on average over baselines in memory-augmented QA

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurate memory retrieval in large-scale memory-augmented AI assistants, where accumulated similar memories create confusion during recall. The authors propose AssoMem, an associative memory graph approach that links memories to extracted clues (entities, events, topics) and connects related memories. The system uses importance-aware ranking via personalized PageRank and adaptive fusion of relevance, importance, and temporal signals using mutual information weighting. Experiments show significant improvements in recall@10 by 24.93% on average across three benchmarks and a newly introduced MeetingQA dataset.

## Method Summary
AssoMem constructs an associative memory graph that connects each memory utterance to automatically extracted clues and related memories. The retrieval score combines relevance, importance (computed via personalized PageRank on the graph), and temporal alignment, with adaptive weighting determined by mutual information. The approach addresses the challenge of distinguishing between many similar memories that accumulate over time, enabling more accurate retrieval for memory-augmented question answering. The system was evaluated on three existing benchmarks plus a newly introduced MeetingQA dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves 24.93% improvement in recall@10 over state-of-the-art baselines
- Demonstrates corresponding gains in QA accuracy and robustness to memory size
- Shows effectiveness across three benchmarks and newly introduced MeetingQA dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by creating richer semantic relationships between memories through clue extraction and graph connections, moving beyond simple keyword matching. The personalized PageRank importance ranking helps surface memories that are central to the user's knowledge graph rather than just topically relevant. The mutual information-driven adaptive fusion allows the system to dynamically weigh different signals based on their correlation with successful retrieval outcomes. Temporal alignment ensures recent and contextually appropriate memories are prioritized when relevant.

## Foundational Learning

**Personalized PageRank**: Importance ranking algorithm that computes node importance in graphs based on random walks - needed to identify central memories in the associative graph; quick check: verify convergence and sensitivity to damping factor

**Mutual Information**: Statistical measure of dependence between variables - used to adaptively weight retrieval signals based on their predictive power; quick check: validate MI estimates on validation data

**Clue Extraction**: Process of identifying entities, events, and topics from text - creates semantic anchors for memory connections; quick check: measure precision/recall of extracted clues

**Graph-based Retrieval**: Using graph structures instead of flat lists for information access - enables multi-hop reasoning between related memories; quick check: verify graph connectivity and path existence

**Temporal Alignment**: Incorporating time-based signals in retrieval - ensures recent and contextually appropriate memories are surfaced; quick check: validate temporal weighting effectiveness

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Query -> Clue Extractor -> Memory Graph -> Signal Fuser -> Retrieved Memories

Critical path: Query processing → clue extraction → graph traversal → signal fusion → ranked retrieval

Design tradeoffs: The system balances between comprehensive clue extraction (which adds computational overhead) and retrieval efficiency, while the adaptive fusion mechanism trades off simplicity for potentially better signal combination.

Failure signatures: Common failures include clue extraction errors leading to poor graph connectivity, personalized PageRank convergence issues on very large graphs, and suboptimal mutual information estimation when training data is limited.

First experiments to run:
1. Ablation study removing personalized PageRank to measure importance signal contribution
2. Fixed-weight fusion baseline to validate adaptive weighting benefits
3. Clue extraction quality analysis on a sample of memories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on only three existing benchmarks plus one newly introduced dataset, limiting generalizability
- Lacks extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of individual components
- Assumes static memory importance, potentially missing dynamic changes in user priorities over time

## Confidence
- Retrieval performance improvements (24.93% recall@10): Medium
- Multi-signal fusion effectiveness: Medium
- Scalability claims: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component (graph construction, PageRank importance, temporal alignment, adaptive fusion)
2. Evaluate performance across diverse memory domains to assess generalizability
3. Test the system's robustness to memory size scaling beyond the reported benchmarks, particularly for memory sets exceeding 1000 entries
