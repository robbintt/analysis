# SEAL: Speaker Error Correction using Acoustic-conditioned Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.08421
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08421
- **Reference count**: 38
- **Primary result**: SEAL reduces speaker error rates by 24-43% across Fisher, Callhome, and RT03-CTS datasets using acoustic-conditioned LLMs with constrained decoding

## Executive Summary
SEAL addresses speaker error correction in diarization systems by leveraging acoustic-conditioned large language models. The approach conditions LLMs with acoustic features from speaker diarization systems and employs constrained decoding to prevent hallucinations during speaker transitions and overlapping speech. The method achieves significant improvements over first-pass acoustic speaker diarization systems, with relative improvements of 24-43% in speaker error rates across multiple datasets.

## Method Summary
SEAL combines acoustic information from speaker diarization systems with large language models through a conditioning mechanism. The approach uses constrained decoding with a "Spkword" transcript format where speaker labels are mapped to specific tokens. During inference, the LLM generates speaker-corrected transcripts while respecting speaker identity constraints. The acoustic conditioning allows the model to better handle challenging scenarios like speaker transitions and overlapping speech where traditional diarization systems often fail.

## Key Results
- Reduces speaker error rates by 24-43% across Fisher, Callhome, and RT03-CTS datasets
- Achieves best performance using acoustic-conditioned LLMs with speaker scores mapped to labels
- Constrained decoding with "Spkword" format prevents hallucinations while maintaining correction accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by providing LLMs with rich acoustic context that traditional text-only models lack. By conditioning on speaker diarization outputs including speaker scores and acoustic features, SEAL enables the LLM to make more informed decisions about speaker identity during challenging segments. The constrained decoding mechanism ensures that speaker labels remain consistent with the acoustic evidence while the model corrects transcription errors, preventing the generation of hallucinated speaker identities that could degrade diarization quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Speaker diarization systems**: These systems identify "who spoke when" in audio recordings by partitioning speech into homogeneous segments. SEAL improves upon these systems by correcting their errors using LLMs, making it essential to understand how traditional diarization works to appreciate the enhancement.
- **Large language models**: Pre-trained models that can generate and understand natural language. SEAL leverages their strong language understanding capabilities while conditioning them on acoustic information to handle speaker-related tasks beyond pure text processing.
- **Constrained decoding**: A technique that restricts the output space of language models during generation. In SEAL, this prevents the LLM from hallucinating incorrect speaker labels while still allowing it to correct transcription errors, ensuring speaker consistency with acoustic evidence.
- **Acoustic conditioning**: The process of providing acoustic features or representations to a language model during inference. SEAL uses this to give the LLM access to speaker diarization outputs, enabling better handling of overlapping speech and speaker transitions.
- **Speaker error rates**: Metrics that quantify the accuracy of speaker identification and segmentation. SEAL's improvements are measured through reductions in these rates, making it crucial to understand how these metrics are computed and what they represent.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Speaker Diarization System -> Acoustic Features -> LLM Conditioning -> Constrained Decoding -> Speaker-corrected Output
- **Critical path**: Acoustic features from diarization system → LLM conditioning → constrained generation → final speaker-corrected transcript
- **Design tradeoffs**: The use of constrained decoding prevents hallucinations but may limit the model's ability to correct certain types of errors if speaker labels are incorrect in the first pass. Acoustic conditioning adds computational overhead but provides essential context for accurate speaker identification.
- **Failure signatures**: The system may propagate errors if initial speaker labels are incorrect, struggle with highly overlapping speech where acoustic separation is difficult, or fail when speaker characteristics are too similar to distinguish acoustically.
- **First experiments**: 1) Evaluate performance with and without acoustic conditioning to measure its contribution, 2) Test different transcript formats beyond "Spkword" to assess format sensitivity, 3) Measure real-time inference latency to evaluate deployment feasibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on English conversational telephone speech, limiting generalizability to other languages and domains
- Computational overhead of acoustic-conditioned LLMs is not discussed, which is critical for real-time applications
- Constrained decoding may propagate initial speaker labeling errors rather than correcting them

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The 24-43% relative improvement claims are well-supported by reported metrics across multiple datasets and clearly demonstrate SEAL's effectiveness over first-pass diarization
- **Medium confidence**: The claim of "significant reduction" in speaker error rates is supported but lacks absolute performance metrics and comparison to state-of-the-art systems
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that constrained decoding prevents hallucinations lacks empirical validation beyond relative performance metrics, with no qualitative analysis of corrected outputs

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SEAL on non-English datasets and different acoustic conditions (meetings, broadcast, noisy environments) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing SEAL with and without constrained decoding, and test alternative transcript formats beyond "Spkword"
3. Measure computational latency and resource requirements of SEAL in real-time diarization scenarios to assess deployment feasibility
