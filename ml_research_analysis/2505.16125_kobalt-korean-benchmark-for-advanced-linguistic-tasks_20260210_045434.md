# KoBALT: Korean Benchmark For Advanced Linguistic Tasks

- 700 multiple-choice questions across 24 linguistic phenomena in five domains evaluating Korean language understanding

## Executive Summary
KoBALT is a Korean language benchmark designed to evaluate true language understanding by mitigating data contamination. The benchmark consists of 700 multiple-choice questions spanning 24 linguistic phenomena across five domains: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. By focusing on Korean, a morphologically rich language, the benchmark addresses the need for comprehensive evaluation of language models in non-English contexts. The evaluation of 20 contemporary LLMs revealed significant performance disparities, with the highest-performing model achieving only 61% general accuracy, demonstrating the benchmark's discriminative power.

## Method Summary
The benchmark was constructed by developing 700 multiple-choice questions covering 24 distinct linguistic phenomena distributed across five domains of Korean language understanding. The questions were designed to assess both surface-level pattern recognition and deeper linguistic comprehension. The benchmark underwent validation through correlation with human judgments to establish its effectiveness as a discriminative measure. Evaluation was conducted on 20 contemporary LLMs, with performance metrics calculated for overall accuracy and domain-specific performance.

## Key Results
- Highest-performing model achieved 61% general accuracy across all questions
- Significant performance variations observed across the five linguistic domains
- Strong correlation established between benchmark results and human judgments
- Demonstrates discriminative power in distinguishing true language understanding from memorization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by targeting multiple levels of linguistic understanding through carefully designed multiple-choice questions. By covering 24 distinct linguistic phenomena across five domains, it forces models to demonstrate competence beyond simple pattern matching. The use of Korean, with its complex morphological structure, creates a challenging environment that requires genuine linguistic comprehension rather than reliance on statistical correlations common in English-based benchmarks.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Morphological Richness** - Korean's agglutinative structure requires understanding of morpheme combinations and their semantic contributions. Quick check: Ability to parse complex words into meaningful components.
2. **Syntactic Dependencies** - Korean's subject-object-verb structure demands tracking of long-range dependencies. Quick check: Correct identification of grammatical roles in complex sentences.
3. **Pragmatic Inference** - Korean's honorific system and context-dependent meanings require social and cultural understanding. Quick check: Appropriate interpretation of implied meanings and social cues.
4. **Phonological Patterns** - Understanding of sound patterns and their role in word formation. Quick check: Recognition of phonological constraints and allophonic variations.
5. **Semantic Composition** - Ability to understand how word meanings combine to create sentence meanings. Quick check: Correct interpretation of compound predicates and idiomatic expressions.
6. **Cross-Domain Transfer** - Integration of knowledge across syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Quick check: Application of grammatical knowledge to pragmatic interpretation tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Question Bank -> Domain Distribution -> Model Evaluation -> Performance Analysis -> Human Validation

**Critical Path:** Question Design → Domain Coverage → Model Testing → Performance Measurement → Validation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Multiple-choice format enables efficient evaluation but may not capture generative capabilities. Domain-specific questions provide detailed insights but require careful balance to ensure fair representation. Korean language focus ensures linguistic depth but limits cross-linguistic comparisons.

**Failure Signatures:** Models achieving high accuracy may be overfitting to specific patterns. Performance drops in certain domains indicate systematic weaknesses in linguistic understanding. Correlation with human judgments serves as validation against spurious correlations.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test models on individual domain subsets to identify systematic weaknesses
2. Evaluate performance on questions with varying complexity levels within each domain
3. Conduct ablation studies by removing morphological markers to assess their impact on comprehension

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to 20 contemporary LLMs, limiting generalizability
- Maximum 61% accuracy indicates significant performance gaps but doesn't specify optimal architectures
- Multiple-choice format may not fully capture Korean language understanding nuances
- Data contamination mitigation claims lack specific technical validation details

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Benchmark construction methodology is well-documented and reproducible; strong correlation with human judgments validates discriminative power.

**Medium Confidence:** Performance disparities across domains are reported but underlying causes require further investigation.

**Low Confidence:** Data contamination mitigation effectiveness is claimed but not substantiated with specific technical details.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-validation studies using models with varying architectural designs and training data compositions to verify benchmark's discriminative power across model types.

2. Perform ablation studies to determine whether performance differences across domains reflect genuine linguistic understanding gaps or are artifacts of question construction.

3. Implement and test proposed data contamination mitigation strategies using controlled experiments to verify their effectiveness in preventing model memorization.
