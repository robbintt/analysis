# Controllable Abstraction in Summary Generation for Large Language Models via Prompt Engineering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.15436
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15436
- **Reference count:** 27
- **Primary result:** Introduces controllable abstract summary generation method using prompt engineering with multi-stage framework showing ROUGE-N of 0.50, ROUGE-L of 0.46, BLEU of 0.45, and TER of 0.38 on CNN/Daily Mail dataset

## Executive Summary
This study presents a framework for generating summaries with controllable abstraction levels using prompt engineering for large language models. The approach employs semantic analysis, topic modeling, and noise control to construct prompts that guide summary generation. The framework demonstrates that optimal prompt length significantly impacts summary quality, with both very short and very long prompts degrading performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics while showing superior semantic matching, structural fidelity, and controllability compared to existing approaches.

## Method Summary
The method employs a multi-stage framework that first preprocesses input text through word segmentation and entity recognition to construct a semantic graph capturing core information structure. This graph guides prompt generation optimized through a multi-level objective function combining semantic matching, abstractness, and context adaptability objectives. A reinforcement learning-based policy optimization method evaluates prompt effectiveness using reward functions, enabling dynamic adjustment of prompt content and structure. The framework integrates these components within a multi-task learning architecture to generate summaries with varying abstraction levels.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with ROUGE-N of 0.50, ROUGE-L of 0.46, BLEU of 0.45, and TER of 0.38
- Optimal prompt length of 30-40 tokens significantly impacts summary quality, with both shorter and longer prompts decreasing performance
- Data noise negatively affects results, with ROUGE-L scores declining from 0.46 to 0.32 as noise increases to 0.1
- Different text types exhibit varying effects on model performance, with news articles yielding the best results and academic articles the worst

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Graph-Guided Prompt Generation
- Claim: Constructing a semantic graph from input text enables more targeted and semantically-aligned prompt generation for controllable summarization.
- Mechanism: Input text X undergoes preprocessing (word segmentation, entity recognition) to construct semantic graph G_sem via function f_sem. This graph captures entities, relations, and events, providing structured representation that guides prompt generation toward core content rather than surface features.
- Core assumption: Explicitly modeling semantic relationships as graph structures provides better guidance for prompt generation than processing raw text directly.
- Evidence anchors: The framework generates summaries with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic modeling, and noise control on the input text.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Level Objective Function for Abstraction Control
- Claim: A weighted combination of semantic matching, abstractness, and context adaptability objectives enables fine-grained control over summary abstraction levels.
- Mechanism: Prompt generation optimizes L = λ₁L_semantic + λ₂L_abstract + λ₃L_contextual. The hyperparameters λ₁, λ₂, λ₃ control tradeoffs between semantic fidelity to source, desired abstraction level, and contextual appropriateness.
- Core assumption: These three objectives are sufficient to capture key dimensions of controllable summarization and can be combined linearly without significant interaction effects.
- Evidence anchors: The framework generates summaries with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic modeling, and noise control.

### Mechanism 3: Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Policy Optimization
- Claim: Using RL reward functions to evaluate prompt effectiveness enables dynamic, task-aware adjustment of prompt content and structure.
- Mechanism: Generated summary Y_gen is evaluated against target output T via reward function R = f_reward(Y_gen, T). This reward signal provides feedback on summary quality, guiding policy updates for prompt generation.
- Core assumption: The reward function adequately captures human preferences for summary quality, and the RL policy can learn to maximize this reward through iterative feedback.
- Evidence anchors: We introduce a policy optimization method based on reinforcement learning, using a reward function to evaluate the effectiveness of prompts.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: ROUGE/BLEU/TER Evaluation Metrics**
  - Why needed here: The paper extensively reports these metrics (ROUGE-N=0.50, ROUGE-L=0.46, BLEU=0.45, TER=0.38) to demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.
  - Quick check question: If ROUGE-L increases from 0.40 to 0.46 while TER decreases from 0.45 to 0.38, what specific aspects of summary quality have improved?

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering for LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework builds on designing prompts that control abstraction levels. The paper demonstrates that prompt length significantly impacts quality (30-40 tokens optimal).
  - Quick check question: The paper finds ROUGE-L peaks at 30-40 tokens but drops for both shorter (10-20) and longer (50-60) prompts. What competing mechanisms might explain this inverted-U pattern?

- **Concept: Semantic Graph Construction**
  - Why needed here: The method constructs G_sem from input text via semantic analysis functions. This is the pipeline's first stage and constrains all downstream prompt quality.
  - Quick check question: For a news article about a corporate merger, what specific entity-relationship types should the semantic graph capture to support effective summarization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Text X -> Preprocessing Layer (word segmentation, entity recognition) -> Semantic Graph Construction (G_sem = f_sem(X)) -> Prompt Generator (Multi-objective: L = λ₁L_sem + λ₂L_abs + λ₃L_ctx) -> RL Policy Optimizer (R = f_reward(Y_gen, T)) -> Multi-Task Learning Framework (L_total = Σ λ_k × L_k) -> Generated Summary Y_gen

- **Critical path:** Preprocessing quality -> Semantic graph completeness -> Prompt relevance -> Summary abstraction control. If the semantic graph fails to capture key entities/relations, downstream prompt generation cannot recover lost information regardless of optimization quality.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Prompt length vs. quality: 30-40 tokens optimal; shorter loses context (ROUGE-L drops to ~0.38), longer introduces redundancy
  - Noise tolerance vs. performance: Clean data achieves ROUGE-L ~0.46; noise=0.1 drops to ~0.32 (30% degradation)
  - Domain adaptation: News performs best (BLEU 0.45), academic worst (0.38) — may require domain-specific preprocessing or weight tuning

- **Failure signatures:**
  - ROUGE-L < 0.35 on clean news data -> likely semantic graph construction failure or prompt length misconfiguration
  - Large performance variance across text types -> multi-task weights need domain-specific calibration
  - High TER with moderate BLEU -> summary captures content but requires substantial editing; check abstraction level settings

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Prompt length validation:** Sweep 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 token prompts on held-out CNN/Daily Mail subset; verify ROUGE-L peaks at 30-40 tokens as reported.
  2. **Noise sensitivity test:** Inject controlled noise (0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1) to inputs; confirm ROUGE-L degradation pattern before deploying to noisy real-world data.
  3. **Cross-domain baseline:** Test on academic papers and blog posts; compare BLEU against reported values (0.38 academic, 0.40 blog) to establish whether domain transfer requires architecture changes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can adaptive prompt-length mechanisms dynamically tailor input length based on text type or application scenario to optimize summarization quality?
  - Basis in paper: The discussion of Figure 2 states: "these insights... point toward future research directions, such as adaptive prompt-length mechanisms that dynamically tailor input length based on text type or application scenario."
  - Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates optimal prompt length varies (30-40 tokens for news), but the mechanism remains static and manually tuned, not adaptive.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing static vs. adaptive prompt-length strategies across multiple text domains, measuring ROUGE-L improvements when length is dynamically adjusted.

- **Open Question 2:** How can noise-resistant architectures sustain summary quality across varying noise conditions in input texts?
  - Basis in paper: The discussion of Figure 3 states: "Future work should explore adaptive techniques and noise-resistant architectures that sustain summary quality across varying noise conditions."
  - Why unresolved: The paper only documents noise sensitivity (ROUGE-L drops from 0.46 to 0.32 as noise increases to 0.1) without proposing solutions.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Architectural modifications or training strategies that maintain ROUGE-L within 5-10% of baseline performance under noise levels of 0.05-0.15.

- **Open Question 3:** Does the prompt engineering framework generalize effectively to specialized domains such as legal documents and medical literature?
  - Basis in paper: The conclusion states the method should be "tested on more types of texts, such as legal documents and medical literature, to evaluate its performance across different domains."
  - Why unresolved: The study only evaluates on CNN/Daily Mail (news articles), and results show academic articles perform worst (BLEU 0.38 vs. 0.45 for news), suggesting domain transfer challenges.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on legal and medical corpora (e.g., PubMed, case law datasets) showing comparable metrics to news domain performance.

- **Open Question 4:** Can combining large-scale unsupervised data training improve the model's ability to generate summaries for long-tail and rare text patterns?
  - Basis in paper: The conclusion identifies "combining large-scale unsupervised data training to improve the model's ability to generate summaries for long-tail texts will be key to improving summary generation quality."
  - Why unresolved: The current framework relies on supervised training with CNN/Daily Mail, limiting exposure to diverse text distributions and rare linguistic patterns.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments augmenting training with unsupervised data showing improved performance on underrepresented text types or vocabulary.

## Limitations

- **Implementation details missing:** The paper lacks specifications about the underlying LLM model, semantic graph construction methodology, and exact RL reward function formulation, making reproduction challenging.
- **Hyperparameter sensitivity unexplored:** The optimal prompt length (30-40 tokens) and multi-task learning weights are presented as fixed values without exploring their sensitivity to dataset characteristics or domain shifts.
- **Evaluation methodology gaps:** The paper doesn't address whether ROUGE, BLEU, and TER metrics adequately capture summary abstraction quality or semantic matching at different abstraction levels, nor their relationship to human judgment.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The observation that prompt length significantly impacts summary quality (with 30-40 tokens optimal) is well-supported by the data shown in Fig. 2.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim of "state-of-the-art performance" with ROUGE-N of 0.50 is reasonable given the metric values, though direct comparison to specific baseline models is limited.
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that the framework achieves "superior controllability" compared to existing approaches lacks comparative analysis or ablation studies demonstrating the specific contribution of each component.

## Next Checks

1. **Prompt Length Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct a controlled experiment sweeping prompt lengths from 10-60 tokens on a held-out CNN/Daily Mail subset to verify the reported ROUGE-L peak at 30-40 tokens and confirm the inverted-U relationship.

2. **Cross-Domain Performance Verification:** Test the framework on academic papers and blog posts to validate the reported BLEU scores (0.38 for academic, 0.40 for blogs) and assess whether domain-specific tuning is required for optimal performance.

3. **Noise Robustness Testing:** Systematically inject controlled noise levels (0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1) into input text and measure ROUGE-L degradation to confirm the 30% performance drop pattern observed in Fig. 3 before deploying to real-world noisy data.
