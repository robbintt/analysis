# Identification of Potentially Misclassified Crash Narratives using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.03066
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03066
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Primary result:** ALBERT model achieved 73% expert agreement on intersection-related crash classification, outperforming other ML/DL approaches

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates machine learning and deep learning methods for detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 Iowa crash data, five models (SVM, XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT Word Embeddings, and Albert) were trained and validated against expert reviews. The Albert Model achieved the highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original tabular data (58%), maintaining performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates. Multi-modal integration combining narrative text with structured data achieved a 54.2% reduction in error rates. The Albert Model significantly outperformed other approaches, particularly on ambiguous narratives, demonstrating that hybrid automated classification with targeted expert review offers a practical methodology for improving crash data quality and transportation safety management.

## Method Summary
The study used 2019 Iowa Department of Transportation crash data (58,566 total records) with five narrative columns concatenated into single strings. Models were trained on a stratified 2,000-crash sample using 70/30 train/test split. Five models were evaluated: SVM and XGBoost using bigram/TF-IDF features, and BERT/ALBERT using transformer embeddings. Performance was measured against expert review consensus and original tabular labels using F1-score, accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and McNemar's test. Multi-modal fusion combined narrative embeddings with structured crash data (geospatial coordinates, traffic control devices) to reduce error rates.

## Key Results
- ALBERT achieved highest expert agreement at 73% with Expert 1 (vs 66% for original labels)
- ALBERT maintained performance similar to inter-expert consistency rates (kappa ~0.39)
- Multi-modal integration achieved 54.2% error reduction by combining text with structured data
- ALBERT significantly outperformed other approaches on ambiguous narratives (p < 0.05)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
ALBERT's parameter-efficient architecture captures contextual nuances in ambiguous narratives better than traditional sparse representations or standard BERT configurations. By sharing parameters across layers, ALBERT effectively regularizes the model, forcing it to learn more robust, generalized representations of intersection features (e.g., "junction," "traffic light") rather than overfitting to specific lexical patterns. This allows it to distinguish between "at intersection" and "near intersection" with higher fidelity.

### Mechanism 2
Integrating structured tabular data (e.g., geospatial coordinates) with unstructured text reduces error rates by providing external "grounding" signal that resolves textual ambiguity. A hybrid fusion approach combines high-confidence explicit features from tabular data (like traffic control device presence) with semantic richness of text embeddings. When text model encounters "proximity reference" (e.g., "near intersection"), structured data acts as tie-breaker or prior probability.

### Mechanism 3
Upper bound of automated classification performance is constrained by inherent subjectivity of human expert agreement (inter-rater reliability). Since experts only achieved moderate agreement (Cohen's Kappa ~0.3-0.5) on ambiguous narratives, model trained on this data learns to mimic this "human noise ceiling." ALBERT performs well because it aligns with probabilistic human consensus rather than binary objective truth.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transformer Embeddings vs. Sparse Features (TF-IDF/Bigrams)**
  - Why needed: Study contrasts SVM (using bigrams) with ALBERT (embeddings). Bigrams count exact word pairs (e.g., "at intersection"), while embeddings capture semantic similarity (e.g., "junction" ≈ "intersection").
  - Quick check: If a narrative says "T-boned at the junction," which model type is more likely to correctly classify it based on semantic context alone?

- **Concept: Inter-rater Reliability (Cohen's Kappa)**
  - Why needed: Paper uses Kappa to prove model isn't just "accurate" against flawed label, but "agrees" with humans at rate comparable to humans agreeing with each other.
  - Quick check: If Expert A and Expert B only agree 60% of the time, is it possible for a model to validly achieve 95% accuracy against Expert A's labels?

- **Concept: Multi-modal Fusion (Hybrid Approach)**
  - Why needed: 54.2% error reduction came from combining text and tabular data. Need to understand that "Early Fusion" (concatenating inputs) vs. "Late Fusion" (averaging predictions) impacts model architecture differently.
  - Quick check: According to Section 3.6, which fusion strategy worked best for the Deep Learning models (ALBERT/BERT)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Crash Narrative + Crash Tabular Data -> Preprocessing (PII Removal, Tokenization, Embeddings) -> Model Layer (ML Path: XGBoost/SVM on Sparse Bigrams; DL Path: ALBERT/BERT on Dense Embeddings) -> Fusion Layer (Hybrid integration) -> Output (Probability + Ambiguity Flag)

- **Critical path:** Text preprocessing (specifically Ambiguity Detection Framework in Section 2.4) is critical path. If model cannot detect "proximity references" (e.g., "near intersection"), subsequent classification will default to high false positives.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Speed vs. Nuance: ALBERT offers +4% accuracy over XGBoost but requires 3 hours training vs. 12 minutes, and inference is 16x slower (8.4ms vs 0.5ms per sample)
  - Complexity vs. Interpretability: ML models (XGBoost) allow feature importance analysis. ALBERT is "black box," making it harder to explain why a crash was flagged to policy maker

- **Failure signatures:**
  - False Positive Spikes: Look for narratives containing "near," "approaching," or distance markers (e.g., "200 ft from"). Indicates model triggering on proximity references without context
  - Validation Divergence: If training accuracy rises (>90%) but validation drops, model is overfitting on specific officer reporting styles rather than crash features

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ambiguity Threshold Test: Train ALBERT on full dataset vs. filtered set excluding "Short/Incomplete" narratives (<25 words). Quantify accuracy delta to validate claim that ambiguity drives errors
  2. Fusion Ablation: Run model in "Narrative Only" mode vs. "Narrative + Geospatial" mode. Verify if error reduction matches claimed ~54% or relies entirely on location data
  3. Expert Ceiling Check: Calculate Cohen's Kappa between ALBERT and Expert 1 on "Clear" vs. "Ambiguous" subsets separately. Confirm model approaches human performance primarily on ambiguous cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question 1:** Does the Albert Model maintain its classification performance when applied to crash narratives from jurisdictions with different reporting standards or terminology?
  - Basis: Models were "trained and validated on data from a single state (Iowa), potentially limiting generalizability to jurisdictions with different reporting practices"
  - Why unresolved: Training data was localized to Iowa, model has not been tested on diverse reporting formats or dialects used by law enforcement in other states
  - What evidence would resolve it: Cross-validation study using crash narratives from multiple states with distinct reporting guidelines

- **Question 2:** Can Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT or LLaMA provide statistically significant performance advantage over Albert Model for this specific classification task?
  - Basis: Authors acknowledge that "more complex models like GPT or LLaMA might offer higher theoretical performance" but were not tested because selected models "represent practical approaches"
  - Why unresolved: Study prioritized computational efficiency and implementability over exploring theoretical performance ceiling of larger generative models
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative benchmark evaluating LLMs against Albert Model using same Iowa crash dataset

- **Question 3:** What specific explainability techniques can effectively resolve "black box" limitations of transformer models for regulatory compliance in transportation agencies?
  - Basis: Paper states Albert Model's "black box nature may complicate regulatory compliance or explanation of classification decisions"
  - Why unresolved: While study successfully improved accuracy, it did not develop or test methods to interpret why model made specific classifications
  - What evidence would resolve it: Integration of attention visualization or SHAP to map narrative features to classification outcomes

## Limitations

- Model performance may not generalize to other states or years due to potential overfitting to Iowa's specific narrative style and crash reporting conventions
- 54.2% error reduction via multi-modal fusion is contingent on assumption that tabular data itself is accurate, which paper acknowledges is uncertain
- Inter-expert agreement (Cohen's Kappa ~0.3-0.5) is low, suggesting task is inherently ambiguous; model performance is therefore bounded by human subjectivity rather than objective truth

## Confidence

- **High:** ALBERT outperforms traditional ML on ambiguous narratives (supported by statistical tests, p < 0.05)
- **Medium:** Multi-modal fusion achieves significant error reduction (mechanism plausible but dependent on tabular data quality)
- **Low:** Absolute performance numbers (73% expert agreement) are context-dependent and may not hold in different datasets or operational settings

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test:** Apply trained ALBERT model to crash narratives from different state or year to assess if performance drop is within acceptable bounds
2. **Tabular Data Quality Audit:** Manually review sample of original tabular labels (roadtype) to quantify how often "ground truth" itself is misclassified, isolating contribution of text vs. tabular errors
3. **Narrative Length Threshold:** Filter dataset to exclude narratives <25 words and retrain ALBERT; compare performance to full dataset to validate claim that ambiguity (not just length) drives errors
