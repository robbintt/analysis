# Constructing Safety Cases for AI Systems: A Reusable Template Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22773
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22773
- Reference count: 40
- The study proposes a reusable safety-case template framework for AI systems, addressing limitations of classical engineering safety cases that rely on deterministic, specification-driven logic.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a reusable safety-case template framework specifically designed for AI systems, addressing the limitations of classical engineering safety cases that rely on deterministic, specification-driven logic. AI systems, especially generative and frontier models, exhibit emergent, context-dependent behaviors that evolve through fine-tuning and deployment, making traditional safety-case logic insufficient. The framework introduces comprehensive taxonomies for AI-specific claim types (assertion-based, constrained-based, capability-based), argument types (demonstrative, comparative, causal/explanatory, risk-based, normative), and evidence families (empirical, mechanistic, comparative, expert-driven, formal methods, operational/field data, model-based). Each claim type, argument function, and evidence category is linked through explicit reasoning logics (deductive, inductive, abductive, statistical, analogical). The framework also provides end-to-end patterns addressing AI-specific challenges such as evaluation without ground truth, continuous model updates, and threshold-based risk decisions. A case study on an AI-based tender evaluation system demonstrates the practical application of the marginal-risk pattern without ground truth, showing the AI-human configuration performs no worse than the human-human baseline with 2.8% inconsistency versus 3.0%, and within acceptable tolerance thresholds. The approach enables systematic, composable, and adaptive safety cases for evolving AI systems.

## Method Summary
The framework was developed through a systematic literature review of 112 primary studies, identifying gaps in existing safety-case approaches for AI systems. The methodology involved constructing comprehensive taxonomies for claims (assertion-based, constrained-based, capability-based), argument functions (demonstrative, comparative, causal/explanatory, risk-based, normative), and evidence families (empirical, mechanistic, comparative, expert-driven, formal methods, operational/field data, model-based). Each element is linked through explicit reasoning logics (deductive, inductive, abductive, statistical, analogical). The framework was validated through a case study using an AI-based tender evaluation system with GPT-4o, comparing AI+human reviewer performance against human-human baseline using 200 synthetic tender cases. The study demonstrated non-inferiority with 2.8% inconsistency versus 3.0% baseline, within acceptable tolerance thresholds.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive taxonomies for AI-specific claim types, argument functions, and evidence families with explicit reasoning logics
- Four end-to-end patterns addressing AI-specific challenges: discovery-driven, marginal-risk, continuous-evolution, and threshold-comparator
- Case study demonstrating marginal-risk pattern: AI-human configuration performs no worse than human-human baseline with 2.8% inconsistency versus 3.0%, within acceptable tolerance thresholds
- Framework enables systematic, composable, and adaptive safety cases for evolving AI systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured CAE taxonomy enables systematic composition of AI safety arguments.
- Mechanism: The taxonomy decomposes safety reasoning into orthogonal dimensions—claim types (assertion-based, constrained-based, capability-based), argument functions (demonstrative, comparative, causal, risk-based, normative), and evidence families (empirical, mechanistic, comparative, etc.). This separation allows practitioners to mix-and-match elements based on available evidence and system characteristics, reducing ad-hoc argument construction.
- Core assumption: Claims, arguments, and evidence can be meaningfully categorized and composed without losing the context-dependent nature of AI safety reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The framework introduces comprehensive taxonomies for AI-specific claim types, argument types, and evidence families, "each linked through explicit reasoning logics (deductive, inductive, abductive, statistical, analogical)."
  - [section 4.2, Table 5] Adaptation of CAE elements shows conditional claims, multi-modal reasoning, and heterogeneous evidence for AI systems.
  - [corpus] Related work on control safety cases (Korbak et al.) similarly structures arguments around specific assurance goals but with narrower scope.
- Break condition: If claim-argument-evidence categories are not truly orthogonal (the paper admits "overlap across categories is expected"), composability may degrade into classification theater without improving argument quality.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Marginal-risk pattern provides defensible safety justification when ground truth is absent.
- Mechanism: Instead of proving absolute safety, the pattern establishes non-inferiority to a comparator system (e.g., human-human baseline). Multi-dimensional proxy metrics (predictability, capability, game-based) triangulate safety through statistical comparison and confidence bounds.
- Core assumption: The comparator system represents an acceptable safety baseline, and proxy metrics reliably capture safety-relevant dimensions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Case study shows "AI-human configuration performs no worse than the human-human baseline with 2.8% inconsistency versus 3.0%, and within acceptable tolerance thresholds."
  - [section 5.2] Marginal-risk pattern explicitly addresses "evaluation without ground truth" through comparative inductive reasoning and statistical non-inferiority testing.
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence for marginal-risk patterns specifically; most related safety case work focuses on absolute or control-based arguments.
- Break condition: If the comparator baseline is itself unsafe or poorly characterized, marginal reasoning propagates rather than reduces uncertainty.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic safety cases maintain validity through versioned traceability and continuous monitoring.
- Mechanism: The continuous-evolution pattern links safety claims to live Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs) and governance artifacts. Changes trigger revalidation rather than invalidating the entire argument, supporting "living artefact" maintenance.
- Core assumption: Monitoring metrics and governance processes can be sufficiently automated or routinized to keep pace with AI system evolution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3] Pattern specifies "rolling SPI indicators within pre-declared acceptance bounds" and "audit trail confirming revalidation and approval."
  - [section 7] Limitations explicitly note "continuous evidence overload from real-time operational data" and "computational complexity of automatically updating argument structures" as open challenges.
  - [corpus] Dynamic safety case concepts appear in related work (Cârlan et al., Habli et al.) but operational tooling remains nascent.
- Break condition: If monitoring infrastructure cannot detect behavior changes or if update cycles outpace governance review, the safety case becomes stale or falsely reassuring.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Claims-Arguments-Evidence (CAE) structure**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework builds on CAE decomposition; without understanding that claims are propositions, arguments are reasoning links, and evidence is factual support, the taxonomy is meaningless.
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish a claim ("the system is safe") from its supporting argument ("because it passed stress tests") and underlying evidence ("test report dated X showing Y results")?

- Concept: **Deductive vs. inductive vs. abductive reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The framework assigns different reasoning logics to different argument types (e.g., deductive for control arguments, inductive for comparative arguments, abductive for root-cause analysis). Misapplying logic weakens assurance credibility.
  - Quick check question: Given evidence that "100 test runs showed no failures," which reasoning mode justifies the claim "the system is safe"—and what are its limitations?

- Concept: **Non-inferiority testing and marginal risk**
  - Why needed here: The marginal-risk pattern relies on statistical demonstration that a new system is "no worse than" a baseline within a tolerance threshold. Understanding confidence intervals, delta thresholds, and comparator selection is essential for practical application.
  - Quick check question: If an AI system has 2.8% error rate vs. human baseline of 3.0%, with threshold δ=5% and α=0.95, what does this prove and what does it not prove?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Claim taxonomy: 3 types (assertion-based, constrained-based, capability-limited) defining what safety propositions can be asserted
  - Argument taxonomy: 6 function types plus 5 reasoning logics, defining how claims connect to evidence
  - Evidence taxonomy: 7 families defining what constitutes valid support
  - Pattern library: 4 composable patterns (discovery-driven, marginal-risk, continuous-evolution, threshold-comparator) for recurring challenges
  - Pipeline ecosystem: Builder → Validator → Registry for lifecycle governance

- Critical path:
  1. Identify applicable claim type(s) based on system characteristics and available evidence
  2. Select argument functions matching evidence availability and reasoning requirements
  3. Gather evidence from appropriate families, ensuring quality criteria (representativeness, recency, reproducibility)
  4. Compose patterns as needed; most real systems require 2+ patterns combined
  5. Establish versioning and monitoring for continuous-evolution capability

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Composability vs. auditability**: More modular patterns increase reuse but can fragment argument coherence
  - **Statistical rigor vs. practical feasibility**: Tight confidence bounds require more data than many deployments can provide
  - **Dynamic updates vs. governance overhead**: Living safety cases require ongoing human review capacity

- Failure signatures:
  - Claims drift from evidence (unsupported assertions)
  - Reasoning logic mismatches (e.g., using deductive logic for emergent behaviors)
  - Comparator contamination (baseline is not independent)
  - Threshold arbitrage (selecting thresholds post-hoc to pass)
  - Monitoring gaps (SPIs don't capture actual failure modes)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the marginal-risk pattern to a simple AI classification task with human baseline data; compute non-inferiority statistics and document reasoning chain
  2. Construct a capability-limited claim for an LLM application (e.g., tool-use constraints), then identify what evidence would be required to support it and where gaps exist
  3. Simulate a model update scenario; trace which safety case elements would need revalidation and what SPI threshold changes would trigger review

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can dynamic safety cases be scaled to continuously evolving frontier AI systems while maintaining rigorous assurance documentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 states that "implementing them at the scale of frontier AI systems will require automation infrastructure, tooling standards, and agreement on trusted data pipelines for live safety indicators."
- Why unresolved: There is a fundamental mismatch between rapid, non-deterministic AI evolution and the need for rigorous, stable assurance documentation; continuous evidence overload and computational complexity of automatic argument structure updates remain unsolved.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrated implementations of automated, scalable dynamic safety case systems for production frontier AI models with measurable latency, completeness, and traceability metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent can LLMs reliably generate accurate and traceable AI safety case components without human verification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 notes that recent studies "show that LLMs can create the structural parts of safety case elements... though they have difficulty with accuracy and traceable evidence without human checking."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a "hybrid human-AI assurance paradigm" direction but does not quantify accuracy thresholds or characterize which CAE components LLMs handle well versus poorly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation benchmarks comparing LLM-generated CAE elements against expert-constructed safety cases, with metrics for accuracy, completeness, and traceability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can uncertainty be formally propagated across heterogeneous reasoning modes (deductive, inductive, abductive, statistical, analogical) in composite AI safety arguments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 identifies "formalising uncertainty propagation between reasoning modes" as a priority for future research. Section 4.4.2 discusses integrative reasoning but does not provide formal mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: Each reasoning logic has distinct validity conditions and uncertainty characteristics; the framework lacks a formal calculus for combining confidence across modes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal uncertainty propagation model with mathematical properties (e.g., soundness, compositionality) validated through case studies with quantified confidence bounds.

## Limitations

- The framework's dynamic safety case maintenance capability is largely theoretical, with the paper identifying continuous evidence overload and computational complexity as open challenges
- The 2.8% vs 3.0% inconsistency metric in the case study represents a marginal difference that may not generalize to more complex or safety-critical domains
- The taxonomy's claimed orthogonality is explicitly noted as potentially overlapping, raising questions about composability guarantees

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The claim that structured CAE decomposition enables systematic composition of AI safety arguments is well-supported by the explicit taxonomy construction and literature review synthesis. The argument types and evidence families demonstrate clear logical separation.

**Medium confidence**: The marginal-risk pattern's practical applicability depends heavily on comparator quality and proxy metric reliability. While the case study demonstrates technical feasibility, real-world safety-critical applications may face greater uncertainty.

**Low confidence**: The framework's dynamic safety case maintenance capability is largely theoretical, with the paper identifying continuous evidence overload and computational complexity as open challenges. No production-scale implementation evidence exists.

## Next Checks

1. **Comparator baseline validation**: Test the marginal-risk pattern with intentionally degraded comparator systems to verify the pattern fails gracefully when baselines are unsafe, rather than propagating uncertainty.

2. **Taxonomy orthogonality test**: Apply the framework to two different AI systems (e.g., vision vs. language) and measure overlap rates in claim-argument-evidence assignments to empirically assess composability claims.

3. **Continuous monitoring stress test**: Simulate model updates with varying frequencies and magnitudes; measure argument structure update times and identify thresholds where governance review cannot keep pace with system evolution.
