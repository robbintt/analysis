# A Universal Banach--Bregman Framework for Stochastic Iterations: Unifying Stochastic Mirror Descent, Learning and LLM Training

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14216

- A universal Banach-Bregman framework that unifies stochastic mirror descent, learning algorithms, and LLM training through non-Euclidean geometry

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a universal Banach-Bregman framework that unifies stochastic mirror descent, learning algorithms, and large language model training. By replacing Hilbert-space inner products with general Banach-Bregman geometry, the framework extends convergence theory to non-Euclidean settings including mirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning, and KL-regularized LLM training. The framework rigorously justifies super-relaxations (λ>2) for the first time in non-Hilbert spaces and demonstrates up to 20% faster convergence across diverse domains.

## Method Summary
The framework introduces a unified theoretical foundation based on Banach-Bregman geometry, where stochastic iterations are analyzed through Bregman-Fejér monotonicity. It extends classical stochastic optimization theory by replacing Euclidean inner products with general Bregman divergences, enabling flexible geometries tailored to specific problem structures. The approach provides rigorous convergence guarantees spanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated across machine learning benchmarks, deep learning architectures, reinforcement learning algorithms, and LLM training tasks.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated up to 20% faster convergence compared to classical baselines
- Validated across machine learning (UCI), deep learning (transformers), reinforcement learning (actor-critic), and LLMs (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2)
- Reduced variance and enhanced accuracy in stochastic optimization tasks
- First rigorous justification of super-relaxations (λ>2) in non-Hilbert spaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by replacing Euclidean geometry with general Banach-Bregman geometry, allowing optimization to adapt to problem-specific structures through appropriate choice of Bregman divergence. This enables better handling of constraints, sparsity, and non-convex landscapes. The introduction of Bregman-Fejér monotonicity provides a unifying principle that generalizes classical convergence theory to these broader geometric settings.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Banach-Bregman Geometry** - Why needed: Extends optimization beyond Euclidean spaces to handle constraints and structured problems; Quick check: Verify that the chosen Bregman divergence is proper, convex, and differentiable
2. **Bregman-Fejér Monotonicity** - Why needed: Generalizes classical Fejér monotonicity to Banach-Bregman settings; Quick check: Confirm that the monotonicity condition holds for the specific divergence and iteration scheme
3. **Super-relaxations (λ>2)** - Why needed: Provides acceleration beyond classical relaxation parameters; Quick check: Validate that the super-relaxation maintains convergence while improving rates
4. **Stochastic Mirror Descent** - Why needed: Handles constrained optimization through mirror maps; Quick check: Ensure the mirror map is proper and essentially smooth
5. **KL-regularized Training** - Why needed: Enables principled handling of probability distributions in LLMs; Quick check: Verify KL divergence is well-defined and finite for the distributions involved

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Problem Structure → Bregman Divergence Selection → Iteration Scheme → Convergence Analysis → Empirical Validation

Critical Path: Choose appropriate Bregman divergence based on problem constraints → Implement stochastic iteration with chosen geometry → Verify Bregman-Fejér monotonicity → Apply convergence theorem → Validate empirically

Design Tradeoffs: 
- Flexibility in geometry choice vs computational overhead
- Theoretical guarantees vs practical implementation complexity
- Acceleration through super-relaxations vs stability concerns

Failure Signatures:
- Divergence of iterates (indicates improper Bregman divergence choice)
- Oscillatory behavior (suggests violation of monotonicity conditions)
- Slow convergence (may indicate suboptimal geometry selection)

3 First Experiments:
1. Implement stochastic mirror descent on simplex constraints using KL divergence
2. Apply super-relaxation (λ=2.5) to a convex learning problem and compare convergence
3. Test KL-regularized training on a small transformer with WikiText-2 subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumption of Bregman-Fejér monotonicity may not hold in all practical scenarios
- Applicability to highly non-convex deep learning landscapes remains partially validated
- Practical benefits of super-relaxations need more systematic exploration across problem classes

## Confidence
High confidence in theoretical foundations extending classical convergence theory to non-Euclidean settings
Medium confidence in empirical validation due to limited experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies on Banach-Bregman geometry choice across different problem types to quantify impact on convergence rates and solution quality
2. Test framework robustness to noisy gradients and non-stationary objectives typical in real-world stochastic optimization
3. Implement and evaluate framework on larger-scale LLM training tasks (beyond WikiText-2) to assess scalability and practical advantages over established optimizers
