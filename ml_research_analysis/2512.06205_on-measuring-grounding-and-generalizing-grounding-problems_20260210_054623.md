# On measuring grounding and generalizing grounding problems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.06205
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06205
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces a systematic audit framework across five grounding desiderata (authenticity, preservation, faithfulness, robustness, compositionality) to measure semantic alignment and causal warrant, enabling precise diagnosis of grounding failures across symbolic systems, LLMs, and natural language.

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses the symbol grounding problem by operationalizing it as an audit across five desiderata rather than a binary judgment. It introduces a grounding profile framework that quantifies semantic alignment and causal warrant through evaluation tuples indexing context, meaning type, threat model, and reference distribution. Applied to model-theoretic semantics, LLMs, and natural language, the framework shows how different systems achieve various combinations of desiderata, enabling systematic investigation of grounding across philosophy, computer science, linguistics, and mathematics.

## Method Summary
The framework operationalizes grounding through five desiderata: authenticity (mechanisms reside inside the agent), preservation (atomic symbols map accurately to concepts), faithfulness (composition rules preserve meaning), robustness (graceful degradation under perturbations), and compositionality (systematic generalization). Each desideratum is indexed by an evaluation tuple E = (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution) and measured via specific parameters in a grounding profile. The method includes formal definitions for metrics like the modulus of continuity for robustness and average causal effect for etiological faithfulness, with systematic evaluation procedures for testing compositionality versus systematicity.

## Key Results
- Replaces binary "is-grounded" judgments with a diagnostic grounding profile across five desiderata
- Shows symbolic systems achieve perfect composition but lack etiological warrant, while LLMs exhibit correlational fit but fail selection-for-success on world tasks
- Introduces formal framework distinguishing internal acquisition (G0-strong) from external stipulation (G0-weak) via Chinese Room thought experiment
- Provides common language for philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians to investigate grounding systematically

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Desiderata Decomposition converts grounding from binary to profile
Replacing a binary "is-grounded" judgment with an audit across multiple desiderata yields a grounding profile that can diagnose specific failure modes rather than delivering a single verdict. Each desideratum is formalized as a measurable constraint parameterized by an evaluation tuple E = (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution). The resulting profile GP(G;E) = {ε_pres, ε_faith, ACE(M), ω_U, δ_comp, β} locates the system within a typology of archetypes (e.g., "parrot," "brittle expert," "fluent empty"). Core assumption: Meaning can be decomposed into independently measurable components indexed by context and meaning type.

### Mechanism 2: Authenticity constraint blocks semantic smuggling via G0-weak vs G0-strong
The authenticity requirement distinguishes systems that possess meaning from systems where meaning is stipulated by external analysts. G0-weak requires Φ and Γ implemented causally inside the agent. G0-strong further requires acquisition under process T relevant to evaluated tasks. This separates Searle's Chinese Room (external rulebook, G0-weak only) from genuine internal grounding. Post-hoc assignment of meaning violates authenticity. Core assumption: There exists a meaningful distinction between internal acquisition and external stipulation that can be verified from observable evidence.

### Mechanism 3: Modulus of continuity formalizes robustness as graceful degradation
Robustness can be quantified via a modulus ω_U(ε) that bounds semantic drift under perturbations of scale ε, distinguishing systems that degrade smoothly from those that fail catastrophically. For threat model U and reference distribution P, the condition Pr[sup_{ε(u)≤ε} d_k,t(S(r), S(u·r)) ≤ ω_U(ε)] ≥ 1-α measures whether meaning degrades gracefully. Uniformly discrete systems (symbolic) have degenerate step-function moduli. The dimensionality reduction R^64 → R^2 in neural systems provides structural dampening independent of accuracy. Core assumption: Perturbations can be meaningfully scaled and semantic distance d_k,t has a well-defined (pseudo)metric.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Evaluation Tuple E = (k, t, U, P)**
  - Why needed here: All grounding claims are indexed; a system may be well-grounded at (k_embodied, ext) but poorly grounded at (k_logic, inf). Comparing systems requires matching tuples.
  - Quick check question: Can you state the context, meaning type, threat model, and reference distribution for your grounding claim before asserting it?

- **Concept: Average Causal Effect (ACE) for etiological faithfulness (G2b)**
  - Why needed here: G2b distinguishes "lucky" systems (high accuracy from spurious correlations) from "competent" systems (accuracy underwritten by selected-for mechanisms). ACE requires E[Pr(succ|do(M=on)) − Pr(succ|do(M=off))] ≥ η.
  - Quick check question: If you ablate mechanism M, does task success drop by at least η_k,t? If you cannot intervene, can you bound ACE via retrain-without-M or invariance tests?

- **Concept: Compositional deviation (δ) vs. Systematicity (β)**
  - Why needed here: δ measures whether the algebra holds on seen compositions; β measures generalization to held-out combinations. A system can have low δ (perfect algebra) but low β (fails on novel forms) if it memorized training compositions.
  - Quick check question: Does your system correctly compose meanings it has seen, and does that composition generalize to unseen combinations of familiar atoms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Σ (surface symbols) → Φ (encoder) → R (representations, metric d_R) → Γ (concept constructor) → C (concepts, metric d_C) → A_k^t (alignment) → M_k^t (meanings, metric d_k,t) → I_k^t (intended interpretation)
- **Critical path**: 1) Define evaluation tuple E for your domain; 2) Verify G0: Are Φ, Γ implemented inside the agent?; 3) Measure G1 preservation error ε_pres on atomic vocabulary; 4) Measure G2a faithfulness error ε_faith on composed expressions; 5) Characterize G3 robustness modulus ω_U(ε); 6) Assess G4 compositional deviation δ and systematicity β on held-out combinations
- **Design tradeoffs**: Symbolic modes: Perfect composition (δ ≈ 0), brittle robustness (step-function ω), fails G2b without selection history. Vectorial modes: Smooth ω, approximate δ, strong G2a for linguistic tasks but limited G2b for world-referential tasks without grounded signals. Referential modes: Strong G2b for embodied tasks, weaker for abstractions lacking extensional anchors.
- **Failure signatures**: "Parrot": High G2a, low G2b/G4 → lookup table, pattern-matching without causal warrant or systematic structure. "Calculator": High G4, low G1 → correct algebra applied to miscalibrated atoms, systematic error. "Glass canon": High G2a, low G3 → accurate under standard conditions, catastrophic collapse under noise. "Fluent empty": High G3/G4 for linguistic tasks, low G2b for ext tasks → text-only LLMs on world-referential evaluation. "Drifter": Low G1 → atomic miscalibration cascades through composition.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run preservation audit: Compute ε_pres = d_k,t(A_k^t Ψ(σ), I_k^t(σ)) for all σ ∈ Σ_atom under declared (k, t). 2) Estimate robustness modulus: Sample representations r ~ P, apply perturbations u from threat model U at scales ε ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0}, compute semantic drift d_k,t(S(r), S(u·r)), fit ω_U(ε). 3) Test systematicity on held-out compositions: Create D_novel with unseen combinations of familiar atoms, compute β = proportion within tolerance τ.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can valid pseudo-metrics be defined for social-normative meanings (t=soc), such as dialogue commitments or normative statuses? The paper asks how to metrize the space of dialogue commitments, normative statuses, or politeness violations. Why unresolved: While metrics exist for extensional or vectorial settings, no consensus exists for operationalizing "distance" in social space, limiting the framework's applicability to this meaning type. What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of repair-cost metrics or scalar human judgments that correlate with defined tolerances (ε) for social grounding tasks.

### Open Question 2
How finely should evaluation contexts (k) be individuated to ensure grounding parameters are both measurable and meaningful? The framework requires context-indexing, but overspecifying k risks pushing the complexity into the context definition rather than addressing semantic flexibility intrinsically. Why unresolved: The framework requires context-indexing, but overspecifying k risks pushing the complexity into the context definition rather than addressing semantic flexibility intrinsically. What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing whether fine-grained context definitions significantly improve the stability of grounding profiles over coarse-grained ones across diverse linguistic tasks.

### Open Question 3
What systematic methodology determines which grounding profile parameters are acceptable for specific downstream tasks? The paper states there is no systematic theory for determining which parameters matter for which tasks, despite partial grounding sufficing for many applications. Why unresolved: The paper provides the measurement vocabulary (the profile) but leaves the engineering standard for "adequacy" undefined, relying instead on domain-specific judgment. What evidence would resolve it: A formal mapping that links specific grounding profile configurations to failure rates in distinct application domains like medical diagnosis or robotic control.

## Limitations

- The framework's dependence on evaluation tuples E = (k, t, U, P) means grounding claims are only meaningful within declared contexts and cannot adjudicate unmeasured desiderata
- The authenticity constraints (G0-weak vs G0-strong) rely on philosophically contested assumptions about internal vs. external meaning assignment that remain unverifiable from observable evidence
- The robustness quantification via modulus ω_U(ε) requires metrics d_k,t that may not exist for many meaning types, particularly social-normative meanings

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The desiderata decomposition mechanism and compositionality vs. systematicity distinction are well-supported by formal definitions and toy examples
- **Medium confidence**: The authenticity constraints rest on philosophically contested assumptions about internal vs. external meaning assignment
- **Low confidence**: The robustness quantification requires metrics d_k,t that may not exist for many meaning types, making the framework's claim to handle "all meaning types" aspirational

## Next Checks

1. **Test robustness across meaning types**: Apply the framework to evaluate robustness (G3) on three distinct meaning types—embodied (spatial navigation), linguistic (word embeddings), and social-normative (ethical judgments). Document where metrics d_k,t exist versus where they fail, and assess whether the framework's claims about handling "all meaning types" hold in practice.

2. **Validate ACE estimation methods**: Compare ACE estimates obtained through direct intervention (ablating mechanisms) versus proxy methods (retrain-without-M, invariance tests) on a controlled grid-world task. Measure the correlation between methods and document cases where binary ACE shows zero despite mechanistic causal influence, testing the framework's recommendation to use continuous distance measures instead.

3. **Benchmark profile resolution**: Create a suite of systems ranging from pure symbolic calculators to multimodal LLMs and apply the full grounding profile audit. Measure the pairwise distinguishability of profiles and test whether desiderata are sufficiently independent or whether failures cascade, limiting diagnostic resolution.
