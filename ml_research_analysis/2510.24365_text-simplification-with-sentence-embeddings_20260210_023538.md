# Text Simplification with Sentence Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24365
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24365
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: A small feed-forward network learns to transform complex-to-simple sentence embeddings, achieving competitive results with only 8M parameters compared to larger Seq2Seq and LLM baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to text simplification that operates entirely in sentence embedding space. Rather than generating simplified text through token-level transformations, the method encodes complex sentences into fixed-size embeddings, applies a learned transformation via a small feed-forward neural network, and decodes the result back into simplified text. The approach demonstrates that complexity levels are preserved through encoding-decoding cycles, enabling the embedding space to serve as a stable substrate for transformation. Using a pretrained SONAR encoder-decoder and only 8 million parameters, the method achieves competitive performance across multiple datasets and shows promising cross-lingual transferability.

## Method Summary
The method encodes complex sentences into 1024-dimensional SONAR embeddings, applies a learned transformation via a 2-layer MLP (1024→K→1024), and decodes the result back to simplified text using the SONAR decoder. The transformation function g(x) is trained to minimize MSE loss between predicted and reference simple embeddings. The approach is evaluated on WikiAuto, ASSET, MedEASi (medical domain), and cross-lingual datasets (German and Spanish), using metrics including BLEURT, SARI, LENS, FKGL, ARI, and CEFR.

## Key Results
- A 2-layer MLP with 8M parameters learns effective complex-to-simple embedding transformations
- Complexity levels are preserved through encoding-decoding cycles (FKGL delta < 0.2, BLEURT > 0.8)
- Cross-lingual transfer works for related languages (German) but degrades for distant ones (Spanish)
- Competitive performance against larger Seq2Seq and LLM baselines on multiple simplification datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sentence embeddings preserve complexity levels through encoding-decoding cycles
- Mechanism: When a sentence is encoded into a fixed-size embedding and decoded back, readability metrics remain approximately constant
- Core assumption: The encoder-decoder has captured syntactic and lexical complexity features in its latent representation
- Evidence anchors: FKGL delta between original and reconstructed complex sentences: -0.075 (ASSET), -0.131 (WikiAuto); BLEURT scores 0.923/0.824 indicating high semantic preservation
- Break condition: If encoder-decoder is retrained or replaced with a different embedding model, complexity preservation is not guaranteed and must be re-verified

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A small feed-forward network can learn a mapping between complex and simple embeddings
- Mechanism: A 2-layer MLP (8M params max) learns g(E_c) → E_s via MSE loss against reference simple embeddings
- Core assumption: The relationship between complex and simple embeddings is approximately learnable by a shallow network
- Evidence anchors: TSSE achieves FKGL 8.303 vs. reference 8.154 on ASSET; 4096 hidden nodes achieves lowest loss (3.618×10⁻⁵)
- Break condition: If parallel data is noisy, misaligned, or domain-shifted, the learned mapping may not generalize

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-lingual transfer is possible when embeddings share a unified multilingual space
- Mechanism: SONAR's language-agnostic encoder-decoder allows the English-trained g(x) to transform German/Spanish embeddings without retraining
- Core assumption: Complexity-related dimensions in the embedding space are language-independent or at least similar across related languages
- Evidence anchors: German (DEPlain): BLEURT 0.470, SARI 37.198 (competitive with English); Spanish (ClaraMed): BLEURT 0.266, SARI 25.996 (much lower)
- Break condition: Transfer fails when languages are ethnolinguistically distant or when domain differs significantly

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sentence embeddings as fixed-size semantic representations
  - Why needed here: The entire approach depends on understanding that sentences map to dense vectors where semantic/complexity properties are encoded
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a 1024-dimensional vector can represent sentence meaning and how pooling (mean-pooling) creates this representation?

- Concept: Encoder-decoder reconstruction (autoencoding)
  - Why needed here: The method relies on f⁻¹(f(T)) ≈ T; you must understand what reconstruction fidelity means and how it's measured
  - Quick check question: If a sentence embedding decoder produces T′ from E, what metrics would you use to verify T ≈ T′?

- Concept: Feed-forward neural networks for function approximation
  - Why needed here: The transformation g(x) is learned by a simple MLP; understanding capacity vs. hidden layer size tradeoffs is critical
  - Quick check question: Why might a 2-layer MLP with 4096 hidden units struggle with highly non-linear transformations compared to deeper architectures?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SONAR Encoder (f) -> Transformation Network (g) -> SONAR Decoder (f⁻¹)
- Critical path:
  1. Encode complex sentence T_c → E_c via SONAR encoder
  2. Apply learned transformation: E_s = g(E_c)
  3. Decode E_s → T_s via SONAR decoder
  4. Evaluate T_s against references using BLEURT, SARI, FKGL, CEFR

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Hidden layer size (K): Larger K (4096) reduces loss but increases params; limited by GPU RAM (40GB A100 capped experiments)
  - Training data quality: WikiAuto is large but automatically aligned (noisy); ASSET is smaller but higher quality
  - Cross-lingual applicability vs. language-specific training: Zero-shot transfer is cheaper but underperforms on distant languages

- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucinations: Decoder generates content not in source (see Table 6 examples: "die Natur zu erforschen" repeated)
  - Factual inaccuracies: Simplifications change meaning (e.g., German museum example misstates dates)
  - Neural text degeneration: Repetition or incoherence, especially with long/named-entity-heavy inputs
  - Cross-lingual drop-off: Spanish performance significantly lower than German/English

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Complexity preservation sanity check: Encode-decode 100 sentences from ASSET/WikiAuto; verify FKGL/CEFR deltas < 0.2 and BLEURT > 0.8
  2. Hidden layer sweep: Train g(x) with K=[256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096]; plot validation MSE vs. param count to find the inflection point where returns diminish
  3. Domain transfer test: Train on WikiAuto, evaluate on MedEASi (unseen medical domain). Compare FKGL drop to baselines to quantify domain robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the linguistic distance between English and a target language predict the zero-shot transfer performance of the embedding transformation function?
- Basis in paper: The authors observe stronger results on German than Spanish and suggest the transformation may be "more suitable for closely-related languages," but state they "do not have sufficient data to fully investigate this claim"
- Why unresolved: The study only tested two non-English languages (German and Spanish), which is insufficient to establish a statistical correlation between linguistic similarity and transferability
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the TSSE model on a diverse set of target languages with varying linguistic distances from English (e.g., Dutch, French, Japanese, Arabic) to correlate performance drops with typological differences

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can increasing the capacity of the transformation network beyond 4096 hidden nodes significantly improve semantic preservation and reduce hallucinations?
- Basis in paper: The authors note GPU limitations restricted the hidden layer size to 4096 nodes and explicitly state, "we suspect that a larger hidden layer or a more complex neural architecture may have been suitable for further improving the performance"
- Why unresolved: The experiments were hardware-constrained, leaving the potential gains of larger or deeper feed-forward networks unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Training the transformation function g(x) with hidden layer sizes exceeding 4096 (or using deeper architectures) on high-memory hardware and comparing the BLEURT/LENS scores and hallucination rates against the current baseline

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the TSSE approach yield text that is functionally useful and readable for human users despite lower scores on reference-based semantic metrics?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge they "have not explicitly evaluated the degree to which simplified texts... are useful for a reader," noting that while metrics are aligned with human judgments, the actual utility remains unverified
- Why unresolved: The study relies entirely on automated metrics (SARI, BLEURT, LENS) and manual inspection of samples, without conducting a human evaluation study
- What evidence would resolve it: A human evaluation study where raters assess the fluency, adequacy, and simplicity of TSSE outputs compared to Seq2Seq and LLM baselines

## Limitations

- Cross-lingual transfer performance degrades significantly for linguistically distant languages (Spanish vs German)
- No systematic evaluation of factual consistency or hallucination prevention beyond BLEURT scoring
- Limited investigation into whether complexity preservation is model-specific or a general property of sentence embeddings

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core architectural approach of learning transformations in embedding space is technically sound and well-implemented. The method's small parameter footprint (8M parameters) and competitive performance relative to larger models is well-demonstrated through multiple evaluation metrics across datasets.

- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of complexity preservation through embedding reconstruction is demonstrated but limited to one embedding model. The cross-lingual transfer results are promising but show language-dependent performance variation that requires deeper investigation.

- **Low confidence**: The method's robustness to domain shifts (medical simplification) and its ability to prevent factual errors and hallucinations in generated text. The paper provides initial evidence but lacks systematic evaluation of these critical aspects.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-model complexity preservation test: Repeat the encoding-decoding complexity preservation experiment using different sentence embedding models (e.g., BERT, Sentence-BERT, LaBSE) to validate whether this property is universal or SONAR-specific.

2. Factual consistency evaluation: Implement automated factual consistency checking using natural language inference models or question-answering systems to quantify how often simplifications introduce factual errors or hallucinations beyond what BLEURT captures.

3. Linguistic distance sensitivity analysis: Systematically test the method across multiple language pairs with varying degrees of linguistic distance from English (e.g., French, Italian, Russian, Arabic, Mandarin) to better understand the relationship between linguistic distance and transfer performance.
