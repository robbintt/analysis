core_contribution: This work addresses learning path recommendation (LPR) in adaptive
  education, where the goal is to generate personalized sequences of exercises to
  maximize learning gains while respecting pedagogical principles such as the Zone
  of Proximal Development (ZPD). Directly applying large language models (LLMs) is
  challenging due to misalignment with pedagogical objectives, sparse delayed feedback,
  and the need to balance multiple objectives (learning effect, ZPD compliance, path
  length, and diversity).

# IB-GRPO: Aligning LLM-based Learning Path Recommendation with Educational Objectives via Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.14686
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14686
- **Authors:** Shuai Wang; Yaoming Yang; Bingdong Li; Hao Hao; Aimin Zhou
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** IB-GRPO improves multi-objective LPR performance over baselines using hybrid expert demonstrations and Iε+ indicator-based group-relative advantages.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses learning path recommendation (LPR) in adaptive education, where the goal is to generate personalized sequences of exercises to maximize learning gains while respecting pedagogical principles such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). Directly applying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to misalignment with pedagogical objectives, sparse delayed feedback, and the need to balance multiple objectives (learning effect, ZPD compliance, path length, and diversity). To address these, the authors propose IB-GRPO, a two-stage alignment framework. First, hybrid expert demonstrations are synthesized via genetic algorithm search and teacher RL agents, and an LLM is warm-started via supervised fine-tuning. Second, IB-GRPO uses the Iε+ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multi-dimensional rewards, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs. Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi datasets using a Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over RL and LLM baselines in learning effect, ZPD alignment, and path diversity.

## Method Summary
IB-GRPO is a two-stage framework for aligning LLM-based LPR with educational objectives. Stage I synthesizes hybrid expert demonstrations by combining genetic algorithm (GA) search and teacher RL agents, then warm-starts an LLM via supervised fine-tuning. Stage II applies indicator-based GRPO, using the Iε+ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over vector rewards (learning effect, ZPD alignment, path length, diversity). The method avoids manual scalarization and improves Pareto trade-offs. Evaluation uses the KES simulator and metrics for learning effect, ZPD compliance, path length, and diversity.

## Key Results
- Hybrid expert demonstrations (GA + RL) provide better Pareto coverage than single-source demonstrations
- IB-GRPO with Iε+ indicator-based advantages outperforms scalarized and hypervolume-based methods
- ZPD alignment via data-driven reward is essential for long-horizon learning effect
- Qwen2.5-7B backbone trained with IB-GRPO shows consistent improvements on ASSIST09 and Junyi datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hybrid Expert Demonstration Synthesis
- **Claim:** Combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) search with teacher RL agents produces a richer Pareto front for supervised warm-start than either source alone.
- **Mechanism:** GA provides global exploration with diverse path candidates; RL teachers contribute structurally sound, exploitation-focused trajectories. Aggregating both into D_sft and applying behavior cloning gives the LLM a warm-start distribution covering the efficiency-diversity trade-off front, providing contrastive signals for subsequent GRPO.
- **Core assumption:** The quality-diversity profile of demonstration data directly affects the richness of intra-group comparisons during GRPO.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning"
  - [Section 4.1]: "distilling the global search capability of GA and the local exploitation of RL, we ensure the initial
