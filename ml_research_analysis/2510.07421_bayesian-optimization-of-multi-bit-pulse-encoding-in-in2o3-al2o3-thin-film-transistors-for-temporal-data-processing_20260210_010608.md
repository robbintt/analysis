- Primary result: Bayesian optimization improves 6-bit temporal encoding state separation by 46× compared to initial conditions

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of optimizing pulse parameters for high-bit temporal encoding in physical reservoir computing using solution-processed In₂O₃/Al₂O₃ thin-film transistors (TFTs). A Bayesian optimization framework is employed to systematically explore a five-dimensional parameter space—pulse period, base gate voltage, gate pulse amplitude, drain voltage, and duty cycle—to maximize the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) among output states for 6-bit encoding. The method significantly improves state distinguishability, achieving a log(nDoS) of -8.97 compared to -55 in initial conditions. Additionally, the study demonstrates that a 4-bit model can effectively guide 6-bit optimization, reducing experimental overhead while maintaining performance.

## Method Summary
The approach uses Gaussian Process Regression with Matern 5/2 kernel and Automatic Relevance Determination to model the relationship between five pulse parameters (period, base gate voltage, gate pulse amplitude, drain voltage, duty cycle) and the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) metric. The optimization starts with 20 initial conditions generated via Latin Hypercube Sampling, followed by 5 rounds of Bayesian optimization using qUCB acquisition function (β=1.0, q=5) to propose new conditions. Each condition is evaluated by applying all 64 binary pulse sequences to a single TFT device, measuring final current values, computing DoS, and normalizing to the ideal DoS for 6-bit encoding. A reset protocol ensures consistent device state between measurements.

## Key Results
- Bayesian optimization achieved log(nDoS) = -8.97 compared to initial -55, representing 46× improvement in state separation
- Best condition: pulse period=66ms, Vbase=1.1V, Vamp=1.9V, VDS=1V, duty=72%
- 4-bit optimization results effectively predict 6-bit performance, with log(nDoS) = -9.09 for best 4-bit condition applied to 6-bit task
- SHAP analysis identified gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage as most influential parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The physical mechanism underlying successful state separation involves the non-linear current response of the In₂O₃/Al₂O₃ TFT to temporal gate voltage sequences. When different pulse patterns are applied, the device's conductance evolves differently based on the history of voltage inputs, creating distinct final current states. The Gaussian Process model effectively captures these complex, non-linear relationships between pulse parameters and state separation. The optimized parameters (longer period, higher gate amplitude, specific duty cycle) likely maximize the contrast between different input sequences by allowing sufficient time for charge accumulation and redistribution within the transistor structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **Latin Hypercube Sampling**: Systematic space-filling design for initial parameter exploration; needed to avoid clustering and ensure broad coverage of 5D parameter space
- **Gaussian Process Regression with Matern 5/2 kernel**: Non-parametric Bayesian model that captures smooth but non-differentiable relationships; needed for modeling noisy experimental data without assuming specific functional forms
- **qUCB acquisition function**: Balances exploration and exploitation in Bayesian optimization; needed to efficiently search high-dimensional parameter space with expensive evaluations
- **Normalized Degree of Separation (nDoS)**: Metric quantifying distinguishability of encoded states; needed to objectively compare different pulse parameter combinations
- **Physical reservoir computing with TFTs**: Uses material properties for computation rather than traditional logic gates; needed to leverage inherent device physics for temporal data processing

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Parameter Space -> Latin Hypercube Sampling -> Initial Conditions -> Gaussian Process Model -> qUCB Acquisition -> Proposed Conditions -> TFT Measurement -> DoS Calculation -> Model Update

**Critical Path**: Parameter selection → Device measurement → State separation calculation → Model training → New parameter proposal

**Design Tradeoffs**: Single-device optimization vs. device-to-device variability; computational cost of full 6-bit encoding vs. 4-bit surrogate modeling; exploration vs. exploitation in parameter space

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Numerical underflow in nDoS calculation indicates insufficient state separation
- Inconsistent baseline currents suggest incomplete device reset between measurements
- Poor initial LHS coverage leads to local optima convergence

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement GPR model with Matern 5/2 kernel and verify it can fit synthetic data with similar characteristics
2. Test DoS calculation on synthetic state distributions to verify metric computation
3. Run BO loop with synthetic objective function to validate convergence behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does device variability affect the generalizability of optimized pulse parameters across multiple TFTs?
- What is the optimal number of initial LHS samples and BO iterations for balancing exploration and computational cost?
- Can the 4-bit surrogate modeling approach be extended to even higher bit encodings with maintained accuracy?

## Limitations
- Unknown GPR hyperparameters (length scales, noise variance) affect reproducibility
- Missing quantitative convergence criteria for stopping optimization
- Results optimized for single device, generalizability to multiple devices unknown
- Limited validation of 4-bit-to-6-bit transfer learning approach
- No analysis of temporal stability or long-term device degradation under repeated pulse sequences

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Experimental methodology for measuring DoS and basic BO framework using BoTorch are well-defined
- **Medium confidence**: Pulse encoding mechanism and device physics underlying state separation are adequately explained
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability of results to other devices and robustness of 4-bit-to-6-bit transfer learning

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence sensitivity analysis**: Reproduce optimization with different random seeds for Latin Hypercube Sampling and different β values in qUCB acquisition
2. **Cross-device validation**: Apply optimized pulse parameters to 5-10 additional TFT devices and measure variation in log(nDoS)
3. **Transfer learning validation**: Systematically evaluate 4-bit-optimized conditions across multiple 6-bit tasks to quantify average performance degradation
4. **Device stability assessment**: Characterize TFT performance after 1000+ pulse sequence applications to evaluate long-term reliability
