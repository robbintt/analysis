# On the Impossibility of Separating Intelligence from Judgment: The Computational Intractability of Filtering for AI Alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07341
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07341
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proves computational intractability of filtering for AI alignment, showing fundamental barriers to both prompt and output filtering

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes that filtering-based approaches to AI alignment face fundamental computational barriers that cannot be overcome through engineering improvements alone. The authors prove that there exist language models for which no efficient prompt filter can distinguish adversarial prompts from benign ones, and that output filtering is also computationally intractable in natural settings. These impossibility results rely on cryptographic assumptions about time-lock puzzles and reveal that the separation of intelligence (generation capability) from judgment (harm assessment) is computationally infeasible.

## Method Summary
The paper employs cryptographic constructions to demonstrate computational intractability. The authors construct adversarial prompt generators that embed encrypted harmful prompts within high-entropy benign prompts using time-lock puzzles. They show that any efficient filter running in sub-exponential time cannot distinguish these adversarial prompts from truly benign ones. For output filtering, they use a similar approach where the harmful content is encrypted and only revealed after sufficient sequential computation time. The proofs leverage properties of pairwise independent hash functions, the leftover hash lemma, and the sequentiality assumption of time-lock puzzles to establish indistinguishability.

## Key Results
- No efficient prompt filter can distinguish adversarial prompts from benign ones when running in o(t^ε) time, assuming time-lock puzzles exist
- Output filtering is computationally intractable even for safe prompts, assuming time-lock puzzles exist
- Relaxed mitigation approaches allowing filters to modify rather than reject prompts encounter similar fundamental barriers
- The results connect to broader philosophical questions about the separation of intelligence from judgment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The impossibility results work by constructing adversarial inputs that are computationally indistinguishable from benign ones for any efficient algorithm. Time-lock puzzles ensure that the harmful content can only be revealed after sequential computation time t, while cryptographic techniques make the encrypted content appear uniformly random to any sub-exponential time observer. The high entropy of the benign prompt generator ensures that the adversarial construction inherits this property, making statistical separation impossible without solving the time-lock puzzle.

## Foundational Learning
- Time-lock puzzles (why needed: provide computational sequentiality; quick check: verify t squarings mod n cannot be parallelized)
- Leftover hash lemma (why needed: ensures statistical closeness to uniform; quick check: verify collision probability bound)
- Hardcore bits of one-way functions (why needed: enable extraction of pseudorandom bits; quick check: verify Goldreich-Levin construction)
- Pairwise independence (why needed: sufficient for hash function properties; quick check: verify h(a)⊕h(b) is uniform for a≠b)
- Computational indistinguishability (why needed: formal security definition; quick check: verify advantage is negligible)
- Sequential computation assumption (why needed: prevents parallel speedups; quick check: verify no known parallel algorithm for t squarings)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
G (innocent prompt generator) -> Samp -> z (adversarial prompt) -> F (filter) -> accept/reject
H' (harm oracle) -> m (harmful prompt) -> MaliciousLLM -> output

Critical Path:
The critical path is the construction of adversarial prompts that embed encrypted harmful content using time-lock puzzles, ensuring that filters cannot distinguish them from benign prompts without solving computationally hard problems.

Design Tradeoffs:
The main tradeoff is between security parameter t (larger t provides stronger security but requires more computation time) and filter efficiency (smaller t allows faster filtering but weaker security guarantees). The construction also trades off between the entropy of the base prompt generator and the complexity of the adversarial embedding.

Failure Signatures:
- Filter success rate significantly above baseline indicates potential weakness in the time-lock puzzle construction
- RecoverRand failure to extract randomness suggests precision parameter P is insufficient
- Non-negligible advantage in indistinguishability experiments indicates filter runtime exceeds claimed bounds

First Experiments:
1. Implement Samp and RecoverRand over binary tokens, verify RecoverRand(Samp(G,R)) = R for random R
2. Implement RSW time-lock puzzle construction and verify sequentiality property
3. Run indistinguishability experiments measuring filter advantage between G and G'(m) outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Can the impossibility result for prompt filtering be generalized to apply to any time-lock puzzle, rather than relying on specific distribution properties found in RSW or LWE-based constructions? (Remark 4 in Appendix C.1.1)

2. How do the theoretical barriers to separating intelligence from judgment align with the 4E cognitive science paradigm (embodied, embedded, enactive, extended)? (Section 4)

3. Does the output filtering impossibility result persist if the harmfulness oracle is constrained to run in polynomial time rather than exponential time? (Remark 5)

## Limitations
- Results rely on strong cryptographic assumptions that may not hold in practice
- Assumes access to an ideal harmfulness oracle that perfectly identifies harmful content
- Does not consider practical engineering constraints like latency requirements
- Assumes perfect implementation without computational errors or approximations

## Confidence
- High confidence in mathematical proofs and theoretical constructions
- Medium confidence in practical relevance of the assumptions
- Medium confidence in interpretation of results for real-world alignment

## Next Checks
1. Implement the RecoverRand algorithm with varying precision parameters to empirically verify the leftover hash lemma bound and determine minimum precision requirements for successful randomness recovery.

2. Conduct empirical indistinguishability experiments comparing filter performance on outputs from the base LLM versus the adversarial construction, varying filter runtime parameters to observe the threshold where advantage becomes negligible.

3. Analyze the computational requirements for implementing the time-lock puzzle construction at realistic security parameters, measuring actual sequential time needed versus parallel computation capabilities available in modern hardware.
