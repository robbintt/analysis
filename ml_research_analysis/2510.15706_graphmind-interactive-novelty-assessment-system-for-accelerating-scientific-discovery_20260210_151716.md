# GraphMind: Interactive Novelty Assessment System for Accelerating Scientific Discovery

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.15706
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15706
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Key outcome**: 78.0% precision, 72.2% recall, and 75.0% F1 on ICLR/NeurIPS novelty classification

## Executive Summary
GraphMind is an interactive web tool that accelerates scientific discovery by assessing the novelty of research papers through structured analysis and relationship-aware exploration. The system extracts key components (claims, methods, experiments) from full arXiv papers, builds a hierarchical graph of related works via citation networks and semantic similarity, and generates novelty reports with supporting and contradictory evidence. Evaluated on ICLR and NeurIPS papers, GraphMind demonstrates strong performance compared to baselines that lack structured retrieval or graph-based context.

## Method Summary
GraphMind combines structured paper analysis with relationship-aware exploration to assess novelty. It parses LaTeX content into Markdown and uses LLMs to extract distinct components (claims, methods, experiments) and their interconnections. The system retrieves related papers through citation networks and semantic similarity, classifies citations by polarity (supporting vs. contrasting) and neighbors by role (background vs. target), then generates novelty reports via topological sorting of the internal graph combined with classified evidence. The pipeline supports both full-paper analysis and abstract-only mode for availability.

## Key Results
- Achieves 78.0% precision, 72.2% recall, and 75.0% F1 using GPT-4o on ICLR/NeurIPS papers
- Outperforms baselines lacking structured retrieval or graph-based context
- Automated pairwise comparisons show rationales match or exceed human reviews in faithfulness, factuality, and specificity
- Gemini 2.0 Flash provides faster, cheaper inference ($0.02 vs $0.48) while maintaining competitive performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Decomposing a paper into a structured internal graph (claims, methods, experiments) yields higher assessment fidelity than treating the document as a single semantic block.
- **Mechanism**: The system parses LaTeX content into Markdown and prompts an LLM to extract distinct nodes (claims, methods, experiments) and their edges. This forces the model to map the internal logic of the argument before comparing it to external literature, preventing "surface-level" semantic matching.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs can reliably identify logical dependencies between claims and experiments in scientific LaTeX better than they can summarize novelty directly from raw text.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "An LLM then extracts key components from the Markdown: claims, methods, experiments, and their interconnections."
  - [abstract]: "...combining structured paper analysis with relationship-aware exploration."
  - [corpus]: Related work like "Navigating Ideation Space" (arXiv:2601.08901) supports the general need for "decomposed conceptual representations" to position ideas, validating the structural decomposition approach.
- **Break condition**: If the input paper lacks standard LaTeX structural tags (e.g., heavily non-standard formatting), the extraction logic may fail to map edges, resulting in a disconnected graph.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Classifying citations by polarity (supporting vs. contrasting) and semantic neighbors by role (background vs. target) creates a "relationship-aware" context that improves precision over standard keyword or citation count metrics.
- **Mechanism**: The pipeline retrieves related papers and uses an LLM to classify the *intent* of the citation context (positive/negative) and the *role* of semantic neighbors. This filters the "related works" section into specific evidence categories rather than a generic list of references.
- **Core assumption**: The context surrounding a citation in the main paper is sufficient for an LLM to accurately determine the author's stance (support/contrast) without deeper cross-document reasoning.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "Citations are classified as supporting when contexts are mostly positive, and as contrasting when contexts are mostly negative."
  - [table]: Ablation study (Table 2) shows a performance drop when citation or semantic features are removed, indicating their specific contribution to the F1 score.
  - [corpus]: "NoveltyRank" (arXiv:2512.14738) similarly relies on retrieval-based comparison, but GraphMind specifically distinguishes itself by adding *polarity* classification to the retrieval chain.
- **Break condition**: If the paper cites work ironically or sarcastically (rare in formal text but possible), the binary sentiment classification may miscategorize contradictory evidence as supporting.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Generating novelty reports via a topological sort of the internal graph + retrieved evidence list provides traceability that outperforms direct prompting.
- **Mechanism**: Instead of asking "Is this novel?", the system linearizes the paper's internal graph nodes and pairs them with the classified evidence list. This structured context constrains the LLM's generation, forcing it to cite specific graph nodes or evidence papers in the rationale.
- **Core assumption**: Providing a linearized, topologically sorted chain of arguments reduces hallucination rates compared to feeding the model the raw full text of the paper and related abstracts.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "...generates novelty reports with supporting and contradictory evidence."
  - [section]: "We combine the paper graph and related papers... convert the paper graph to text using topological sorting... then transform each node into a paragraph."
  - [corpus]: "Literature-Grounded Novelty Assessment" (arXiv:2506.22026) highlights the difficulty of manual evaluation; GraphMind's mechanism addresses this via automated rationale generation, achieving high specificity scores (Table 3).
- **Break condition**: If the "related papers" retrieval step returns off-topic results (low semantic similarity), the generated report will contain "hallucinated" contradictions or supports that are factually grounded in irrelevant papers.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Structured vs. Semantic Retrieval
- **Why needed here**: The architecture relies on two distinct retrieval modes: 1) Citation graph traversal (structured) and 2) Vector similarity search (semantic). Understanding the difference is crucial for debugging why certain papers appear in the "Related Works" section.
- **Quick check question**: If a paper is cited but semantically dissimilar, does GraphMind keep it? (Answer: Yes, it filters by relevance but retains specific citation contexts).

### Concept: LLM-as-Parser vs. LLM-as-Judge
- **Why needed here**: The system uses the LLM for two distinct tasks: extracting structured JSON/graph data from LaTeX (Parser) and synthesizing the final novelty score (Judge). Failure modes differ significantly between extraction logic and judgment logic.
- **Quick check question**: Which step requires stricter output formatting constraints? (Answer: The extraction/graph building step, as it feeds the subsequent judge).

### Concept: Topological Sorting in DAGs
- **Why needed here**: To generate the final report, the system must linearize the internal argument graph. Understanding that Claims -> Methods -> Experiments must be ordered correctly is key to understanding how the "Result summary" is synthesized.
- **Quick check question**: Why can't the system just concatenate the extracted paragraphs? (Answer: Logical flow requires dependency ordering, not random concatenation).

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Frontend (TypeScript SPA) -> Backend (Python FastAPI) -> Data (arXiv/Semantic Scholar APIs) -> Models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings, GPT-4o/Gemini)

### Critical path
1. User inputs arXiv ID
2. Backend fetches LaTeX source & metadata
3. Pandoc converts LaTeX -> Markdown
4. LLM extracts claims/methods graph from Markdown
5. Retriever finds citations & semantic neighbors
6. LLM classifies neighbors (support/contrast)
7. LLM synthesizes report using (Graph + Classified Neighbors)

### Design tradeoffs
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash vs. GPT-4o**: Gemini is faster and cheaper ($0.02 vs $0.48) while performing best on their specific benchmark. Default to Gemini unless user demands GPT-4o.
- **Abstract-only mode**: Trading depth for availability. Without LaTeX, the "Paper Structured Graph" cannot be built; the system falls back to semantic similarity only.

### Failure signatures
- **Empty Graph**: Occurs if LaTeX is malformed or non-standard (e.g., heavy macro usage that Pandoc misses).
- **Generic Rationale**: If the semantic retrieval step returns broad review papers rather than specific target papers, the novelty report will sound generic ("This paper is similar to existing surveys...").
- **API Timeouts**: The pipeline is sequential and relies on live external APIs; expect failures if arXiv/Semantic Scholar rate limits are hit during full evaluation.

### First 3 experiments
1. **Smoke Test (Library Mode)**: Select a pre-computed paper from the "Library" to verify the frontend visualizes the "Paper Structured Graph" and "Novelty Assessment" correctly without triggering backend jobs.
2. **Extraction Fidelity Check**: Run `/evaluate` on a well-known paper (e.g., "Attention Is All You Need") and inspect the backend logs to verify that the LLM correctly extracts "Claims" and "Methods" from the LaTeX source.
3. **Retrieval Boundary Test**: Input a very recent or obscure arXiv paper to test the fallback behavior when Semantic Scholar has few or no citations. Check if the "semantic neighbors" list compensates adequately.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does GraphMind's novelty assessment performance generalize to scientific domains outside of Machine Learning?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state, "We’ll also consider... evaluation on domains beyond Machine Learning" in the Conclusion.
- **Why unresolved**: The current evaluation relies exclusively on ICLR and NeurIPS papers, which share similar formatting, terminology, and citation norms specific to the ML community.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1) on a dataset of peer-reviewed papers from distinct domains such as Biology, Chemistry, or Physics.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Does scaling the retrieval corpus to millions of papers improve the recall of related work detection without introducing excessive noise?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors propose "building our own database containing millions of scientific papers" to enhance the search process.
- **Why unresolved**: The current system relies on the Semantic Scholar API and recommendation algorithms, which may miss "long-tail" related work or be constrained by API limits and latency.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A comparative analysis of retrieval coverage and novelty assessment accuracy between the current API-based pipeline and a pipeline utilizing a massive local vector database.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: To what extent does incorporating interactive user feedback improve the accuracy of the structured paper graph or the final novelty score?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion notes the intent to incorporate "interactive user feedback" as a future step.
- **Why unresolved**: The current pipeline is automated; it is unclear if allowing users to correct extracted claims or methods would significantly propagate into better novelty rationales or scores.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A user study measuring the delta in novelty assessment quality (e.g., human agreement rate) between the automated baseline and a version refined by user annotations.

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to NLP/ML venues; performance on other scientific domains remains untested
- Reliance on structured LaTeX formatting; papers with non-standard formatting may fail to generate internal paper graph
- Binary classification masks nuance; binarizing peer review scores loses granularity in reviewer judgment

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Claims about pipeline architecture and components are well-supported by implementation and ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance metrics (78.0% P, 72.2% R, 75.0% F1) are credible for ICLR/NeurIPS but may not generalize to other venues or fields
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about handling "any" scientific paper or robustness to non-standard LaTeX are not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test GraphMind on papers from non-CV/NLP venues (e.g., Bioinformatics, Physical Review Letters) to assess domain generalizability
2. **Error analysis on malformed LaTeX**: Systematically evaluate papers with non-standard LaTeX formatting to quantify fallback rate to abstract-only mode
3. **Ablation on citation classification**: Remove citation polarity classification step and re-run evaluation to measure its specific contribution to overall F1 score
