# Experience-based Knowledge Correction for Robust Planning in Minecraft

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24157
- Reference count: 40
- XENON significantly outperforms prior agents in both knowledge learning and long-horizon planning, achieving up to 0.74 success rate on diverse goals

## Executive Summary
XENON addresses the brittleness of LLM-based agents in Minecraft by algorithmically correcting flawed planning knowledge through experience rather than relying on LLM self-correction. The system combines two complementary mechanisms: an Adaptive Dependency Graph that revises item dependencies using successful experiences, and Failure-aware Action Memory that corrects action knowledge using failures. This approach enables XENON to disambiguate failure causes and acquire complex dependencies despite limited guidance. Remarkably, with only a 7B open-weight LLM, XENON surpasses agents using much larger proprietary models like GPT-4 across multiple Minecraft benchmarks.

## Method Summary
XENON employs a two-pronged approach to robust planning knowledge acquisition. The Adaptive Dependency Graph maintains a probabilistic representation of item dependencies and updates them based on successful task executions, learning the correct prerequisites for complex actions like crafting tools or building structures. The Failure-aware Action Memory tracks action failures and their contexts, using this information to correct flawed action knowledge and identify root causes of failures. These mechanisms work together to transform unreliable LLM priors into robust, experience-based planning knowledge that can handle the diverse and complex challenges of Minecraft environments.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 0.74 success rate on diverse Minecraft goals
- Outperforms agents using much larger proprietary models like GPT-4
- Demonstrates superior performance in both knowledge learning and long-horizon planning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by algorithmically correcting knowledge rather than relying on LLM self-correction. It separates knowledge into two types - item dependencies and action knowledge - and corrects each based on experience. Successful executions update item dependencies, while failures update action knowledge, allowing the agent to disambiguate failure causes and acquire complex dependencies despite limited guidance.

## Foundational Learning

**Adaptive Dependency Graph** - A probabilistic representation of item dependencies that updates based on successful task executions. Why needed: To learn correct prerequisites for complex actions like crafting tools. Quick check: Verify that item dependencies converge to stable, accurate representations over multiple successful executions.

**Failure-aware Action Memory** - Tracks action failures and their contexts to correct flawed action knowledge. Why needed: To identify and correct root causes of failures rather than just memorizing unsuccessful actions. Quick check: Ensure failure contexts are sufficiently detailed to disambiguate different failure modes.

**Experience-based Correction** - Algorithm that updates knowledge based on execution outcomes rather than relying on LLM self-correction. Why needed: LLMs have inherent knowledge gaps and biases that cannot be reliably corrected through prompting alone. Quick check: Compare knowledge evolution with and without experience-based correction.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Adaptive Dependency Graph -> Failure-aware Action Memory -> Planning Module -> Execution Environment -> Experience Collector -> Back to both correction mechanisms

**Critical Path**: Experience Collection → Knowledge Correction → Planning → Execution → Success/Failure Assessment

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades computational overhead for knowledge correction against the brittleness of uncorrected LLM priors. Using a smaller open-weight LLM with correction mechanisms versus larger proprietary models without correction.

**Failure Signatures**: Item dependency failures manifest as inability to craft required tools, while action knowledge failures appear as repeated attempts at actions known to fail in given contexts.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test dependency graph learning on simple crafting tasks with known dependencies
2. Evaluate failure-aware memory on isolated action failures in controlled environments
3. Assess combined system performance on progressively complex multi-step goals

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is primarily focused on Minecraft, raising questions about generality to other domains
- Dependency graph correction assumes successful execution implies correct dependencies, which may not hold in complex scenarios
- Limited discussion of how ambiguous or complex failure scenarios are handled

## Confidence
High confidence: The core algorithmic approach of separating and correcting different types of knowledge is well-founded and the experimental methodology is sound.

Medium confidence: The specific implementation details and hyperparameters used in the experiments are not fully disclosed, making exact replication challenging.

Medium confidence: While the results are impressive, the evaluation scope is limited to Minecraft, and the claim of surpassing larger models should be validated across more diverse environments.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the Adaptive Dependency Graph and Failure-aware Action Memory components to overall performance.

2. Test the approach in at least one non-Minecraft environment with different mechanics and knowledge structures to evaluate generalizability.

3. Implement a mechanism to track and analyze the evolution of the knowledge base over time to detect and prevent potential accumulation of incorrect corrections.
