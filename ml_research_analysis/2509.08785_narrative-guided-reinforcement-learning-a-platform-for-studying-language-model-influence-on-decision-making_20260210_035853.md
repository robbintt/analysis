- Combines RL policy suggestions with LLM narrative processing to study decision-making influence

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel experimental platform that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with language model reasoning to explore how narrative frameworks influence AI decision-making. The system uses a dual architecture where an RL policy suggests actions based on experience, while a language model processes these suggestions through different narrative contexts to guide decisions. Implemented in a configurable gridworld environment, the platform enables controlled testing of how narrative frameworks affect decision-making while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures.

Initial experiments across various grid sizes showed that narrative-guided agents achieved performance comparable to RL-only agents after just 10 episodes, despite significant computational overhead. Different narrative frameworks (Theseus labyrinth navigator, Sherlock Holmes detective, and Westworld-inspired AI) demonstrated systematic differences in success rates and path efficiency, with the Westworld framework showing the most consistent performance across metrics. The platform provides a foundation for studying how narrative context might influence reward-based decisions and exploring interactions between optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

## Method Summary
The platform uses a dual architecture combining Q-learning with language model reasoning in a configurable gridworld environment. The RL component uses Q-learning with random initialization and 10-episode training to produce action suggestions. At each decision point, the language model receives the RL suggestion plus local observations, then processes both through a narrative prompt that frames the decision context. The LLM can either reinforce or override the RL suggestion based on its narrative interpretation. The system is implemented in a 5x5 to 11x11 grid with 30-40% obstacles, enabling controlled testing of how different narrative frameworks influence decision-making while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures.

## Key Results
- Narrative-guided agents achieved comparable performance to RL-only agents (100 episodes) in just 10 episodes
- Westworld-inspired AI narrative framework consistently outperformed other narratives across success rate and path efficiency metrics
- LLM+RL agents demonstrated more efficient path-finding, particularly in complex environments (7x7+ grids)
- Computational overhead was significant (5-30 minutes vs <1 second for RL-only), though justified by sample efficiency gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Narrative frameworks systematically influence how agents interpret and act on RL policy suggestions.
- Mechanism: At each decision point, the RL policy proposes an action based on Q-values. The LLM receives this suggestion plus local observations, then processes both through a narrative prompt that frames the decision context. The LLM can either reinforce or override the RL suggestion based on its narrative interpretation.
- Core assumption: LLMs can consistently apply narrative framing to filter or modify decision outputs in predictable ways.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "language model that processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide decisions"
  - [section] "Analysis of agent behavior logs revealed that narrative frameworks influenced not just performance metrics but also decision-making patterns. While all LLM+RL agents had access to the same environmental information and RL policy suggestions, their interpretation and use of this information varied systematically with narrative context."
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for narrative-specific mechanisms; related work focuses on reasoning cues broadly (arXiv:2602.00259) but not narrative framing specifically.
- Break condition: If narrative differences produce random or inconsistent behavioral patterns across runs, the mechanism is likely noise rather than systematic influence.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLM-based symbolic reasoning compensates for undertrained RL policies by injecting task-relevant priors.
- Mechanism: The RL component uses only 10 training episodes with random initialization, producing weak policies. The LLM, pre-trained on broad corpora, brings implicit spatial reasoning and goal-directed planning knowledge that supplements the undertrained policy, achieving in 10 episodes what RL-only required 100 episodes to reach.
- Core assumption: The LLM's pre-training includes sufficient task-relevant knowledge (spatial navigation, obstacle avoidance, goal-seeking) that transfers to the gridworld domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "narrative-guided agents demonstrated more efficient path-finding, particularly in complex environments"
  - [section] "LLM+RL agents achieved in 10 episodes performance comparable to what RL-only agents reached after 100 episodes of training"
  - [corpus] arXiv:2204.01691 (Language Models as Zero-Shot Planners) supports the claim that LLMs can extract actionable knowledge for embodied agents without task-specific training.
- Break condition: If LLM performance degrades sharply in domains distant from its training distribution, the mechanism is prior-transfer rather than general reasoning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Narrative complexity interacts with environmental complexity to modulate decision quality.
- Mechanism: Simpler narratives (direct instructions) provide less interpretive structure than richer character-based narratives (Westworld AI). In complex environments (7x7+ grids), the richer narratives offer more decision-relevant heuristics, explaining why Westworld consistently outperformed other frameworks across both success rate and path efficiency.
- Core assumption: Richer narrative framing activates more relevant reasoning patterns in the LLM.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Westworld-inspired AI narrative framework achieved the best performance, consistently outperforming other narratives"
  - [section] "The Westworld AI framework...demonstrated more consistent integration of RL suggestions with environmental observations, potentially explaining its superior performance metrics."
  - [corpus] arXiv:2411.05778 ("LLMs as Method Actors") suggests character-based prompting can improve task performance, though this remains preliminary.
- Break condition: If performance rankings reverse across different task domains, the mechanism is task-specific affinity rather than general narrative depth.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Q-Learning Basics**
  - Why needed here: The RL component uses Q-learning with random initialization and short training (10 episodes). Understanding how Q-values encode expected rewards and why limited training produces weak policies is essential to interpret why LLM augmentation helps.
  - Quick check question: Given a 7x7 gridworld with 30% obstacles, explain why 10 episodes of Q-learning produces a suboptimal policy.

- Concept: **Dual-Process Cognitive Architectures**
  - Why needed here: The system explicitly references dual-system theory (Evans & Stanovich) as its architectural inspiration—separating fast learned responses (RL) from deliberative reasoning (LLM).
  - Quick check question: Map the RL component and LLM component to System 1 and System 2 reasoning; what happens if the LLM always overrides the RL policy?

- Concept: **Prompt Engineering for Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The narrative frameworks are essentially prompts that structure LLM reasoning. Understanding how prompt design affects output consistency is critical for reproducing and extending this work.
  - Quick check question: What elements of the Westworld narrative prompt might have caused more consistent integration of RL suggestions with environmental observations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Environment state → RL policy lookup → (suggestion + observations) → LLM narrative processing → Action execution → Reward/next state

- Critical path: Environment state → RL policy lookup → (suggestion + observations) → LLM narrative processing → Action execution → Reward/next state

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Computational cost vs. sample efficiency**: 5-30 minutes for LLM+RL vs. <1 second for RL-only; justified only when training data is scarce or environments are complex
  - **Narrative richness vs. reproducibility**: Richer narratives may improve performance but introduce more variance in LLM outputs
  - **RL training duration vs. LLM dependency**: Shorter RL training increases LLM influence but risks over-reliance on potentially unreliable LLM reasoning

- Failure signatures:
  - LLM consistently ignores RL suggestions → prompt may lack integration instructions
  - Success rate drops below RL-only baseline → narrative framing contradicts task structure
  - High variance across runs with same narrative → LLM temperature too high or prompt underspecified
  - Timeout on larger grids → LLM inference latency dominates; consider caching or smaller models

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline comparison: Run RL-only (100 episodes) vs. LLM+RL-direct instructions (10 episodes) on 7x7 grid with 30% obstacles; verify ~equivalent performance.
  2. Ablate narrative specificity: Test Westworld prompt vs. stripped-down version with same information content to isolate whether character framing or information structure drives gains.
  3. Scale test: Run all four narrative conditions on 11x11 grid with 40% obstacles; check if performance rankings hold and whether computational overhead becomes prohibitive.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Platform remains at preliminary proof-of-concept stage with limited environmental diversity and narrative frameworks tested
- Significant computational overhead (5-30 minutes vs <1 second) makes scaling challenging
- Study relies on single gridworld task with configurable parameters, limiting generalizability to other decision-making domains
- Narrative frameworks are handcrafted without systematic exploration of what makes certain prompts more effective

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The dual architecture implementation works as described, and the computational cost differences are accurately reported. The platform successfully demonstrates that narrative frameworks can influence LLM outputs in predictable ways within the gridworld environment.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that LLM+RL achieves comparable performance to RL-only in fewer episodes relies on the specific experimental setup with deliberately undertrained RL. The observed performance differences across narrative frameworks appear consistent but may be sensitive to prompt formulation.

**Low confidence**: The mechanism by which narrative complexity specifically improves decision quality remains speculative. Without systematic ablation studies of prompt components or testing across diverse task domains, it's unclear whether the observed effects generalize beyond the specific gridworld implementation.

## Next Checks
1. Run a cross-validation experiment with 10-fold episode splits on the 7x7 grid to verify that the 10-episode LLM+RL performance advantage is statistically robust and not an artifact of specific training/test splits.
2. Implement a systematic ablation study of the Westworld narrative prompt by removing one framing element at a time (character identity, environmental description, goal framing) to isolate which components drive performance improvements.
3. Test the platform on a fundamentally different task domain (e.g., text-based adventure or resource allocation problem) to assess whether narrative framework effects transfer beyond spatial navigation gridworlds.
