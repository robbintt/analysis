# MLMA: Towards Multilingual ASR With Mamba-based Architectures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18684
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18684
- Reference count: 0
- MLMA introduces a multilingual ASR system leveraging the Mamba state-space architecture for improved efficiency and scalability

## Executive Summary
MLMA presents a multilingual automatic speech recognition system built on Mamba-based architectures, specifically ConMamba encoders with CTC decoding. The system trains on nearly 12,000 hours of data across six European languages and demonstrates superior performance compared to Conformer baselines on standard benchmarks. The approach leverages the selective state space modeling capabilities of Mamba to achieve competitive results while maintaining computational efficiency. The architecture shows strong generalization capabilities, particularly on out-of-domain FLEURS evaluation.

## Method Summary
MLMA employs ConMamba encoders as the backbone for multilingual ASR, replacing traditional Transformer or Conformer architectures. The system uses Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoding for sequence modeling across multiple languages. Training data comprises approximately 12,000 hours from six European languages, enabling robust multilingual representation learning. The Mamba architecture's selective state space modeling allows for efficient processing of long sequences while maintaining strong performance across diverse linguistic contexts.

## Key Results
- MLMA outperforms Conformer baselines on LibriSpeech and CommonVoice datasets
- Achieves competitive results on FLEURS out-of-domain evaluation
- Ablation studies confirm performance gains from increased model size and training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Mamba architecture's selective state space modeling enables efficient processing of long sequences by selectively updating hidden states based on input content. This mechanism allows MLMA to capture long-range dependencies in speech signals while maintaining computational efficiency compared to attention-based models. The CTC decoding framework provides a straightforward approach to multilingual sequence modeling without requiring complex alignment mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mamba state space models**: Why needed - Enable efficient processing of long sequences without quadratic complexity; Quick check - Verify that the model can handle sequences longer than typical attention-based models
- **CTC decoding**: Why needed - Provides sequence modeling without requiring frame-level alignments; Quick check - Confirm that the decoding produces reasonable transcriptions without external language models
- **Multilingual training**: Why needed - Improves generalization across languages and domains; Quick check - Evaluate performance on held-out languages not seen during training
- **Selective state space modeling**: Why needed - Allows the model to focus on relevant information while ignoring noise; Quick check - Analyze attention patterns to verify selective processing
- **Connectionist Temporal Classification**: Why needed - Enables end-to-end training without explicit alignments; Quick check - Measure alignment quality between predicted and reference transcriptions
- **ConMamba architecture**: Why needed - Combines Mamba's efficiency with convolutional processing for speech features; Quick check - Compare feature extraction quality against pure Mamba or ConvNet approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Speech -> ConMamba Encoder -> CTC Decoder -> Output Transcriptions

Critical Path:
The critical path involves processing raw speech through the ConMamba encoder, which applies selective state space modeling to extract temporal features, followed by CTC decoding to generate the final transcriptions. The Mamba layers are the primary computational bottleneck and determine the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Efficiency vs. Expressiveness: Mamba provides better computational efficiency than Transformers but may have limitations in modeling very complex dependencies
- Model Size vs. Performance: Larger models show better performance but increase computational requirements
- Language Coverage vs. Specialization: Training on six languages improves generalization but may reduce performance on individual languages compared to monolingual models

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance on languages with very different phonetic structures from the training set
- Degradation when processing extremely long sequences beyond the Mamba model's effective context window
- Suboptimal results on highly accented or noisy speech that deviates significantly from training data distribution

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline Conformer model on the same datasets for direct comparison
2. Test single-language performance to identify potential multilingual interference effects
3. Measure inference speed and memory usage compared to attention-based architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, focusing instead on demonstrating the effectiveness of Mamba-based architectures for multilingual ASR.

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed architectural comparisons between Mamba and other state-space models beyond Conformer
- Absence of comprehensive ablation on Mamba-specific hyperparameters
- Limited analysis of cross-lingual transfer learning effectiveness across all six European languages

## Confidence
- High confidence in MLMA's superior performance on LibriSpeech and CommonVoice datasets compared to Conformer baselines
- Medium confidence in the generalizability of results to other multilingual ASR tasks due to limited out-of-domain testing
- Low confidence in the scalability of MLMA to languages outside the six European languages tested

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comprehensive ablation study on Mamba-specific hyperparameters (e.g., kernel size, block depth) to identify optimal configurations for multilingual ASR
2. Expand out-of-domain evaluation to include non-European languages and diverse speech domains (e.g., conversational speech, accented speech)
3. Perform computational efficiency analysis comparing Mamba's inference speed, memory usage, and training time against other state-space models and Transformer-based architectures
