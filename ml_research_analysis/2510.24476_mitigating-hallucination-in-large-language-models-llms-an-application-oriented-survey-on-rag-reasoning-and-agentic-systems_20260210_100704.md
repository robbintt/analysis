# Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs): An Application-Oriented Survey on RAG, Reasoning, and Agentic Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.24476
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24476
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive analysis of hallucination mitigation techniques, establishing taxonomy of knowledge-based vs. logic-based hallucinations and unified framework integrating RAG, reasoning, and agentic systems.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines hallucination mitigation strategies in LLMs, distinguishing between knowledge-based hallucinations (factual errors) and logic-based hallucinations (reasoning errors). The authors establish a unified framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), reasoning enhancement, and Agentic Systems to address composite hallucinations across applications in healthcare, law, finance, and education. The survey identifies three core mitigation mechanisms: knowledge grounding via retrieval, logical decomposition via reasoning, and composite mitigation through reflective agentic loops, while highlighting critical challenges including efficiency trade-offs, multi-modal hallucinations, and the need for standardized evaluation methods.

## Method Summary
The survey conducts a systematic analysis of hallucination mitigation by establishing a taxonomy of hallucination types and reviewing RAG, reasoning, and agentic systems as complementary approaches. The unified framework involves implementing an Agentic System that integrates RAG modules (query rewriting, hybrid retrieval, reranking), reasoning modules (Chain-of-Thought or tool-augmented reasoning), and agent orchestration (planning, retrieval, reasoning, reflection). The method requires constructing hybrid RAG pipelines, integrating tool-calling capabilities for logic offloading, and implementing multi-agent workflows with verification mechanisms to address both knowledge gaps and logical inconsistencies in LLM outputs.

## Key Results
- Established taxonomy distinguishing knowledge-based hallucinations (factual errors) from logic-based hallucinations (reasoning errors)
- Systematic review of RAG techniques (sparse, dense, hybrid retrieval) for mitigating knowledge-based hallucinations
- Analysis of reasoning enhancement (Chain-of-Thought, symbolic reasoning) for addressing logic-based hallucinations
- Framework for Agentic Systems integrating retrieval and reasoning to mitigate composite hallucinations
- Identification of application domains (healthcare, law, finance, education) where hallucination mitigation is critical

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Knowledge Grounding via Retrieval
- **Claim:** RAG mitigates knowledge-based hallucinations by shifting generation burden from model's parametric memory to external evidence
- **Mechanism:** System identifies user intent, retrieves relevant documents, and conditions LLM generation on this context
- **Core assumption:** Retrieval pipeline surfaces accurate documents; generator faithfully utilizes context over internal priors
- **Evidence anchors:** [Abstract] "RAG supplements external knowledge to reduce factual errors"; [Section IV.A.3] discusses "mitigating knowledge conflicts"
- **Break condition:** Retrieval failures or "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon

### Mechanism 2: Logical Decomposition via Reasoning
- **Claim:** Reasoning enhancement mitigates logic-based hallucinations by decomposing inference tasks into verifiable steps
- **Mechanism:** Model generates reasoning chain; symbolic reasoning translates natural language to formal logic for external execution
- **Core assumption:** LLM generates logically sound intermediate steps without excessive drift
- **Evidence anchors:** [Abstract] "...reasoning enhancement... improves logical consistency"; [Section V.C] describes Symbolic Reasoning
- **Break condition:** "Overthinking" or invalid symbolic translation

### Mechanism 3: Composite Mitigation via Agentic Loops
- **Claim:** Agentic systems mitigate composite hallucinations by integrating retrieval and reasoning within reflective loops
- **Mechanism:** Agents utilize tools to gather facts and execute logic; self-reflection module evaluates output against evidence
- **Core assumption:** Agent's planner effectively decomposes tasks; tool interfaces are reliable
- **Evidence anchors:** [Abstract] "Agentic systems combine both paradigms"; [Section VI.B] describes MA-RAG and Agentic Reasoning
- **Break condition:** Error propagation across modules

## Foundational Learning

- **Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Memory**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand why RAG helps—LLM weights are static while RAG provides dynamic grounding
  - **Quick check question:** If a model was trained in 2023, can it factually answer a question about an event in 2024 without RAG?

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
  - **Why needed here:** To distinguish between retrieving facts (RAG) and processing them (Reasoning)
  - **Quick check question:** Does asking a model to "think step-by-step" primarily improve factual recall or logical derivation?

- **Knowledge Conflicts**
  - **Why needed here:** Critical failure mode where retrieved context contradicts model's internal beliefs
  - **Quick check question:** If retrieved documents say "Event X happened in 1990" but the model "knows" 1980, how should the system prioritize?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Query Rewriter -> Hybrid Retriever (Sparse/Dense) -> Knowledge Graphs -> CoT Generator/Symbolic Solver -> Planner -> Memory -> Tool Interface (Search/Calculator)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Intent Understanding: High-quality query rewriting determines retrieval success
  2. Context Integration: Prompt template must separate retrieved evidence from instruction
  3. Verification: Reasoning chain must be checked before final synthesis

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Latency vs. Accuracy: Agentic loops and symbolic reasoning add significant inference time
  - Creativity vs. Factuality: Strict RAG grounding reduces hallucination but may stifle creative generation
  - Granularity: Coarse-grained retrieval (documents) is faster; fine-grained (entities/sentences) is more accurate but complex

- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Hallucination on Hallucination": Retrieving AI-generated content from web and treating it as fact
  - "Lost-in-the-Middle": Model ignores evidence placed in middle of long contexts
  - Overthinking: Logic-based hallucinations introduced by excessively long CoT

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline vs. RAG: Measure factual accuracy on FreshQA dataset to verify knowledge gap filling
  2. Vanilla vs. CoT: Test GSM8K dataset with and without CoT prompts to isolate logic-based improvements
  3. Conflict Resolution: Intentionally feed contradictory retrieved documents and measure faithfulness to provided context

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can unified evaluation benchmarks be established for Agentic Systems to jointly assess knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations throughout complex workflows?
- **Basis in paper:** Section VII.D notes few benchmarks jointly measure these hallucinations in agents; Section VIII.A cites lack of unified design frameworks
- **Why unresolved:** Current evaluations are fragmented and rely on ad hoc pipelines, preventing fair comparison
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of end-to-end datasets that score systems on composite hallucinations, tracking errors from retrieval through reasoning

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can retrieval and reasoning modules be architected to "co-evolve" and interact dynamically rather than functioning as sequential pipeline?
- **Basis in paper:** Section VIII.A argues future development must move beyond linear execution to enable "co-evolution"
- **Why unresolved:** Existing systems execute retrieval and reasoning sequentially, causing error cascades and lacking synergistic adaptation
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Architectures demonstrating bidirectional feedback loops where reasoning guides retrieval granularity

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent can current RAG and reasoning enhancement paradigms effectively generalize to mitigate multi-modal hallucinations?
- **Basis in paper:** Section VIII.B states applicability and scalability for multi-modal hallucinations remain underexplored
- **Why unresolved:** Semantic gaps in modality alignment introduce noise that may offset retrieval benefits
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies on multi-modal agents showing consistent hallucination reduction rates comparable to text-only baselines

## Limitations
- Survey sacrifices detailed implementation specifications for architectural overviews, lacking specific prompt templates and algorithmic details
- Efficiency trade-offs between retrieval precision and latency are mentioned but not quantified
- Multi-modal hallucination detection lacks standardized benchmarks and evaluation methods
- Post-hoc verification mechanisms for agentic systems are described conceptually without implementation details

## Confidence
- Taxonomy of hallucination types (knowledge vs. logic-based): High
- Effectiveness of RAG for knowledge-based hallucinations: Medium
- Effectiveness of reasoning for logic-based hallucinations: Medium
- Composite mitigation via agentic systems: Low-Medium
- Benchmark comprehensiveness: Medium

## Next Checks
1. **Retrieval-Relevance Correlation**: Measure relationship between retrieval relevance scores and hallucination reduction rates across different RAG architectures to validate "input-level integration" assumption

2. **Reasoning Depth Trade-off**: Systematically test CoT depth (3, 5, 7, 10 steps) on logic tasks to empirically determine "overthinking" threshold where additional steps increase hallucination probability

3. **Agentic Error Propagation**: Implement multi-module agent system and track hallucination rates at each stage (planning, retrieval, reasoning, verification) to quantify error propagation and identify most critical failure points
