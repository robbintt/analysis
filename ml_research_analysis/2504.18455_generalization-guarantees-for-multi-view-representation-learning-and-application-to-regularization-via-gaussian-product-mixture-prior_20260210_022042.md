# Generalization Guarantees for Multi-View Representation Learning and Application to Regularization via Gaussian Product Mixture Prior

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.18455
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18455
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes generalization bounds for multi-view representation learning using MDL-based analysis and demonstrates improved performance with Gaussian Product Mixture MDL regularization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generalization in distributed multi-view representation learning, where multiple agents extract features from distinct data views without explicit coordination. The authors establish novel generalization bounds based on Minimum Description Length (MDL) relative to symmetric priors, which are tighter than previous information bottleneck approaches. The key theoretical insight is that encouraging feature redundancy across views can improve generalization performance, contradicting the common assumption that views should be maximally diverse.

The paper proposes a practical regularization method using data-dependent Gaussian mixture priors, which outperforms existing Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) and Category-Dependent VIB (CDVIB) approaches in both single-view and multi-view settings. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, USPS, and INTEL datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over baselines across various multi-view configurations, including scenarios with different view qualities and occlusions. The method naturally induces a weighted attention mechanism and feature redundancy consistent with the theoretical analysis.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a generalization framework for multi-view representation learning based on information-theoretic bounds. They derive generalization guarantees using MDL of latent variables relative to symmetric priors, establishing that feature redundancy across views can improve performance. The practical implementation uses a Gaussian Product Mixture MDL (GPM-MDL) regularizer constructed from data-dependent Gaussian mixture priors. This regularizer is applied during training to encourage representations that balance compression and predictive power while naturally inducing attention mechanisms across views.

## Key Results
- Generalization bounds based on MDL relative to symmetric priors outperform previous IB-based approaches
- Encouraging feature redundancy across views improves generalization, contrary to conventional wisdom
- GPM-MDL regularizer outperforms VIB and CDVIB on single-view cases
- Multi-view experiments show consistent improvements across CIFAR10, CIFAR100, USPS, and INTEL datasets
- The method naturally induces weighted attention mechanisms and feature redundancy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The theoretical framework leverages MDL principles to establish tighter generalization bounds than information bottleneck approaches. By using symmetric priors and analyzing the relative description length of latent variables, the bounds capture the trade-off between compression and prediction more effectively. The Gaussian mixture prior construction provides a flexible, data-dependent regularization that adapts to the underlying data distribution while encouraging the desired redundancy properties across views.

## Foundational Learning
**Minimum Description Length (MDL)**: A principle for model selection based on compression, measuring the complexity of models by the length of the description needed to encode them. Needed to establish information-theoretic generalization bounds that are tighter than IB approaches. Quick check: Verify that the description length of the latent variables relative to the prior is properly bounded.

**Symmetric Priors**: Priors that treat all outcomes equally, used to establish the MDL bounds. Needed to simplify the theoretical analysis and derive clean generalization guarantees. Quick check: Confirm that the symmetric prior assumption holds approximately for the data distribution.

**Information Bottleneck**: A framework for learning compressed representations that retain relevant information about targets. Needed as the baseline approach for comparison and to motivate the MDL-based improvements. Quick check: Ensure the IB-based bounds are properly derived and compared.

**Gaussian Mixture Models**: Probabilistic models representing data as mixtures of Gaussian distributions. Needed to construct the data-dependent priors for the GPM-MDL regularizer. Quick check: Verify that the mixture components capture the relevant structure in the data.

**Attention Mechanisms**: Methods for weighting the importance of different inputs or features. Needed to understand how the GPM-MDL prior naturally induces view-specific weighting. Quick check: Analyze the learned attention weights to confirm they reflect view quality differences.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
View 1 -> Feature Extractor 1 -> Latent Representation z_1
View 2 -> Feature Extractor 2 -> Latent Representation z_2
...
View N -> Feature Extractor N -> Latent Representation z_N
Latent Representations -> Decoder -> Label Prediction

Critical Path:
Data Views → Feature Extractors → Latent Representations → Decoder → Prediction

Design Tradeoffs:
- Balancing redundancy vs. diversity across views
- Choosing the number of Gaussian mixture components
- Trade-off between compression and prediction in the MDL framework
- Computational cost of multiple feature extractors vs. performance gains

Failure Signatures:
- Poor generalization when views have very different semantic content
- Instability in mixture component learning with insufficient data
- Suboptimal performance when view quality is highly imbalanced
- Increased computational cost with many views or high-dimensional data

First Experiments:
1. Single-view CIFAR10 classification with GPM-MDL vs VIB regularization
2. Two-view CIFAR10 with synthetic occlusions comparing different regularization methods
3. Multi-view USPS digit recognition with varying numbers of Gaussian mixture components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies on information-theoretic bounds with symmetric prior assumptions that may not capture real-world complexities
- Gaussian mixture prior construction requires careful tuning and may not generalize well to highly non-Gaussian data structures
- Experiments focus on image datasets with controlled view separations, leaving uncertainty about heterogeneous multi-view scenarios
- Scalability to very high-dimensional views or scenarios with many (>3) views is not thoroughly investigated

## Confidence
High: The generalization bounds based on MDL relative to symmetric priors are mathematically sound and the comparison to previous IB-based approaches is valid. The experimental results demonstrating improved performance over baselines on CIFAR and USPS datasets are reproducible and convincing for the tested settings.

Medium: The theoretical claim that encouraging feature redundancy improves generalization is well-supported within the model assumptions but may have limited applicability when views have very different semantic content. The attention mechanism induced by the GPM-MDL prior is empirically observed but lacks rigorous theoretical characterization.

Low: The scalability of the Gaussian mixture prior approach to very high-dimensional views or scenarios with many (>3) views is not thoroughly investigated. The robustness to view quality imbalances beyond the tested synthetic occlusion scenarios remains uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Test the GPM-MDL method on multi-view datasets with semantically diverse views (e.g., text+image pairs) to assess cross-modal generalization properties
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of Gaussian components in the mixture prior to establish sensitivity and optimal configurations
3. Evaluate performance degradation when views have highly asymmetric information content rather than the balanced scenarios tested
