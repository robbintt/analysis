# Autonomous Question Formation for Large Language Model-Driven AI Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01556
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01556
- Authors: Hong Su
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: LLM-driven AI systems can improve performance in dynamic environments by autonomously discovering and formulating questions before task selection, with environment-aware and inter-agent-aware prompting significantly reducing failure rates

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in current AI systems: their inability to autonomously identify what questions to ask in dynamic environments. The proposed human-simulation framework treats question formation as a first-class decision process that precedes task selection and execution, enabling AI systems to progressively expand their cognitive coverage through internal, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware prompting scopes. Experimental results in a multi-agent simulation environment demonstrate that autonomous question formation significantly reduces no-eat events compared to baseline approaches, with inter-agent-aware prompting achieving a 60% improvement over the internal-driven baseline.

## Method Summary
The approach introduces a human-simulation framework that models question formation as a cognitive process driven by internal states, environmental observations, and inter-agent interactions. The framework employs a three-stage prompting mechanism: first discovering what to ask through iterative refinement, then generating questions based on the discovery, and finally selecting tasks based on those questions. Three prompting scopes are defined - internal-driven (focused on cognitive needs), environment-aware (incorporating environmental observations), and inter-agent-aware (considering social dynamics). The system supports learning question-formation patterns from experience through utility optimization, though the experiments primarily compare fixed prompting strategies rather than learned approaches.

## Key Results
- Environment-aware prompting significantly reduces no-eat events compared with the internal-driven baseline
- Inter-agent-aware prompting further reduces cumulative no-eat events by more than 60% over a 20-day simulation
- Statistical significance achieved (p < 0.05) for performance improvements across experimental conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating question formation as a fundamental cognitive capability that enables AI systems to adapt to dynamic environments. By discovering what to ask before selecting tasks, the system can identify gaps in knowledge and adjust its behavior accordingly. The human-simulation approach captures how humans naturally form questions based on internal needs, environmental cues, and social interactions. The progressive expansion from internal-driven to inter-agent-aware prompting allows the system to build increasingly sophisticated understanding of its operating context, leading to more effective decision-making and reduced failure rates.

## Foundational Learning
- Cognitive state modeling: Why needed - to represent the AI system's internal knowledge and needs; Quick check - verify state variables capture relevant aspects of system knowledge
- Environmental observation integration: Why needed - to enable awareness of external conditions affecting decisions; Quick check - confirm observation features improve question relevance
- Social interaction modeling: Why needed - to capture inter-agent dynamics affecting outcomes; Quick check - validate interaction patterns influence question formation
- Multi-stage prompting: Why needed - to separate question discovery from question generation; Quick check - ensure each stage adds distinct value to the process
- Experience-based learning: Why needed - to improve question-formation patterns over time; Quick check - measure performance improvement with accumulated experience

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Environment -> Observation Processor -> Question Discovery -> Question Generation -> Task Selection -> Action Executor -> Environment

Critical path: Environment observation → Question discovery refinement → Question generation → Task selection → Action execution

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational overhead for improved adaptability and reduced failure rates. The multi-stage prompting approach adds latency but enables more sophisticated question formation. Fixed prompting strategies offer predictability while learned approaches promise long-term improvement but require experience accumulation.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation occurs when prompting scopes are too narrow (missing critical information), when question discovery fails to identify relevant gaps, or when task selection cannot effectively leverage generated questions. Environmental changes that invalidate existing question patterns may also cause failures.

First experiments:
1. Compare all three prompting scopes in a simple resource acquisition environment to establish baseline performance differences
2. Test the learning mechanism by running multiple episodes and measuring improvement in question formation quality
3. Validate the human-simulation approach by comparing against human-designed question formation strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the learnable question-formation mechanism (optimizing π_Q through long-term utility) actually converge and improve performance compared to fixed prompting strategies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "the framework supports learning the question-formation process from experience" and describes optimizing π_Q via Equation 36, but the experiments only compare three fixed prompting methods without evaluating the learning mechanism.
- Why unresolved: No experiments demonstrate whether agents can successfully learn effective question patterns from accumulated experience tuples D = {(C_t, Q_t, τ_t, π_t, R_t)}.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing improved decision quality over time as agents accumulate experience, with comparison between learned π_Q and fixed prompting strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the framework compare to traditional autonomous decision-making approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning, intrinsic motivation methods) in terms of sample efficiency, adaptability, and performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Related work mentions RL and curiosity-driven learning, but experiments only compare internal-driven, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware LLM prompting—no comparison with non-LLM baselines.
- Why unresolved: Without baseline comparisons to established methods, the relative advantage of LLM-driven question formation remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments against RL agents or intrinsic motivation methods in the same multi-agent resource environment.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the inter-agent-aware prompting approach generalize to more complex social scenarios beyond the specific greeting-watering coupling tested?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The interaction model is highly specific: unhappy agents who aren't greeted suppress watering. This single mechanism may not represent the diversity of real-world social reasoning.
- Why unresolved: The 60% improvement in no-eat events depends on this particular social-environmental coupling; whether similar gains occur in other multi-agent coordination scenarios is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments in diverse multi-agent environments with varied interaction structures and cooperation requirements.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to specific multi-agent simulation environment focused on resource acquisition
- Performance metrics center on single outcome (no-eat events), potentially overlooking other important dimensions
- Computational overhead and scalability challenges not addressed for complex environments

## Confidence

High confidence: Core observation that autonomous question formation improves performance in dynamic environments, supported by statistically significant experimental results

Medium confidence: Generalizability of human-simulation framework and three prompting scope taxonomy, as these conceptual contributions are well-reasoned but require broader validation

Low confidence: Claims about long-term sustainability and adaptability beyond specific experimental conditions, as these assertions extend beyond demonstrated results

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments across diverse task domains (e.g., navigation, scheduling, knowledge discovery) to assess framework generalizability beyond resource acquisition scenarios
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the specific contribution of each prompting scope component and determine minimum viable configuration for performance gains
3. Measure computational overhead and response latency introduced by autonomous question formation process to evaluate practical deployment feasibility in time-sensitive applications
