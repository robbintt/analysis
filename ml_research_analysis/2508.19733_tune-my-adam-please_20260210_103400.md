# Tune My Adam, Please!

## Quick Facts

- Pre-trained Adam surrogate model achieves better learning curve extrapolation and accelerates hyperparameter optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Adam-PFN, a specialized surrogate model for Bayesian optimization of Adam optimizer hyperparameters, pre-trained on real learning curves from TaskSet. The key innovation is CDF-augment, a learning curve augmentation method using Beta distribution CDFs to increase training data diversity by non-linearly transforming task hardness while preserving curve rankings. Adam-PFN improves learning curve extrapolation accuracy and accelerates hyperparameter optimization, achieving similar performance at 150 epochs compared to FT-PFN at 750 epochs.

## Method Summary
Adam-PFN is a pre-trained Physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator (PFN) specifically designed for Adam optimizer hyperparameter optimization. The model is trained on learning curves from TaskSet, a benchmark of diverse tasks and architectures. The key innovation is CDF-augment, which applies Beta distribution CDF transformations to learning curves to create synthetic training data that preserves curve rankings while increasing task hardness diversity. This augmentation method addresses the limitation of TaskSet's relatively small number of tasks by generating more diverse training samples without losing the essential ranking information needed for effective hyperparameter optimization.

## Key Results
- Adam-PFN achieves log-likelihood of 5.326 vs 3.440 for FT-PFN on learning curve extrapolation accuracy
- On FT-PFN, Adam-PFN reaches 0.7 AUROC in 150 epochs vs 750 epochs for FT-PFN
- Adam-PFN performs best early in optimization on out-of-distribution tasks before being overtaken by FT-PFN

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Adam-PFN works by leveraging pre-training on a large dataset of learning curves to create a specialized surrogate model for Adam optimizer hyperparameter optimization. The CDF-augment method increases training data diversity by applying Beta distribution CDF transformations to existing learning curves, creating synthetic samples that preserve the relative ranking of curves while varying the perceived task difficulty. This approach allows the model to learn robust representations of how different hyperparameter configurations affect learning across diverse tasks, leading to more accurate predictions and faster convergence during Bayesian optimization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Sequential model-based optimization method that uses surrogate models to efficiently search hyperparameter spaces; needed for understanding the optimization framework within which Adam-PFN operates
- **Learning Curve Extrapolation**: The task of predicting final model performance from early training curves; critical check is whether predictions remain accurate as training progresses
- **Surrogate Models**: Models that approximate expensive-to-evaluate functions; quick check involves verifying prediction accuracy against ground truth evaluations
- **Fourier Neural Operators**: Neural network architecture for learning operators on function spaces; fundamental for understanding PFN architecture and its physics-informed variant
- **TaskSet Benchmark**: Standardized collection of diverse machine learning tasks; needed to understand the dataset used for pre-training and evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: TaskSet datasets -> CDF-augment -> Adam-PFN training -> Bayesian Optimization loop -> Hyperparameter recommendations

Critical Path: The critical path involves generating augmented learning curves through CDF-augment, training Adam-PFN on these curves, and then using the trained model within Bayesian optimization to recommend hyperparameter configurations. The quality of CDF-augment directly impacts Adam-PFN's performance, which in turn determines the effectiveness of the hyperparameter optimization.

Design Tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between model specialization and generalization. Adam-PFN is specialized for Adam optimizer hyperparameters but may perform worse on other optimizers compared to a more general FT-PFN. The fixed search space provides consistency but limits adaptability to different optimization scenarios.

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation on truly out-of-distribution tasks where the pre-training data lacks relevant examples, or when the search space contains configurations far outside the pre-training distribution. The temporal pattern where Adam-PFN is initially better but later overtaken by FT-PFN suggests limitations in long-term adaptation capabilities.

First Experiments:
1. Compare learning curve extrapolation accuracy of Adam-PFN vs FT-PFN on a held-out validation set from TaskSet
2. Evaluate hyperparameter optimization speed by measuring AUROC convergence rates across multiple tasks
3. Test performance on out-of-distribution tasks to assess generalization beyond the pre-training distribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Fixed hyperparameter search space across all experiments limits adaptability to different optimization scenarios
- CDF-augment represents just one approach to learning curve augmentation, with alternative methods unexplored
- The temporal performance pattern on out-of-distribution tasks (early superiority followed by being overtaken) requires further investigation

## Confidence
High: The core claims about Adam-PFN's improved learning curve extrapolation accuracy and accelerated hyperparameter optimization are well-supported by experimental results across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Medium: The claims regarding CDF-augment's effectiveness in increasing data diversity and the general superiority of Adam-PFN over FT-PFN for OoD tasks are supported but could benefit from additional ablation studies and broader task coverage.

Low: The assertion that Adam-PFN's performance pattern on OoD tasks represents a fundamental limitation or advantage requires further investigation with more diverse task distributions and longer optimization horizons.

## Next Checks
1. Test Adam-PFN with dynamic search space adaptation where the hyperparameter ranges can adjust based on task characteristics or initial optimization results.
2. Compare CDF-augment against alternative learning curve augmentation methods including Gaussian Process interpolation and other distribution-based transformations on the same benchmark tasks.
3. Conduct experiments on specialized or domain-specific tasks (e.g., medical imaging, scientific computing) that are not well-represented in TaskSet to evaluate Adam-PFN's performance on truly out-of-distribution scenarios.
