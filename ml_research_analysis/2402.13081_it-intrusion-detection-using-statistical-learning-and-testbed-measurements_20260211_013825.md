# IT Intrusion Detection Using Statistical Learning and Testbed Measurements

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.13081
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13081
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Statistical learning methods (HMM, LSTM, RFC) can predict intrusion start times and attack action sequences from high-dimensional IT infrastructure measurements, with HMM offering efficiency and LSTM providing highest accuracy for sequences.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically evaluates statistical learning methods for automated intrusion detection in IT infrastructures using high-dimensional measurement data from an emulated testbed. The authors compare Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Random Forest Classifiers (RFC) for predicting intrusion start times, attack types, and action sequences. A key contribution is a machine-learning pipeline that reduces 50-dimensional observation vectors to low-dimensional representations or observation symbols, which is critical for HMM model complexity. The study demonstrates that surprisingly small sets of observation attributes, particularly SNORT alert counts, enable accurate predictions. HMM offers an attractive balance of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, while LSTM provides superior accuracy but requires more resources and labeled data.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluated three statistical learning approaches - HMM, LSTM, and RFC - using 2000 traces of two attack types, each with six distinct actions. They developed a preprocessing pipeline that removes redundant attributes, selects top-ranked features using RFC, and clusters remaining attributes into observation symbols for HMM. The models were trained to predict intrusion start time, attack type, individual attack actions, and complete action sequences. HMM was trained both supervised (with labeled state sequences) and unsupervised (using Baum-Welch algorithm), with label mapping required for unsupervised cases. LSTM used sequence-to-sequence architecture, while RFC performed frame-wise classification. The 70/30 train-test split and four accuracy metrics (Accstart, Acctype, Accaction, Accsequence) enabled comprehensive performance evaluation.

## Key Results
- HMM and LSTM achieve similar accuracy (>0.99) for predicting intrusion start times, while RFC performs best for this task due to lower complexity
- LSTM outperforms both HMM and RFC for predicting attack action sequences (>0.91 accuracy), while RFC fails completely at sequence prediction since it cannot capture temporal dependencies
- Surprisingly small sets of observation attributes, particularly SNORT alert counts, enable accurate predictions across all models
- HMM offers an attractive balance of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for intrusion detection even with limited labeled data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sequence models (HMM, LSTM) outperform non-sequence models (RFC) for predicting attack action sequences because they capture temporal dependencies between actions.
- Mechanism: Both HMM (via first-order Markov assumption and Viterbi decoding) and LSTM (via recurrent gates and memory cells) learn the probability of the next state/action given previous states/actions. RFC treats each observation independently, losing temporal context.
- Core assumption: Attack actions exhibit sequential structure (e.g., scan → exploit → install tools), violating the i.i.d. assumption.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...LSTM outperforms both HMM and RFC for predicting attack action sequences (above 0.91 accuracy). RFC performs worst for sequence prediction since it cannot capture temporal dependencies."
  - [section VII-E] "HMM and LSTM outperform RFC in terms of predicting the attack actions... RFC does not capture the temporal information of sequences."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corroboration; neighbor papers focus on detection, not comparative temporal modeling. Assumption needs empirical validation in your data.
- Break condition: If your attack actions are statistically independent or randomly ordered (no sequential pattern), sequence models will not outperform RFC.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dimensionality reduction via feature selection and clustering maintains predictive accuracy while reducing computational cost.
- Mechanism: Removing constant and highly correlated attributes eliminates redundancy. RFC-based feature ranking identifies informative attributes (e.g., SNORT alert counts). Clustering maps continuous, high-dimensional observations into a small set of discrete observation symbols for HMM, controlling parameter growth.
- Core assumption: Most attributes are redundant or irrelevant; a small subset captures the signal needed for discrimination.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...pipeline that reduces high-dimensional observation vectors (50 attributes) to low-dimensional representations or observation symbols."
  - [section VI] "More than half of them turn out to have constant values and are therefore redundant... four of them are alert counts from the IDS, which is a SNORT system."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corroboration; neighbor papers don't specifically validate this reduction pipeline.
- Break condition: If your data contains many informative attributes with non-redundant signal, aggressive reduction may discard predictive power. Validate by measuring accuracy vs. attribute count.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: HMM can be trained with limited or no labeled state sequences (unsupervised learning), making it viable when full ground truth is unavailable.
- Mechanism: The Baum-Welch algorithm (EM) estimates HMM parameters from observation sequences alone. Supervised HMM uses labeled state sequences for parameter estimation. Unsupervised HMM predicts state labels which must be mapped to actions via a learned correspondence.
- Core assumption: The true underlying state structure (attack actions) corresponds to the hidden states inferred by the model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-A] "In case only sample sequences of observations are available, the Baum-Welch algorithm allows for unsupervised training."
  - [section VII-C, Table 3] Unsupervised HMM achieves high start-time accuracy (0.993) but lower action accuracy (0.779) vs. supervised (0.919) for Attack 1 with top attribute.
  - [corpus] No direct validation in neighbors.
- Break condition: If the true number or structure of hidden states does not match the model's assumptions, or if observations are insufficiently discriminative, unsupervised mapping will fail. Supervised data may be required for complex tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**
  - Why needed here: HMM is the core probabilistic framework for modeling state sequences (attack actions) from observations. Understanding its parameters (transition, emission, initial probabilities) and algorithms (Baum-Welch, Viterbi) is essential to implement, train, and interpret the model.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why HMM complexity scales with the number of observation symbols, and how the Viterbi algorithm finds the most likely state sequence?

- **Concept: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**
  - Why needed here: LSTM is the sequence-to-sequence deep learning alternative that can capture longer-range dependencies than first-order HMM. Understanding its architecture (gates, cell state) and training requirements (labeled data, compute) is necessary to evaluate its trade-offs.
  - Quick check question: How does an LSTM's ability to maintain a cell state over many time steps differ from HMM's first-order Markov assumption?

- **Concept: Random Forest Classifier (RFC) for Feature Ranking**
  - Why needed here: RFC is used both as a baseline classifier and as the method for ranking feature importance. Understanding how ensemble trees provide importance scores is critical for the preprocessing pipeline.
  - Quick check question: If you run an RFC on your dataset and find the top feature has very low importance, what might that indicate about your data or feature set?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Testbed traces -> Observation sequences (50 attributes) -> Preprocessing (remove constants/correlated, RFC feature ranking, GMM clustering) -> HMM/LSTM/RFC training -> Viterbi/forward pass/single-step classification -> Predicted start time, attack type, action sequence

- **Critical path**: The preprocessing → feature selection step is most critical. If key attributes (e.g., SNORT counts) are removed, all downstream models suffer. Validate each step with ablation studies.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - HMM: Lower compute, supports unsupervised training, but first-order assumption limits long-range dependency modeling. Best when labeled data is scarce.
  - LSTM: Highest accuracy for sequence prediction, but requires significant labeled data and compute. Best when labels are plentiful and accuracy is paramount.
  - RFC: Fastest for single-step predictions (start time), but fails to model sequences. Best as a baseline or feature ranker.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - HMM: Low Accaction with unsupervised training → possible state-action mapping mismatch; try supervised or increase observation symbols.
  - LSTM: Poor accuracy despite large data → check input normalization, sequence length, model capacity (hidden units).
  - RFC: High Accstart but near-zero Accsequence → expected due to lack of temporal modeling.
  - General: Performance degrades with all models → re-examine preprocessing; key attributes may have been removed or data distribution shifted.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate baseline: Run the exact pipeline with the 1- and 4-top-attribute sets on the provided traces. Verify reported Accstart (>0.99) and Accsequence (>0.91 for LSTM). Document any discrepancies.
  2. Ablation on features: Vary the number of top attributes (1, 4, 8, all remaining) and plot Accsequence for all three models. Identify the point of diminishing returns.
  3. Unsupervised vs. Supervised HMM: Train HMM with 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of labeled training data. Plot Accaction and Accsequence to quantify the value of labels and identify the minimum viable labeled set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How does the intensity and type of background activity (from regular users or maintenance processes) impact the prediction accuracy of statistical learning models in this pipeline?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section IX (Conclusions and Future Work) explicitly states the authors plan to "investigate how the prediction accuracy depends on the type and intensity of background activities by regular users or by maintenance processes."
  - **Why unresolved**: The current evaluation relies on a controlled testbed environment which may not fully replicate the noise and traffic variability of a production IT infrastructure.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: A sensitivity analysis measuring Accstart and Accaction on the testbed while systematically increasing the volume of non-malicious background traffic and diverse user behaviors.

- **Question**: Can the proposed statistical learning methods effectively predict actions within a large family of variable attack sequences that achieve a specific goal, rather than fixed sequences?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section IX identifies the limitation of current experiments, which focus on fixed sequences, and proposes studying "prediction methods that are applicable to a large family of attack sequences."
  - **Why unresolved**: The current models are trained on two specific attack types with relatively deterministic action orders (Table 2), potentially overfitting to these specific paths.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluation of HMM and LSTM performance on a new dataset where attackers utilize multiple, non-deterministic paths to reach the same exploitation goal.

- **Question**: What causes the non-monotonic behavior (specifically, the accuracy drop between sequence lengths 4 and 5) in the online prediction accuracy of the Hidden Markov Model?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section VII-D reports an "aberration where the accuracy decreases when the sequence length grows from four to five" and states, "We can not fully explain this behavior."
  - **Why unresolved**: This contradicts the theoretical expectation that longer observation sequences should provide more evidence, thereby increasing prediction confidence/accuracy.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: A theoretical analysis of the specific transition probabilities in the trained HMM or a statistical breakdown of prediction errors at sequence length 5 versus 4 to identify conflicting observation symbols.

## Limitations

- The testbed-generated traces may not capture the full complexity and variability of real-world attack patterns, potentially limiting external validity
- The study focuses on two specific attack types with six actions each, raising questions about performance on more diverse or complex attack scenarios
- The dimensionality reduction pipeline may not preserve predictive information in datasets with different attribute distributions or correlation structures
- The LSTM architecture details are underspecified, making exact replication challenging
- The unsupervised HMM's reliance on label mapping through permutation search becomes computationally intractable for larger state spaces, limiting scalability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Claims about RFC's inability to capture temporal dependencies (supported by fundamental differences in model architecture and explicit statement that RFC treats observations independently)
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about HMM's efficiency and viability with limited labeled data (supported by unsupervised training results but requires stronger empirical validation across diverse datasets)
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about LSTM's superior sequence prediction accuracy (supported by reported metrics but dependent on unspecified architecture details and training procedures)

## Next Checks

1. **External Dataset Validation**: Apply the complete pipeline to a different intrusion detection dataset (e.g., CIC-DDoS2019 or real enterprise network data) to assess generalizability beyond the original testbed environment.

2. **Model Complexity vs. Performance Trade-off**: Systematically vary the number of hidden states in HMM and hidden units in LSTM, measuring both prediction accuracy and computational requirements to quantify the efficiency-accuracy trade-off more precisely.

3. **Robustness to Data Distribution Shifts**: Introduce controlled perturbations to the test data (e.g., noise injection, attribute value shifts, sequence length variations) and measure model degradation to evaluate real-world deployment robustness.
