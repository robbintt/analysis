# Practical Policy Distillation for Reinforcement Learning in Radio Access Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06563
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06563
- Reference count: 19
- The paper demonstrates that policy distillation can compress RAN AI models by up to 30× while maintaining <1% throughput loss and ±7% BLER deviation.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the deployment challenge of AI-driven link adaptation in radio access networks by applying policy distillation to compress large teacher models into smaller, deployable student models. The authors show that transferring knowledge from scenario-agnostic or multi-scenario teachers to compact students preserves generalization performance across diverse network conditions. Experiments in a 5G-compliant simulator demonstrate that distilled models (down to 3.5k parameters) achieve near-identical performance to their 105k-parameter teachers, while direct training of small models from scratch performs significantly worse. The approach enables AI deployment on legacy RAN hardware with tight computational and memory constraints.

## Method Summary
The method employs policy distillation to compress link adaptation models from large teacher networks to smaller student networks. A DQN teacher with 7-layer MLP (105k parameters) is trained using distributed reinforcement learning with domain randomization across 5000 simulations. Two distillation strategies are evaluated: single-policy distillation from one generalist teacher, and multi-policy distillation combining multiple scenario-specific teachers. Students of three sizes (4×64, 4×32, 3×32 parameters) are trained offline using KL divergence loss on Q-value distributions from ~20M distillation samples. Performance is measured via throughput, BLER deviation, and episodic reward compared to the teacher baseline.

## Key Results
- Distilled student models achieve 30× compression (3.5k vs 105k parameters) with <1% throughput loss and BLER deviations within ±7%
- Single-policy distillation preserves teacher performance better than multi-policy, with throughput deficit never exceeding -2.8%
- Direct training of small models from scratch results in significant performance collapse, confirming distillation's effectiveness
- Domain randomization enables generalization across MIMO, mMIMO, and SCSU benchmark scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KL divergence loss transfers policy knowledge by matching student Q-value distributions to teacher Q-value distributions, with temperature scaling to sharpen action preferences.
- Mechanism: The teacher produces Q-values representing expected future rewards for each action. The student learns to reproduce these distributions via L_KL loss. Lower temperature τ sharpens the softmax distribution, accentuating differences in action preferences and improving policy fidelity.
- Core assumption: The Q-value distribution encodes sufficient policy knowledge; student architecture has enough capacity to approximate this distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "We employ the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss... Rusu et al. recommend using lower values of τ to sharpen the output distribution."
  - Eq. (2) defines the distillation loss formally
  - Rusu et al. (2016) original policy distillation paper establishes this mechanism; corpus confirms this is standard approach
- Break condition: Student capacity too limited for the task complexity; temperature τ set too high (over-smoothing) or too low (over-sharpening causes gradient instability).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Domain randomization enables generalization by exposing the teacher—and thus the distillation dataset—to heterogeneous network conditions during training.
- Mechanism: Network parameters (cell radius, bandwidth, TX power, UE speed, antenna configs, traffic types) are randomized per simulation. This creates diverse state observations for distillation, preventing overfitting to specific deployment conditions.
- Core assumption: Randomized parameters span the variability space encountered in real deployments; the teacher successfully learns robust policies across this space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "domain randomization to generate diverse training datasets from varied simulated environments"
  - Table I lists randomized parameters; "5000 simulations, distributed across 16 actors, each with randomized network parameters"
  - Limited direct corpus evidence on domain randomization in RAN specifically; related work (Demirel et al., arXiv:2507.06602) discusses generalization challenges in RAN RL
- Break condition: Randomization ranges don't cover real-world variability; simulation-to-reality gap persists despite randomization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-policy distillation consolidates specialized expertise by aggregating distillation datasets from multiple scenario-specific teachers into one unified student.
- Mechanism: N independent teachers trained on specific environments (e.g., urban, rural, high-speed). Each generates dataset D^T_j. Datasets are shuffled and aggregated. Student learns from combined Q-value distributions, inheriting broad coverage.
- Core assumption: Scenario-specific teachers are high-quality in their domains; aggregation doesn't introduce conflicting signal that degrades overall policy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student"
  - "throughput deficit of the smallest student model never exceeds −2.8%... maximum observed reduction in episodic reward is 3.7%"
  - Weak corpus evidence on multi-policy distillation specifically; Rusu et al. mention but don't deeply evaluate multi-policy approaches
- Break condition: Teacher policies conflict significantly (e.g., same state, opposite action preferences); aggregation introduces noise that student cannot resolve.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Markov Decision Processes and Q-learning**
  - Why needed here: Link adaptation is formulated as an episodic MDP; understanding states, actions, rewards, and Q-values is essential to grasp what's being distilled.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Q-values (not just actions) are transferred during policy distillation?

- Concept: **Knowledge Distillation Fundamentals**
  - Why needed here: The core technique; involves teacher-student architecture, soft targets, and the intuition that distributions encode more information than hard labels.
  - Quick check question: Why does matching a softmax distribution over actions preserve more information than mimicking only the argmax action?

- Concept: **5G Link Adaptation and MCS Selection**
  - Why needed here: The application domain; MCS index selection directly affects spectral efficiency and BLER. Understanding HARQ feedback loops clarifies state design.
  - Quick check question: What is the tradeoff between selecting a higher vs. lower MCS index in terms of throughput and error rate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Teacher model -> Distillation dataset -> Student models -> Performance evaluation
  - Distributed RL with domain randomization -> Q-value collection -> Offline distillation training -> Benchmark scenario testing

- Critical path:
  1. Train teacher(s) using distributed RL with domain randomization (5000 simulations, 16 actors)
  2. Generate distillation dataset by evaluating trained teacher on randomized states
  3. Train student(s) offline using KL divergence loss on aggregated Q-value targets
  4. Validate on held-out benchmark scenarios (MIMO, mMIMO, SCSU)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Student size vs. performance**: Smaller students (3×32) show slightly higher degradation but may be necessary for strict memory budgets
  - **Single vs. multi-policy**: Single-policy preserves teacher performance better (<1% throughput loss); multi-policy enables merging specialized experts but with slightly higher degradation (~2-3%)
  - **Temperature τ**: Lower values sharpen distribution (better fidelity) but may cause training instability

- Failure signatures:
  - **Underfitting**: Student trained from scratch collapses to limited action subset (Fig. 3d-f purple peaks at indices 10, 16)
  - **Capacity mismatch**: Excessive compression beyond ~30× may degrade performance beyond acceptable thresholds
  - **Distribution shift**: If distillation dataset doesn't cover deployment conditions, student generalization fails

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Train smallest student (3×32) directly with RL on same data—confirm it underperforms distilled student by >10% throughput
  2. **Temperature sweep**: Vary τ (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0) and measure throughput/BLER deviation—identify stability-fidelity tradeoff
  3. **Cross-scenario test**: Train single-policy teacher on MIMO scenarios only; test distilled student on mMIMO—quantify generalization gap vs. domain-randomized teacher

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can policy distillation approaches transfer effectively from simulation to real RAN hardware deployments, and what sim-to-real gaps exist?
- Basis in paper: The authors note domain randomization is used "to bridge the simulation-to-real gap" and all experiments use a "high-fidelity, 5G-compliant simulator" without real hardware validation.
- Why unresolved: No real-world deployment results are provided; simulation-only evaluation may not capture hardware-specific constraints like quantization effects, timing jitter, or memory fragmentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Deployment of distilled student models on actual baseband hardware (FPGA/DSP/ASIC) with measurements of inference latency, memory footprint, and performance metrics under real traffic.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does multi-policy distillation scale with the number of scenario-specific teachers, and at what point does student capacity become a bottleneck?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates only three scenario-specific teachers merged into one student, but the scalability to more diverse scenarios (e.g., 10+ distinct network contexts) is not explored.
- Why unresolved: The 30× compression may suffice for three scenarios, but fusing knowledge from many more specialized teachers could exceed student capacity, causing catastrophic forgetting or performance degradation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the number of teachers (N=3, 5, 10, 20) while monitoring student performance across all teacher-specific scenarios and held-out test cases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can policy distillation be successfully applied to other latency-critical RAN functions beyond link adaptation, such as scheduling or power control?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates success on link adaptation but states AI has been "explored across a broad range of RAN functions" including scheduling, mobility management, and channel estimation.
- Why unresolved: Different RAN functions have different state/action space characteristics, latency budgets, and reward structures that may affect distillation effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the distillation methodology on at least one additional L1/L2 RAN function with similar compression ratios and generalization metrics reported.

## Limitations

- Simulation-to-reality gap remains unvalidated despite domain randomization efforts
- Multi-policy distillation mechanism lacks deep examination of teacher policy conflicts
- Temperature hyperparameter τ is mentioned as critical but not empirically optimized across student model spectrum

## Confidence

- **Single-policy distillation effectiveness (High)**: Well-supported by controlled experiments showing consistent <1% throughput loss across all student sizes
- **Multi-policy distillation generalization (Medium)**: Performance gains demonstrated but mechanism and edge-case behavior not thoroughly examined
- **Domain randomization sufficiency (Low-Medium)**: Assumed effective but simulation-real world gap not quantified; limited corpus evidence for RAN-specific applications
- **Model size vs. performance tradeoff (High)**: Clear quantitative relationship established with error margins reported

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-scenario generalization test**: Train single-policy teacher on MIMO-only scenarios; evaluate distilled student on mMIMO and SCSU. Compare performance gap vs domain-randomized teacher to quantify simulation-reality gap.

2. **Temperature hyperparameter sweep**: Systematically vary τ (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0) for each student size. Measure throughput/BLER deviation and training stability to identify optimal tradeoff between fidelity and convergence.

3. **Teacher policy conflict analysis**: For multi-policy distillation, identify states where scenario-specific teachers disagree on optimal action. Measure whether student inherits conflicting preferences and quantify performance degradation in these edge cases.
