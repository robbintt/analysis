# An Evaluation of Interleaved Instruction Tuning on Semantic Reasoning Performance in an Audio MLLM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.02234
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02234
- Reference count: 40
- Zero-shot interleaved prompting improves semantic reasoning performance but reduces audio labeling accuracy in an audio MLLM.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how interleaved instruction tuning affects semantic reasoning in an audio-based multimodal large language model (MLLM). The authors introduce SHARD, a benchmark for audio semantic reasoning, and evaluate zero-shot interleaved prompting and fine-tuning on interleaved prompts using small (40K) and large (1 million) datasets. Results show that interleaving improves semantic reasoning but degrades audio labeling, with small-scale fine-tuning achieving the best balance while large-scale tuning causes catastrophic forgetting.

## Method Summary
The study uses the LTU model (CAV-MAE audio encoder + LLaMa LLM) and evaluates it on the newly created SHARD benchmark for audio semantic reasoning. Three conditions are tested: the original non-interleaved LTU, zero-shot interleaved prompting, and fine-tuning with interleaved prompts using LoRA (rank=8, alpha=16) on datasets of 40K and 1M samples. Performance is measured on synonym and hypernym recognition tasks, as well as audio labeling identity accuracy.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot interleaved prompting improves semantic reasoning performance (F1 increases of 17.73% for synonyms and 18.15% for hypernyms) but reduces audio labeling accuracy.
- Small-scale fine-tuning (40K samples) on interleaved prompts achieves the best balanced performance for semantic tasks while maintaining reasonable audio labeling capability.
- Large-scale fine-tuning (1M samples) leads to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, with identity accuracy dropping from 48.45% to 28.75%.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interleaved prompting improves semantic reasoning by enabling direct attention between audio tokens and contextual text.
- Mechanism: Placing audio embeddings within the text sequence allows the LLM's attention mechanism to relate audio tokens to preceding and succeeding text tokens, creating tighter audio-text alignment at inference time.
- Core assumption: The model's attention heads are already capable of cross-modal reasoning but are underutilized when audio tokens are isolated at sequence boundaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "zero-shot interleaved prompting improves performance on our reasoning tasks"
  - [section 5] "The interleaved instruction allows audio tokens to attend directly to preceding text, rather than only to other audio tokens"
- Break condition: If the base model's attention window cannot accommodate the interleaved sequence length, or if audio token representations are too semantically sparse to benefit from textual context.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Small-scale interleaved fine-tuning balances semantic reasoning gains against labeling capability loss.
- Mechanism: Limited-parameter updates via LoRA on 40K interleaved samples adjust the projection between audio encoder and LLM without extensively overwriting pre-trained audio-labeling weights.
- Core assumption: The interleaved format requires some weight adaptation to be fully exploited beyond zero-shot prompting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a small amount of fine-tuning using interleaved training prompts improves the results further, however, at the expense of the MLLM's audio labeling ability"
  - [section 4] "Fine-tuning with the small dataset, improved precision for both synonyms... over the interleaved prompting of the baseline model"
- Break condition: If LoRA rank is too high or dataset contains distribution shift, small-scale tuning may still cause degradation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Large-scale interleaved fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting of audio-labeling capabilities.
- Mechanism: With 1M samples, the model overfits to the interleaved prompt distribution and reduces recall sharply, losing original audio-labeling representations.
- Core assumption: The fine-tuning dataset does not adequately cover audio-labeling tasks, causing distribution mismatch.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "large-scale fine-tuning leads to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting of audio labeling capabilities"
  - [section 4] "Fine-tuning with the large dataset (FT-Large) resulted in a sharp decline in recall... identity accuracy fell to 28.75%"
- Break condition: If the fine-tuning dataset includes balanced identity/labeling tasks alongside interleaved reasoning prompts, forgetting may be mitigated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Attention mechanism in transformers**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core hypothesis depends on understanding how self-attention allows tokens to attend to other tokens based on position, and how interleaving changes which tokens audio embeddings can attend to.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why prepended audio tokens have limited interaction with subsequent text tokens in a causal attention mask?

- Concept: **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - Why needed here: All fine-tuning experiments use LoRA with specific hyperparameters (r=8, α=16). Understanding parameter-efficient fine-tuning is essential to interpret why small-scale tuning works while avoiding full-weight overwrite.
  - Quick check question: What does LoRA's rank parameter control, and why might a low rank preserve more of the original model's capabilities?

- Concept: **Catastrophic forgetting**
  - Why needed here: The large-scale fine-tuning experiment explicitly demonstrates forgetting of audio-labeling abilities. Understanding this phenomenon helps diagnose when model degradation is due to distribution shift versus architectural limitations.
  - Quick check question: If you observe that fine-tuned model recall drops while precision increases, what does this suggest about the model's decision threshold and potential forgetting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Audio encoder (CAV-MAE) -> 32 embeddings (768-dim each)
  - Projection layer -> Maps to 4096-dim LLM hidden space
  - LLM backbone (LLaMa) -> Autoregressive transformer
  - LoRA adapters -> Applied during fine-tuning only

- Critical path:
  1. Raw audio → CAV-MAE encoder → 32 × 768 embeddings
  2. Embeddings → Linear projection → 32 × 4096 tokens
  3. Text → LLaMa tokenizer → token IDs → embedding layer
  4. Audio tokens inserted at [AUDIO] placeholder position → interleaved sequence
  5. Sequence → LLaMa with LoRA → autoregressive text output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interleaved vs. prepended: Interleaving improves semantic reasoning (F1 +17.73% on synonyms for FT-Small) but degrades identity accuracy (-9.12%)
  - Fine-tuning scale: 40K samples balances reasoning and labeling; 1M samples causes overfitting (synonym recall drops from 44.40% to 6.31%)
  - Explicit modality cues: The paper deliberately removes phrases like "in this audio clip" to force deeper integration

- Failure signatures:
  - High precision, very low recall → likely overfitting to interleaved distribution (FT-Large pattern)
  - Degraded identity accuracy across all interleaved conditions → fundamental tradeoff between reasoning depth and labeling breadth
  - Synonym task more affected than hypernym → fine-grained distinctions lost before hierarchical ones

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation on audio token position**: Test [AUDIO] at beginning, middle, and end of prompt to isolate position effects on reasoning vs. labeling performance.
  2. **Mixed-task fine-tuning**: Create a balanced dataset combining interleaved reasoning prompts with standard labeling prompts to test if catastrophic forgetting can be prevented at larger scales.
  3. **LoRA rank sweep**: Test r ∈ {4, 8, 16, 32} on the 40K dataset to find the minimum rank that preserves reasoning gains while maximizing identity retention.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would incorporating diverse interleaved data during the pre-training phase, rather than fine-tuning, prevent the decline in audio labeling capabilities while preserving semantic reasoning gains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that "incorporating diverse interleaved data earlier in the pre-training phase would facilitate more robust and generalizable audio-reasoning MLLMs."
- Why unresolved: The current study only applies interleaved instruction tuning during the fine-tuning phase or via zero-shot prompting, where the trade-off between reasoning and labeling was observed.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment training a model from scratch or continuing pre-training with interleaved data, evaluated on both the SHARD benchmark and the Identity (labeling) task.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific regularization techniques or data balancing strategies can mitigate the catastrophic forgetting observed when scaling interleaved fine-tuning to large datasets (1M samples)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion notes that "naively scaling the fine-tuning data (FT-Large) resulted in a significant performance collapse" and suggests the decline in labeling accuracy contributes to reasoning errors.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the failure mode (overfitting and forgetting) in the large-scale condition but does not test interventions to correct it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using methods like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) or replay buffers during large-scale fine-tuning to see if identity accuracy is maintained.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the removal of explicit modality cues (e.g., "in this audio clip") influence the trade-off between leveraging LLM reasoning and retaining audio-specific knowledge?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The methodology states that explicit modality cues were omitted to force the model to process audio embeddings akin to text tokens, but results showed a consistent drop in audio labeling (Identity) performance across interleaved conditions.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the drop in labeling accuracy is an inherent property of interleaving or a side effect of the specific "modality-agnostic" prompt styling used.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing the current prompt style against interleaved prompts that explicitly reference the audio modality, measuring the impact on the Identity task.

## Limitations

- The study's findings may not generalize to other MLLM architectures beyond the specific LTU model used.
- The SHARD benchmark covers only 78 words from AudioSet, which may not represent the full diversity of audio semantic reasoning tasks.
- The sampling method for the 40K fine-tuning dataset is unspecified, making it difficult to assess reproducibility.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The zero-shot interleaved prompting improvement on semantic reasoning tasks is well-supported by direct experimental comparisons (F1 increases of 17.73% for synonyms and 18.15% for hypernyms). The catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in large-scale fine-tuning is clearly demonstrated through the sharp decline in identity accuracy from 48.45% to 28.75%.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that small-scale fine-tuning optimally balances reasoning and labeling performance assumes the 40K dataset is representative and that LoRA hyperparameters (r=8, α=16) are optimal.
- **Low confidence**: The paper does not provide sufficient analysis of why large-scale fine-tuning causes overfitting specifically to interleaved patterns rather than improving reasoning capabilities further.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-model validation**: Test the interleaved prompting approach on a different audio MLLM architecture (e.g., Qwen-Audio or AudioPaLM) to determine if the semantic reasoning improvements generalize beyond the LTU model.

2. **Dataset balancing experiment**: Create a 40K fine-tuning dataset that explicitly includes equal proportions of interleaved reasoning prompts and standard audio labeling prompts to test whether catastrophic forgetting can be prevented while maintaining semantic reasoning gains.

3. **Attention visualization analysis**: Generate attention heatmaps comparing non-interleaved vs. interleaved prompting conditions to directly visualize whether audio tokens gain more cross-modal attention connections in the interleaved format, providing empirical support for Mechanism 1.
