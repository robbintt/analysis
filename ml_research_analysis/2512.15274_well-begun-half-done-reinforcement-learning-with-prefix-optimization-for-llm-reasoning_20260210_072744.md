# Well Begun, Half Done: Reinforcement Learning with Prefix Optimization for LLM Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15274
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15274
- Reference count: 8
- Proposed method achieves up to 18.02% accuracy improvement by optimizing only 26.17% of training tokens

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for LLM reasoning: the inefficient uniform training across all tokens without considering their varying contributions. The authors observe that prefix tokens (initial portions of output sequences) disproportionately influence reasoning trajectories through what they term the Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). To exploit this insight, they propose Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which focuses training on prefix tokens while using multiple continuations to obtain more reliable reward signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant accuracy improvements on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks while reducing the fraction of tokens being optimized.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which optimizes only the prefix tokens of reasoning sequences rather than all generated tokens. The method employs two key strategies: Progressive Prefix Retention gradually increases the fraction of retained prefix tokens during training, and Continuation Accumulated Reward samples multiple continuations for each prefix sequence to accumulate their scores as a more reliable reward signal. This approach is inspired by the human thinking theory of Path Dependence, recognizing that early tokens have disproportionate influence on shaping subsequent reasoning trajectories. The method claims to achieve superior performance while optimizing only 26.17% of training tokens compared to uniform training approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 18.02% accuracy improvement over baseline RLVR methods
- Optimizes only 26.17% of training tokens while maintaining superior performance
- Demonstrates effectiveness on GSM8K and MATH reasoning benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE) posits that prefix tokens have disproportionate influence on shaping subsequent reasoning trajectories. Early tokens in a reasoning sequence establish the foundation and direction for the entire solution path, making their optimization more critical than later tokens. By focusing on these influential prefix tokens, the method achieves more efficient optimization of the reasoning process. The Progressive Prefix Retention strategy ensures that as training progresses, more tokens are gradually included in the optimization process, allowing the model to refine its reasoning capabilities systematically. The Continuation Accumulated Reward mechanism addresses the instability of single-step rewards by sampling multiple continuations for each prefix, providing a more robust signal for learning.

## Foundational Learning

**Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**: Why needed - Provides the foundation for training LLMs on reasoning tasks where ground truth answers can be verified. Quick check - Verify understanding of reward shaping and policy gradient methods in the context of language model training.

**Path Dependence Theory**: Why needed - Provides theoretical justification for why early decisions have disproportionate influence on outcomes. Quick check - Confirm understanding of how initial conditions constrain future possibilities in sequential decision-making processes.

**Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE)**: Why needed - Explains why prefix tokens should be prioritized in optimization. Quick check - Validate the intuition that early reasoning steps significantly constrain later reasoning choices through empirical analysis.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Prompt -> LLM Reasoning Generator -> Prefix Token Selector -> Continuation Sampler -> Reward Accumulator -> Policy Optimizer -> Updated Model

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are the Prefix Token Selector and Continuation Sampler, as they determine which tokens are optimized and how rewards are estimated. The Progressive Prefix Retention schedule must be carefully designed to balance early focus with comprehensive optimization.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational efficiency (optimizing fewer tokens) for potentially missing important information in non-prefix tokens. The multiple continuation sampling increases computational overhead but provides more reliable rewards. The progressive retention schedule must balance early optimization focus with eventual comprehensive coverage.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include: over-optimization of prefixes leading to rigid reasoning patterns, insufficient exploration of alternative reasoning paths due to premature commitment to early decisions, and computational inefficiency from excessive continuation sampling. The method may also struggle with tasks where the most important reasoning steps occur later in the sequence.

**First Experiments**: 1) Validate BLE by measuring correlation between prefix token quality and final answer accuracy across different reasoning tasks. 2) Compare PPPO against uniform token optimization on a small-scale benchmark to confirm efficiency gains. 3) Test sensitivity of performance to continuation sampling rate and progressive retention schedule parameters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
The paper's evaluation is limited to GSM8K and MATH datasets, raising questions about generalization to other reasoning domains. The computational overhead of multiple continuation sampling is not fully addressed in terms of training cost versus performance benefits. The Beginning Lock-in Effect's applicability across different reasoning task types and difficulty levels remains unverified through comprehensive analysis.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The observation that current RLVR methods train uniformly across all tokens without considering their relative importance is well-established in the literature and clearly demonstrated through empirical analysis.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific formulation of Progressive Prefix Retention and its implementation details appear sound, with reasonable theoretical grounding in path dependence concepts. However, the optimal progression schedule and retention ratios warrant further investigation.

**Low Confidence**: The claim of 18.02% accuracy improvement over baseline methods requires more rigorous validation across diverse datasets and problem types. The generalization of Beginning Lock-in Effect across different reasoning domains remains speculative without broader empirical support.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-dataset validation on at least three additional reasoning benchmarks (e.g., coding tasks, logical reasoning problems, and multilingual mathematical reasoning) to test the generalization of PPPO's performance improvements.

2. Perform ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of Continuation Accumulated Reward by comparing against simpler prefix-based reward estimation methods, measuring both performance impact and computational overhead.

3. Analyze the distribution of Beginning Lock-in Effect across different reasoning problem types and difficulty levels, identifying specific conditions where prefix optimization may be less effective or potentially harmful to reasoning quality.
