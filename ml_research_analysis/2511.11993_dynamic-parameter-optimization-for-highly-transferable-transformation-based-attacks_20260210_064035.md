# Dynamic Parameter Optimization for Highly Transferable Transformation-Based Attacks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11993
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11993
- Authors: Jiaming Liang; Chi-Man Pun
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Introduces DPO to optimize transformation-based attack parameters, improving transferability by up to 13.9% in targeted settings and 3.2% in untargeted settings.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of insufficient parameter optimization in transformation-based adversarial attacks, which limits their transferability. The authors identify three key issues: (1) attacks are typically evaluated under low-iteration settings, but performance differs significantly at higher iterations; (2) existing attacks use uniform parameters across different models, iterations, and tasks; and (3) traditional grid search for parameter optimization has high computational complexity. To address these limitations, the authors propose a Dynamic Parameter Optimization (DPO) method based on the observation that transferability follows a rise-then-fall pattern with respect to transformation magnitude. They introduce the Concentric Decay Model (CDM) to explain the distribution of plausible models around the surrogate and how transformation parameters affect transferability. DPO reduces optimization complexity from O(mn) to O(nlog²m) using a bisection-based approach. Experiments on multiple transformation-based attacks (Admix, SSIM, STM, BSR) demonstrate that re-optimized parameters significantly improve transferability, with average gains of up to 13.9% in targeted settings and 3.2% in untargetized settings, including substantial improvements against adversarially trained models.

## Method Summary
The authors propose Dynamic Parameter Optimization (DPO) to address the challenge of optimizing transformation parameters in adversarial attacks. DPO leverages the observation that transferability follows a rise-then-fall pattern with transformation magnitude, which they explain using the Concentric Decay Model (CDM). CDM posits that plausible models are concentrically distributed around the surrogate in KL-divergence space, with density decreasing outward. This enables bisection-based search, reducing optimization complexity from O(mn) to O(nlog²m). The method is applied to four transformation-based attacks (Admix, SSIM, STM, BSR) across different surrogate models, iteration counts, and tasks. Parameters are optimized per surrogate/iteration/task combination using a validation set, then evaluated on held-out test models and adversarially trained models.

## Key Results
- DPO optimized parameters significantly improve transferability across multiple attacks (Admix, SSIM, STM, BSR)
- Average ASR improvements of up to 13.9% in targeted settings and 3.2% in untargeted settings
- Substantial improvements against adversarially trained models
- Optimal transformation magnitudes grow with iterations and vary across surrogates and tasks
- DPO reduces parameter optimization complexity from O(mn) to O(nlog²m)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transferability follows a rise-then-fall pattern with transformation magnitude because plausible models are concentrically distributed around the surrogate with density decreasing outward in KL-divergence space.
- Mechanism: Small transformation magnitudes correspond to smaller KL surfaces that exclude many plausible models (under-coverage), leaving transferability unrealized. Excessive magnitudes cover too many implausible models, introducing perturbation noise that attenuates transferability (over-coverage). An intermediate magnitude optimally balances plausible model coverage against implausible model noise.
- Core assumption: Plausible models are distributed concentrically around the surrogate in KL-divergence space, with density monotonically decreasing with distance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We further propose a novel Concentric Decay Model (CDM) to effectively explain these patterns."
  - [section 3.3]: "When the combination of transformations and the surrogate emulates plausible models, it facilitates transferability. In contrast, if it emulates implausible models, the resulting perturbations act as noise that does not aid transferability."
  - [corpus]: Corpus evidence is weak for CDM specifically; related papers focus on transformation types rather than parameter dynamics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Optimal transformation magnitudes grow with iterations because adversarial perturbations progressively better approximate the average vulnerability within the KL surface as iterations increase.
- Mechanism: At low iterations, perturbations underfit the average vulnerability—large transformation magnitudes disperse fitting capacity across too many models, diluting effectiveness. Higher iterations allow perturbations to exploit the full KL surface, warranting larger magnitudes to cover more plausible models without the noise penalty.
- Core assumption: Iteration count directly determines fitting capacity for vulnerabilities, and this relationship is monotonic.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "Generally, optimal transformation magnitudes grow with iterations and vary across surrogates."
  - [section 3.3]: "With increasing iterations, the adversarial perturbations progressively better approximate the average vulnerability, as illustrated in Figure 3(c)."
  - [corpus]: Related papers do not address iteration-dependent parameter scaling.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The rise-then-fall pattern enables bisection-based search, reducing parameter optimization complexity from O(m^n) to O(n·log²m).
- Mechanism: Since transferability monotonically rises then falls with each parameter, bisection locates the peak by comparing midpoints and narrowing the search interval. This eliminates exhaustive grid search while maintaining comparable precision.
- Core assumption: The rise-then-fall pattern is consistent and unimodal for each parameter independently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Building on these insights, we propose an efficient Dynamic Parameter Optimization (DPO) based on the rise-then-fall pattern, reducing the complexity to O(n·log²m)."
  - [section 3.4]: "The rise-then-fall pattern in Pattern (iii) suggests that a bisection-based strategy can accelerate this process."
  - [corpus]: Corpus papers do not propose efficient optimization methods for transformation parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Transformation-based adversarial attacks**
  - Why needed here: This is the core paradigm being optimized. Without understanding how input transformations (translation, rotation, resizing, noise, block shuffle) generate diverse perturbation copies averaged to prevent surrogate overfitting, the motivation for parameter optimization is unclear.
  - Quick check question: How does averaging gradient copies from multiple random transformations improve transferability compared to using a single perturbation direction?

- Concept: **Model Augmentation Theory**
  - Why needed here: CDM extends this established theory. Understanding that composing transformations with the surrogate emulates diverse models (rather than just the surrogate) is essential to grasp why parameter magnitude affects which "models" are covered.
  - Quick check question: Why does a perturbation that overfits the surrogate model transfer poorly to unseen target models?

- Concept: **Bisection search for unimodal optimization**
  - Why needed here: DPO relies on bisection for efficient parameter search. Recognizing when bisection converges versus when it fails is critical for implementation and debugging.
  - Quick check question: What property must a function satisfy for bisection to reliably find its maximum, and how does the rise-then-fall pattern satisfy this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Empirical Analysis Module -> CDM Theoretical Framework -> DPO Optimization Engine -> Validation/Test Pipeline

- **Critical path:**
  1. Select attack baseline (Admix, SSIM, STM, or BSR) and define parameter search range with step intervals.
  2. For each parameter independently, initialize low/high bounds and run bisection: generate adversarial examples at midpoint, evaluate ASR on validation models, narrow interval toward higher ASR.
  3. Repeat bisection until convergence (⌈log₂m⌉ iterations per parameter).
  4. Optionally refine with a few grid search steps to handle fluctuations.
  5. Evaluate optimized parameters on held-out test models and adversarially trained models.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - *Per-parameter vs. joint optimization*: Current DPO optimizes parameters sequentially (O(n·log²m)) but may miss interaction effects; joint optimization captures interactions but reverts to O(m^n) complexity.
  - *Validation model selection*: Using 8 specific models risks overfitting to those architectures—diversity in architecture family (CNNs vs. ViTs vs. hybrid) is critical.
  - *Iteration-specific optimization*: Optimizing per-iteration captures dynamics better but requires separate searches; sharing parameters across iterations reduces cost but sacrifices optimality.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - *Optimized parameters underperform official defaults*: Validation models likely don't represent test distribution, or rise-then-fall pattern is violated for that transformation.
  - *Bisection oscillates without converging*: Transferability curve is non-unimodal; fall back to grid search for that parameter.
  - *Large gap between validation and test ASR*: Overfitting to validation set—increase validation model diversity or use cross-validation.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce the rise-then-fall pattern**: Using Noise Addition with R50 surrogate at Epoch 500, sweep z ∈ [0.02, 0.50] and plot ASR vs. z to verify unimodality and identify approximate peak visually.
  2. **Implement single-parameter bisection DPO**: For Admix η on R50 at Epoch 100, run Algorithm 1 with bounds [0.10, 0.50]; compare final ASR and number of search steps against exhaustive grid search.
  3. **Test cross-surrogate generalization**: Optimize BSR parameters on R50 surrogate, then evaluate transferability when ViT-S/16 is used as surrogate (and vice versa) to confirm surrogate-specific optimization is necessary.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do transferability dynamics and optimal parameters evolve at iterations significantly beyond 500?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "However, our investigation is capped at 500 iterations. The dynamics at higher iterations remain an intriguing topic for future study."
- Why unresolved: The empirical study and optimization experiments were limited to at most 500 iterations; whether patterns (rise-then-fall, optimal magnitude growth) persist, shift, or break at extended iterations is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extend empirical analysis and DPO to larger iteration counts (e.g., 1000–5000) on standard benchmarks; report whether optimal parameters continue to scale and whether the rise-then-fall pattern holds.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the Concentric Decay Model accurately predict optimal parameter trajectories across diverse surrogate-target pairs and transformation types?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The CDM is proposed as an explanatory framework connecting KL divergence surfaces to plausible models and dynamic parameters, but validation is primarily qualitative/correlational rather than predictive.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that KL divergence correlates with observed patterns, but does not provide systematic, quantitative validation that CDM-predicted optimal KL boundaries match empirically optimal parameters across varied settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formalize CDM predictions (e.g., expected optimal KL boundary as a function of iteration and surrogate), then compare predicted vs. empirically optimal parameters across multiple surrogates, targets, and transformations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is DPO's optimized parameter choice to the composition of the validation model set?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Optimization uses a fixed validation set of 8 models to select parameters; whether different validation sets (e.g., only CNNs, only ViTs, or out-of-distribution architectures) yield substantially different optimal parameters is not analyzed.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not ablate or analyze variance in optimized parameters when validation models change, leaving open whether DPO overfits to the chosen validation set.
- What evidence would resolve it: Run ablations optimizing parameters on diverse validation subsets and measure variance in selected parameters and final test-model transferability; report sensitivity metrics.

## Limitations

- The Concentric Decay Model assumes plausible models are concentrically distributed in KL-divergence space with monotonically decreasing density, but this assumption is not directly validated in the paper.
- The paper does not report confidence intervals or statistical significance tests for the ASR improvements, making it difficult to assess whether observed gains are robust across different random seeds or dataset splits.
- Optimization is performed per surrogate/iteration/task combination, which increases computational cost and may not generalize well across different settings without re-optimization.

## Confidence

- **High**: The empirical observation that transferability varies with transformation parameters and that parameter optimization improves ASR across multiple attacks (Admix, SSIM, STM, BSR) is well-supported by extensive experiments across different models and settings.
- **Medium**: The rise-then-fall pattern explanation and the bisection-based optimization method are logically sound given the unimodal assumption, but the assumption itself needs empirical validation.
- **Low**: The CDM theoretical framework, while providing a compelling explanation, is not directly validated and relies on untested assumptions about the distribution of plausible models in KL space.

## Next Checks

1. **Validate the CDM assumption**: Generate transformed outputs for multiple parameter values, compute pairwise KL-divergences to the surrogate, and test whether plausible models cluster concentrically with monotonically decreasing density as distance increases.

2. **Test bisection convergence conditions**: Systematically vary the smoothness and number of local maxima in the transferability curve for each transformation parameter, and measure bisection search success rate versus exhaustive grid search.

3. **Cross-surrogate parameter generalization**: Optimize parameters on one surrogate (e.g., R50) and evaluate on a different surrogate (e.g., ViT-S/16) without re-optimization to quantify the cost of surrogate-specific optimization versus potential gains.
