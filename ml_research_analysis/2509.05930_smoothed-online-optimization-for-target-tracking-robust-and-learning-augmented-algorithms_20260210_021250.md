# Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking: Robust and Learning-Augmented Algorithms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05930
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05930
- Reference count: 40
- The paper introduces SOOTT framework combining tracking, adversarial robustness, and switching cost minimization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT), a novel framework that addresses the challenge of tracking dynamically moving targets while maintaining robustness against adversarial perturbations and minimizing switching costs. The framework is particularly relevant for practical scenarios like workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must balance long-term service-level agreements against sudden demand spikes. The authors propose two algorithms: BEST, a robust online algorithm with provable competitive guarantees, and CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that leverages untrusted black-box predictions while maintaining robustness against prediction errors.

## Method Summary
The authors develop two main algorithms for the SOOTT problem. BEST is a robust online algorithm that achieves bounded degradation relative to a semi-online benchmark algorithm IGA. The algorithm uses a two-level contraction mechanism to handle both tracking and switching costs while maintaining adversarial robustness. CoRT extends BEST by incorporating untrusted ML predictions, introducing a tunable parameter θ that controls the trade-off between consistency (performance when predictions are accurate) and robustness (performance when predictions are wrong). The theoretical analysis employs a sliding-window Cauchy-Schwarz lemma to achieve tight competitive bounds. Both algorithms are evaluated on real-world Google Cloud traces for workload scheduling scenarios.

## Key Results
- BEST achieves bounded competitive ratio relative to semi-online benchmark IGA while handling adversarial perturbations
- CoRT strictly improves upon BEST when predictions are accurate, maintaining robustness against arbitrary prediction errors
- The algorithms demonstrate effective balancing of trajectory tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances in workload scheduling case study
- CoRT's performance closely approaches that of IGA while maintaining robustness against inaccurate predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by combining online optimization techniques with adversarial robustness mechanisms. BEST uses a two-level contraction approach that first contracts the solution space to reduce switching costs, then applies further contraction to maintain tracking accuracy. CoRT builds on this by incorporating prediction-based adjustments that can be scaled by parameter θ to balance between exploiting accurate predictions and maintaining robustness against errors. The sliding-window Cauchy-Schwarz lemma enables tight analysis of the cumulative cost bounds across time windows.

## Foundational Learning
- Smoothed Online Optimization: Online algorithms with switching costs; needed to model real-world scenarios where frequent changes incur penalties
- Adversarial Robustness in Online Algorithms: Algorithms that perform well despite worst-case input sequences; needed to handle unpredictable demand spikes
- Learning-Augmented Algorithms: Integration of ML predictions with theoretical guarantees; needed to leverage available but untrusted predictive models
- Competitive Analysis: Comparing online algorithms to optimal offline benchmarks; needed to quantify algorithm performance
- Two-Level Contraction Mechanism: Hierarchical space reduction technique; needed to simultaneously optimize for tracking and smoothness
- Sliding-Window Analysis: Time-windowed cost accumulation analysis; needed to handle non-additive cost functions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input stream → BEST/CoRT processing → Cost calculation (tracking + switching + adversarial) → Output decisions

**Critical Path:** Decision making → Cost evaluation → Perturbation handling → Next decision update

**Design Tradeoffs:** CoRT balances consistency vs. robustness through parameter θ; higher θ improves consistency but reduces robustness

**Failure Signatures:** Poor tracking performance indicates excessive switching costs; high costs despite accurate predictions suggest insufficient exploitation of ML inputs

**First 3 Experiments:** 1) Run BEST on synthetic trajectories with varying perturbation intensities, 2) Test CoRT with deliberately inaccurate predictions across different θ values, 3) Compare algorithm performance on real-world Google Cloud traces under different workload patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Competitive ratio analysis assumes specific cost function structures that may not generalize to all practical scenarios
- Empirical validation relies on a single case study using Google Cloud traces, limiting generalizability across different domains
- Novel technical tools (contraction mechanism, Cauchy-Schwarz lemma) lack independent verification for broader applicability

## Confidence

**Theoretical guarantees for BEST:** High
**CoRT algorithm design and trade-off analysis:** Medium  
**Empirical validation on Google Cloud traces:** Medium
**Novel technical tools (contraction mechanism, Cauchy-Schwarz lemma):** Low (due to limited independent verification)

## Next Checks

1. Test BEST and CoRT on synthetic datasets with varying perturbation patterns to assess robustness beyond the Google Cloud traces
2. Implement ablation studies on the two-level contraction mechanism to isolate its contribution to competitive ratio improvements
3. Conduct stress tests on CoRT with deliberately inaccurate ML predictions to quantify the practical limits of the consistency-robustness trade-off
