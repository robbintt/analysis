# Identifiability in Causal Abstractions: A Hierarchy of Criteria

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06213
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06213
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Introduces a hierarchy of identifiability criteria for causal abstractions formalized as collections of causal diagrams.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a structured framework for understanding identifiability of causal queries within causal abstractions, which are formalized as collections of causal diagrams. The key contribution is establishing a hierarchy of identifiability notions ranging from common graphical criteria to identifiability through graphs, with proven logical relationships between them. A critical result shows that verifying identifiability reduces to checking only maximal graphs under subgraph inclusion, dramatically simplifying the problem. The work also identifies a major open conjecture about whether identifiability through graphs always implies identifiability by common do-calculus.

## Method Summary
The paper formalizes causal abstractions as collections of acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) with directed and bidirected edges. Identifiability is defined across several increasingly stringent criteria: identifiability by common graphical criteria (ICGC), identifiability by common do-calculus (ICD), and identifiability through graphs (IG). The theoretical approach leverages do-calculus rules (R1-R3) and graphical criteria like the backdoor criterion. A key computational insight is that only maximal graphs under subgraph inclusion need to be checked for identifiability, as subgraph relationships preserve graphical independence conditions.

## Key Results
- A hierarchy of identifiability notions is established: ICGC → ICD → IG, with ICGC equivalent to ICD
- Verifying identifiability reduces to checking only maximal graphs under subgraph inclusion
- For any collection of causal diagrams, it suffices to consider only the maximal elements for identifiability checks
- An open conjecture remains about whether IG always implies ICD, representing a fundamental question in causal inference theory

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Graph Inclusion Reduces Identifiability to Maximal Elements
- Claim: Verifying identifiability in a collection of graphs reduces to checking only the maximal graphs under subgraph inclusion.
- Mechanism: Subgraph relationships preserve graphical independence conditions. Since removing edges preserves independencies (Lemma 1), any valid estimand, do-calculus proof, or graphical criterion that holds in a maximal graph also holds in all its subgraphs. Therefore, if the query is identifiable in all maximal elements, it is identifiable in the entire collection.
- Core assumption: The collection C is partially ordered by subgraph inclusion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "verifying identifiability reduces to checking only maximal graphs under subgraph inclusion, dramatically simplifying the problem."
  - [section] Theorem 2: "P(y | do(x), z) is identifiable in C" iff "identifiable in Cmax."
  - [corpus] "On the Granularity of Causal Effect Identifiability" touches on identifiability granularity, implicitly supporting the need for structured reduction in complexity.
- Break condition: If a causal abstraction is not defined as a collection of graphs or lacks a clear partial order (e.g., a set of unrelated graphs with no subgraph relationships), the reduction fails. Also, if edge removal is not semantically valid in the underlying causal model (violating the monotonicity of independence), the property breaks.

### Mechanism 2: The Strict Hierarchy of Identifiability Notions
- Claim: A causal query can be tested against a hierarchy of increasingly stringent and powerful identifiability notions: from common graphical criteria (ICGC) to common do-calculus (ICD) to full identifiability through graphs (IG).
- Mechanism: The hierarchy is established by proof implication. ICGC implies ICD because any graphical criterion (like the backdoor criterion) can be derived via do-calculus rules. ICD implies IG because a single common do-calculus proof produces a valid estimand for all compatible SCMs, satisfying the definition of IG.
- Core assumption: The causal query and collection of graphs are well-defined. Do-calculus is sound and complete for single causal diagrams (referenced in the paper).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "common graphical criteria imply identifiability by common do-calculus, which in turn implies full identifiability, but not vice versa."
  - [section] Theorem 3 details the full chain of implications.
  - [corpus] The corpus does not strongly support or refute this specific hierarchy; most related papers focus on specific criteria (e.g., backdoor) in specific contexts like time series, without proposing a general hierarchy.
- Break condition: The hierarchy is one-way. Finding a query that is IG but not ICD would create a separation, invalidating the converse implication. This is the subject of the paper's central conjecture.

### Mechanism 3: The IG vs. ICD Conjecture as an Open Research Frontier
- Claim: It is currently unknown whether the notions of Identifiability through Graphs (IG) and Identifiability by Common Do-Calculus (ICD) are equivalent or distinct, posing a major open problem.
- Mechanism: IG requires only that a single valid estimand exist for all graphs (potentially using different proofs), while ICD requires a single, universal do-calculus proof for all graphs. The conjecture posits that there exists a case where valid proofs for individual graphs cannot be unified, creating a separation.
- Core assumption: A potential counterexample would require two graphs, G1 and G2, two valid do-calculus proofs (P1, P2) yielding the same formula, but no single proof valid for both.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The paper also identifies a major open conjecture: whether full identifiability always implies identifiability by common do-calculus."
  - [section] Section 6 is entirely dedicated to stating, and outlining how to prove or disprove, this conjecture.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers address this conjecture directly, confirming its status as an open, unsolved problem.
- Break condition: If a uniform algorithmic procedure is discovered that can always transform an IG result into a common ICD proof, the conjecture would be disproven, and IG and ICD would collapse into a single notion.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Causal Abstractions as Graph Collections**
  - Why needed here: This is the paper's core representation. Understanding that an abstraction is not a single simplified graph but a set of compatible full graphs (e.g., a Markov Equivalence Class) is prerequisite to reasoning about identifiability within it.
  - Quick check question: How would you represent the causal abstraction "X causes Y, but the direction between A and B is unknown" as a collection of causal diagrams?

- Concept: **Do-Calculus Rules (R1-R3) and Proofs**
  - Why needed here: The hierarchy's core hinges on what constitutes a "common do-calculus proof." One must understand the three rules (insertion/deletion of observations, action/observation exchange, insertion/deletion of actions) and what it means for a proof to "hold" in a graph.
  - Quick check question: For a common do-calculus proof to hold across a collection of graphs, what condition must the d-separation requirements satisfy?

- Concept: **Maximal Elements under Subgraph Inclusion**
  - Why needed here: Theorem 2 provides the critical simplification. Understanding which graphs in a set are maximal (i.e., not subgraphs of any other member) is essential for making identifiability checking tractable.
  - Quick check question: In a collection of all graphs with edges {A→B} and {A→B, B→C}, which graph(s) must be checked for identifiability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Collection of Causal Diagrams (C): The input abstraction, representing partial causal knowledge.
  2. Maximal Graph Filter: A preprocessing component that reduces C to its subset of maximal elements (Cmax) based on subgraph inclusion.
  3. Identifiability Verifier: A logical engine that takes a causal query and Cmax, then attempts to establish identifiability using a cascade of criteria (IG, ICD, ICGC).
  4. Identification Formula Generator: If identifiability is established, this component outputs the do-free estimand.

- Critical path:
  1. Input a causal abstraction (a set of graphs C) and a query P(y|do(x), z).
  2. Compute Cmax, the subset of maximal graphs in C (Theorem 2).
  3. Check for the simplest criterion first: Attempt to find a common graphical criterion (e.g., backdoor/frontdoor) valid for all G in Cmax. This establishes ICGC, which implies ICD and IG.
  4. If ICGC fails, attempt Identifiability by Common Do-Calculus (ICD): Search for a single sequence of do-calculus rules whose d-separation conditions hold in all G in Cmax.
  5. If ICD fails, attempt Identifiability through Graphs (IG): For each G in Cmax, find a valid estimand (potentially using different proofs for different graphs). If all resulting estimands are identical, IG is established. (Note: This is the most computationally expensive step, and its relationship to ICD is the subject of the open conjecture).
  6. Return the identification formula if successful, or "not identifiable" otherwise.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Strength vs. Tractability:** Checking ICGC (e.g., backdoor) is fast but may fail even when identification is possible. Checking IG is the most comprehensive but computationally prohibitive for large C. The paper's Theorem 2 improves tractability for all graphical notions by focusing on Cmax.
  - **Assumption vs. Generality:** Restricting to "common do-calculus" proofs (ICD) is a stronger assumption than allowing different proofs per graph (IG), but it may yield simpler, more uniform estimands.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Empty Maximal Set:** If C is empty or ill-defined, Cmax cannot be computed.
  - **Divergent Estimands:** During IG checking, if different graphs in Cmax yield different valid estimands for the same query, the query is not identifiable in the collection.
  - **Infinite C

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does Identifiability through Graphs (IG) always imply Identifiability by Common Do-Calculus (ICD), or does there exist a collection of diagrams where a query is IG but not ICD?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6 is dedicated to the "IG vs ICD Conjecture," stating, "it is not known whether there exists a family of causal diagrams C... such that Q is IG in C but is not ICD in C."
- **Why unresolved:** While the implication ICD $\Rightarrow$ IG is proven (Theorem 3), the reverse implication remains unproven. The authors conjecture a separation exists but have not found a concrete counterexample.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Constructing a specific class of diagrams and a query that yields identical estimands for all graphs (IG) but admits no single do-calculus proof valid across the class (no ICD), or a formal proof that IG always implies ICD.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What is the computational complexity of verifying the various identifiability notions (e.g., IG, ICD) defined in the hierarchy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states that it is "essential to rigorously classify the algorithmic complexity associated with each identifiability notion."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper focuses on defining the hierarchy and logical implications, but it does not provide an analysis of the computational resources required to check these criteria in practice.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical analysis classifying the verification problems (e.g., as NP-hard, PSPACE-complete, or polynomial time) for the different levels of the hierarchy.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can efficient algorithms be developed to verify identifiability criteria in abstractions where the collection of maximal graphs is large?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion calls for the need to "develop efficient procedures for verifying them," noting that identifying effects is easiest when maximal elements are few (Theorem 2).
- **Why unresolved:** While Theorem 2 reduces the problem to checking only maximal graphs, the paper notes that for general collections, the set of maximal graphs might still be large, making naive verification infeasible.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Algorithms capable of verifying identifiability without explicitly enumerating all maximal graphs or valid estimands, perhaps leveraging structural properties of specific abstraction types.

## Limitations
- The central IG vs ICD conjecture remains unproven, leaving a gap in the completeness of the hierarchy.
- The paper provides theoretical definitions and implications but lacks algorithmic details for systematically verifying identifiability in large collections of graphs.
- No complexity analysis is provided for the verification procedures of different identifiability notions.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The reduction to maximal graphs (Theorem 2) is logically sound given the monotonicity of independence under edge removal.
- **Medium Confidence:** The one-way hierarchy (ICGC → ICD → IG) is well-supported by existing do-calculus completeness for single graphs.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that ICD is strictly weaker than IG is unproven; the conjecture requires finding a counterexample or a unification algorithm.

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the maximal graph reduction on non-trivial collections to confirm computational savings.
2. Attempt to construct a concrete counterexample separating IG from ICD, focusing on collections where valid individual do-calculus proofs cannot be unified.
3. Develop a systematic search algorithm for ICD proofs in collections, verifying if it always finds a common proof when IG holds.
