# Large Language Model for Extracting Complex Contract Information in Industrial Scenes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06539
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06539
- Authors: Yunyang Cao; Yanjun Li; Silong Dai
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: Novel dataset construction method and LLM fine-tuning for industrial contract information extraction with improved accuracy and robustness

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method for extracting complex contract information in industrial scenarios using large language models. The approach involves constructing a high-quality dataset through cluster analysis of industrial contract texts, leveraging GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for key information extraction and data annotation. The researchers employ data augmentation techniques by generating unstructured contract texts from randomly combined keywords using GPT-3.5 to enhance model robustness. The fine-tuned LLM demonstrates excellent overall performance while maintaining high field recall and precision, with considerations for parsing efficiency.

## Method Summary
The method employs cluster analysis on industrial contract texts to identify patterns and structures. GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are utilized to extract key information from original contract data, generating high-quality data annotations. Data augmentation is achieved through constructing new texts by randomly combining keywords and using GPT-3.5 to generate unstructured contract texts. The large language model is fine-tuned on this augmented dataset using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), data balancing techniques, and the augmented data to improve accuracy and robustness.

## Key Results
- Model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field recall and precision
- LoRA, data balancing, and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness
- Proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract information extraction tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages the advanced capabilities of large language models, particularly GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, for complex information extraction tasks. By using these models for both data annotation and augmentation, the method capitalizes on their ability to understand and generate nuanced contract language. The cluster analysis helps identify common patterns and structures in industrial contracts, allowing for more targeted and efficient extraction. Data augmentation through keyword combination and text generation expands the training dataset, improving the model's ability to handle diverse contract formats and scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Industrial Contract Structure Analysis** - Understanding the typical structure and key components of industrial contracts is crucial for effective information extraction. Quick check: Review sample contracts to identify common sections and information types.

2. **Cluster Analysis for Text Classification** - Grouping similar contract texts helps in organizing the dataset and identifying patterns. Quick check: Visualize clusters to ensure meaningful groupings of contract types.

3. **LLM Fine-tuning with LoRA** - Low-Rank Adaptation allows efficient fine-tuning of large models on specific tasks. Quick check: Compare model performance with and without LoRA fine-tuning.

4. **Data Augmentation Techniques** - Generating synthetic data from existing patterns improves model robustness. Quick check: Analyze augmented data quality by human review of generated samples.

5. **Information Extraction Metrics** - Understanding precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluating extraction performance. Quick check: Calculate metrics on a held-out validation set.

6. **GPT Model Capabilities and Limitations** - Knowledge of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 strengths and weaknesses in contract analysis. Quick check: Benchmark different GPT models on contract tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Cluster Analysis -> GPT-4/GPT-3.5 Annotation -> Data Augmentation -> LoRA Fine-tuning -> Evaluation

Critical Path: Raw Contract Data -> Cluster Analysis -> Information Extraction -> Data Annotation -> Augmentation -> Model Fine-tuning -> Performance Evaluation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Accuracy vs. parsing efficiency: Balancing model complexity with real-time performance needs
- Annotation quality vs. quantity: Trade-off between using GPT models extensively vs. human annotation
- Data augmentation vs. overfitting: Balancing synthetic data generation with model generalization

Failure Signatures:
- Low recall in specific contract fields: Indicates insufficient training data or annotation errors in those areas
- High precision but low recall: Suggests overly strict extraction criteria or data imbalance
- Poor performance on novel contract formats: Reveals limitations in data augmentation diversity

First 3 Experiments:
1. Compare extraction performance using only GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5 for annotation tasks
2. Evaluate the impact of different cluster analysis methods on downstream extraction quality
3. Test various data augmentation ratios to find optimal balance between original and synthetic data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for data annotation introduces potential quality and consistency issues
- Limited methodological detail on cluster analysis and validation criteria affects reproducibility
- Lack of comparison with strong baseline models beyond general performance claims

## Confidence

High confidence in the general feasibility of using LLMs for contract information extraction tasks
Medium confidence in the effectiveness of the proposed dataset construction method due to limited methodological detail
Low confidence in the claimed performance improvements without independent validation or detailed ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a detailed ablation study to isolate the contributions of LoRA fine-tuning, data balancing, and data augmentation to overall performance
2. Implement inter-annotator agreement metrics between GPT-4/GPT-3.5 annotations and human experts to quantify annotation quality and consistency
3. Test the model's generalization capability on an entirely separate industrial contract corpus not used in training or development
