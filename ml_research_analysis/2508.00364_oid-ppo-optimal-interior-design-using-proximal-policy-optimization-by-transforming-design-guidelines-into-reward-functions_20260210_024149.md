# OID-PPO: Optimal Interior Design using Proximal Policy Optimization by Transforming Design Guidelines into Reward Functions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.00364
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00364
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: OID-PPO outperforms optimization-based and deep RL methods in layout quality and computational efficiency across diverse room shapes and furniture counts

## Executive Summary
OID-PPO addresses optimal interior design by integrating expert design guidelines into a structured reward function within a reinforcement learning framework. The method uses a diagonal Gaussian policy to enable continuous furniture placement, capturing both functional and visual criteria such as pairwise alignment, accessibility, visibility, pathway connectivity, visual balance, and alignment. Experiments across diverse room shapes and furniture counts show OID-PPO outperforms optimization-based and other deep RL methods in layout quality and computational efficiency. Ablation studies confirm that each reward component contributes distinctly to the final layout quality, with OID-PPO achieving up to 0.971 reward on square rooms with six furniture items. Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees under partial observability.

## Method Summary
OID-PPO formulates sequential furniture placement as a finite episodic Markov Decision Process with continuous actions for position and discrete rotations. The method employs a diagonal Gaussian policy for stochastic exploration under partial observability, combined with a critic estimating state values. Six normalized reward components encode expert design guidelines covering pairwise relationships, accessibility, visibility, pathway connectivity, visual balance, and alignment. The PPO algorithm with clipped surrogate objectives and GAE advantages trains the actor-critic architecture, which processes furniture descriptors and occupancy maps through shared-weight MLPs and CNNs. Furniture items are placed sequentially in descending order of footprint area to reduce constraint violations.

## Key Results
- OID-PPO achieves lowest P-Loss (0.009-0.061) and V-Loss (0.026-0.124) across all room shapes and furniture counts
- Ablation studies show removing functional rewards causes blocked entrances while removing visual rewards creates cluttered, imbalanced layouts
- OID-PPO achieves up to 0.971 reward on square rooms with six furniture items, outperforming optimization-based and other deep RL methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Diagonal Gaussian policies enable effective exploration under partial observability in continuous furniture placement.
- Mechanism: The stochastic policy maintains nonzero variance (σ_t > 0), sampling actions as a_t = μ_t + σ_t ⊙ z where z ~ N(0,I). This guarantees strictly positive probability of exploring all valid placements, allowing the agent to infer latent environmental dynamics when room geometry and future furniture are not fully observable.
- Core assumption: Partial observability can be compensated through stochastic exploration rather than explicit state estimation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "OID-PPO utilizes a diagonal Gaussian policy for continuous and flexible furniture placement, effectively exploring latent environmental dynamics under partial observability."
  - [Page 4, Proposition 4] "Because the diagonal Gaussian policy maintains nonzero variance, the OID-PPO agent guarantees a strictly positive probability of exploring all valid furniture placements."
  - [corpus] KIPPO (arXiv:2505.14566) supports PPO's effectiveness for high-dimensional continuous control, though not specific to interior design.
- Break condition: If σ_t collapses to near-zero during training, exploration fails and the agent may converge to suboptimal deterministic placements in complex room geometries.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Structured reward functions encoding expert design guidelines directly shape policy behavior toward human-preferred layouts.
- Mechanism: Six normalized reward components (R_pair, R_a, R_v, R_path, R_b, R_al) are aggregated as R_idg ∈ [-1,1]. Each component captures a distinct constraint: pairwise relationships enforce functional cohesion (e.g., desk-chair proximity), accessibility penalizes obstruction, visibility prevents furniture facing walls, pathway connection ensures reachability from doors, visual balance centers mass distribution, and alignment orients furniture to walls.
- Core assumption: Expert guidelines are both necessary and sufficient for high-quality layouts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 3] "Each partial reward function is explicitly designed and normalized to lie within the range [-1, 1]."
  - [Page 6, Ablation] Figure 2 shows removing functional rewards causes blocked entrances; removing visual rewards causes cluttered, imbalanced layouts.
  - [corpus] Related interior design systems (Co-Layout, DecoMind) use different approaches (LLM + integer programming; diffusion models), not providing direct validation of reward-based shaping.
- Break condition: If reward components conflict or have misaligned scales, the agent may optimize one constraint at the expense of others, producing locally valid but globally poor layouts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PPO's clipped surrogate objective with GAE provides stable convergence for sequential furniture placement.
- Mechanism: The clipped objective L_clip(θ) = E[min(r_t(θ)Â_t, clip(r_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε)Â_t)] prevents large policy updates. GAE computes advantage estimates Â_t = Σ(γλ)^l δ_{t+l} with low variance. On-policy gradient updates with Adam optimizer ensure monotonic improvement up to O(ε) bias.
- Core assumption: The finite-horizon MDP (H ≤ |F|) and bounded rewards ([-1,1]) satisfy convergence conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 5, Table 1] OID-PPO achieves lowest P-Loss (0.009-0.061) and V-Loss (0.026-0.124) across all room shapes and furniture counts.
  - [Page 4, Theorem 1] Formal convergence guarantee under stated assumptions with proof in Appendix B.
  - [corpus] KIPPO and A-3PO papers validate PPO variants for stability in other domains, supporting generalization.
- Break condition: If episode horizons grow significantly (e.g., >15 furniture items) or room geometries introduce non-differentiable constraints, convergence guarantees may weaken.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
  - Why needed here: The interior design problem is formulated as a finite episodic MDP M = ⟨S, A, P, R, γ⟩ where states include furniture descriptors and occupancy maps, actions are placement positions and rotations, and rewards encode design guidelines.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the finite-horizon property (H ≤ |F|) matters for convergence proofs?

- **Concept: Actor-Critic Architecture**
  - Why needed here: OID-PPO uses separate networks—an actor outputting Gaussian policy parameters (μ, σ) and a critic estimating V(s)—trained jointly via PPO objectives.
  - Quick check question: What would happen if the critic significantly overestimates value in early training?

- **Concept: Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**
  - Why needed here: GAE (λ=0.95, γ=0.99) balances bias-variance in advantage estimates, enabling stable policy gradient updates across sequential placement steps.
  - Quick check question: If λ=1.0, what property does GAE lose, and how would that affect training stability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - Furniture Encoders: Two shared-weight L-layer MLPs with GELU activation process current (e_t) and next (e_{t+1}) furniture geometric descriptors → ψ_obj(e)
  - Occupancy Encoder: CNN processes binary occupancy map O_t → ψ_O
  - Fusion Layer: Concatenate [ψ_t, ψ_{t+1}, ψ_O] → h_t
  - Actor Head: Linear projections output μ_t and log σ_t for diagonal Gaussian policy; actions sampled as a_t = μ_t + σ_t ⊙ z
  - Critic Head: Linear projection from shared embedding to scalar V(s)
  - PPO Update: Clipped surrogate loss + value loss (c_v) + entropy bonus (c_e) optimized via Adam

- **Critical path**:
  1. Episode initializes with room E and furniture set F (sorted by footprint area descending)
  2. At each step t, encode current furniture, next furniture, and occupancy map
  3. Actor samples placement action (x_t ∈ R^2, k_t ∈ {0,1,2,3})
  4. Validate placement (within bounds, no collision); if invalid → terminal with penalty φ=-10
  5. Compute all six reward components → R_idg
  6. Update occupancy map and proceed to next furniture
  7. After episode, compute GAE advantages and update actor/critic via PPO

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Stochastic vs. deterministic policy: Stochastic (SAC, OID-PPO) outperforms deterministic (DDPG, TD3) under partial observability but incurs ~2-3x higher inference time
  - On-policy (PPO) vs. off-policy (SAC): OID-PPO achieves lower losses and more stable convergence; SAC has higher sample efficiency but noisier updates
  - Descending vs. ascending furniture order: Larger items first reduces constraint violations; ascending order increases losses and inference time (OID-ASC ablation)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Invalid placement termination: Check if actor variance collapsed (σ_t ≈ 0) or if furniture exceeds room bounds
  - Low R_path despite valid placements: A* pathfinding failed; verify door connectivity in occupancy grid
  - High P-Loss with oscillating rewards: Learning rate too high; reduce η_a from 10^-4
  - Layouts cluster in one corner: R_b (visual balance) underweighted or spatial encoding (OID-NIL) removed

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate Table 1 baseline: Train OID-PPO on square room with F_n=4; verify reward >0.95 and P-Loss <0.01 within 1000 epochs
  2. Ablate single reward components: Disable R_pair and confirm desk-chair separation increases; document reward drop magnitude
  3. Test generalization: Train on square/rectangle only; evaluate zero-shot on L-shape and U-shape with F_n=8; measure reward degradation vs. trained performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How can a standardized benchmark be developed to enable fair comparison between automated interior design methods given the current reliance on proprietary datasets and inconsistent reward protocols?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section states, "This highlights the need for a shared benchmark that integrates both functional and visual guideline compliance—providing a common platform for rigorous evaluation."
  - Why unresolved: The authors note that direct comparison is challenging because prior deep learning approaches use proprietary data and earlier RL methods utilize custom environments with inconsistent action spaces.
  - What evidence would resolve it: The establishment and adoption of a common evaluation platform that standardizes functional and visual metrics across diverse room configurations.

- **Open Question 2**: Can the structured reward function be extended to effectively incorporate subjective user aesthetics (e.g., color palettes) and physical constraints like natural or multi-source lighting?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion identifies a key limitation as the "lack of user preference modeling and real-world constraints," specifically noting the framework disregards user aesthetics and factors like natural lighting.
  - Why unresolved: The current framework limits the furniture set to 15 items of a single style and does not model illumination, focusing purely on geometric and functional guidelines.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A modified OID-PPO framework that successfully optimizes for lighting constraints and aligns with user-provided aesthetic preferences without sacrificing functional validity.

- **Open Question 3**: How does the framework's performance and stability change when the action space is expanded to six degrees of freedom to handle curved boundaries, acute angles, and vertical placement?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion notes the current model assumes axis-aligned walls, restricts rotations to 90-degree increments, and excludes vertical placement, requiring "six-degree-of-freedom... actions" for complex geometries.
  - Why unresolved: The current architectural design relies on a diagonal Gaussian policy tailored for 2D continuous placement with discrete rotation, which may not scale efficiently to 3D reasoning.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results demonstrating that the PPO-based policy can converge and maintain reward scores in environments with non-rectilinear geometries and 3D object placement.

## Limitations
- Convergence guarantees rely on assumptions of partial observability and finite horizons that may not hold in real-world interior design with longer interaction loops and user preferences
- Network architecture details (MLP layers, CNN configurations) are unspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- The reward design assumes expert guidelines are sufficient while excluding user preferences and real-world constraints like lighting, limiting practical applicability

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties:**
- The paper's convergence guarantees rely on assumptions of partial observability and finite horizons that may not hold in real-world interior design with longer interaction loops and user preferences
- Network architecture details (MLP layers, CNN configurations) are unspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- The reward design assumes expert guidelines are sufficient while excluding user preferences and real-world constraints like lighting, limiting practical applicability

**Confidence Assessment:**
- **High Confidence**: The integration of expert design guidelines into structured reward functions directly shapes policy behavior toward human-preferred layouts. This is well-supported by ablation studies showing distinct contributions of each reward component.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that diagonal Gaussian policies enable effective exploration under partial observability is theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation beyond convergence proofs.
- **Medium Confidence**: PPO's clipped surrogate objective with GAE providing stable convergence for sequential furniture placement is supported by performance metrics but depends on unspecified hyperparameters.

## Next Checks
1. **Architectural Verification**: Replicate the baseline experiment (square room, F_n=4) and verify reward >0.95 and P-Loss <0.01 within 1000 epochs using the specified hyperparameters.
2. **Reward Component Analysis**: Systematically ablate individual reward components (starting with R_pair) and document the impact on layout quality and reward magnitude.
3. **Zero-Shot Generalization**: Train exclusively on square and rectangular rooms, then evaluate performance on L-shape and U-shape rooms with F_n=8 to measure generalization capability.
