# Toward a Unified Security Framework for AI Agents: Trust, Risk, and Liability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09620
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09620
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Introduces TRL framework linking trust, risk, and liability systems for AI agents

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a unified Trust, Risk, and Liability (TRL) framework for AI agents that treats these three governance dimensions as interdependent systems. The framework provides a systematic approach to building trustworthy, low-risk, and responsible AI agents through four trust dimensions (name, exterior, behavior, interior), dual risk analysis methods (ranking-based and math-based), and two liability attribution models (role-based and causality-based). It aims to foster public trust, reduce legal disputes, and enable broader AI adoption in critical sectors like 6G networks.

## Method Summary
The TRL framework is conceptual and qualitative, providing a structured process for AI agent governance without specific algorithms or datasets. It operates through three sequential systems: trust assessment using four dimensions mapped to three requirements, risk analysis using either ranking-based indicators or math-based simulation models, and liability allocation using either role-based RACI/DACI models or causality-based conditions. The framework is illustrated through a phone-calling AI agent scenario but lacks quantitative metrics, scoring thresholds, or empirical validation methods.

## Key Results
- Links responsibility, trust, and risk management through three causal pathways creating feedback loops
- Proposes layered risk analysis combining qualitative ranking approaches with quantitative mathematical models
- Establishes multidimensional trust framework based on name, exterior, behavior, and interior attributes
- Introduces dual liability attribution models (role-based and causality-based) with accountability mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Treating trust, risk, and liability as interdependent systems produces more coherent governance than addressing each in isolation.
- Mechanism: The TRL framework links three causal pathways: (1) responsibility positively affects trust; (2) risk triggers accountability mechanisms; (3) risk level modulates trust decisions. These create feedback loops where, for example, higher trust reduces the cost of risk management, while clearer accountability mechanisms incentivize stakeholders to manage risks more diligently.
- Core assumption: Stakeholders respond rationally to liability incentives, and trust decisions correlate with perceived risk levels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ties together the interdependent relationships of trust, risk, and liability"
  - [section III] "responsibility affects trust...risk triggers accountability mechanisms...risk level affects the degrees of trust"
  - [corpus] Weak direct validation. Neighboring papers (e.g., "Unbounded Harms, Bounded Law") address liability gaps but do not test the unified TRL causal model experimentally.
- Break condition: If stakeholders cannot accurately perceive risk levels or liability attribution is unenforceable, the feedback loops weaken or fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Layered risk analysis (ranking-based + math-based) enables context-appropriate mitigation strategies.
- Mechanism: Ranking-based approaches provide qualitative, scenario-comparative risk assessment (definable, extensible, standardizable), while math-based models (Monte-Carlo, Bayesian networks, event trees) provide quantitative estimates (modellable, quantifiable, computable). Risk levels then map to four mitigation strategies: avoidance (highest risk), transfer, reduction, acceptance (lowest risk).
- Core assumption: Risks are classifiable into discrete levels and appropriate mitigation strategies exist for each level.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V] "The process is mainly broken down into risk analysis and risk management with two proposed approaches"
  - [section V.B] "Examples of suitable models include Monte-Carlo simulation, Bayesian network, and event tree analysis"
  - [corpus] "GenAI Security: Outsmarting the Bots" describes proactive testing frameworks but does not validate TRL's specific dual-approach structure.
- Break condition: If risk indicators are poorly defined or scenarios have correlated/compounding risks that resist independent level assignment, the mitigation mapping becomes unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Trust in AI agents is multidimensional, established through name, exterior, behavior, and interior attributes that satisfy dependability, controllability, and alignability requirements.
- Mechanism: Users form trust impressions sequentially—first via name (memorability, cultural significance) and exterior (facial expressions, voice patterns), then through behavior (response timeliness, decision comprehensibility) and interior factors (data quality, model capability, privacy protection). These map to three requirements: dependability (capability + name/exterior), controllability (data/function/permission + behavior), alignability (value/goal/intention).
- Core assumption: Trust is both measurable and designable through controllable attributes; users assess these dimensions consistently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV] "four establishment dimensions of trust include the trustee's name, exterior, behavior, and interior"
  - [section VII.A] "An easily memorizable, pronounceable, recognizable, and culturally significant name can help AI agents create decent first impressions"
  - [corpus] "MemTrust" addresses trust in unified AI memory systems but focuses on zero-trust architecture rather than the four-dimension model.
- Break condition: If user populations have divergent cultural interpretations of name/exterior signals, or if interior attributes (values, goals) are opaque or misaligned, trust calibration fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **RACI/DACI Attribution Models**
  - Why needed here: The liability system relies on role-based attribution (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed or Driver, Approver, Contributor, Informed) to assign stakeholder responsibilities across scenarios.
  - Quick check question: Given an AI agent making an autonomous phone call, can you map each stakeholder (user, AI agent, company, recipient) to RACI roles for a "wrong number dialed" failure scenario?

- Concept: **Control and Epistemic Conditions in Causality-Based Attribution**
  - Why needed here: Causality-based models determine liability by evaluating whether an agent had free choice (control condition) and actual knowledge (epistemic condition), differently defined for intention-and-culpability vs. risk-and-negligence models.
  - Quick check question: For an AI agent that executes a harmful action based on a prompt injection attack, does the agent satisfy the control condition? Does the deploying company satisfy the epistemic condition?

- Concept: **Trust vs. Trustworthiness Distinction**
  - Why needed here: The framework distinguishes trust (subjective relationship between trustor and trustee) from trustworthiness (objective measure), which affects how technical and societal trust factors are designed and measured.
  - Quick check question: If users report high trust in an AI agent that has known security vulnerabilities, is the agent trustworthy? How does the TRL framework address this gap?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Trust System**: 4 dimensions (name, exterior, behavior, interior) → 3 requirements (dependability, controllability, alignability) → 2 aspects (societal, technical) → 1 purpose (words-deeds consistency)
  - **Risk System**: Analysis (ranking-based with indicators OR math-based with simulation models) → Risk level (0-3) → Mitigation strategy (accept, reduce, transfer, avoid)
  - **Liability System**: Attribution model selection (role-based RACI/DACI OR causality-based intention/negligence) → Stakeholder-role mapping → Responsibility allocation → Accountability mechanism enforcement
  - **Inter-system flows**: Responsibility→Trust, Trust→reduced accountability dependency, Risk→Accountability triggers, Accountability→Risk management enforcement, Risk level→Trust degree, Trust→reduced risk management cost

- Critical path:
  1. Identify AI agent scenario and enumerate all stakeholders
  2. Apply Trust System: Evaluate agent against 4 dimensions, verify 3 requirements, assess both trust aspects
  3. Apply Risk System: Select analysis approach, define indicators, compute risk level, assign mitigation strategy
  4. Apply Liability System: Select attribution model, map stakeholders to roles/conditions, allocate responsibilities, define accountability mechanisms
  5. Iterate: Use liability outcomes to refine risk management; use risk levels to calibrate trust thresholds

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Ranking-based vs. math-based risk analysis: Ranking is faster and more interpretable but less precise; math-based is rigorous but requires probability data that may not exist for novel AI behaviors
  - Role-based vs. causality-based attribution: Role-based is simpler and preemptive; causality-based is more contextually fair but requires post-hoc investigation
  - Societal vs. technical trust emphasis: Societal factors (culture, brand) vary by market; technical factors (privacy, explainability) require engineering investment

- Failure signatures:
  - Trust system failure: Users avoid or disable AI agent features despite technical correctness (suggests name/exterior/societal trust mismatches)
  - Risk system failure: Unexpected harms occur that were not classified in risk indicators (suggests indicator set incomplete or model assumptions violated)
  - Liability system failure: Disputes arise with no clear responsibility assignment (suggests attribution model mismatch or stakeholder role ambiguity)
  - Inter-system failure: High-trust users take excessive risks, or liability fears suppress beneficial low-risk AI usage (suggests calibration failure between systems)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Trust dimension audit**: For an existing AI agent (e.g., voice assistant), score each of the 4 dimensions against the 3 requirements. Identify the weakest dimension and propose concrete improvements.
  2. **Risk ranking exercise**: Define 5 scenarios for an AI phone-calling agent. Select 4 risk indicators (e.g., privacy, confidentiality, auditability, reversibility). Build the scenario-indicator matrix and assign risk levels 0-3. Validate mitigation strategy assignments.
  3. **Liability attribution drill**: For the same phone-calling agent, assume a "call made to wrong contact revealing confidential information" failure. Apply both RACI and causality-based attribution. Compare resulting responsibility allocations and identify which model produces fairer/more actionable outcomes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the qualitative trust dimensions (name, exterior, behavior, interior) be operationalized into quantitative metrics that enable systematic comparison across different AI agent implementations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The trust system describes four dimensions with multiple factors (cultural significance, appearance, response timeliness, value alignment), but provides no measurement methodology or scoring system.
- Why unresolved: The framework offers descriptive categories without standardized metrics, making objective trust evaluation impossible across implementations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validated measurement instrument with scoring rubrics for each dimension, demonstrated through inter-rater reliability testing.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Under what conditions do ranking-based versus math-based risk analysis approaches yield more accurate risk predictions for AI agent behaviors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "efforts still need to be taken to ensure a successful and effective launch and promotion" of the newly proposed framework, without specifying which approach works better.
- Why unresolved: Both approaches are presented as equally valid options without comparative analysis or guidance on selection criteria.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing prediction accuracy of each method across different AI agent risk scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How should liability be divided among multiple stakeholders when both the AI agent and the user contribute to harmful outcomes in ways the framework's attribution models cannot cleanly separate?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The DACI example assigns discrete roles (Driver, Approver, Contributor), but real scenarios may involve overlapping contributions where both AI agent errors and user inattention co-cause harms.
- Why unresolved: Attribution models assume clear role boundaries and single-party responsibility, leaving ambiguous joint-causation cases unaddressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proportional liability formula validated against actual dispute resolution cases involving multi-stakeholder AI harms.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does implementing the TRL framework actually reduce legal disputes and increase user adoption compared to existing ad-hoc trust and risk management approaches?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims the framework will "reduce legal disputes" and "enable broader adoption" but provides no empirical validation of these outcomes.
- Why unresolved: The framework is newly proposed with no deployment data or controlled trials demonstrating its effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies comparing dispute rates and adoption metrics between TRL-implementing and non-implementing AI systems.

## Limitations
- Framework remains entirely qualitative without operational metrics, scoring thresholds, or quantitative validation methods
- No empirical testing or case studies demonstrate effectiveness in real-world scenarios
- Interdependence mechanisms between systems lack mathematical formalization or experimental validation
- Risk level assignments and mitigation strategy mappings lack clear decision rules or probability thresholds

## Confidence

- **Medium Confidence**: The conceptual linkage between responsibility, trust, and risk management mechanisms (Mechanism 1). While logically coherent, this assumes rational stakeholder behavior without empirical support.
- **Medium Confidence**: The dual approach to risk analysis (ranking-based and math-based methods) is theoretically sound but lacks implementation specifications or validation data.
- **Low Confidence**: The four-dimensional trust model and its mapping to dependability, controllability, and alignability requirements. Cultural variability in name/exterior interpretation and measurement challenges are not addressed.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Trust Mapping Validation**: Conduct user studies with diverse cultural backgrounds to test whether the four trust dimensions (name, exterior, behavior, interior) consistently predict trust ratings across different AI agent types. Measure inter-rater reliability and identify cultural divergences.

2. **Risk Analysis Comparative Study**: Implement both ranking-based and math-based risk assessment approaches on the same set of AI agent scenarios. Compare consistency of risk level assignments, mitigation strategy recommendations, and resource requirements between methods.

3. **Liability Attribution Fairness Test**: Apply both role-based (RACI/DACI) and causality-based (intention/culpability vs. risk/negligence) attribution models to real incident cases. Evaluate stakeholder satisfaction with responsibility allocations and assess which model produces more actionable outcomes in practice.
