core_contribution: We aim to extend the scope of iconographic database work to include
  previously overlooked visual content in medieval manuscripts, such as decorative
  patterns, marginalia, and non-narrative forms. By using zero-shot segmentation models

# Exploring the "Great Unseen" in Medieval Manuscripts: Instance-Level Labeling of Legacy Image Collections with Zero-Shot Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07004
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07004
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: This paper proposes a semi-automatic system for instance-level labeling of overlooked visual content in medieval manuscripts using zero-shot segmentation and multi-modal models.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of annotating previously overlooked visual content in medieval manuscripts, such as decorative patterns, marginalia, and non-narrative forms. The authors propose a semi-automatic annotation system that combines zero-shot segmentation models like SAM2 with multi-modal models like RAM++ and Grounded-SAM. This approach enables instance-level segmentation and labeling, leveraging both legacy annotations and new ones to create richer training data for downstream computer vision and multimodal models. The system facilitates "distant viewing" through batch labeling via nearest-neighbor search and iterative fine-tuning, aiming to provide a more inclusive and granular representation of medieval manuscript imagery for large-scale analysis.

## Method Summary
The proposed system uses zero-shot segmentation models (SAM2) alongside multi-modal models (RAM++ and Grounded-SAM) to create a semi-automatic annotation framework for medieval manuscript images. The approach integrates legacy annotations with new ones to build richer training data. Batch labeling is enabled through nearest-neighbor search, and iterative fine-tuning is used to improve model performance. This combination allows for instance-level segmentation and labeling of decorative patterns, marginalia, and non-narrative forms that have been traditionally overlooked in iconographic databases.

## Key Results
- Achieves instance-level labeling of decorative patterns, marginalia, and non-narrative forms in medieval manuscripts
- Enables semi-automatic annotation by combining zero-shot segmentation with multi-modal models
- Facilitates distant viewing through batch labeling and iterative fine-tuning for large-scale analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages zero-shot segmentation capabilities of SAM2 to identify visual elements without prior training on medieval manuscript imagery. Multi-modal models RAM++ and Grounded-SAM provide contextual understanding and labeling capabilities. By combining these approaches, the system can process previously overlooked content types. The integration of legacy annotations with new ones creates a feedback loop that improves model performance over time. Batch labeling through nearest-neighbor search enables scalable processing of large manuscript collections, while iterative fine-tuning allows continuous improvement of the annotation system.

## Foundational Learning
- Zero-shot segmentation (why needed: to identify visual elements without specific training; quick check: test SAM2 on unseen manuscript types)
- Multi-modal model integration (why needed: to provide contextual understanding; quick check: evaluate RAM++ and Grounded-SAM performance on manuscript content)
- Instance-level labeling (why needed: to capture fine-grained visual details; quick check: compare instance vs. image-level annotations)
- Batch processing via nearest-neighbor search (why needed: to scale to large collections; quick check: measure processing speed on collections of varying sizes)
- Iterative fine-tuning (why needed: to improve model performance over time; quick check: track annotation accuracy improvements across iterations)
- Legacy data integration (why needed: to leverage existing knowledge; quick check: assess compatibility between legacy and new annotations)

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Legacy Annotations -> SAM2 -> RAM++/Grounded-SAM -> Batch Processing -> Iterative Fine-tuning -> Enriched Training Data

**Critical Path:** Image Input -> SAM2 Segmentation -> Multi-modal Analysis -> Label Assignment -> Nearest-neighbor Search -> Batch Labeling -> Fine-tuning -> Output Dataset

**Design Tradeoffs:** Zero-shot approach reduces need for extensive training data but may sacrifice accuracy on specialized content; batch processing enables scalability but may miss nuanced details; iterative fine-tuning improves performance but requires computational resources.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor segmentation accuracy on complex decorative patterns; incorrect label assignment for marginalia; scalability issues with very large collections; failure to integrate legacy annotations properly.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate SAM2 segmentation accuracy on a diverse set of medieval manuscript images
2. Test RAM++ and Grounded-SAM label assignment accuracy on annotated manuscript content
3. Measure batch processing performance and accuracy across collections of increasing size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Zero-shot segmentation model performance on medieval manuscript imagery remains unproven
- Lack of detailed validation for multi-modal models on targeted content types
- Unclear quality and representativeness of resulting dataset without benchmark comparisons
- Scalability and robustness of methods not demonstrated on real large-scale collections

## Confidence
- High confidence in conceptual framework potential to expand iconographic database work
- Medium confidence in technical feasibility pending empirical validation
- Low confidence in immediate applicability and performance on real medieval manuscript datasets

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comparative evaluation of SAM2, RAM++, and Grounded-SAM performance on benchmark dataset of medieval manuscript images with diverse decorative and marginal elements
2. Validate system's ability to accurately segment and label instance-level content across multiple manuscript collections, measuring precision and recall against expert annotations
3. Test scalability and robustness of batch labeling and iterative fine-tuning approach on large, diverse set of medieval manuscripts, assessing quality and usability of resulting training data for downstream models
