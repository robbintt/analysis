# An Architectural Advantage of The Instruction-Tuned LLM in Containing The Readability-Accuracy Tension in Text Simplification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05080
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05080
- Reference count: 40
- Both Mistral-Small 3 24B (instruction-tuned) and Qwen2.5 32B (reasoning-augmented) outperform previous transformer-based systems in biomedical text simplification

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the core linguistic capabilities of two general-purpose large language models for automated text simplification of biomedical abstracts. Using only zero-shot prompting, both models outperform previous transformer-based systems in overall goodness (SARI scores of 42.46 and 38.38 respectively) and achieve superior readability compared to human experts. The instruction-tuned Mistral model additionally attains human-level discourse preservation (BERTScore of 0.91) and demonstrates consistent performance across temperature settings. In contrast, while Qwen achieves reasonable readability, its operational strategy shows a disconnect between readability and accuracy, engaging in more conceptual expansion that risks semantic integrity. These findings suggest an architectural advantage for instruction-tuned models in balancing readability and semantic integrity during text simplification.

## Method Summary
The study compares Mistral-Small 3 24B (instruction-tuned) and Qwen2.5 32B (reasoning-augmented) on biomedical abstract simplification using zero-shot prompting. Models were evaluated on a benchmark of 750 biomedical abstracts with human reference simplifications, using 21 metrics including SARI, BERTScore, and various readability formulas. Temperature settings of T=0.2 ("strict") and T=0.4 ("flexi") were tested. A structured output schema required sentence-level indexing, transformed output, change tags, and rationale. Statistical comparisons used Welch's t-test at α=0.05.

## Key Results
- Mistral-Small 3 achieves SARI score of 42.46 vs baseline 34, demonstrating superior system goodness
- Mistral attains BERTScore of 0.91 matching human benchmark, while Qwen achieves 0.89
- Instruction-tuned Mistral shows temperature-robust performance across T=0.2 and T=0.4 settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Instruction-tuned models exhibit a tempered lexical simplification strategy that correlates with better discourse preservation.
- Mechanism: Mistral's conservative approach—prioritizing jargon/parlance swaps and selective omission over conceptual expansion—creates a tighter coupling between readability optimization and semantic fidelity. Correlation analysis shows Mistral's readability-accuracy coefficients range [0.2, 0.4], while Qwen's range [-0.2, 0.1], indicating disconnected tactics.
- Core assumption: The instruction-tuning process constrains the model's lexical search space, biasing toward substitution within input bounds rather than outward conceptual exploration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Mistral exhibits a tempered lexical simplification strategy that preserves discourse fidelity... correlation analysis reveals that Mistral employs a tempered lexical simplification strategy that preserves discourse fidelity, whereas Qwen's approach is more aggressive and less connected to accuracy metrics."
  - [section 3.6.2] "Mistral appears to consider accuracy in tandem with readability optimization... coefficients in the range [0.2,0.4] and [-0.2,0.1] respectively."
- Break condition: If instruction-tuned models from other families show aggressive expansion behavior similar to reasoning-augmented models, the mechanism may be model-specific rather than architectural.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reasoning-augmented architectures engage in conceptual expansion that increases readability but risks semantic drift.
- Mechanism: Qwen's self-reported rationale shows it opts to "add explanatory context" or "abstract and generalize complex concepts" as secondary tactics. This exploration behavior—likely emergent from reasoning training—expands the lexical search space but decouples accuracy from readability optimization.
- Core assumption: Reasoning augmentation encourages multi-step inference chains that surface contextual elaborations, which may introduce information not grounded in the source.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Qwen's approach is more aggressive and less connected to accuracy metrics... engaging in more conceptual expansion that risks semantic integrity."
  - [section 3.6.2, Figure 4] "Qwen appears to engage in conceptual expansion as it opts to add explanatory context or abstract and generalize complex concepts."
- Break condition: If constraining Qwen's output via prompt engineering eliminates conceptual expansion while preserving readability, the mechanism is controllable rather than inherent.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temperature robustness in instruction-tuned models indicates stable operational strategy across stochasticity settings.
- Mechanism: Mistral shows statistically consistent performance between T=0.2 and T=0.4 configurations, with near-identical SARI scores (42.37 vs 42.46) and BERTScore (0.91 both). This suggests the instruction-tuning process anchors the model's behavioral policy, reducing sensitivity to generation hyperparameters.
- Core assumption: Instruction-tuning creates a stronger alignment between the model's policy and the specified task, reducing the influence of sampling variance on output strategy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "The instruction-tuned Mistral model maintains stable operational performance irrespective of the temperature configuration."
  - [section 4] "The model does so consistently under different temperature configurations and appears to have a conservative lexical substitution/retention strategy."
- Break condition: If other instruction-tuned models show significant performance variance across temperature settings, robustness may be specific to Mistral-Small 3's training regime rather than the architectural class.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **SARI (System Against Reference Input)** — evaluates simplification goodness by measuring term addition, deletion, and retention against human reference.
  - Why needed here: Primary metric for system-level comparison; Mistral's SARI of 42.46 vs baseline 34 quantifies architectural advantage.
  - Quick check question: If a model deletes many source terms but adds none, would SARI increase or decrease?

- Concept: **BERTScore** — semantic similarity metric using contextual embeddings to compare generated and reference texts.
  - Why needed here: Measures discourse fidelity; Mistral's 0.91 matches human benchmark, while Qwen's 0.89 indicates semantic drift.
  - Quick check question: Why might BERTScore be preferable to ROUGE-L for evaluating semantic preservation in simplification?

- Concept: **Lexical vs. syntactic simplification** — lexical complexity involves vocabulary difficulty; syntactic complexity involves sentence structure.
  - Why needed here: Paper identifies lexical control as the "primary hurdle"; both models master syntactic simplification but differ in lexical strategy.
  - Quick check question: Which readability formula would most directly penalize high lexical complexity—Dale-Chall or Flesch Reading Ease?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer -> LLM simplification engine -> Prompt controller -> Temperature config -> Evaluation suite -> Self-reporting module

- Critical path:
  1. Segment input abstract into sentences with indices
  2. Apply zero-shot prompt with transform taxonomy
  3. Generate simplified text with self-reported rationale tags
  4. Compute SARI against human benchmark, BERTScore against source
  5. Validate readability metrics and cross-check correlation structure

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Mistral: Higher discourse fidelity (BERTScore 0.91), lower raw readability on Dale-Chall (12.30 vs human 9.40), temperature-robust
  - Qwen: Higher Flesch Ease (43.83 vs Mistral 42.11), lower BERTScore (0.89), more temperature-sensitive, aggressive lexical substitution
  - Temperature: Lower T reduces variance but may limit creative simplification; higher T increases output diversity but risks format failures

- Failure signatures:
  - Qwen strict: 59% task completion rate vs Mistral's 81%—format adherence issues under low temperature
  - Both models: Underperform on Dale-Chall and Gunning Fog—suggests lexical simplification is the bottleneck
  - Qwen: Low correlation between difficult-words score and readability metrics (coefficients 0.1–0.3) vs Mistral's 0.4—disconnected strategies

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Run Mistral-Small 3 and Qwen2.5 on the benchmark dataset (750 biomedical abstracts) with T=0.3, compute SARI, BERTScore, and Dale-Chall. Target: Mistral SARI > 40, BERTScore ≥ 0.90.
  2. **Prompt ablation**: Remove the self-reporting requirement and compare task completion rates and metric scores. Hypothesis: Reduces Qwen's format failures but may lose mechanistic insights.
  3. **Temperature sweep**: Test T ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} for both models. Measure SARI variance and BERTScore stability. Expect Mistral to show <2% variance; Qwen may show >5% variance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the architectural advantage of instruction-tuned models over reasoning-augmented models in balancing readability and accuracy hold across a wider range of LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations and Discussion sections explicitly state that "further evaluation across a wider range of models is required to unequivocally characterize the architectural advantage."
- Why unresolved: This study only compared a single representative from each class (Mistral-Small vs. Qwen), limiting the generalizability of the architectural conclusions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation of multiple distinct instruction-tuned and reasoning-augmented models (e.g., various Llama, Gemma, or GPT variants) on the same text simplification benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does prioritizing specialized lexical support over generalized domain knowledge expansion improve performance in LLM text simplification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion notes that "lexical control" is the primary hurdle and suggests "targeted domain adaptation strategies may benefit from prioritizing integration of specialized lexical support."
- Why unresolved: The current study evaluated general-purpose models using zero-shot prompting and did not test specific domain-adaptation techniques or lexical interventions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing general fine-tuning against lexicon-augmented retrieval or specialized lexical fine-tuning on the identified lexical control metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the "conceptual expansion" behavior of reasoning-augmented models inherently cause semantic drift in text simplification tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states that the "characteristic conceptual expansion behavior of reasoning-augmented Qwen... risks semantic degradation but requires further investigation."
- Why unresolved: The study observed that Qwen adds explanatory context more often than Mistral, but did not determine if this reasoning behavior is the direct cause of the lower statistical accuracy scores.
- What evidence would resolve it: A fine-grained error analysis or human evaluation focused on the factual accuracy of the "added explanatory context" generated by reasoning models.

## Limitations
- The analysis is based on zero-shot prompting without fine-tuning, limiting claims about optimal performance configurations
- The correlation analysis does not establish causation between architectural features and simplification tactics
- Temperature robustness findings are limited to two settings (T=0.2 and T=0.4) and may not generalize across the full range of sampling parameters

## Confidence

- **High**: Mistral-Small 3 24B achieves superior SARI scores (42.46) and BERTScore (0.91) compared to Qwen2.5 32B; instruction-tuned model shows better discourse preservation than human benchmark.
- **Medium**: Claims about architectural advantages being generalizable beyond biomedical domain; temperature robustness being a fundamental property of instruction-tuning.
- **Low**: Causal mechanisms linking instruction-tuning to tempered lexical strategies; reasoning-augmentation directly causing conceptual expansion behavior.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test Mistral and Qwen on non-biomedical simplification tasks (e.g., news articles, legal documents) to assess architectural advantage generalizability.
2. **Fine-tuning experiment**: Compare zero-shot vs. few-shot vs. fine-tuned performance for both models to establish baseline optimization potential.
3. **Prompt engineering impact**: Systematically vary prompt specificity and constraints to measure how much Qwen's conceptual expansion is prompt-driven vs. architecturally determined.
