- Key outcome: Bayesian fusion of generic LLM scores with local classifier scores improves curation performance while avoiding expensive fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of curating online course discussion forums by proposing a Bayesian fusion approach that combines classification scores from pre-trained large language models with locally trained classifiers. The method avoids the computational expense and impracticality of frequent LLM fine-tuning while leveraging the strengths of both generic and domain-specific models. The fusion approach demonstrates competitive performance across multiple experimental scenarios, achieving F1-scores up to 0.78.

The research validates that multidimensional classification scores can be effectively combined through Bayesian fusion to create a cost-efficient solution for educational forum curation. The approach proves particularly valuable in scenarios where continuous adaptation is needed but computational resources are constrained, offering a practical alternative to expensive fine-tuning while maintaining robust classification performance.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a Bayesian fusion method that combines multidimensional classification scores from a pre-trained generic LLM with scores from a classifier trained on local course data. This approach leverages the broad knowledge of the LLM while incorporating domain-specific insights from the local classifier. The fusion algorithm probabilistically integrates these scores to produce final classification decisions, avoiding the need for expensive fine-tuning of the LLM. The method was tested across within-course, within-domain, and cross-domain scenarios to evaluate its robustness and generalizability.

## Key Results
- Bayesian fusion approach achieved F1-scores up to 0.78 across various experimental scenarios
- Performance was competitive with traditional LLM fine-tuning while avoiding its computational costs
- The method demonstrated robustness across within-course, within-domain, and cross-domain settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Bayesian fusion approach works by probabilistically combining the strengths of two complementary models: the broad knowledge base of a pre-trained generic LLM and the domain-specific insights captured by a locally trained classifier. The LLM provides strong general language understanding and classification capabilities, while the local classifier captures course-specific patterns and terminology. By fusing their scores through Bayesian inference, the method creates a more robust classifier that benefits from both general and specific knowledge without the computational burden of fine-tuning the LLM for each new course or domain.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian fusion**: Probabilistic combination of multiple model outputs to improve overall classification accuracy. Needed because it allows principled integration of complementary model strengths. Quick check: verify that fusion weights are learned from validation data rather than being fixed.

- **Multidimensional classification**: Simultaneously predicting multiple labels or categories for each input instance. Needed because forum posts often contain multiple relevant topics or characteristics. Quick check: ensure the classification scheme captures all relevant dimensions of forum content.

- **Pre-trained LLMs**: Large language models trained on general web data that provide strong baseline language understanding. Needed as a foundation that can be adapted without full fine-tuning. Quick check: verify the LLM was trained on diverse enough data to handle educational contexts.

- **Local classifier adaptation**: Training domain-specific models on course-specific data to capture local patterns. Needed because generic models may miss important context-specific features. Quick check: confirm the local classifier has sufficient training data for stable learning.

- **Cost-effective AI deployment**: Strategies to achieve good performance without expensive computational resources. Needed because frequent fine-tuning is impractical for educational settings. Quick check: compare inference costs between fusion and fine-tuning approaches.

- **Cross-domain generalization**: Ability of models to perform well across different but related domains. Needed to ensure the approach works beyond a single course or institution. Quick check: test performance across multiple unrelated courses or educational platforms.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Pre-trained LLM -> Score extraction -> Bayesian fusion module <- Local classifier -> Score extraction -> Bayesian fusion module -> Final classification

Critical Path:
Local classifier training -> Score extraction -> Bayesian fusion computation -> Classification decision

Design Tradeoffs:
The approach trades potential maximum performance (achievable through full fine-tuning) for significant cost savings and faster deployment. The fusion method must balance between the generic LLM's broad knowledge and the local classifier's domain specificity. This creates a middle ground where neither model's strengths are fully exploited individually, but their combination achieves competitive results with much lower computational overhead.

Failure Signatures:
Poor performance when the local classifier lacks sufficient training data or when the pre-trained LLM has limited understanding of educational contexts. The fusion can also fail when there's high disagreement between models that cannot be resolved through simple Bayesian weighting. Cross-domain scenarios may show significant performance drops if the foundational LLM lacks relevant domain knowledge.

Three First Experiments:
1. Ablation study: Test classification performance with only the LLM scores, only the local classifier scores, and their fusion to quantify the contribution of each component.
2. Training data sensitivity: Evaluate how performance scales with different amounts of local training data to identify the minimum viable dataset size.
3. Cross-domain transfer: Test the fusion approach on courses from completely different domains (e.g., humanities vs. STEM) to assess generalization limits.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability uncertainty across different educational domains and forum structures
- Limited comparison to fine-tuning under varying experimental conditions and edge cases
- Potential struggles with nuanced educational terminology without domain-specific fine-tuning

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Bayesian fusion achieves competitive performance with fine-tuning | Medium |
| Method offers practical, cost-effective solution | Medium |
| Fusion approach maintains performance over time | Low (not extensively validated) |

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Institutional Validation**: Test the fusion approach across multiple universities and educational platforms with varying course structures and student demographics to assess generalizability.

2. **Longitudinal Performance Monitoring**: Implement a time-series analysis to track fusion model performance over extended periods (6+ months) to identify potential degradation or drift in classification accuracy.

3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis Under Varying Scales**: Conduct experiments comparing operational costs and performance metrics across different forum sizes (from small classes to massive open online courses) to validate the claimed cost-effectiveness.
