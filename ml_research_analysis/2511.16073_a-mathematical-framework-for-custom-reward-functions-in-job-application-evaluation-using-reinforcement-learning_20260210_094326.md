# A Mathematical Framework for Custom Reward Functions in Job Application Evaluation using Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16073
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16073
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: GRPO-refined model achieves 91% accuracy with 0.85 recall and 1.0 precision on unseen test data

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the inflexibility of traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that rely on rigid keyword matching and often overlook qualified candidates due to semantic mismatches. The proposed two-stage methodology combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish a baseline model with Generative Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a custom multi-component reward function. This approach enhances the model's ability to evaluate candidates more holistically, aligning its outputs with human recruiter judgment and significantly outperforming traditional keyword-based systems.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs a two-stage approach to improve job application evaluation. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning establishes a baseline model using labeled recruitment data. Second, Generative Reward Policy Optimization refines the model using a custom multi-component reward function that evaluates candidates based on multiple criteria including skills, experience, and role fit. The reward function is designed to capture nuanced aspects of candidate quality beyond simple keyword matching, allowing the model to learn more sophisticated evaluation patterns that better align with human recruiter decision-making.

## Key Results
- GRPO-refined model achieves 91% accuracy on unseen test data
- Recall of 0.85 for the SELECTED class with perfect precision (1.0)
- Significantly outperforms the SFT-only baseline model
- Demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating reward hacking while reducing false positives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed framework works by combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning optimization, allowing the model to learn both from labeled examples and through iterative reward-based refinement. The custom multi-component reward function captures complex evaluation criteria that traditional keyword-based systems miss, enabling the model to recognize qualified candidates even when their applications don't contain exact keyword matches. By aligning the reward structure with human recruiter judgment, the system learns to evaluate candidates more holistically, considering contextual relationships between different aspects of a candidate's profile rather than treating each criterion in isolation.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Required to establish baseline understanding of recruitment patterns from labeled data; quick check involves verifying baseline performance metrics before RL refinement.
2. **Generative Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO)**: Advanced RL technique that optimizes policies through reward feedback; quick check requires monitoring reward convergence during training.
3. **Multi-component Reward Functions**: Composite evaluation metrics combining multiple criteria; quick check involves testing individual component contributions to overall performance.
4. **Reward Hacking Prevention**: Techniques to prevent model exploitation of reward function loopholes; quick check requires adversarial testing with edge-case candidate profiles.
5. **Semantic Matching**: Understanding contextual relationships beyond literal keyword matching; quick check involves testing with semantically similar but lexically different applications.
6. **Human-in-the-Loop Alignment**: Ensuring model outputs match human recruiter judgment; quick check requires comparison with human expert evaluations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Candidate Applications -> SFT Model -> GRPO Refinement -> Reward Function -> Final Evaluation Model

**Critical Path**: Raw application data flows through SFT training to create baseline model, which then undergoes GRPO refinement using the custom reward function to produce the final evaluation model deployed for candidate assessment.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity and training time for improved evaluation accuracy and reduced false negatives. While SFT provides faster initial training with simpler implementation, GRPO requires more computational resources but delivers superior performance through iterative refinement and better alignment with human judgment.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance indicates issues with reward function design (reward hacking or misaligned incentives), insufficient SFT baseline quality (inadequate training data or model architecture), or data distribution mismatch between training and deployment scenarios (domain adaptation problems).

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare baseline SFT performance against GRPO-refined model using identical test datasets
2. Evaluate individual reward function component contributions through ablation studies
3. Test model robustness with adversarial candidate profiles designed to trigger potential reward exploitation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited assessment of generalizability due to undisclosed dataset characteristics and sample size
- Insufficient detail on specific mechanisms preventing reward hacking exploitation
- Lack of benchmarking against other state-of-the-art recruitment evaluation methods
- Missing practical implementation considerations for real-world ATS integration

## Confidence
- Model performance claims (accuracy, recall, precision): High
- GRPO effectiveness relative to SFT baseline: Medium
- Reward hacking mitigation effectiveness: Low
- Real-world applicability and ATS integration: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation across multiple diverse recruitment datasets to assess generalizability beyond the initial test set
2. Implement ablation studies isolating individual reward function components to quantify their specific contributions to performance improvements
3. Perform stress testing with adversarial candidate profiles designed to trigger potential reward hacking behaviors identified in the reward function design
