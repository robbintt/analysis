# Fre-CW: Targeted Attack on Time Series Forecasting using Frequency Domain Loss
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08955
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08955
- Reference count: 25
- Introduces Fre-CW, a frequency-domain enhanced targeted attack method for transformer-based time series forecasting

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Fre-CW, a novel targeted adversarial attack method for transformer-based time series forecasting models. The key innovation is the integration of frequency domain loss into the Carlini and Wagner (C&W) attack framework, using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to capture both low-frequency trends and high-frequency abrupt changes in time series data. By optimizing both time and frequency domain losses, Fre-CW generates adversarial samples that are more effective at deceiving forecasting models while maintaining data realism. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline attacks (FGSM, PGD, C&W) across six benchmark datasets and two forecasting models.

## Method Summary
Fre-CW extends the C&W attack framework by incorporating a frequency domain loss component. The method first transforms the time series into the frequency domain using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), then optimizes both time and frequency domain losses simultaneously during the adversarial sample generation process. The frequency domain loss captures periodic patterns and abrupt changes that may not be fully represented in the time domain alone. The optimization process uses a two-stage approach where time and frequency domain losses are weighted differently in each stage to balance attack effectiveness and data realism. The final adversarial sample is obtained by combining the optimized perturbations from both domains.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baseline methods (FGSM, PGD, C&W) with MAE reductions of 0.009-0.039 on PatchTST model
- Achieves MSE reductions of 0.014-0.043 on PatchTST compared to baseline attacks
- Demonstrates effectiveness across six benchmark datasets (Weather, ECL, ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2)
- Improves attack stealthiness by capturing both low-frequency trends and high-frequency abrupt changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The frequency domain loss component allows Fre-CW to capture periodic patterns and abrupt changes that may be missed by time-domain-only approaches. By transforming the time series into the frequency domain using DFT, the method can optimize perturbations that affect both the overall trends (low-frequency components) and sudden changes (high-frequency components) in the data. This dual optimization ensures that adversarial samples are not only effective at deceiving the forecasting model but also maintain realistic characteristics that make them harder to detect. The two-stage optimization process allows for better control over the trade-off between attack effectiveness and data realism.

## Foundational Learning
- **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**: Converts time series from time domain to frequency domain; needed to capture periodic patterns and analyze frequency components of adversarial perturbations; quick check: verify DFT implementation correctly preserves signal energy
- **Carlini and Wagner (C&W) attack framework**: Optimization-based targeted attack method; provides the foundation for generating adversarial samples with minimal perturbation; quick check: ensure gradient computation is correct for the modified loss function
- **Frequency domain loss**: Additional loss term that captures high-frequency components; helps maintain data realism while improving attack effectiveness; quick check: validate that frequency loss actually captures meaningful signal characteristics
- **Two-stage optimization**: Different weighting of time and frequency losses in each stage; balances attack performance and stealthiness; quick check: experiment with different stage configurations to find optimal balance
- **Transformer-based forecasting models**: Models like PatchTST and Dlinear that use attention mechanisms; vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their complex decision boundaries; quick check: verify model predictions are consistent across different random seeds
- **Targeted attack**: Aims to force the model to predict a specific target output; more challenging than untargeted attacks; quick check: ensure target labels are correctly specified in experiments

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Time series data -> DFT transformation -> Joint time-frequency optimization -> Adversarial sample generation -> Model prediction

**Critical path**: Input time series → DFT → Frequency domain loss computation → Time domain loss computation → Combined loss optimization → Adversarial sample output

**Design tradeoffs**: The frequency domain loss improves attack effectiveness but increases computational complexity; the two-stage optimization provides better control but requires careful tuning of stage-specific hyperparameters; maintaining data realism may limit the maximum perturbation size

**Failure signatures**: Poor attack performance when frequency domain loss dominates (samples become too noisy); failure to generate effective adversarial samples when time domain loss is too strong (samples remain too close to original); DFT artifacts appearing in generated samples due to improper frequency loss weighting

**Three first experiments**:
1. Validate DFT implementation by comparing original and reconstructed signals for various test datasets
2. Test single-stage vs two-stage optimization to quantify the benefit of the staged approach
3. Measure attack success rate while varying the relative weight of frequency domain loss to find the optimal balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to transformer-based models (PatchTST and Dlinear), excluding other architectures like LSTMs or CNNs
- No analysis of defense mechanisms against frequency-based adversarial perturbations
- Limited testing on real-world deployed systems, focusing only on benchmark datasets
- Assumption that DFT transformation preserves adversarial patterns may not hold for non-stationary signals

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Core methodology and technical implementation are sound, with specific experimental results (MAE reductions of 0.009-0.039 and MSE reductions of 0.014-0.043) that are reproducible based on the described approach.

**Medium Confidence**: Claims about improved stealthiness are supported by experimental design but lack comprehensive perceptual evaluation or domain expert validation to confirm enhanced realism of adversarial samples.

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability to real-world deployment scenarios is uncertain due to evaluation being limited to benchmark datasets without testing on live forecasting systems or varying environmental conditions.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Test Fre-CW against diverse forecasting models including LSTMs, temporal convolutional networks, and statistical models to verify consistent performance improvements across different architectures.

2. **Defense robustness analysis**: Implement and evaluate common adversarial defense techniques (adversarial training, input denoising, detection mechanisms) against Fre-CW to assess whether frequency domain components introduce exploitable vulnerabilities.

3. **Real-world deployment testing**: Apply Fre-CW to actual deployed time series forecasting systems (energy load prediction, financial forecasting) and measure attack success rate under realistic operational conditions with varying data quality and system constraints.
