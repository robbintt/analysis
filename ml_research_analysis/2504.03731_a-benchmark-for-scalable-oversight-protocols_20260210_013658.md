core_contribution: The authors introduce a principled benchmark for evaluating scalable
  oversight protocols using an Agent Score Difference (ASD) metric, which measures
  how effectively a protocol advantages truthful behavior over deception. They implement
  this in a Python library and conduct a demonstrative experiment on the GSM8K dataset,
  comparing Debate, Consultancy, and Propaganda protocols.
