# Automatic Pith Detection in Tree Cross-Section Images Using Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.00625
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00625
- **Reference count:** 11
- **Primary result:** Deep learning models (Swin Transformer, YOLOv9, DeepLabV3, U-Net, Mask R-CNN) achieved varying success in automated pith detection, with Swin Transformer reaching highest accuracy (0.94) and IoU (0.85).

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates five deep learning models for automated pith detection in tree cross-section images, addressing a critical need in dendrochronology for accurate ring counting and age determination. The research compares Swin Transformer, YOLOv9, DeepLabV3, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN using a dataset of 582 labeled images with data augmentation to enhance generalization. Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94) and IoU (0.85), excelling in fine segmentation but requiring high computational resources. The study reveals that model selection should balance accuracy, speed, and computational cost based on application needs, with YOLOv9 offering fast detection but struggling with boundary precision, while DeepLabV3 and U-Net provided balanced performance.

## Method Summary
The study trained and tested five deep learning models on 582 labeled tree cross-section images using data augmentation techniques including rotation, scaling, and flipping to improve generalization. Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94) and IoU (0.85), while YOLOv9 provided fast detection with boundary precision issues. DeepLabV3 and U-Net balanced accuracy with efficiency, and Mask R-CNN showed significant improvement with Non-Maximum Suppression, increasing its IoU from 0.45 to 0.80. The models were evaluated on their ability to handle overlapping detections and boundary inconsistencies, with hyperparameter tuning and augmentation addressing these challenges. Exploratory testing on an oak dataset revealed that model generalizability varied by training data size and composition, with Mask R-CNN trained on a smaller dataset outperforming others.

## Key Results
- Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94) and IoU (0.85) but required significant computational resources
- Mask R-CNN's IoU improved dramatically from 0.45 to 0.80 with Non-Maximum Suppression implementation
- YOLOv9 offered fast detection but struggled with boundary precision compared to segmentation-focused models
- Model generalizability varied significantly based on training data composition and size, with smaller datasets sometimes outperforming larger ones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of deep learning models in pith detection stems from their ability to learn hierarchical feature representations from tree cross-section images. Convolutional neural networks excel at capturing spatial patterns in wood grain and ring structures, while transformer architectures like Swin leverage self-attention mechanisms to better understand contextual relationships between different regions of the cross-section. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping help models generalize to varying image orientations and scales commonly encountered in field conditions. The substantial improvement in Mask R-CNN's performance with Non-Maximum Suppression demonstrates how post-processing techniques can effectively resolve overlapping detections and improve boundary delineation, addressing key challenges in automated pith localization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Essential for capturing spatial hierarchies in tree ring patterns; quick check: verify receptive field size matches expected pith diameter range
- **Transformer Architectures:** Provide superior contextual understanding through self-attention mechanisms; quick check: compare attention map visualizations across different pith regions
- **Data Augmentation:** Critical for improving model robustness to varying imaging conditions; quick check: analyze performance degradation without augmentation across test sets
- **Non-Maximum Suppression:** Key post-processing technique for resolving overlapping detections; quick check: measure precision-recall trade-off with different suppression thresholds
- **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Standard metric for evaluating segmentation accuracy; quick check: validate IoU calculations using ground truth masks
- **Computational Complexity Trade-offs:** Important consideration for real-time field applications; quick check: benchmark inference time versus accuracy across different hardware platforms

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Image -> Data Augmentation -> Backbone Network (CNN/Transformer) -> Feature Pyramid -> Detection/Segmentation Head -> Post-processing (NMS) -> Output Pith Mask

**Critical Path:** Image preprocessing and augmentation -> Feature extraction through backbone -> Feature refinement through neck/neck-like components -> Detection/segmentation head processing -> Post-processing for final output

**Design Tradeoffs:** Swin Transformer offers highest accuracy but requires significant computational resources; YOLOv9 provides speed but sacrifices boundary precision; DeepLabV3 and U-Net balance accuracy and efficiency; Mask R-CNN benefits substantially from post-processing techniques but may struggle with boundary delineation without optimization

**Failure Signatures:** Overlapping detections indicate insufficient suppression or feature separation; boundary inconsistencies suggest inadequate spatial resolution or feature refinement; poor generalization across species indicates insufficient diversity in training data or inadequate augmentation strategies

**First Experiments:** 1) Benchmark inference time and memory usage across all models on target hardware, 2) Visualize attention maps and feature activations to identify failure modes in boundary detection, 3) Perform ablation studies on data augmentation strategies to quantify their impact on cross-species generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational demands of top-performing models (Swin Transformer) may limit real-time field deployment
- Exploratory testing on oak dataset suggests model performance varies significantly with training data composition
- Relatively modest dataset size (582 images) may constrain true generalization capabilities across diverse tree species
- Boundary precision remains challenging for all models, particularly in complex ring structures with overlapping features

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in reported model performance metrics on test dataset
- **Medium confidence** in cross-species generalizability based on exploratory oak dataset testing
- **Low confidence** in computational efficiency trade-offs for field deployment scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on a larger, more diverse dataset including multiple tree species and imaging conditions to assess true generalizability
2. Conduct field trials with real-time processing requirements to evaluate computational efficiency claims under practical constraints
3. Perform ablation studies specifically targeting boundary detection and overlapping object handling to quantify improvements from hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation strategies
