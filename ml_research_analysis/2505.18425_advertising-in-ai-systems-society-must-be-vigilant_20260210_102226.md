# Advertising in AI systems: Society must be vigilant

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.18425
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18425
- Authors: Menghua Wu; Yujia Bao
- Reference count: 21
- One-line primary result: This paper envisions the future of advertising within AI systems, predicting that commercial incentives will increasingly shape content served by generative AI.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores how advertising will integrate into AI systems, predicting that commercial incentives will increasingly shape generative AI outputs much like they have for web search and social media. The authors identify two main types of sponsored content—static advertisements and generative advertisements—and propose four core design principles for responsible integration: faithfulness, utility, privacy, and provenance. They also outline strategies for detecting and mitigating commercial biases in AI outputs, while raising critical open questions about regulation, transparency, and long-term model alignment.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a conceptual framework for advertising in AI systems centered on retrieval-augmented generation. Sponsored content is injected into the retrieval stage, where the model synthesizes both organic and commercial sources. Two approaches are suggested for detecting commercial bias: direct debiasing using specialized models, and multi-sampling aggregation that compares outputs across varied serving conditions to identify sponsor-specific content. The work emphasizes principles for system design and outlines implementation strategies, though it lacks empirical validation or concrete implementation details.

## Key Results
- Commercial incentives will increasingly shape generative AI content, similar to how advertising transformed web search and social media
- Sponsored content can be integrated through retrieval augmentation, making commercial influence difficult to distinguish from organic recommendations
- Four core principles—faithfulness, utility, privacy, and provenance—are proposed as guardrails for responsible ad integration
- Commercial bias detection can be approached through direct debiasing or multi-sampling aggregation methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Generative Advertisement Insertion via Retrieved Context
- Claim: Sponsored content can be integrated into AI outputs by injecting it into the information retrieval stage, where the model synthesizes both organic and commercial sources
- Mechanism: Given user query x, the system retrieves information sources z = {z₁, ..., zₙ}. A subset z_ad contains sponsored content. The model generates output y conditioned on both z_w/o_ad and z_ad, making commercial influence difficult to distinguish from organic recommendations
- Core assumption: Users cannot reliably distinguish AI outputs influenced by sponsored sources from those based solely on organic information
- Evidence anchors: [Section 2]: "Generative advertisements derive their content from both traditional information sources, as well as additional sponsored content"
- Break condition: If users develop reliable heuristics or tools to detect sponsored synthesis, or if platforms isolate ad content into clearly delineated output sections

### Mechanism 2: Tool-Call Architecture for Concurrent Ad Retrieval
- Claim: Standard LLM tool-call patterns can be extended to treat advertisement acquisition as a parallel tool call, enabling real-time ad auctions and insertion without blocking primary content generation
- Mechanism: Upon receiving query x, the LLM initiates parallel tool calls—a content retrieval call (yielding z_w/o_ad) and an advertisement call (yielding z_ad, potentially via auction). Sponsored content is tagged (e.g., `<ad>`) in context, and the model generates integrated output with optional post-hoc faithfulness verification
- Core assumption: Modern LLMs can maintain fidelity to sponsored content while preserving overall response utility
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3.3]: Details the 5-step implementation including concurrent tool calls, optional chain-of-thought, and ad insertion with special tags
- Break condition: If utility degradation U(y_w/ad) falls below threshold α·U(y_w/o_ad), or if faithfulness metric F(y_w/ad, z_i) cannot be maintained above δ

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Sampling Aggregation for Bias Detection
- Claim: Commercial bias can be estimated by generating multiple outputs under varied serving conditions (cookies, geolocation, personas) and identifying stable vs. variable content segments
- Mechanism: Generate k outputs {y_w/ad^1(x), ..., y_w/ad^k(x)} under different contextual parameters. Aggregate to extract text segments that appear across all samples (likely non-promotional) versus those that vary (likely sponsor-specific). A smaller ad-free model filters variable elements
- Core assumption: Different serving contexts will elicit different sponsored content, creating detectable variance patterns
- Evidence anchors: [Section 4.2]: "By comparing these k outputs, we detect the stable text segments shared across all samples, filtering out brand- or sponsor-specific components"
- Break condition: If advertisers serve uniform sponsored content across all contexts, or if non-promotional content varies significantly due to model stochasticity

## Foundational Learning

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: The ad insertion mechanism treats sponsored content as a special type of retrieved document; understanding RAG helps grasp how external information influences generation
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how retrieved documents are incorporated into an LLM's generation process, and where in that pipeline ad content would be injected?

- **RLHF and Alignment Data Pipelines**
  - Why needed here: Section 3.2 and 5 discuss how human feedback on ad-containing outputs risks embedding commercial bias into model weights over time
  - Quick check question: What happens to model behavior if commercially-influenced outputs are included in RLHF training data without proper labeling?

- **Provenance Tracking in Generative Systems**
  - Why needed here: The provenance principle (mapping output tokens to source documents) is foundational for compliance auditing and transparency
  - Quick check question: How would you implement a mapping φ: y_i → {0,1}^{|z|} that tracks which retrieved sources influenced each output token?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  ```
  User Query (x) → [Router]
                   ↓
    ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
    ↓                              ↓
  Content Tool Call            Ad Tool Call
  (search/RAG/tools)          (auction + user prefs o_u)
    ↓                              ↓
  z_w/o_ad                     z_ad (tagged <ad>)
    └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                   ↓
              LLM Context
                   ↓
         [Optional: CoT reasoning]
                   ↓
         Final Generation (y_w/ad)
                   ↓
         [Optional: Post-hoc verification]
  ```

- **Critical path:** The ad auction must complete within the same latency budget as content retrieval; any delay directly impacts user-facing response time

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Faithfulness vs. utility: Maximizing ad fidelity F may constrain natural language fluency
  - Privacy vs. relevance: o_u = OUT reduces personalization value for advertisers, potentially affecting pricing
  - Transparency vs. UX: Prominent ad disclosure may erode trust if overused, but covert integration risks regulatory violation

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Hallucinated sponsorship: Model references brands not in z_ad (training data contamination)
  - Utility collapse: User satisfaction metrics drop when ads are present (α threshold violated)
  - Provenance loss: Cannot trace output claims to specific sources during audit

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement a toy system with mock ad retrieval; measure faithfulness F using entailment checks between z_ad and y_w/ad across 100 queries
  2. A/B test utility metrics (relevance, latency, accuracy) comparing y_w/ad vs. y_w/o_ad outputs on a held-out evaluation set
  3. Test multi-sampling debiasing: generate 5 outputs per query with synthetic persona variations; measure precision/recall of commercial content detection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can regulators verify compliance for generative advertisements when model outputs vary stochastically across users and sessions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper asks, "It is not yet clear how regulators will verify compliance when model outputs differ across users or sessions"
- Why unresolved: Generative outputs lack the static format of traditional ads, complicating the enforcement of standard disclosure requirements
- Evidence: Development of adapted reproducibility techniques, logging standards, and automated auditing tools capable of handling dynamic AI responses

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can sponsored outputs be incorporated into model alignment pipelines without systematically biasing the AI's factual knowledge base?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "Determining how to incorporate sponsored outputs into alignment pipelines without systematically biasing the model remains an unsolved problem"
- Why unresolved: Naively including commercial content in human feedback loops may cause models to "forget" sponsorship context or hallucinate information
- Evidence: Algorithms capable of surgically removing sponsored content from trained models or alignment methods that prevent commercial bias drift

### Open Question 3
- Question: What metrics and methodologies can effectively quantify "commercial bias" in large language model outputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 notes, "It is not yet clear what metrics best reflect commercial bias in LLM outputs"
- Why unresolved: Unlike factuality or social bias, commercial bias involves subtle promotional language that is difficult to distinguish from genuine advice
- Evidence: Creation of new datasets and evaluation benchmarks specifically designed to detect and measure promotional influence

## Limitations
- The paper presents conceptual frameworks and design principles rather than empirical validation, with most claims supported by theoretical arguments rather than experimental data
- Critical implementation details are underspecified, including threshold values (δ for fidelity, α for utility degradation), concrete metric definitions, and dataset specifications for bias detection
- The multi-sampling aggregation approach lacks evidence for effectiveness in real-world scenarios where commercial content may be uniformly distributed across contexts
- No discussion of computational overhead for provenance tracking or post-hoc verification mechanisms in production settings

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core observation that advertising will increasingly influence AI systems, and the general principle that retrieval-augmented generation provides a natural insertion point for sponsored content
- **Medium confidence**: The four design principles (faithfulness, utility, privacy, provenance) as reasonable guardrails, though their practical enforceability remains untested
- **Low confidence**: The effectiveness of proposed bias detection mechanisms (multi-sampling aggregation and direct debiasing) without empirical validation on real ad-integrated systems

## Next Checks
1. Implement and benchmark the proposed ad insertion pipeline with controlled test queries, measuring faithfulness scores F(y_w/ad, z_ad) and utility degradation U(y_w/ad)/U(y_w/o_ad) across 100+ diverse prompts
2. Conduct a user study to test whether individuals can reliably distinguish AI outputs containing sponsored content from organic recommendations, measuring detection accuracy under different disclosure conditions
3. Build a prototype provenance tracking system that maps output tokens to source documents, then stress-test its performance and storage requirements under realistic query volumes (10K+ queries/day)
