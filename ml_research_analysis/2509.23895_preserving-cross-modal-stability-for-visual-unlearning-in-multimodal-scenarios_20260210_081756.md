# Preserving Cross-Modal Stability for Visual Unlearning in Multimodal Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23895
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23895

- Primary result: Visual modality unlearning framework achieving 7.12% accuracy improvement with 7% of unlearning time

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of visual modality unlearning in multimodal scenarios where visual data poses significant privacy risks. Existing unlearning methods fail to preserve cross-modal knowledge and intra-class structural stability, leading to degraded performance on other modalities. The authors propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) framework that selectively removes visual information while maintaining model utility across all modalities. Through three key components—selective visual unlearning, cross-modal knowledge retention, and dual-set contrastive separation—CCU effectively eliminates visual data influence while preserving the model's ability to process and understand other modalities.

## Method Summary
The Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) framework introduces a novel approach to multimodal unlearning by focusing on preserving cross-modal stability. The method employs inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual representations from original semantics while maintaining semantic consistency across other modalities. The framework uses a dual-set contrastive separation mechanism to isolate structural perturbations between unlearn and retain sets, ensuring that visual data removal doesn't compromise the model's overall performance. This approach addresses the fundamental challenge of maintaining model utility while complying with data removal requests in privacy-sensitive applications.

## Key Results
- Achieves 7.12% accuracy improvement compared to baseline unlearning methods
- Reduces unlearning time to only 7% of the top-accuracy baseline's processing time
- Effectively eliminates visual data influence while maintaining cross-modal knowledge
- Demonstrates superior performance across three different multimodal datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CCU framework works by recognizing that visual data in multimodal systems is particularly vulnerable to privacy leakage due to its rich representational capacity. By employing inverse contrastive learning, the method systematically weakens the visual-semantic connections without disrupting the underlying cross-modal relationships. The dual-set contrastive separation ensures that perturbations remain localized to the visual modality while preserving the structural integrity of other modalities. This targeted approach prevents the cascading degradation that typically occurs when applying conventional unlearning methods to multimodal systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: Needed for understanding how representations are learned and can be manipulated; quick check: verify loss functions use contrastive objectives
- **Multimodal Representation**: Essential for grasping cross-modal dependencies; quick check: ensure framework handles modality-specific and shared representations
- **Inverse Learning**: Critical for understanding how to deliberately weaken learned associations; quick check: confirm inverse objectives are properly formulated
- **Knowledge Retention**: Key for maintaining performance across modalities; quick check: verify semantic consistency metrics are used
- **Structural Stability**: Important for preventing cascading failures; quick check: examine how perturbations are isolated and contained

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Inverse Contrastive Learning -> Cross-modal Knowledge Retention -> Dual-set Contrastive Separation
- **Critical Path**: Visual unlearning through inverse contrastive learning → preservation of non-visual modalities via semantic consistency → structural isolation using dual-set separation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balances complete visual removal against maintaining cross-modal utility; prioritizes privacy while minimizing performance degradation
- **Failure Signatures**: Over-aggressive visual unlearning causing cross-modal collapse; insufficient inverse learning leaving residual visual information
- **First 3 Experiments**: 1) Ablation study on each CCU component's contribution, 2) Cross-modal performance stability test across different modality combinations, 3) Scalability evaluation on larger multimodal datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to only three datasets, raising questions about generalizability
- Lack of comprehensive baseline comparisons makes performance claims difficult to contextualize
- Ambiguous quantification of how well other modalities maintain performance relative to pre-unlearning states

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical feasibility of CCU framework design and core components
- Medium confidence in reported performance improvements due to limited baseline comparisons
- Low confidence in scalability claims for real-world multimodal applications without additional validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the CCU framework across a broader range of multimodal datasets including text-heavy, audio-visual, and sensor fusion scenarios to verify cross-modal generalization claims
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating each component (inverse contrastive learning, semantic consistency preservation, dual-set separation) to quantify their individual contributions to the overall performance gains
3. Perform long-term stability testing to assess whether visual unlearning effects persist over time or degrade with continued model updates and fine-tuning
