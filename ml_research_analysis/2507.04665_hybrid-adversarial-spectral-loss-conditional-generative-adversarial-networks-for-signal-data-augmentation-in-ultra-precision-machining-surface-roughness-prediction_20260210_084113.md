# Hybrid Adversarial Spectral Loss Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Signal Data Augmentation in Ultra-precision Machining Surface Roughness Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.04665
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04665
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposed HAS-CGAN improves 1D force signal generation for ultra-precision machining, reducing prediction error from 31.4% to approximately 9% when combined with traditional ML and deep learning models.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses data scarcity in ultra-precision machining (UPM) surface roughness prediction by proposing HAS-CGAN, a Hybrid Adversarial Spectral Loss Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for signal data augmentation. The method improves 1D force signal generation, particularly for high-frequency signals, by incorporating Fourier-domain spectral loss into the GAN framework. Experimental comparison with four CGAN variants demonstrates HAS-CGAN achieves superior performance, with wavelet coherence exceeding 0.85. When augmented data is combined with machining parameters, prediction accuracy significantly improves across multiple models. Testing with traditional ML (SVR, RF, LSTM) and deep learning approaches (BPNN, 1DCNN, CNN-Transformer) shows that adding 520+ synthetic samples reduces prediction error from 31.4% (original 52 samples) to approximately 9%. The results effectively address the critical challenge of limited training data in UPM roughness prediction.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces HAS-CGAN, a novel architecture that extends traditional CGANs by incorporating Fourier-domain spectral loss to improve high-frequency signal generation. The generator produces 1D force signals conditioned on input parameters, while the discriminator evaluates both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics. The spectral loss component enforces similarity in the frequency domain through Fourier transforms, addressing the limitation of traditional GANs that struggle with high-frequency components. The model generates synthetic force signals that are combined with real machining parameters to augment the training dataset for surface roughness prediction models.

## Key Results
- HAS-CGAN outperforms four CGAN variants with wavelet coherence exceeding 0.85
- Adding 520+ synthetic samples reduces prediction error from 31.4% to approximately 9%
- Performance validated across multiple prediction models: SVR, RF, LSTM, BPNN, 1DCNN, and CNN-Transformer
- Effective solution for data scarcity in ultra-precision machining surface roughness prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HAS-CGAN's effectiveness stems from its dual-domain approach to signal generation. By incorporating spectral loss in the Fourier domain alongside traditional adversarial loss, the model can capture both time-domain patterns and frequency characteristics essential for force signals in ultra-precision machining. This hybrid approach addresses the fundamental limitation of standard GANs that often fail to generate high-frequency components accurately. The conditional architecture ensures generated signals are relevant to specific machining parameters, while the spectral component ensures physical plausibility in the frequency domain where material removal dynamics and cutting forces manifest.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conditional GANs**: Why needed - Generate signals conditioned on specific machining parameters rather than generic samples. Quick check - Verify input conditioning properly influences generated signal characteristics.
- **Fourier-domain spectral loss**: Why needed - Ensure high-frequency components (critical for force signals) are accurately captured. Quick check - Compare frequency spectra of generated vs. real signals using FFT.
- **Wavelet coherence**: Why needed - Quantify similarity between generated and real signals across both time and frequency domains. Quick check - Confirm coherence values exceed 0.85 threshold.
- **Data augmentation in manufacturing**: Why needed - Address critical data scarcity in ultra-precision machining where collecting labeled samples is expensive. Quick check - Validate that augmented data improves prediction accuracy.
- **Multi-model validation**: Why needed - Ensure improvements generalize across different prediction architectures. Quick check - Test augmented data with diverse ML and DL models.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Parameters -> Generator -> Spectral Loss + Adversarial Loss -> Discriminator -> Output Signals
**Critical Path**: The spectral loss computation in the frequency domain represents the critical innovation, as it directly addresses the high-frequency generation challenge that limits traditional GANs.
**Design Tradeoffs**: The spectral loss adds computational overhead but enables high-frequency signal generation; the conditional architecture increases complexity but ensures parameter relevance.
**Failure Signatures**: Poor high-frequency reproduction (visible in frequency spectra), low wavelet coherence scores, or prediction accuracy that doesn't improve with augmentation would indicate failure.
**First Experiments**:
1. Generate signals with HAS-CGAN and baseline CGAN, compare frequency spectra using FFT
2. Compute wavelet coherence between generated and real signals
3. Train baseline prediction models with original data versus augmented data to measure improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused on single manufacturing domain, limiting generalizability to other signal generation applications
- Choice of 520 synthetic samples appears arbitrary without sensitivity analysis on augmentation ratios
- Comparison limited to four CGAN variants without exploring diffusion models or newer GAN architectures
- No investigation of potential overfitting to specific machining conditions or long-term stability of generated signals

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: HAS-CGAN outperforms baseline CGAN variants in 1D force signal generation, supported by quantitative metrics (wavelet coherence > 0.85) and multiple model evaluations
- **Medium confidence**: Adding 520 synthetic samples universally improves prediction accuracy, as this depends on dataset characteristics and may not generalize across different machining scenarios
- **Low confidence**: Spectral loss is the primary driver of performance improvement, as ablation studies are insufficient to isolate this effect from other architectural choices

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of spectral loss versus other architectural components in HAS-CGAN's performance gains
2. Test the approach on diverse manufacturing datasets beyond UPM to assess generalizability across different signal types and domains
3. Perform sensitivity analysis on augmentation ratios to determine optimal synthetic-to-real sample ratios for different prediction model types
