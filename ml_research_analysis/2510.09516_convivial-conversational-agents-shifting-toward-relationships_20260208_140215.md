- The paper argues for designing convivial conversational AI that supports human autonomy, relationships, and community rather than focusing narrowly on automation and scale.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a shift in conversational AI design from automation-focused approaches toward conviviality—supporting human autonomy, relationships, and community. Drawing on Ivan Illich's concept of conviviality and Self-Determination Theory, the authors argue that technology should enhance rather than replace human connections, particularly in relational service contexts like dementia care. The work advocates for participatory design methods and group-level analysis to preserve the tacit benefits of human relationships that may be lost through automation.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual framework rather than a specific technical implementation. It synthesizes existing literature on conviviality, Self-Determination Theory, and participatory design to propose design principles for conversational AI. The authors reference Seah et al. (2022) as an example of convivial CAI design involving voice-assistant mindfulness interventions for dementia caregiver dyads. The proposed method involves stakeholder participation throughout design, individual-level SDT measurement, and qualitative group-level analysis to assess relational impacts.

## Key Results
- Convivial CAI should be designed to support basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) rather than maximize efficiency or scale
- Group-level analysis is essential to detect relational harms invisible to individual metrics
- Participatory design involving patients, carers, and communities increases likelihood of values alignment and autonomy preservation
- Existing convivial CAI examples (e.g., Seah et al. 2022) demonstrate feasibility of relationship-centred approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Designing CAI to support basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) may preserve wellbeing and prevent dehumanisation in relational service contexts.
- Mechanism: SDT-based design → basic psychological need satisfaction → maintained wellbeing and relational quality. The paper proposes that autonomy (willingness, not control), competence (feeling effective), and relatedness (meaningful connection) are mediators of flourishing.
- Core assumption: Need satisfaction at the individual level translates to healthier group-level dynamics. Assumption: SDT measures, validated across cultures, apply to technology-mediated interactions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Paper "proposes grounding design in Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to preserve autonomy, relatedness, and competence."
  - [section] "SDT literature has demonstrated that wellbeing is contingent on the satisfaction of these three basic psychological needs... their essential and mediating role in wellbeing has been empirically demonstrated across domains, cultures and age groups."
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers explore participatory CAI design for wellbeing (e.g., "Challenges and Opportunities for Participatory Design of Conversational Agents for Young People's Wellbeing"), suggesting convergent interest but limited direct validation of SDT mechanisms in CAI specifically.
- Break condition: If SDT instruments (self-report) fail to capture group-level effects, or if autonomy/relatedness trade off against each other in deployment contexts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A systems-level view of human relationships can reveal harms invisible to individual-level analysis.
- Mechanism: Group-level analysis (dyads, families, communities) → detection of relational erosion (e.g., carer disengagement, isolation) → design adjustments that preserve human support networks.
- Core assumption: Harms can emerge at collective levels even when individual metrics appear positive. Assumption: Ethnographic and qualitative methods can surface tacit relational benefits at risk of automation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "While an individual might benefit from using a tool at an immediate practical level, a relationship or a group might suffer; for example, if carers disengage, patients become more isolated, or human support networks dissolve."
  - [section] "Understanding how automation may rewire human relationships requires in-depth understanding of the nuances, dynamics and critical benefits of those relationships."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers focus on individual or task-level outcomes rather than relational/systems-level impacts.
- Break condition: If group-level methods prove impractical at scale, or if stakeholders cannot articulate tacit relational benefits before they are lost.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Participatory, stakeholder-inclusive design increases the likelihood that CAI aligns with community values and preserves autonomy.
- Mechanism: Stakeholder participation throughout design → values alignment + autonomy preservation → convivial outcomes (tolerant coexistence, interdependence).
- Core assumption: Stakeholders can effectively represent relational and community values. Assumption: Participatory processes are feasible within healthcare constraints (time-poor patients, medical trial traditions).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Seah et al. (2022) example: "Experts in dementia and mindfulness, as well as carers and patients, all contributed to the iterative design and evaluation... relationships were centred and participatory methods helped preserve autonomy."
  - [section] "It's hard to imagine how a convivial AI tool could ever be successful without participation from the people whose relationships, values, goals and willingness must be nourished by it."
  - [corpus] "Challenges and Opportunities for Participatory Design of Conversational Agents for Young People's Wellbeing" confirms participatory approaches are actively explored but notes implementation challenges across cultural contexts.
- Break condition: If participation is tokenistic, or if power imbalances (patients vs. clinicians vs. tech developers) distort expressed preferences.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Conviviality (Illich)**
  - Why needed here: This is the paper's normative frame—tools should support "tolerant coexistence," autonomy, and relatedness rather than creating "serfdom." Understanding this distinguishes convivial CAI from purely efficiency-driven automation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Illich contrasts "convivial tools" with "hyperindustrial" or "overefficient" tools that become "master and executioner"?

- Concept: **Self-Determination Theory (SDT) basic psychological needs**
  - Why needed here: SDT provides the empirical grounding and validated instruments the paper proposes for operationalising conviviality. Without this, "autonomy" and "relatedness" remain philosophical rather than measurable.
  - Quick check question: What are the three basic psychological needs in SDT, and how does SDT define "autonomy" (hint: it is not synonymous with independence)?

- Concept: **Relational services vs. transactional services**
  - Why needed here: The paper argues healthcare (e.g., home-based dementia nursing) is a "relational service" where the interaction changes both parties. Treating it as transactional risks eroding unmeasured benefits.
  - Quick check question: Give an example of how a "relational service" differs from a "faceless transaction" in the context of dementia care.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Stakeholder participation layer: Co-design workshops, interviews, cultural probes involving patients, carers, families, community health workers
  - Individual-level measurement: SDT-based instruments (BPN satisfaction/frustration scales) for autonomy, competence, relatedness
  - Group-level analysis: Qualitative frameworks (ethnography, sociology/anthropology methods) to assess dyad/family/community dynamics
  - Conviviality evaluation: Assessment of impacts on coexistence, autonomy, interdependence (currently no standardised measures per paper)
  - Reframing logic: Shift from "automate tasks" → "support human reach" (e.g., community health worker model enhanced by technology, not replaced)

- Critical path:
  1. Map the relational ecosystem (who are the stakeholders, what relationships exist, what tacit benefits are present?)
  2. Engage stakeholders in participatory design to surface values and goals
  3. Design CAI interventions that enhance (not displace) human connections
  4. Evaluate using SDT instruments (individual) + qualitative group-level methods
  5. Iterate based on both individual and relational outcomes

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Scale vs. relational quality: "Scaling engagements" may increase contact counts while reducing relationship depth
  - Individual vs. group analysis: SDT measures are individual self-report; group-level insights require additional qualitative investment
  - Automation vs. augmentation: Full automation may be efficient but risks dehumanisation; augmentation (supporting human reach) preserves relationships but may not achieve same scale

- Failure signatures:
  - Individual metrics improve while carers report disengagement or patients report isolation
  - CAI provides advice that contradicts family/community values, eroding trust
  - Stakeholders describe feeling "managed by" rather than "supported by" the system
  - Filter-bubble or misinformation dynamics emerge in community health contexts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline relational mapping**: Before introducing CAI, conduct ethnographic observation and interviews with a dementia care dyad (patient + carer) to document tacit relational benefits and current communication patterns.
  2. **SDT measurement pilot**: Deploy an existing validated SDT instrument pre/post-CAI interaction to assess changes in autonomy, competence, and relatedness for both patient and carer individually.
  3. **Group-level impact probe**: After CAI deployment, conduct a joint interview with dyad or family unit to identify any shifts in relational dynamics, trust, or division of caregiving labour that individual metrics would miss.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can conviviality be accurately measured at the group or community level?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note they are "not aware of any measures of conviviality in Illich’s terms" and state that existing Self-Determination Theory (SDT) measures rely on individual self-report, failing to assist with group-level analysis.
- Why unresolved: Validated psychological instruments typically focus on individual phenomenology, whereas conviviality requires assessing "tolerant coexistence" and relationships within a collective.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and validation of a qualitative or quantitative framework capable of assessing autonomy and relatedness across dyads, families, or communities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific metrics can assess the system-level side-effects of CAI scaling on human support networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper asks: "What is the impact of such scaling on the richness and quality of human relationships? What are the negative consequences, and can they be prevented?"
- Why unresolved: Current service measures focus on "engagements" (transaction counts) rather than the quality or efficacy of relationships, leaving "social ecosystem harms" invisible.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical data linking the deployment of CAI to changes in the strength, quality, and size of human care networks (e.g., carer disengagement or patient isolation rates).

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can participatory design methods for convivial AI be reconciled with the strict protocols of medical validation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "flexible participatory approaches often go against the medical tradition of lengthy and fixed controlled trials with strict pre-defined quantitative outcomes."
- Why unresolved: There is a methodological tension between the fluid, iterative nature of co-designing for values and the rigid, fixed-outcome requirements of healthcare research.
- What evidence would resolve it: A successful trial of a "convivial" CAI that utilizes a study design satisfying both participatory inclusivity and medical evidence standards.

## Limitations
- No validated group-level conviviality measurement frameworks exist; proposed SDT instruments are individual-level only
- Empirical evidence base is conceptual/theoretical rather than experimental; most cited examples are individual cases rather than comparative studies
- Participatory design feasibility in healthcare contexts (time-poor patients, clinician resistance) remains unproven

## Confidence
- **High**: The conceptual framing of conviviality vs. automation dehumanization (rooted in Illich) and the basic SDT-need-satisfaction → wellbeing mechanism are well-established
- **Medium**: The proposed participatory design approach and reframing from "automate tasks" to "support human reach" have supporting examples but limited empirical validation in CAI contexts
- **Low**: Claims about group-level relational impacts and specific conviviality measures lack empirical foundation or validated instruments

## Next Checks
1. Pilot test the proposed SDT instruments with a small sample of dementia dyads to assess measurement feasibility and initial validity for CAI interactions
2. Conduct comparative analysis of existing CAI systems using individual SDT measures to establish baseline relational quality metrics
3. Design and validate a qualitative group-level analysis framework specifically for assessing conviviality in conversational AI deployments
