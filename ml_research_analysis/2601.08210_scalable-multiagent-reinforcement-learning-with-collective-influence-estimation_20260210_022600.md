# Scalable Multiagent Reinforcement Learning with Collective Influence Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08210
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08210
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: CIEN-SAC achieves centralized-level performance without communication in three-arm cooperative lifting task

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN) for scalable multiagent reinforcement learning in communication-limited environments. The method enables agents to estimate the collective influence of other agents on task objects from local observations, eliminating the need for explicit action information exchange. CIEN is integrated into Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, creating CIEN-SAC algorithm that maintains constant input-output dimensionality regardless of team size. Experimental results on a three-arm collaborative manipulation task show CIEN-SAC achieves performance comparable to centralized SAC while significantly reducing communication requirements. When deployed on a physical robotic platform, CIEN-SAC demonstrates strong robustness against observation noise and outperforms baseline decentralized SAC, validating its practical scalability and real-world deployability in multiagent cooperative scenarios.

## Method Summary
The method proposes a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN) that enables decentralized multiagent coordination without explicit communication. Each agent observes its local state and the task object state, then uses CIEN to estimate the collective influence of all other agents on the task object. This estimated influence is fed into the actor network alongside local observations to inform action selection. The approach is integrated with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, creating CIEN-SAC algorithm. During training, each agent learns its policy independently while the CIEN learns to predict how other agents' actions collectively affect the task object. The method maintains constant network input dimensionality regardless of team size, addressing the scalability challenge in multiagent reinforcement learning.

## Key Results
- CIEN-SAC achieves performance comparable to centralized SAC in three-arm cooperative lifting task without inter-agent communication
- The method demonstrates strong robustness against observation noise when trained with independent noise injection per agent
- CIEN-SAC successfully transfers from simulation to physical robotic platform (three UR5e robots) with consistent performance
- Ablation studies show that CIEN-SAC significantly outperforms baseline decentralized SAC without collective influence estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aggregating teammate influence on a shared task object enables coordination without explicit communication while avoiding dimensionality explosion.
- Mechanism: Instead of estimating each agent's actions individually (which scales as O(n)), CIEN estimates the collective influence c_{-i} = e_ψ(s_o) — a low-dimensional representation of how all other agents jointly affect the task object's state evolution. In the three-arm lifting task, this reduces estimation dimensionality from 6 (two arms' actions) to 2 (disk displacement in x-y plane).
- Core assumption: The collective influence on the task object captures sufficient information about teammate behavior for effective coordination; the task object's state evolution is primarily determined by joint agent actions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states"
  - [section II-A] "This formulation allows a learning agent to consider multiagent interactions without the need for explicit inter-agent communication or extensive opponent modeling"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence — neighbor paper "Multiagent Reinforcement Learning with Neighbor Action Estimation" (same authors) addresses action estimation but uses explicit neighbor modeling rather than collective influence aggregation
- Break condition: If individual agent actions have independent, non-additive effects on the task object that cannot be compressed into a low-dimensional representation, collective influence estimation will lose critical information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Treating collective influence as an additional input to the actor network improves Q-value estimation accuracy under communication constraints.
- Mechanism: The critic network Q_θ(s_i, s_o, a_i, c_{-i}) conditions on the estimated collective influence rather than explicit teammate states/actions. This provides the critic with implicit information about the multiagent interaction context, reducing non-stationarity that would otherwise arise from treating other agents as part of an unmodeled environment.
- Core assumption: The CIEN can learn to accurately predict collective influence from task object dynamics during exploration; the entropy-regularized update (Eq. 6) effectively trains CIEN to approximate teammate policies' aggregate effect.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section II-B] "CIEN-SAC can provide the critic network with more informative inputs even in the complete absence of inter-agent communication, thereby effectively mitigating the non-stationarity inherent in multiagent environments"
  - [section III-B-3] Ablation shows decentralized SAC without CIEN "demonstrates inadequate convergence" while CIEN-SAC achieves performance "comparable to that of centralized SAC"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation — related MARL papers focus on communication protocols or hierarchical structures rather than implicit influence estimation
- Break condition: If the task object's state does not uniquely determine collective influence (multimodal teammate configurations produce identical object dynamics), the CIEN will be unable to disambiguate and provide useful context.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training with observation noise per agent improves robustness for sim-to-real transfer by preventing over-reliance on synchronized observations.
- Mechanism: Independent noise injection during training exposes each agent to heterogeneous state distributions, breaking tight policy coupling that centralized training creates. The stochastic policy (Gaussian with learned variance) naturally accommodates observation uncertainty through its inherent entropy.
- Core assumption: Observation noise in deployment (1cm height, 1° angle error in the vision system) can be adequately modeled by random perturbations during training; policy diversity from decentralized training generalizes to real-world disturbances.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-C-2] "CIEN-SAC achieves a substantially higher average return after approximately 4,000 episodes" with observation noise training
  - [section III-C-2] "Independent noise exposes each robotic arm to a richer and more heterogeneous state distribution during training, preventing the learned policy from over-relying on idealized, synchronized observation patterns"
  - [corpus] No corpus papers address sim-to-real transfer or observation noise in MARL
- Break condition: If real-world noise has systematic biases (e.g., consistent underestimation of disk height) rather than zero-mean random perturbations, training with random noise will not produce robust policies.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: CIEN-SAC inherits SAC's entropy-regularized objective, twin critic architecture, and reparameterization trick. Understanding why SAC uses stochastic policies and entropy terms is essential for interpreting Equations 2-6.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why SAC maximizes entropy alongside expected return, and how the temperature parameter α controls this trade-off?

- Concept: Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE)
  - Why needed here: The paper positions CIEN-SAC against centralized approaches (MADDPG, COMA) and must be understood as an alternative that achieves similar coordination without explicit information sharing during execution.
  - Quick check question: What information is available during training vs. execution in CTDE, and how does CIEN-SAC's information flow differ?

- Concept: Non-stationarity in Multiagent RL
  - Why needed here: The core problem CIEN addresses is that from each agent's perspective, teammate actions appear as non-stationary environment dynamics when communication is unavailable.
  - Quick check question: Why does treating other agents as part of the environment cause convergence issues in independent Q-learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - CIEN (e_ψ) -> Actor (π_φ) -> Environment
  - Twin Critics (Q_θ1, Q_θ2) <- Actor
  - Target networks (soft-updated)

- Critical path:
  1. Observe local state s_i and task object state s_o
  2. Estimate collective influence: c_{-i} = e_ψ(s_o)
  3. Sample action: a_i = tanh(μ_φ(s_i, s_o, c_{-i}) + σ_φ(s_i, s_o, c_{-i}) ⊙ ε)
  4. Execute action, observe reward and next states
  5. Store transition (s_i, s_o, a_i, c_{-i}, r, s_i^next, s_o^next) in replay buffer
  6. Update critics using TD target (Eq. 3), actor via policy gradient (Eq. 5), CIEN via gradient (Eq. 6)
  7. Soft-update target networks (Eq. 7)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **CIEN architecture simplicity vs. expressiveness**: Paper uses shallow network (2 layers, 128 neurons). For more complex collective influence manifolds, deeper architectures may be needed.
  - **Collective influence dimensionality**: Paper uses 2D for the disk task. Choice is task-dependent — too low loses information, too high increases learning difficulty.
  - **Decentralized vs. centralized training**: Paper trains each agent independently. Assumption: shared reward structure naturally induces coordination.

- Failure signatures:
  - **CIEN collapse**: If c_{-i} provides no useful information, performance degrades to independent SAC (see Figure 7). Check by ablating CIEN input.
  - **Non-convergence in 1/10 runs**: Paper reports one failure where policy only reaches 1.3m height. Likely due to exploration challenges without communication.
  - **Sim-to-real gap**: Policies trained without observation noise exhibit "poor performance...causing the gripper to repeatedly squeeze the disk" (Section III-C-2).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline convergence check**: Run centralized SAC on your task to establish upper bound. Verify environment rewards and termination conditions match paper's setup (target height 1.36m, max 200 steps).
  2. **CIEN dimensionality sweep**: Test collective influence dimensions {1, 2, 4, 8} to find minimum sufficient representation for your task. Monitor both final performance and training stability.
  3. **Communication ablation**: Compare (a) full communication centralized SAC, (b) CIEN-SAC without communication, (c) independent SAC without CIEN. Expected ordering: (a) ≈ (b) > (c). If (b) significantly underperforms (a), the task object may not provide sufficient information about teammate influence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the CIEN framework be effectively extended to non-cooperative or mixed-interaction tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion explicitly states future work will focus on "extending the collective influence estimation framework to non-cooperative and mixed-interaction tasks."
- **Why unresolved:** The current formulation models collective influence as a cooperative aggregation on a shared object; adversarial or deceptive behaviors may not manifest as a consistent aggregate signal, potentially causing estimation failures.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful application of CIEN in competitive or mixed-motive benchmarks (e.g., predator-prey or StarCraft micromanagement) showing performance parity with cooperative baselines.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the accuracy of the collective influence estimation degrade as the number of agents scales significantly?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note the need for "investigating its scalability to scenarios involving a greater number of agents," as experiments were limited to three robotic arms.
- **Why unresolved:** While the network input dimension remains constant, the complexity of the "collective influence" function may increase non-linearly with agent count, potentially making the latent signal too noisy or ambiguous for the estimator to decode accurately.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical convergence curves and estimation error metrics from experiments involving dozens of agents (e.g., swarm robotics) demonstrating that performance remains stable as $N$ increases.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can CIEN be adapted for multiagent tasks that lack a single, observable shared task object?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The methodology relies explicitly on inputting the task object state $s_o$ to estimate collective influence $c_{-i}$ (Eq. 1), limiting applicability to object-centric tasks like lifting.
- **Why unresolved:** The architecture assumes a central physical object mediates all inter-agent influences. It is unclear how CIEN would infer teammate influence in object-free scenarios like formation control or coverage tasks without a defined $s_o$.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Modification of the framework to use abstract state features or environment states in place of a specific object, validated on standard object-free MARL benchmarks.

## Limitations

- The paper's core claim that collective influence estimation enables scalable MARL without communication remains theoretically underspecified, particularly regarding when task object states uniquely determine teammate influence
- The 2D collective influence representation appears well-suited to the three-arm lifting task but may not generalize to more complex interaction patterns where individual agent contributions are non-additive or context-dependent
- Claims about CIEN-SAC's general scalability and robustness to observation noise, particularly regarding real-world deployment scenarios beyond the three-arm task, lack comprehensive validation

## Confidence

- **High**: Experimental results showing CIEN-SAC achieves centralized-level performance without communication (Figure 7, ablation study)
- **Medium**: Theoretical framing of collective influence as sufficient for coordination; mechanism of using task object dynamics to infer teammate behavior
- **Low**: Claims about CIEN-SAC's general scalability and robustness to observation noise, particularly regarding real-world deployment scenarios beyond the three-arm task

## Next Checks

1. **Collective influence sufficiency test**: Create synthetic environments where individual agent actions have independent effects on the task object. Measure whether CIEN can distinguish between different teammate configurations that produce identical object states.
2. **Dimensionality sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary collective influence representation dimensions (1, 2, 4, 8) across multiple tasks. Evaluate trade-offs between representational capacity and learning efficiency.
3. **Noise bias characterization**: Replace zero-mean observation noise with systematic biases (e.g., consistent height underestimation). Measure impact on policy performance and identify failure modes in real-world deployment.
