# Inverse Reinforcement Learning using Revealed Preferences and Passive Stochastic Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.04396
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04396
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Presents comprehensive framework for IRL using revealed preferences and passive Langevin dynamics for adaptive learning

## Executive Summary
This monograph presents a comprehensive framework for Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) using revealed preferences from microeconomics and adaptive Langevin dynamics. The approach enables identifying utility functions and strategies of constrained utility maximizers from observed actions, with applications ranging from cognitive radar identification to constrained Markov decision processes. The framework combines classical revealed preference theory with modern stochastic optimization, enabling both offline utility reconstruction and real-time tracking of time-varying utilities through passive observation of forward learners' gradients.

## Method Summary
The methodology centers on three core approaches: (1) Revealed preferences using Afriat's theorem to test for constrained utility maximization and construct set-valued utility estimates from observed actions, (2) Bayesian revealed preference (BRP) extending this to rationally inattentive Bayesian agents through NIAS and NIAC inequalities, and (3) Passive Langevin dynamics algorithms that track time-varying utilities from noisy gradient estimates using kernel-weighted stochastic approximation. The adaptive IRL framework allows real-time learning without specifying where gradients are evaluated, making it suitable for adversarial and multi-agent settings where the IRL agent passively observes forward learners.

## Key Results
- Establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for utility maximization through Afriat's inequalities and GARP generalizations
- Provides algorithms for identifying cognitive behavior in multiagent systems including Pareto-optimal coordination and Nash equilibria
- Introduces passive Langevin dynamics for adaptive IRL with theoretical convergence guarantees
- Demonstrates applications in cognitive radar identification, constrained MDPs, and high-dimensional problems like logistic regression
- Achieves finite-sample analysis for adaptive IRL algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Afriat's Theorem for Revealed Preference Testing
- **Claim:** A finite dataset of actions and constraints is consistent with constrained utility maximization if and only if it satisfies Afriat's inequalities.
- **Mechanism:** Reduces rationality testing to linear feasibility; feasible solutions yield set-valued utility estimates as piecewise-linear concave functions.
- **Core assumption:** Observed agent is a constrained utility maximizer with monotone, nonsatiated utility function.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states uses Afriat's theorem for testing and construction; section 1.1 provides formal theorem statement.
- **Break condition:** Afriat's inequalities have no feasible solution.

### Mechanism 2: Bayesian Revealed Preference (BRP) Test
- **Claim:** Actions of Bayesian agent are consistent with rationally inattentive utility maximization if NIAS and NIAC inequalities have feasible solution.
- **Mechanism:** NIAS ensures optimal action given posterior belief; NIAC ensures optimal information acquisition across environments.
- **Core assumption:** Agent operates in multiple environments with different rewards but identical priors and information costs.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions extension to rationally inattentive Bayesian agents; section 2.1 provides formal BRP test theorem.
- **Break condition:** NIAS and NIAC inequalities have no feasible solution.

### Mechanism 3: Passive Langevin Dynamics for Adaptive IRL
- **Claim:** Passive stochastic gradient algorithm with injected noise asymptotically generates samples from Gibbs distribution proportional to exp(βR(α)).
- **Mechanism:** Combines kernel-weighted gradient estimates with Langevin dynamics update to sample from reward landscape.
- **Core assumption:** Forward learner's step size ε and IRL step size μ satisfy β = ε/μ as fixed constant.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions passive Langevin dynamics for tracking time-varying utilities; section 3.1 provides formal algorithm statement.
- **Break condition:** Kernel bandwidth Δ too large or step size μ not sufficiently small.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Revealed Preference Theory (Afriat's Theorem, GARP)**
  - **Why needed here:** Core of Chapter 1; provides nonparametric test for rationality and utility reconstruction method.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why GARP is both necessary and sufficient for existence of utility function rationalizing finite dataset?

- **Concept: Stochastic Approximation / Weak Convergence Analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for analyzing asymptotic behavior of constant-step-size Langevin IRL algorithm.
  - **Quick check question:** What is difference between almost-sure convergence and weak convergence?

- **Concept: Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) and Bayesian Filtering**
  - **Why needed here:** Framework for Bayesian IRL built on agents operating as Bayesian trackers or stopping-time controllers.
  - **Quick check question:** How does belief state evolve in POMDP and how does it differ from state in fully observable MDP?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Forward Learner (RL agents generating noisy gradients) -> Inverse Learner (IRL algorithm) -> Analyst/Environment (provides probes and observes responses)

- **Critical path:** 1) Collect dataset D = {(probe, response)} or D = {π₀, pₘ(a|x)} 2) Run feasibility test (Afriat's LP or BRP LP) 3) If feasible, reconstruct set-valued utility estimates and predict future responses. For adaptive IRL: Run passive Langevin algorithm online as gradients arrive.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Parametric vs. Nonparametric: Revealed preference methods are nonparametric but yield set-valued estimates; Langevin IRL is also nonparametric but stochastic.
  - Active vs. Passive: Classical IRL often assumes access to optimal actions; here IRL is passive (cannot choose where gradients are evaluated).
  - Offline vs. Adaptive: Chapters 1 and 2 are offline; Chapter 3 enables real-time tracking of time-varying utilities.

- **Failure signatures:**
  1. Infeasibility of Afriat/BRP inequalities suggests agent is not constrained utility maximizer or data is too noisy.
  2. Langevin samples not converging to reward landscape likely due to step size μ too large, kernel bandwidth Δ too large, or insufficient data coverage.
  3. Poor utility reconstruction in noisy settings without statistical detector.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Synthetic Data Validation:** Generate data from known utility function and budget constraint; test if Afriat's theorem correctly identifies rationality and reconstructs utility set containing true utility.
  2. **Cognitive Radar Simulation:** Simulate Kalman-filter-based cognitive radar tracking maneuvering target; collect probe-response pairs and apply spectral revealed preference test to identify radar's utility.
  3. **Adaptive IRL with Simulated Gradients:** Simulate multiple stochastic gradient agents optimizing non-convex reward; feed noisy gradient estimates to passive Langevin IRL algorithm; compare recovered reward landscape to ground truth.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What are finite sample performance bounds for adaptive IRL algorithms based on passive Langevin dynamics?
- **Basis in paper:** Author states plans to add chapter on finite sample analysis of passive Langevin dynamics in contrast to asymptotic analysis.
- **Why unresolved:** Chapter 3 exclusively provides asymptotic analysis via weak convergence without establishing finite-time guarantees.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Theoretical derivation of non-asymptotic convergence rates and error bounds for finite number of samples N.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are convergence properties of systems consisting of multiple cascaded Langevin dynamics and gradient algorithms?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 3.7 states interest in studying convergence properties of multiple cascaded algorithms.
- **Why unresolved:** Current framework analyzes single RL agent feeding single IRL agent in series, not deeper or parallel cascades.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Stability analysis and convergence proofs for architectures where IRL output serves as input or constraint for another learning process.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can adaptive IRL framework be extended to estimate individual utilities when observing gradients from multiple unknown utility functions?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 3.7 notes worth extending algorithms to case where inverse learner observes gradients from multiple utility functions without knowing assignment.
- **Why unresolved:** Current methodology assumes observed gradients correspond to single expected reward function or assignment is known.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Algorithm capable of separating gradient data and reconstructing distinct utility functions, potentially using symmetric polynomial transformations.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can revealed preference and IRL framework be applied to social network analysis to explain sociological phenomena or to Explainable AI (XAI)?
- **Basis in paper:** Summary mentions plans to add chapter on IRL as basis for explainable AI and social network analysis.
- **Why unresolved:** Monograph currently focuses on engineering applications like cognitive radar, not social data or neural network interpretability.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Application of Bayesian IRL or revealed preference tests to large-scale social interaction datasets or deep learning models to extract utility functions rationalizing behavior.

## Limitations
- Revealed preference framework application to complex agents like cognitive radars introduces uncertainties about model misspecification and noise robustness
- BRP test for rationally inattentive agents is novel with limited empirical validation and restrictive behavioral assumptions
- Passive Langevin dynamics algorithm depends critically on kernel bandwidth and step-size ratio which lack universal optimal values
- Paper does not extensively address finite-sample error bounds for adaptive IRL case

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Revealed preference mechanism (Afriat's theorem and GARP) for testing constrained utility maximization - classical result with decades of validation
- **Medium Confidence:** Bayesian revealed preference extension (NIAS/NIAC inequalities) and application to IRL - mathematically rigorous but limited empirical validation
- **Medium Confidence:** Passive Langevin dynamics algorithm for adaptive IRL - theoretical convergence proven under asymptotic conditions but practical implementation details require further validation

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Noise:** Test BRP feasibility solver on synthetic data with varying noise levels to determine breakdown point where inequalities become infeasible due to noise rather than true irrationality.

2. **Finite-Sample Performance:** Implement passive Langevin IRL algorithm and measure empirical KL divergence between estimated and true reward landscapes as function of number of observed gradients, comparing against baseline active IRL method.

3. **Model Misspecification:** For cognitive radar example, simulate radar with utility function violating monotone, concave assumptions; test whether revealed preference test correctly identifies this as irrational or produces misleading set-valued estimates.
