# Improving User Interface Generation Models from Designer Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.16779
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16779
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces a method for improving UI generation models using designer feedback, showing that sketching and revising feedback led to the best model performance, with the sketching-trained model outperforming all tested baselines including GPT-5.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to improve UI generation models by incorporating feedback from professional designers. The authors collected feedback through four interfaces (ranking, commenting, sketching, and revising) on synthetically generated UIs, converting this feedback into preference pairs to fine-tune code generation models. Their experiments demonstrated that designer-aligned feedback interfaces (sketching and revising) produced higher quality data than conventional ranking methods, with the sketching-trained model outperforming all tested baselines including GPT-5. The approach shows that high-quality, expert-aligned feedback can significantly enhance UI generation quality even with relatively small datasets.

## Method Summary
The method involves generating HTML from text prompts using a code LLM (Qwen2.5-Coder), rendering these to screenshots, and collecting designer feedback through specialized interfaces. Feedback is translated into preference pairs and used to fine-tune both a reward model (initialized from UIClip) and the generator model (using ORPO). The system generates 400k synthetic samples, scores them with the reward model, and pairs top vs. random candidates for training. The approach focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, freezing all but the last layer of the reward model to prevent overfitting on the small expert dataset.

## Key Results
- Sketching and revising feedback interfaces produced the highest quality training data with agreement rates of 63.6% and 76.1% respectively, compared to 49.2% for ranking
- The sketching-trained model outperformed all tested baselines including GPT-5 in blind human comparison
- Fine-tuning on a small dataset of high-quality expert pairs (approximately 1,500 examples) yielded better alignment than training on larger volumes of synthetic or lower-quality data
- Designer-aligned feedback interfaces significantly reduced label noise compared to forced-choice ranking methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Workflow Alignment Reduces Label Noise
If feedback interfaces align with natural designer workflows (e.g., direct revision), data quality improves significantly compared to forced-choice ranking. Ranking forces designers to choose between two potentially flawed options, often resulting in near-random preference labels. In contrast, revisions and sketches allow designers to demonstrate a concrete "fix," turning subjective preference into an objective improvement task.

### Mechanism 2: Spatial Grounding Enhances Feedback Locality
If feedback is spatially grounded (sketching), models can localize improvements better than with global natural language comments. Sketching interfaces link textual feedback to specific bounding boxes or points, creating a direct mapping between a visual region and a code snippet, reducing the ambiguity inherent in global comments like "improve hierarchy."

### Mechanism 3: Expert Preference Density
Fine-tuning on a small dataset of high-quality expert pairs yields better alignment than training on larger volumes of synthetic or lower-quality data. The system uses a reward model initialized from UIClip and fine-tunes it on the expert preference pairs, shifting the model's latent space to prioritize "designer-approved" aesthetics over generic syntactic correctness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reward Modeling (RLHF)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a reward model as an intermediary to convert designer feedback (images/edits) into a scalar signal for the code generator
  - Quick check question: How does the margin-based loss function ($s^+ - s_-$) ensure the model prefers the revised UI over the original?

- **Concept: On-Policy Sampling**
  - Why needed here: The initial dataset was generated by the very model intended to be improved, ensuring the training data reflects the model's actual error distribution
  - Quick check question: Why is sampling from the model's own output distribution (on-policy) critical for identifying specific design flaws?

- **Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**
  - Why needed here: The authors freeze all but the last layer of the reward model to prevent overfitting on the small (~1500 samples) expert dataset
  - Quick check question: What indicates overfitting in a reward model trained on sparse preference data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Generator (Code LLM) -> Renderer -> Feedback Interface -> Translator (LLM) -> Preference Pair -> Reward Model -> Generator (ORPO)
- **Critical path:** The path from Designer Edit → Code Translation → Preference Pair. If the "Translator" fails to correctly implement the designer's sketch in code, the resulting preference pair (Original vs. "Improved") will actually be (Original vs. Broken), introducing noise.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Ranking: High velocity (4.8/min), low quality (49% agreement)
  - Revision: Low velocity (3.45 min/each), high quality (76% agreement)
  - Sketch: Balanced (2.7 annotations/screen, 63% agreement)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low Inter-Rater Reliability: If agreement drops near 50%, the feedback mode is too subjective (common in Ranking)
  - Semantic Drift: If the LLM Translator changes the functional content of the UI while fixing the design, the preference pair becomes invalid for training
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation on Feedback Mode: Train identical models using only Ranking vs. only Sketch data to isolate the impact of data quality
  2. Agreement Analysis: Have HCI experts label a subset of generated pairs to verify that "Designer Preferred" correlates with "Human Preferred"
  3. Cross-Model Generalization: Train the Reward Model on Qwen outputs, but use it to fine-tune a different base model (e.g., Qwen3-Coder) to test if the design principles transfer

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does training reward models on professional, high-fidelity design data yield significantly better UI generation performance than training on synthetic, model-generated data?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.3 states, "A future study could investigate the use of more realistic training data consisting of professional designs... and could yield new insights into the real-world feasibility of the approach."
- Why unresolved: The study relied on synthetically generated UIs to control conditions and manage data confidentiality, limiting the validation of the approach on expert-level source material
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study where reward models are trained on a dataset of professional, human-designed UIs versus synthetic ones, evaluated on the same generation benchmarks

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can feedback interfaces be adapted to infer and capture complex interactive properties related to usability and accessibility (e.g., through cognitive walkthroughs)?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.3 notes, "The techniques we used to collect feedback would likely need to be adapted to infer complex interactive properties related to usability and accessibility."
- Why unresolved: Current interfaces focus on visual critiques (sketching/comments) and static revisions, struggling to capture dynamic usability heuristics or accessibility flows
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and testing of novel interfaces that successfully translate interaction logs or cognitive walkthrough methodologies into machine-learnable preference pairs

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the generator model learn to produce functional application logic (e.g., navigation flows, state handling) based on designer feedback, rather than just static UI code?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.3 asks, "The generator module must also learn from this feedback and use it to generate functionality for app navigation and handling interaction (e.g., a login flow)."
- Why unresolved: The current formulation uses a visual language model (CLIP) as a reward model to score single static images, which cannot evaluate multi-step interaction or logic
- What evidence would resolve it: A new training architecture that incorporates interaction design feedback to generate executable application logic, moving beyond single-screen generation

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does designer feedback collected from a specific base model (Qwen) generalize effectively to architectures with significantly different code distributions or design flaw patterns?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.3 acknowledges that testing was limited to the Qwen family, stating, "we acknowledge that this limitation potentially overstates our method's generalizability."
- Why unresolved: Different base models may exhibit distinct distributions of design flaws; it is unclear if a reward model tuned on one model's artifacts transfers effectively to completely different architectures
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the Qwen-derived sketch reward model to distinct model families (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) and measuring the delta in UI generation performance improvement

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of designer feedback interfaces may be specific to UI design tasks and may not generalize to other creative or technical domains where designer expertise is not applicable
- The system depends on an LLM to translate visual feedback into code improvements, and the paper does not provide quantitative error rates for this translation step
- The scalability of this approach to larger, more diverse UI datasets and different base models beyond the tested Qwen2.5-Coder and UIClip variants is uncertain

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Experimental methodology is sound | High |
| Correlation between feedback interface quality and model performance | Medium |
| Scalability to different base models | Low |

## Next Checks
1. **Translation fidelity test:** Conduct a controlled study measuring the accuracy rate of the LLM translator converting sketch/revision feedback into valid code improvements, with human coders verifying the correctness of translated changes
2. **Cross-domain applicability:** Apply the same feedback interface methodology to a non-UI task (e.g., code documentation generation or data visualization) to test whether the observed benefits of workflow-aligned feedback interfaces generalize
3. **Longitudinal performance tracking:** Monitor the performance of models fine-tuned with designer feedback over multiple generations to detect potential reward hacking or degradation in output diversity
