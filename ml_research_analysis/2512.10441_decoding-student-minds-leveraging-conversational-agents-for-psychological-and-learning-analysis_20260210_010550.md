- A multimodal fusion model integrating LLMs, KG-BERT, and affective sensing predicts student psychological states with 86.7% accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a psychologically-aware conversational agent that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), KG-BERT, and multimodal affective sensing to monitor and support students' cognitive and emotional states in real time. The system combines textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends to predict engagement, stress, motivation, and understanding. Evaluated over 8 weeks with 45 students, the multimodal fusion model outperformed text-only and prosody-only baselines, achieving 86.7% accuracy, 0.84 F1-score, and 0.78 Cohen's Kappa. Psychometric assessments showed significant reductions in stress (−19.2%) and anxiety (−16.4%) alongside a 26.2% increase in motivation. Results demonstrate the value of fusing semantic and affective signals for adaptive, student-centered learning interventions.

## Method Summary
The study collected 720 student-agent interactions from 45 undergraduates over 8 weeks, with 70% text and 30% speech data. Text was preprocessed using tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal. Speech features were extracted using openSMILE (pitch, intensity, speech rate, MFCCs, formants). Ground truth labels came from weekly psychometric questionnaires (PSS, STAI, AMS) and consensus from 3 trained TA annotators. The model used Falcon-7B for embeddings combined with KG-BERT for knowledge graph reasoning, then fused these with speech features through a 2-layer BiLSTM (128 hidden units, ReLU, dropout=0.3) with additive attention. Focal Loss (γ=2) addressed class imbalance, and the system was trained with Adam (lr=1e-4), batch size 32, for 20 epochs with 5-fold cross-validation.

## Key Results
- Multimodal fusion achieved 86.7% accuracy, 0.84 F1-score, and 0.78 Cohen's Kappa on psychological state classification
- Psychometric improvements: stress reduced by 19.2%, anxiety by 16.4%, motivation increased by 26.2%
- Fusion model significantly outperformed text-only BERT and prosody-only SVM baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by fusing three complementary information streams: semantic understanding from text (via LLM embeddings and knowledge graph reasoning), affective state detection from speech prosody, and temporal behavioral patterns. KG-BERT enriches text representations with educational domain knowledge about concepts, prerequisites, and misconceptions, while the BiLSTM with attention learns temporal dependencies across interactions. The focal loss mechanism addresses the class imbalance problem where neutral states dominate, allowing the model to better detect rarer negative and positive states.

## Foundational Learning

**BiLSTM with Additive Attention**
- Why needed: Captures sequential dependencies in student interactions and focuses on relevant temporal segments
- Quick check: Verify temporal patterns exist in your data; test with and without attention

**KG-BERT Integration**
- Why needed: Enriches semantic features with educational domain knowledge beyond raw text embeddings
- Quick check: Confirm your knowledge graph contains relevant triples for your educational domain

**Focal Loss (γ=2)**
- Why needed: Addresses class imbalance where neutral states typically outnumber positive/negative states
- Quick check: Monitor per-class precision/recall to ensure minority classes aren't being ignored

**Multimodal Fusion Architecture**
- Why needed: Combines complementary signals (semantic + prosodic + temporal) for robust psychological state detection
- Quick check: Test each modality independently first to confirm each carries predictive signal

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Text/Speech Inputs -> Falcon-7B Embeddings + KG-BERT Reasoning -> BiLSTM Fusion (2 layers, 128 units, ReLU, 0.3 dropout) -> Additive Attention -> Classification

**Critical Path**
Knowledge graph construction and KG-BERT triple scoring → Falcon-7B embedding generation → Multimodal feature concatenation → BiLSTM fusion with attention → Focal Loss training

**Design Tradeoffs**
Knowledge graph integration provides semantic richness but adds computational complexity and requires domain expertise for construction. The 2-layer BiLSTM balances model capacity with training efficiency, while focal loss sacrifices some overall accuracy to improve detection of underrepresented classes.

**Failure Signatures**
- Model predicts only "Neutral" class → Check focal loss implementation and class distribution
- Overfitting to training data → Monitor train/validation loss gap, increase dropout, or add early stopping
- Poor prosody feature quality → Verify openSMILE configuration and audio preprocessing

**First Experiments**
1. Train text-only classifier with BERT embeddings and compare to multimodal baseline
2. Test different focal loss gamma values (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) to optimize class balance
3. Implement knowledge graph with 50-100 educational concept triples and measure performance gain

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Causal Efficacy**
The study lacks a control group, limiting causal interpretation of observed improvements. Without comparison to standard support methods, it's unclear if reductions in anxiety (−16.4%) and increases in motivation (+26.2%) are attributable to the system or external factors like novelty effects.

**Long-term Sustainability**
The 8-week intervention period doesn't capture long-term retention or academic performance. It remains unknown whether immediate improvements in engagement and emotional states translate into lasting behavioral changes or superior performance in subsequent courses.

**Arousal-Valence Disambiguation**
High-arousal positive states (excitement) are occasionally misclassified as stress due to overlapping prosodic signatures. The current architecture struggles to separate valence from arousal when relying primarily on text and speech acoustics, potentially leading to unnecessary interventions during successful learning moments.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (45 students) limits population-level generalizability
- Absence of control group prevents causal attribution of psychometric improvements
- Knowledge graph construction and KG-BERT integration lack detailed specification
- No real-time implementation validation to assess practical deployment readiness

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Multimodal fusion architecture design, superiority over unimodal baselines, and measured psychometric improvements from pre-post surveys.

**Medium confidence:** Specific performance metrics (86.7% accuracy, 0.84 F1, 0.78 Kappa), dependent on exact dataset and KG-BERT implementation details.

**Low confidence:** Practical effectiveness of KG-BERT integration in real-time educational settings, given lack of deployment details and computational complexity.

## Next Checks

1. Implement KG-BERT integration with a publicly available educational knowledge graph to verify whether knowledge-enhanced semantic features improve performance over standalone BERT embeddings.

2. Conduct cross-dataset validation using established multimodal educational datasets to test whether the fusion architecture generalizes beyond the original study population.

3. Perform ablation studies removing KG-BERT and reducing model complexity to determine the minimum viable architecture that maintains the 86.7% accuracy threshold, assessing real-time deployment feasibility.
