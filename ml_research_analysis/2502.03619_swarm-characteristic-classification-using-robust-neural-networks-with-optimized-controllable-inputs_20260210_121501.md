# Swarm Characteristic Classification using Robust Neural Networks with Optimized Controllable Inputs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.03619
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03619
- **Reference count:** 30
- **Primary result:** Robust neural networks trained on enriched datasets with variations in defender numbers, motions, and noise levels achieved 75-94% accuracy with 2-5 defenders (80-50% reduction from baseline).

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of inferring characteristics of autonomous agents in swarm interactions, particularly in military defense contexts. The authors developed a robust neural network classifier by enriching training datasets with variations in defender numbers, defender motions, and measurement noise levels. They also created an optimization framework to determine optimal defender trajectories that maximize classification accuracy while respecting operational constraints. Key results include: (1) robust neural networks trained on enriched datasets showed improved classification accuracy across diverse operational conditions, achieving 75-94% accuracy with 2-5 defenders (an 80-50% reduction from baseline), (2) defender motion optimization framework demonstrated flexibility and effectiveness, achieving near-maximum classification performance (STP = 399 out of 400), and (3) the framework identified minimum defender requirements for specific classification confidence levels. The approach shows potential for resource reduction and enhanced strategic planning in both military and civilian autonomous agent applications.

## Method Summary
The method combines dataset enrichment with trajectory optimization for swarm tactic classification. The authors created diverse datasets by simulating variations in defender numbers (ND = 1-15), defender motions (5 types), and measurement noise levels (0-50). They trained CNN classifiers on these datasets, with robust models combining multiple conditions to improve cross-condition generalization. The trajectory optimization framework uses defender motion to maximize classification performance by formulating an optimal control problem that maximizes the Sum of True Predictions (STP) while satisfying operational constraints like velocity limits, acceleration bounds, and collision avoidance. The framework identifies minimum defender requirements for target classification confidence levels through optimization sweeps across defender counts.

## Key Results
- Robust neural networks trained on enriched datasets showed improved classification accuracy across diverse operational conditions, achieving 75-94% accuracy with 2-5 defenders (an 80-50% reduction from baseline)
- Defender motion optimization framework demonstrated flexibility and effectiveness, achieving near-maximum classification performance (STP = 399 out of 400)
- The framework identified minimum defender requirements for specific classification confidence levels, showing potential for resource reduction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dataset Enrichment Induces Cross-Condition Generalization
Training on combined datasets spanning operational variations improves NN accuracy when deployment conditions differ from any single training condition. Exposure to diverse defender numbers, motions, and noise levels forces the CNN to learn tactic-relevant features that persist across conditions rather than overfitting to condition-specific patterns. The robust NN achieved 75-94% accuracy with 2-5 defenders versus baseline 10 defenders. Core assumption: Tactic signatures in adversary trajectories are condition-invariant; variations primarily affect manifestation, not underlying pattern.

### Mechanism 2: Optimal Control Links Defender Motion to Classification Performance
Defender trajectories can be optimized to elicit adversary responses that maximize NN classification confidence. The framework formulates trajectory optimization as minimizing cost J = -STP(PD), where STP sums the true prediction probabilities across all possible adversary tactics. Defenders are treated as double integrators with velocity/acceleration constraints, operational area boundaries, and collision avoidance. NLP solvers (fmincon) find trajectories that steer adversaries into states where tactic differences are most distinguishable. Core assumption: Adversary motion responds predictably to defender motion according to their employed tactic; NN input-output gradients provide meaningful optimization signal.

### Mechanism 3: Resource Minimization Through Optimized Motion
Optimized defender motion reduces the minimum number of defenders required to achieve a target classification confidence. By running optimization across ND = 1-10 and tracking "Best STP @ ND," planners identify the smallest defender count meeting threshold. The paper demonstrated 50-80% reduction from baseline defender requirements. Core assumption: Optimized motion extracts maximum classification information per defender; marginal benefit of additional defenders diminishes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Time Series Classification with CNNs**
  - Why needed here: Input data are multivariate time series (2D positions × velocities × 20-50 timesteps × 10 adversaries). CNNs extract local temporal patterns indicative of tactics.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a 1D convolution over time captures tactic signatures better than treating each timestep independently?

- **Constrained Nonlinear Optimal Control**
  - Why needed here: Defender trajectories must satisfy kinematic limits (Vmin, Vmax, Amax), operational boundaries, and collision avoidance while maximizing STP.
  - Quick check question: How does a double integrator model constrain the feasible trajectory space?

- **Data Augmentation for Domain Shift**
  - Why needed here: Deployment conditions (defender count, motion, noise) will differ from training. Combined-dataset training simulates this shift.
  - Quick check question: Why does training on high noise levels hurt performance on clean data but help on noisy data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Simulation engine -> Dataset builder -> CNN classifier -> Trajectory optimizer -> Resource estimator
- **Critical path:** 1. Define VOI dimensions (ND, DM, noise levels) -> generate sub-datasets 2. Apply consistent scaling -> combine into enriched dataset 3. Train CNN -> validate on held-out conditions 4. Import trained NN into MATLAB -> define optimization constraints 5. Run trajectory optimization -> extract oSTP and minimum defender requirements
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Dataset size vs. computational cost: Combined DM+ (200K instances) improved optimization but required 10× training data
  - Input length vs. inference speed: 50 timesteps improved noise robustness but increased computation; 20 timesteps used for ND/DM experiments
  - Initial trajectory choice: Star/Semi motions generally yield highest initial STP, but optimal trajectory may differ
- **Failure signatures:**
  - NN overfits to single condition: Accuracy drops sharply when inference ND/DM/noise differs from training
  - Optimization fails to improve STP: Check NN gradient saliency—weak gradients indicate limited optimization leverage
  - STP plateaus despite more defenders: Indicates ND > NA saturation or constrained motion limits information gain
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate ND robustness experiment: Train CNN on Combined ND dataset (ND = 1-15), test on each ND sub-dataset. Verify 75-94% accuracy with 2-5 defenders.
  2. Single-engagement optimization: Pick seed 1202, run fmincon with Star initial trajectory and simple rectangular operational area. Confirm STP improvement from initial to optimized.
  3. Minimum defender sweep: For one engagement, run optimization across ND = 1-10 with all 5 initial motions. Plot "Best STP @ ND" and identify minimum ND for STP ≥ 390.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do optimized defender trajectories derived from a small CNN model generalize to larger, more complex architectures (e.g., Transformers)?
- Basis in paper: The authors state: "Another important direction could compare the performance of other NN models using the optimal defender motion derived from our CNN model... if it is easier or more cost-effective to develop an optimization using a smaller model (e.g CNN), how will the results scale to a larger, potentially more powerful model (e.g. Transformer)?"
- Why unresolved: The optimization framework was developed using only CNN architectures; the transferability of optimized trajectories across different NN architectures remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of STP performance when trajectories optimized for CNN are applied to Transformer-based classifiers on the same swarm scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal trade-offs between investing in dataset enrichment (more training instances) versus deploying the optimization framework online for improved classifier performance?
- Basis in paper: Future work section asks: "evaluating the trade-offs between generating more engagement instances for NN training versus using the optimization framework for improved classifier performance... expressed in terms of training time or computational resources."
- Why unresolved: The study separately demonstrated benefits of enriched datasets and optimization, but did not compare their relative cost-effectiveness or determine optimal allocation of computational resources between them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments measuring classification accuracy per unit of computational cost across different combinations of training data volume and optimization intensity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the framework accommodate variations in the number of adversaries and engagement geometry without requiring architecture changes like masking or basis transformations?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that handling "variations in the number of adversaries... or dataset scaling and basis changes to account for differences in initial swarm separation and engagement geometry" were "beyond the scope of the current study but are acknowledged as important factors for future research."
- Why unresolved: Current NN architecture requires fixed input dimensions; real-world engagements may involve variable numbers of adversaries and different spatial configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and testing of masking/padding techniques or coordinate-invariant representations that maintain classification accuracy across variable adversary counts and geometries.

### Open Question 4
- Question: When should computational requirements remain online (real-time optimization) versus shift offline (pre-computed enriched datasets), particularly for edge computing with SWaP constraints?
- Basis in paper: Authors ask: "understanding when to shift computational requirements offline, such as from optimization to dataset enrichment, versus keeping them online for increased flexibility, could prove valuable, especially when classifiers might be deployed on edge computing devices with size, weight, and power restrictions."
- Why unresolved: The optimization framework requires numerical solving during deployment, which may be prohibitive for resource-constrained platforms; the trade-off boundary remains undefined.
- What evidence would resolve it: Profiling of optimization computational requirements across scenarios, combined with accuracy benchmarks comparing pre-computed vs. real-time optimized defender trajectories on representative edge hardware.

## Limitations
- Core classification mechanism depends on accurate adversary tactic simulation, which is referenced but not detailed in the paper, creating a potential simulation-reality gap.
- Combined-dataset scaling approach assumes that combining training data from all operational conditions preserves tactic-specific features, but this assumption is not empirically validated across all noise and motion variations.
- Resource reduction claims rely on optimization effectiveness that was demonstrated in simulation but not validated in real-world or higher-fidelity environments.

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the fundamental mechanism of dataset enrichment improving cross-condition generalization, supported by clear accuracy improvements in Figure 4 and the STP optimization results in Figure 13.
- **Medium confidence** in the trajectory optimization framework's ability to improve classification performance, as the mechanism is sound but depends on accurate adversary response modeling.
- **Medium confidence** in the resource minimization claims, as the optimization framework shows promise but the minimum defender requirements were determined through simulation sweeps rather than validated across diverse operational scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the single-engagement optimization experiment with multiple random seeds to quantify optimization robustness and verify STP improvements are consistent and not seed-dependent.
2. Test the trained robust CNN on a held-out validation set with operational conditions (ND, DM, noise) that were not present in any training sub-dataset to assess true cross-condition generalization.
3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the scaling parameters used for combining datasets to determine how sensitive the classification performance is to the common scaling approach across diverse operational conditions.
