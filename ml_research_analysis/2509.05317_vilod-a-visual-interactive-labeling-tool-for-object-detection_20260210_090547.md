# VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05317
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317
- Authors: Isac Holm
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Balanced Guidance Integration strategy achieved mAP50-95 of 0.7477, surpassing automated baseline of 0.7348

## Executive Summary
This thesis presents VILOD, a Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection that integrates human expertise with Active Learning through interactive visualizations. The system combines t-SNE projections, uncertainty heatmaps, and model state views to guide users in implementing diverse labeling strategies within an iterative Human-in-the-Loop workflow. The study demonstrates that human-guided sample selection, when effectively supported by interactive visual analytics, can achieve superior performance compared to automated uncertainty sampling approaches.

## Method Summary
VILOD implements an iterative Human-in-the-Loop workflow where users label samples, the model is fine-tuned, and uncertainty heatmaps are generated for the next iteration. The tool provides three visualization panels: a t-SNE projection for exploring sample distribution and clustering, an uncertainty heatmap showing the model's confidence across samples, and a model state view displaying loss and performance metrics. Three visually-guided labeling strategies were evaluated against an automated baseline: Exploration & Structure Focus (emphasizing t-SNE), Uncertainty-Driven Focus (emphasizing heatmap), and Balanced Guidance Integration (synthesizing all available cues).

## Key Results
- Balanced Guidance Integration strategy achieved the highest final model performance with mAP50-95 of 0.7477
- This surpassed the automated uncertainty sampling baseline (mAP50-95: 0.7348) by 1.29 percentage points
- The study validated that human-guided sample selection can outperform purely automated approaches when supported by effective visual analytics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from combining multiple complementary visual cues that help users make informed decisions about which samples to label. The t-SNE projection reveals the underlying structure and diversity of the dataset, the uncertainty heatmap highlights samples where the model is most uncertain, and the performance metrics track model improvement over time. This multi-faceted approach allows users to balance exploration of new data regions with exploitation of high-uncertainty areas, leading to more efficient learning than single-criterion approaches.

## Foundational Learning

- **t-SNE dimensionality reduction**: Visualizes high-dimensional data in 2D while preserving local structure; needed for understanding sample distribution and identifying clusters
  - Quick check: Verify t-SNE preserves local neighborhoods by examining sample similarity in projection

- **Active Learning uncertainty sampling**: Selects samples where the model has lowest confidence for labeling; needed as the core selection mechanism
  - Quick check: Compare uncertainty distribution before and after labeling to ensure meaningful selection

- **Human-in-the-Loop iterative workflow**: Alternates between user labeling and model training; needed for incorporating human expertise
  - Quick check: Track performance improvement across iterations to verify learning is occurring

- **Object detection metrics (mAP)**: Measures detection accuracy across multiple IoU thresholds; needed for quantitative performance evaluation
  - Quick check: Validate metric calculations against ground truth annotations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data samples -> t-SNE projection -> Uncertainty heatmap -> Model training -> Performance metrics -> User interface

**Critical path**: User labels samples → Model fine-tunes on new labels → Uncertainty scores computed → Heatmap and metrics updated → Visualizations refresh

**Design tradeoffs**: Static pre-trained embeddings vs. dynamic model-updated embeddings (static chosen for stability but may limit long-term effectiveness)

**Failure signatures**: 
- Poor t-SNE clustering suggests feature extraction issues or inappropriate perplexity settings
- Uncertainty heatmap showing uniform distribution indicates model confidence saturation
- Performance plateau despite labeling suggests exploration strategy needs adjustment

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test t-SNE visualization with known clustering ground truth to verify proper dimensionality reduction
2. Validate uncertainty sampling by checking if selected samples actually reduce overall model uncertainty
3. Compare labeling efficiency between visual guidance and random sampling on small subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does VILOD perform across a diverse population of users compared to the single-user evaluation presented in this study?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.2 calls for "broader user studies with multiple participants of varying expertise levels" to assess usability comprehensively
- Why unresolved: The thesis relied on the author acting as the sole expert user, which introduces subjectivity and limits the statistical power and generalizability of the findings
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled user study with a statistically significant number of external participants to validate performance gains and usability

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of integrating diversity or representativeness-based Active Learning strategies into VILOD compared to the current uncertainty-only approach?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.2 identifies the "integration of more diverse and sophisticated AL query strategies" as a key area for future development
- Why unresolved: The current system's inherent suggestions are limited to uncertainty sampling, potentially missing informative samples that require diversity-based metrics
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing hybrid AL metrics (e.g., uncertainty combined with diversity) within the tool and comparing user selections and model convergence rates

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do dynamic, model-updated embeddings improve user decision-making compared to the static pre-trained embeddings used in the current VILOD implementation?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.2 suggests examining "the impact of updating the view based on reduced embeddings from the newly trained models each iteration"
- Why unresolved: The current t-SNE view relies on static features from the base model, which may not accurately reflect the fine-tuned model's evolving feature space
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of user labeling strategies and final model performance when using static vs. dynamic dimensionality reduction visualizations

## Limitations
- Performance improvements may not generalize across different object detection datasets and model architectures
- Study did not report on user experience metrics or cognitive load during interaction
- Limited to uncertainty-based Active Learning without exploring diversity or representativeness strategies

## Confidence
- High: VILOD provides effective visual guidance through t-SNE projections and uncertainty heatmaps
- Medium: Balanced Guidance Integration strategy achieves superior performance
- Low: Claims about quality control benefits and strategic depth lack empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset experiments using VILOD with multiple object detection architectures to verify performance consistency
2. Implement user studies measuring annotation time, cognitive load, and satisfaction across different visual guidance strategies
3. Compare VILOD's performance against state-of-the-art active learning methods on benchmark object detection datasets
