# VeRecycle: Reclaiming Guarantees from Probabilistic Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems after Change

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.14001
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14001
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Reduces certification update costs by up to three orders of magnitude after localized dynamics changes while maintaining valid probabilistic guarantees.

## Executive Summary
VeRecycle addresses the challenge of updating probabilistic reach-avoid certificates for neural-controlled stochastic dynamical systems after localized dynamics changes. Rather than re-certifying the entire system—a computationally expensive process—VeRecycle exploits a theoretical connection between the maximum reclaimable probability threshold and the infimum of the original certificate over the changed state subset. This enables efficient reclamation of guarantees by analyzing only the affected states. The framework uses interval bound propagation to efficiently approximate the certificate's infimum over changed regions, providing sound (though potentially conservative) thresholds. Experimental evaluation on the Stochastic Nine Rooms benchmark demonstrates that VeRecycle maintains competitive probabilistic guarantees while achieving significant computational savings compared to complete re-certification.

## Method Summary
The framework takes as input a neural certificate C, original threshold ρ, and changed states X?. It computes the maximum reclaimable probability threshold ρ̃ that remains valid for any alternative dynamics in X?. The core algorithm uses interval bound propagation (IBP) to approximate inf{C(X?)}, then applies the theoretical formula ρ̃=min(ρ,1−1/I⁻) where I⁻ is the IBP lower bound. For compositional control, it updates edge costs in a task graph and uses shortest-path search to find the optimal policy path. The method was implemented on the Stochastic Nine Rooms environment with specific dynamics, disturbance models, and neural network training procedures using PPO and a learner-verifier loop.

## Key Results
- Reduces computational costs by up to three orders of magnitude compared to complete re-certification
- Achieves global probability thresholds of 0.33 or higher even after changes to multiple rooms
- Enables reuse of unaffected policies in compositional control scenarios
- Provides sound guarantees for any realization of dynamics in the changed region

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** If the infimum of a certificate over changed states is sufficiently high (≥ 1), a valid probabilistic threshold can be reclaimed purely by bounding this value, rather than synthesizing a new certificate.
- **Mechanism:** The approach exploits the semantics of reach-avoid certificates where high certificate values correlate with lower visitation probability. By calculating the minimum value the certificate takes over the changed region X?, VeRecycle determines the maximum probability mass that could be "lost" or "absorbed" in that region. Theorem 1 establishes that the new threshold ρ̃ is exactly min(ρ, 1 - 1/inf{C(X?)}).
- **Core assumption:** The system dynamics change only within a known subset of the state space X?, and the certificate C remains valid for the unchanged dynamics outside this set.
- **Break condition:** If inf{C(X?)} < 1, no reclaimable threshold exists because the system could effectively get "stuck" in the changed region with non-trivial probability, invalidating the reach-avoid guarantee.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) can approximate the certificate's infimum over X? efficiently, providing sound (though potentially conservative) thresholds without expensive optimization.
- **Mechanism:** Because exact infimum computation for neural networks is difficult, VeRecycle uses IBP to compute lower and upper bounds (I⁻, I⁺) on the certificate's output over the region. Plugging the lower bound I⁻ into the threshold formula guarantees a valid probability threshold (soundness), even if it is lower than the theoretical maximum.
- **Core assumption:** The neural certificate is amenable to bounding via IBP (i.e., Lipschitz continuous or piecewise linear properties allow sound interval propagation).
- **Break condition:** If the IBP bounds are too loose (too conservative), the resulting guaranteed threshold ρ̃⁻ might be trivially low (e.g., close to 0), rendering the certificate practically useless even if a valid threshold theoretically exists.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** In compositional control, VeRecycle enables the reuse of unaffected sub-component policies by treating the global policy update as a shortest-path search on a graph of updated costs.
- **Mechanism:** The framework evaluates every edge (sub-task) in the task decomposition graph. It updates the "cost" (negative log of the reclaimed probability) for edges affected by the change. It then uses a shortest-path solver to find a new path that maximizes the global probability product, implicitly discarding paths compromised by the dynamics change.
- **Core assumption:** The global task can be decomposed into a directed graph of sub-tasks where probabilities multiply along a path.
- **Break condition:** If the dynamics change occurs in a bottleneck (cut vertex) of the graph such that all valid paths must cross the affected region with a significantly degraded threshold, the global probability might drop below the required specification.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reach-Avoid Certification (Supermartingales)**
  - **Why needed here:** VeRecycle manipulates these certificates. You must understand that a valid certificate must decrease in expectation (or stay above a safety bound) to guarantee the system reaches a target while avoiding unsafe states.
  - **Quick check question:** If a certificate C does not decrease in expectation in state x, what condition must C(x) satisfy to prevent a violation? (Answer: It must be high enough to imply the state is rarely visited or effectively safe).

- **Concept: Interval Bound Propagation (IBP)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the compute engine for VeRecycle. You need to distinguish between evaluating a network at a point vs. propagating a set (interval) through the network to find output bounds.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does using a mesh (splitting X? into smaller intervals) generally improve the tightness of the bounds? (Answer: Linear approximations or interval arithmetic are typically tighter over smaller input domains).

- **Concept: Compositional Verification**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand how local guarantees (edges) compose into global guarantees.
  - **Quick check question:** If the probability of safety for sub-task A is 0.9 and sub-task B is 0.8, and they must be executed sequentially, what is the approximate probability of success for the combined task? (Answer: 0.9 × 0.8 = 0.72).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Mesh Generator -> IBP Engine -> Threshold Calculator -> Compositional Solver (optional)
- **Critical path:** The efficiency gain relies on the IBP Engine being orders of magnitude faster than the counter-example guided synthesis (CEGIS) loop used in baseline re-certification.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Mesh Granularity vs. Speed: A finer mesh for IBP yields a tighter (higher) reclaimed threshold but increases linear algebra operations.
  - Generality vs. Tightness: VeRecycle provides a threshold valid for any realization of dynamics in X?. If you knew the specific new dynamics, you might get a better threshold, but VeRecycle trades that optimality for robustness to unknown changes.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - The "Zero-Drop": Reclaimed threshold collapses to 0. This occurs if inf{C(X?)} ≈ 1, implying the changed region intersects a critical area for the original certificate.
  - Conservative Loops: The algorithm iterates endlessly refining the mesh without significant threshold improvement (diminishing returns).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Comparison (Single Room): Isolate one room in the "Nine Rooms" benchmark. Run VeRecycle vs. full re-certification (B-III). Verify that VeRecycle runs in <1s while B-III takes >100s, and check the gap between the reclaimed and re-certified thresholds.
  2. Sensitivity to X? Location: Move X? from near the target to near the initial position. Measure the drop in ρ̃. This validates the intuition that changes near the start have a different impact than changes near the goal.
  3. Compositional Rerouting: Block a specific corridor (edge) in the graph. Confirm that the Compositional Solver (Algorithm 1) successfully finds the alternative path with the highest global probability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can VeRecycle's theoretical foundations be extended to continuous-time stochastic systems?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states plans to extend the framework to "probabilistic neural certificates for continuous-time systems."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current mathematical justification relies on discrete-time definitions of supermartingales and reach-avoid certificates.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A formal proof of the reclaimable threshold for continuous-time dynamics or an algorithmic implementation verified on a continuous benchmark.

- **Question:** How can certificate synthesis be optimized to maximize reclaimable guarantees?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors aim to "explore how the certificate learning process can be optimized to maximize the guarantees reclaimed with VeRecycle."
  - **Why unresolved:** Standard learners often produce "loose" certificates with low infima in changed regions, degrading the reclaimed threshold.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A training method producing certificates that consistently yield higher ρ̃ after localized changes compared to baselines.

- **Question:** Can VeRecycle effectively guide active learning for new system dynamics?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper suggests using VeRecycle to "pinpoint crucial states for which new dynamics must be learned" in synergy with learning-enabled certification.
  - **Why unresolved:** The mapping from certificate infima to specific data requirements for model correction is currently undefined.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** An algorithm using VeRecycle's output to direct sampling for system identification, demonstrating improved efficiency in model updates.

## Limitations
- Framework effectiveness depends heavily on certificate quality over changed regions—loose certificates degrade reclaimed guarantees
- IBP approximations introduce conservatism that may significantly reduce practical thresholds
- Theoretical foundation assumes deterministic changes within X?, which may not hold for real-world uncertainties
- Compositional approach may fail if changed region affects all possible paths, requiring complete re-certification

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The computational speedup claim (3 orders of magnitude) is well-supported by experimental setup comparing VeRecycle against complete re-certification baselines.
- **Medium Confidence:** The theoretical connection between inf{C(X?)} and reclaimable thresholds is sound, but practical IBP approximations may yield conservative results not captured in theoretical analysis.
- **Low Confidence:** Framework performance on systems with continuous state spaces beyond Nine Rooms benchmark, or with different disturbance distributions, remains unverified.

## Next Checks
1. **IBP Bound Tightness Analysis:** Systematically evaluate how mesh refinement granularity affects the reclaimed threshold across different certificate architectures and changed region sizes.
2. **Cross-Environment Generalization:** Apply VeRecycle to a continuous control benchmark (e.g., OpenAI Gym's CartPole or LunarLander) to test performance beyond the discrete grid world.
3. **Robustness to Uncertainty:** Introduce probabilistic uncertainty models for the changed dynamics (e.g., Bayesian uncertainty over parameters in X?) and evaluate whether VeRecycle's deterministic threshold still provides meaningful guarantees.
