# HTG-GCL: Leveraging Hierarchical Topological Granularity from Cellular Complexes for Graph Contrastive Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.02073
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02073
- Reference count: 14
- HTG-GCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on TU datasets, with average rank 1.0 and significant improvements over baselines

## Executive Summary
HTG-GCL addresses the fundamental limitation of fixed-granularity graph contrastive learning by introducing a novel framework that leverages hierarchical topological granularity through multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes. The method transforms graphs into diverse topological views at different ring scales, capturing complementary structural information that traditional approaches miss. By incorporating a multi-granularity decoupled contrastive learning strategy with granularity-specific weighting based on uncertainty estimation, HTG-GCL enables the model to focus on reliable topological patterns while suppressing misleading ones. Comprehensive experiments on six TU datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant statistical improvements and an average rank of 1.0 across both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

## Method Summary
The HTG-GCL framework introduces a novel approach to graph contrastive learning by leveraging hierarchical topological granularity through multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes. The method first constructs cellular complexes from input graphs at multiple ring scales, creating diverse topological views that capture different levels of structural information. A multi-granularity decoupled contrastive learning strategy is then employed, where each topological view is processed independently before being integrated through an uncertainty-based weighting mechanism. The uncertainty estimation component evaluates the reliability of topological patterns at each scale, allowing the model to adaptively emphasize more trustworthy structural information while suppressing potentially misleading patterns. This hierarchical approach enables the capture of rich, multi-scale topological features that are typically missed by traditional fixed-granularity methods.

## Key Results
- HTG-GCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on six TU datasets with an average rank of 1.0 across unsupervised and semi-supervised settings
- Outperforms CellCLAT by 1.3% on NCI1 dataset (80.7% vs 79.4%)
- Demonstrates strongly statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) on most tested datasets
- Shows consistent superiority over traditional fixed-granularity methods and other cellular complex-based approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HTG-GCL works by addressing the fundamental limitation of fixed-granularity graph contrastive learning through hierarchical topological processing. By constructing cellular complexes at multiple ring scales, the method captures structural information at different levels of abstraction, from local connectivity patterns to global topological features. The multi-granularity decoupled learning strategy allows each topological view to be processed independently, preserving the unique characteristics of different structural scales. The uncertainty-based weighting mechanism then intelligently combines these views by emphasizing reliable patterns and suppressing misleading ones, resulting in more robust and informative graph representations. This approach effectively overcomes the trade-off between local and global feature capture that plagues traditional methods, leading to superior performance across diverse graph learning tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Graph -> Multi-scale Ring-based Cellular Complex Construction -> Individual Topological View Processing -> Uncertainty Estimation -> Weighted Integration -> Graph Representations

**Critical Path**: The critical execution path involves first constructing cellular complexes at multiple ring scales, then independently processing each topological view through the graph encoder, estimating uncertainty for each view, and finally integrating the weighted representations for downstream tasks.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for richer feature extraction by processing multiple topological views. While this increases processing time and memory requirements, it enables capture of hierarchical structural information that single-scale methods miss. The uncertainty-based weighting mechanism adds complexity but provides robustness against unreliable topological patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when the graph structure is too simple (cellular complexes add little value) or when uncertainty estimation fails to properly distinguish reliable from unreliable patterns. Computational bottlenecks can arise with very large graphs due to the multi-scale processing requirement.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test on synthetic graphs with known hierarchical structure to verify topological feature capture, 2) Perform ablation study removing the uncertainty weighting to quantify its contribution, 3) Evaluate performance degradation on datasets with progressively simpler topological structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the research naturally raises several important directions for future work, including evaluation on diverse graph domains beyond chemical structures, investigation of computational scalability for larger graphs, and exploration of alternative uncertainty estimation methods.

## Limitations
- Performance generalizability remains uncertain for graph domains beyond the six TU chemical datasets tested
- Computational complexity and overhead of multi-scale topological processing may limit scalability for large graphs

1. Evaluate HTG-GCL on diverse graph datasets beyond TU collections, including social networks, biological interaction networks, and citation networks, to assess domain generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the cellular complex construction, multi-granularity contrastive learning, and uncertainty-based weighting components
3. Perform computational complexity analysis and runtime benchmarking against baseline methods to evaluate scalability for large graphs and datasets
