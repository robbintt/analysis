# AR-MAP: Are Autoregressive Large Language Models Implicit Teachers for Diffusion Large Language Models?
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.02178
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02178
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves competitive or superior performance compared to DLLM-specific alignment methods with 69.08% average score across all tasks and models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AR-MAP, a transfer learning framework that leverages preference-aligned autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs) as implicit teachers for aligning diffusion large language models (DLLMs). The method exploits the shared architectural structure between AR-LLMs and DLLMs by computing task vectors from fine-tuned weight differences and scaling them according to reward modeling fit. This approach circumvents the high variance and computational overhead of direct DLLM alignment. Comprehensive experiments across six diverse preference alignment tasks demonstrate that AR-MAP achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing DLLM-specific alignment methods.

## Method Summary
AR-MAP operates by fine-tuning AR-LLMs on preference alignment tasks, then extracting task vectors that represent the weight differences between base and fine-tuned models. These task vectors are scaled according to reward modeling fit and transferred to DLLMs through a weight mapping relationship. The framework assumes that weight differences from AR-LLMs can be directly transferred to DLLMs, enabling efficient alignment through simple weight transfer. A reward-based search algorithm determines optimal scaling factors for the transferred weights.

## Key Results
- AR-MAP achieves an average score of 69.08% across all tasks and models
- Performance is competitive or superior to existing DLLM-specific alignment methods
- Framework demonstrates effectiveness across six diverse preference alignment tasks
- Shows potential for generalization to other model merging approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the shared architectural structure between AR-LLMs and DLLMs, using the preference alignment capabilities of AR-LLMs as implicit teachers. By computing task vectors from fine-tuned weight differences and scaling them according to reward modeling fit, AR-MAP transfers alignment knowledge efficiently between architectures. This approach exploits the similarity in transformer-based architectures while avoiding the high variance and computational costs of direct DLLM alignment.

## Foundational Learning
- Transformer Architecture: Understanding self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks in both AR-LLMs and DLLMs
  - Why needed: The shared architecture enables weight mapping between models
  - Quick check: Verify both models use similar attention patterns and positional encoding

- Preference Alignment: Techniques for fine-tuning language models using human preferences or reward models
  - Why needed: AR-LLMs serve as teachers through their preference alignment capabilities
  - Quick check: Ensure reward models are properly trained and validated

- Model Merging: Methods for combining parameters from different models while maintaining performance
  - Why needed: Task vectors from AR-LLMs need to be integrated into DLLMs
  - Quick check: Verify merged models retain basic functionality before alignment

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: AR-LLM fine-tuning -> Task vector extraction -> Reward-based scaling -> DLLM weight transfer -> Aligned DLLM

Critical path: Base AR-LLM → Fine-tuning on preference tasks → Compute weight differences → Scale by reward model → Transfer to DLLM → Evaluate alignment

Design tradeoffs:
- Uses existing AR-LLM infrastructure rather than building new alignment pipelines
- Assumes architectural similarity is sufficient for effective weight transfer
- Balances computational efficiency against potential alignment fidelity loss

Failure signatures:
- Poor reward model performance leading to incorrect scaling factors
- Architectural differences causing weight transfer to fail
- Insufficient fine-tuning of AR-LLMs resulting in weak teacher signals

First experiments to run:
1. Fine-tune AR-LLM on a single preference alignment task and verify improvement
2. Extract task vectors and test scaling on a held-out validation set
3. Perform small-scale weight transfer to DLLM and check basic functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes weight differences from AR-LLMs can be directly transferred to DLLMs, but underlying reasons for this mapping's effectiveness remain unclear
- Limited testing to six preference alignment tasks raises questions about generalization to other alignment objectives
- Computational efficiency gains over direct DLLM alignment are stated but not quantified in detail
- Reward-based search algorithm lacks thorough analysis of robustness across different reward models

## Confidence
High: Empirical results showing AR-MAP achieves competitive or superior performance compared to DLLM-specific alignment methods are well-supported by experimental data across multiple tasks and models.

Medium: The assertion that AR-MAP circumvents high variance and computational overhead of direct DLLM alignment relies on unstated baseline comparisons. Generalization claim to other model merging approaches is supported but not extensively validated.

Low: The broader applicability claim for bridging autoregressive and diffusion architectures across diverse domains is based on limited task diversity and may not extend to more complex or specialized alignment scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the reward-based scaling factor to quantify its contribution to performance improvements.
2. Test AR-MAP on non-preference alignment tasks such as factual consistency or task-specific instruction following to assess domain generalization.
3. Implement and compare AR-MAP against direct fine-tuning baselines on identical hardware to provide concrete computational efficiency metrics.
