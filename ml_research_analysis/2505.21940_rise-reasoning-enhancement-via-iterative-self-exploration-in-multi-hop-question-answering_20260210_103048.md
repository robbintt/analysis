# RISE: Reasoning Enhancement via Iterative Self-Exploration in Multi-hop Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.21940
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21940
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Achieves consistent accuracy gains across iterations in multi-hop question answering through iterative self-exploration

## Executive Summary
RISE introduces a novel approach to multi-hop question answering that combines retrieval-augmented generation with iterative self-exploration. The method systematically breaks down complex questions into sub-questions, retrieves relevant evidence, and employs a self-critique mechanism to refine reasoning paths. Through multi-objective training across question decomposition, retrieval-then-read, and self-critique tasks, RISE demonstrates significant improvements in reasoning accuracy without requiring manual supervision. The approach shows robust performance across multiple benchmarks and addresses the challenge of maintaining reasoning accuracy in complex question-answering scenarios.

## Method Summary
RISE tackles multi-hop question answering by integrating retrieval-augmented generation with iterative self-exploration. The core mechanism involves repeatedly decomposing questions into sub-questions, retrieving evidence for each component, and critiquing the reasoning path to identify and correct errors. The system employs multi-objective training across three key tasks: question decomposition, retrieval-then-read, and self-critique. This training enables continuous improvement in reasoning accuracy without manual supervision. The iterative nature allows the system to refine answers progressively, with each cycle building upon the previous one to enhance overall reasoning quality.

## Key Results
- Consistent accuracy gains across iterations on multiple benchmarks
- Notable improvements in complex reasoning tasks compared to baseline methods
- Demonstrates both robustness and efficiency in handling multi-hop questions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RISE's effectiveness stems from its iterative refinement process that combines decomposition, retrieval, and self-critique. By breaking complex questions into manageable sub-questions, the system can focus on individual reasoning steps while maintaining overall coherence. The retrieval component ensures access to relevant evidence, while the self-critique mechanism identifies and corrects reasoning errors. The multi-objective training framework allows the system to learn from its own reasoning patterns, continuously improving through synthetic data generated during self-exploration.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: Breaking complex questions into sequential reasoning steps - needed to handle questions requiring multiple inference steps; quick check: ability to correctly answer questions requiring 3+ reasoning hops
- **Retrieval-augmented generation**: Combining information retrieval with text generation - needed to access external knowledge during reasoning; quick check: retrieval of relevant documents for sub-questions
- **Iterative refinement**: Progressive improvement through multiple reasoning cycles - needed to correct errors and improve answer quality; quick check: accuracy improvement across iterations
- **Self-critique mechanisms**: Evaluating and improving one's own reasoning - needed for error detection and correction without external supervision; quick check: ability to identify and correct reasoning flaws
- **Multi-objective training**: Simultaneous optimization across related tasks - needed to balance decomposition, retrieval, and critique capabilities; quick check: performance on each training objective

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Question Decomposition -> Evidence Retrieval -> Answer Generation -> Self-Critique -> Refined Decomposition

**Critical Path**: The system processes questions through decomposition into sub-questions, retrieves evidence for each, generates intermediate answers, and applies self-critique to refine the reasoning path. This cycle repeats iteratively, with each pass potentially improving accuracy.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach balances computational overhead from multiple iterations against accuracy gains. The multi-objective training framework trades off specialized optimization for each task against holistic reasoning improvement. The self-critique mechanism adds computational cost but enables unsupervised error correction.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Early iteration errors propagating through subsequent cycles
- Retrieval failures leading to incorrect evidence for sub-questions
- Self-critique mechanism missing critical reasoning flaws
- Computational bottlenecks during iterative processing

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate accuracy improvement across iteration counts on a standard multi-hop benchmark
2. Test retrieval quality for sub-questions generated during decomposition
3. Measure self-critique effectiveness by comparing error detection rates with and without the critique mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability challenges with longer reasoning chains or complex knowledge graphs
- Potential bias or error propagation from synthetic data in multi-objective training
- Unclear performance on real-world noisy or adversarial questions
- Computational overhead may limit deployment in resource-constrained environments

## Confidence
- **Iterative self-exploration improving reasoning accuracy**: High
- **Multi-objective training effectiveness**: Medium
- **Robustness compared to existing methods**: Medium
- **Efficiency of the approach**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Systematically track error propagation across multiple chain lengths to understand how early iteration errors affect later reasoning outcomes
2. Benchmark resource utilization including memory usage, inference time, and computational overhead across different iteration counts
3. Evaluate performance on noisy, adversarial, or out-of-distribution questions to test real-world generalization
