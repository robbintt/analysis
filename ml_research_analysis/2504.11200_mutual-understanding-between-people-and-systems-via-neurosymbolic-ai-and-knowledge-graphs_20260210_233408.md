# Mutual Understanding between People and Systems via Neurosymbolic AI and Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.11200
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11200
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Neurosymbolic AI can advance mutual understanding between humans, systems, and robots by combining symbolic knowledge representation with neural learning across sharing, exchanging, and governing knowledge dimensions.

## Executive Summary
This chapter analyzes how neurosymbolic AI and knowledge graphs enable mutual understanding between humans, artificial systems, and robots. It identifies three key dimensions: sharing knowledge (aligning conceptual models), exchanging knowledge (enabling meaningful communication), and governing knowledge (establishing rules and processes). Through six case studies spanning human data collection, knowledge extraction, interoperability, reproducibility, spatio-temporal modeling, and hybrid reasoning, the analysis shows that while symbolic approaches excel at sharing and governing knowledge, neural approaches are stronger for knowledge exchange. The synthesis reveals that neurosymbolic AI holds particular promise for advancing all three dimensions by combining bottom-up pattern recognition with top-down semantic reasoning.

## Method Summary
The chapter analyzes six case studies demonstrating neurosymbolic AI applications for mutual understanding. The method involves reviewing technical implementations that integrate neural perception/extraction with symbolic reasoning and knowledge graphs. Case studies cover semantic mapping for robotics, human computation pipelines, knowledge graph extraction from unstructured data, FAIR data principles implementation, spatio-temporal understanding, and hybrid reasoning systems. The analysis synthesizes these implementations to evaluate how neurosymbolic approaches address the three dimensions of mutual understanding, with particular attention to the HanS robot system as a comprehensive example of bidirectional neurosymbolic processing.

## Key Results
- Knowledge graphs serve as shared representational substrates that ground neural observations in human-interpretable symbols
- Three-dimensional framework (sharing, exchanging, governing knowledge) provides structure for analyzing mutual understanding challenges
- Hybrid human-machine processing pipelines enable optimal task routing based on accuracy requirements and cost constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Knowledge Graphs as Shared Representational Substrate
Knowledge graphs enable mutual understanding by providing an explicit, interpretable layer that mediates between human conceptual models and machine-learned patterns. Symbolic representations (ontologies, knowledge graphs) are populated via neural extraction from unstructured data, then used for reasoning and human-readable explanations. The graph anchors sub-symbolic observations to human-interpretable symbols. Core assumption: Both humans and systems can productively operate on explicit symbolic representations; neural outputs can be reliably grounded to symbols. Break condition: When domain knowledge is tacit, context-dependent, or resists formalization (e.g., nuanced social norms, rapidly changing environments), symbolic grounding becomes unreliable.

### Mechanism 2: Three-Dimensional Framework for Mutual Understanding
Mutual understanding between humans and systems requires simultaneous progress across sharing knowledge (conceptual alignment), exchanging knowledge (effective communication), and governing knowledge (rules and processes). The framework adapts interpersonal communication theory—perspective shifting, transaction management, rapport establishment—to human-system interaction. Each dimension addresses a distinct failure mode in collaborative intelligence. Core assumption: Human communication models transfer meaningfully to human-AI interaction; agents have sufficiently compatible representations to align. Break condition: When agents have fundamentally different cognitive architectures or objectives, dimensional decomposition may not capture emergent interaction dynamics.

### Mechanism 3: Hybrid Human-Machine Processing Pipelines
Optimal mutual understanding emerges from orchestrated complementarity—human computation addresses cold-start and edge cases; neural methods scale pattern recognition; symbolic methods enforce consistency and governance. Workflows are designed to route tasks to appropriate processors based on task characteristics, accuracy requirements, and cost constraints. Human-in-the-loop validation corrects systematic errors. Core assumption: Human and machine capabilities are complementary; task routing can be determined a priori or learned. Break condition: When real-time adaptation is required at speeds exceeding human-in-the-loop latency, or when task boundaries are ambiguous.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Graphs and Ontologies**
  - Why needed here: Core symbolic infrastructure for representing entities, relations, and constraints across all six case studies
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish between an ontology (schema), a knowledge graph (instance data), and a semantic map (spatially-grounded graph)?

- **Neuro-Symbolic Integration Patterns**
  - Why needed here: Understanding when to apply top-down symbolic reasoning vs. bottom-up neural learning—and how to combine them
  - Quick check question: For a robot detecting fire hazards, which component handles object recognition (neural/symbolic) and which handles rule compliance checking?

- **Provenance and Reproducibility (RO-Crate, FAIR Principles)**
  - Why needed here: Governing knowledge requires tracking artifact origins, dependencies, and execution history
  - Quick check question: What metadata would you need to reproduce a machine learning pipeline training run six months later?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - RGB-D camera streams -> Neural object detection -> Point Cloud segmentation -> Convex Hull/OBB calculation -> Spatial database storage -> Spatial relation computation -> Symbolic reasoning -> Safety violation detection

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define reference conceptual model/ontology for domain (sharing knowledge)
  2. Build knowledge graph construction pipeline from available data sources
  3. Integrate neural perception/extraction components with symbolic anchoring
  4. Implement validation and correction workflows (human-in-the-loop where needed)
  5. Add provenance tracking and governance rules

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Symbolic vs. neural emphasis**: Symbolic-heavy systems offer interpretability and governance but struggle with unstructured inputs; neural-heavy systems scale but lack transparency
  - **Automation level**: Full automation reduces cost but may miss edge cases; human-in-the-loop improves quality at operational cost
  - **Static vs. dynamic graphs**: Static graphs are simpler but stale; dynamic graphs require maintenance and conflict resolution

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Knowledge graph drifts from reality as neural observations change
  - Symbolic constraints are violated silently by neural outputs
  - Governance rules become blockers rather than guardrails
  - Mappings between representations require constant manual repair

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Build a minimal semantic map: integrate an off-the-shelf object detector with a spatial database, grounding detections to a simple ontology
  2. Implement human-in-the-loop validation for knowledge extraction: measure accuracy improvement and identify highest-value intervention points
  3. Create RO-Crate provenance for a mock ML pipeline: track datasets, code, model artifacts, and execution metadata to understand governance overhead

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How can "boxology" design patterns for hybrid AI be extended to formally include the human component alongside neural and symbolic systems?**
  - Basis in paper: Section 3.4 states that extending existing design patterns for hybrid learning systems to account for the human component "would lead to the definition of hybrid human-neurosymbolic design patterns."
  - Why unresolved: Current design patterns primarily categorize interactions between symbolic and sub-symbolic artificial components but lack formalisms for integrating human agents as active participants in the reasoning loop

- **Can non-symbolic models effectively transform data directly between heterogeneous formats without relying on explicit symbolic mappings?**
  - Basis in paper: Section 5.4 suggests future research should "investigate the potentiality of leveraging non-symbolic models to transform data directly from one format to another."
  - Why unresolved: Semantic interoperability currently relies on declarative mappings (e.g., RML) which are labor-intensive to define; the feasibility of using neural agents for direct transformation is unknown

- **How can a fully bi-directional Neuro-symbolic pipeline be constructed where bottom-up environmental observations automatically update the top-down symbolic knowledge base?**
  - Basis in paper: Section 8.4 posits that a "valuable feedback loop could be established" to create a bi-directional pipeline, which would specifically facilitate the extraction of tacit knowledge
  - Why unresolved: Current pipelines, such as the HanS robot, are largely unidirectional (using knowledge to correct perception); mechanisms to robustly instantiate new symbolic axioms from noisy perception are immature

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework linking interpersonal communication theory to human-system interaction lacks direct empirical validation
- Assumed complementarity between human and machine capabilities may not hold in domains requiring real-time adaptation
- Knowledge graph construction performance varies significantly across domains with different degrees of formalization

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical feasibility of neurosymbolic integration patterns is well-supported by documented case studies
- **Medium confidence**: Three-dimensional framework for mutual understanding is theoretically grounded but lacks direct validation
- **Low confidence**: Universal applicability of interpersonal communication models to human-AI interaction, particularly regarding perspective shifting and rapport establishment

## Next Checks
1. Validate framework transferability: Apply the three-dimensional mutual understanding framework to a new domain (e.g., medical diagnosis assistance) and assess whether the dimensional decomposition captures the interaction dynamics accurately

2. Benchmark human-in-the-loop effectiveness: Design a controlled experiment comparing automated knowledge extraction accuracy with and without human validation, measuring both quality improvements and operational costs across different task types

3. Test symbolic grounding limits: Systematically evaluate knowledge graph construction performance in domains with varying degrees of formalization (structured vs. tacit knowledge) to identify break conditions for reliable symbolic grounding
