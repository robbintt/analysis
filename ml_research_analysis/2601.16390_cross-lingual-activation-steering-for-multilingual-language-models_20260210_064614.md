core_contribution: The paper addresses the persistent performance gap between dominant
  and non-dominant languages in multilingual language models, attributing it to imbalances
  between shared and language-specific neurons. To address this, the authors propose
  Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS), a training-free inference-time intervention
  that selectively modulates neuron activations to enhance cross-lingual transfer.

# Cross-Lingual Activation Steering for Multilingual Language Models

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Training-free inference-time intervention that improves multilingual LLM performance by selectively modulating neuron activations in bridge layers

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the persistent performance gap between dominant and non-dominant languages in multilingual language models by proposing Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS). CLAS is a training-free inference-time intervention that selectively modulates neuron activations in bridge layers to enhance cross-lingual transfer. The method applies lightweight, deterministic modifications to partial-shared and language-specific neurons, adjusting their relative influence while preserving the anchor language (English) as a stable reference. Experiments on XNLI classification and XQuAD generation benchmarks show average accuracy improvements of 2.3% and F1 score improvements of 3.4%, respectively, while maintaining high-resource language performance.

## Method Summary
CLAS operates through three stages: (1) profiling neuron activation patterns across parallel multilingual inputs to categorize neurons as dead, language-specific, partial-shared, or all-shared at the dataset level; (2) selecting bridge layers where partial-shared neurons peak and dead neurons are minimal; and (3) applying masked activation rescaling at inference time. For non-anchor languages, partial-shared neurons are boosted by factor (1 + βM_shared), language-specific neurons are suppressed by (1 - γM_spec), and the result is blended with original activations via h_final = (1 - α)h + αh_2. The method uses LLaMA 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B models with fixed hyperparameters β=0.4 and γ=0.2, while α is tuned per task and model.

## Key Results
- CLAS improves average accuracy by 2.3% on XNLI classification across 15 languages
- CLAS achieves F1 score improvements of 3.4% on XQuAD generative QA for 12 languages
- Performance gains correlate with increased language cluster separation rather than closer alignment to English

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Bridge Layer Selection via Neuron Distribution Profiling
CLAS profiles neuron activation patterns across layers using 100 parallel samples, categorizing neurons at the dataset level. Bridge layers (24–29 in Llama, 24–25 in Qwen) are selected where partial-shared neurons peak and dead neurons are low. The assumption is that neuron categories computed at dataset level generalize across tasks and inputs within the same language set.

### Mechanism 2: Proportional Activation Rescaling with Blended Interpolation
CLAS applies masked scaling: partial-shared neurons are boosted by factor (1 + βM_shared), language-specific neurons are suppressed by (1 - γM_spec), and the result is blended with original activations. The intervention preserves proportionality to actual activations rather than overwriting with constants, maintaining a blend with the original signal.

### Mechanism 3: Functional Divergence Over Geometric Alignment
Performance gains arise from increasing representational separation between languages, not from closer alignment to the anchor language. Analysis shows CLAS generally reduces cosine similarity to English while improving task performance, with negative correlation between alignment change and performance improvement.

## Foundational Learning

- **SwiGLU activation function (h = σ(W_g x) ⊙ (W_u x))**: Why needed: CLAS intervenes on MLP activations before the down-projection; understanding the gating mechanism clarifies where steering is injected. Quick check: Can you identify where in the SwiGLU computation the masked rescaling is applied?

- **Neuron-level interpretability via activation statistics**: Why needed: CLAS relies on mean activation thresholds to categorize neurons; practitioners must understand how aggregate statistics differ from instance-level analysis. Quick check: If a neuron activates for all languages on one example but only 60% of languages across the dataset, which category would Wang et al. (2024) assign versus CLAS?

- **Residual stream interventions in transformer architectures**: Why needed: CLAS modifies intermediate activations; understanding residual connections helps predict propagation effects and failure modes. Quick check: If CLAS is applied at layer 25, which downstream components receive the modified representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: ParallelInputBuilder -> NeuronCategorizer -> BridgeLayerSelector -> ActivationSteerer
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Offline: Profile neuron categories → Select bridge layers → Store masks
  2. Inference: Detect input language → If non-anchor, retrieve masks → Apply steering equations → Pass to down-projection
- **Design tradeoffs**: Dataset-level vs instance-level categorization (stability vs specificity), positive vs negative α (task-dependent), bridge layer exclusion of final layers (output preservation vs transfer opportunities)
- **Failure signatures**: Language regressions (over-suppression), high variance across languages on generative tasks (lexical sensitivity), no improvement on well-separated clusters
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate neuron category stability: Compute categories on XQuAD, test whether same bridge layers emerge from XNLI data
  2. Ablate α direction: Run grid search with α ∈ {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} on a held-out language subset
  3. Test transfer to new languages: Add languages not in profiling set, measure whether masks generalize

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does selecting a non-English anchor language affect the geometric reorganization and performance outcomes of CLAS? The study exclusively used English as the stable reference point.
- **Open Question 2**: What specific representational features determine whether a language will experience performance regression under CLAS? The paper reports regressions (e.g., Hindi, Greek) but does not isolate the underlying causal mechanism.
- **Open Question 3**: Do attention heads play a distinct or complementary role to MLP neurons in facilitating the functional divergence observed during CLAS? The current intervention targets only MLP activations.

## Limitations
- Neuron categorization thresholds and exact bridge layer selection criteria are underspecified
- The assumption that dataset-level neuron categories generalize across tasks may not hold for languages with vastly different structures
- Optimal α values show high variance across languages and tasks, suggesting the need for dynamic adjustment

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of applying deterministic activation rescaling to bridge layers is well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: The relationship between functional divergence and performance gains is supported by analysis, but the causal mechanism requires further validation
- **Low confidence**: The claim that neuron categories computed on XQuAD samples generalize to other tasks and languages is not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-task neuron stability**: Profile neuron categories using XQuAD data, then verify whether the same bridge layers emerge when using XNLI data for the same languages
2. **Dynamic α optimization**: Implement a per-language, per-task α grid search across {-8, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4} rather than using fixed values
3. **Low-resource language generalization**: Apply CLAS to languages not included in the original profiling set (e.g., African or indigenous languages) and compare performance against zero-shot baselines
