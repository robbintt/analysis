# Noisy-Pair Robust Representation Alignment for Positive-Unlabeled Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01278
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01278
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: NcPU framework achieves state-of-the-art PU learning performance without requiring auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces NcPU, a non-contrastive framework for Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning that addresses the challenge of unreliable supervision from PU data. The authors propose a noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL) combined with a phantom label disambiguation (PLD) scheme to effectively learn discriminative representations. The framework achieves substantial improvements over existing PU methods across multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10/100, STL-10, and remote sensing datasets, without requiring auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters.

## Method Summary
NcPU combines two key components: NoiSNCL and PLD. NoiSNCL aligns intra-class representations while tolerating noisy pairs through a modified supervised non-contrastive loss that assigns zero gradients to mismatched positive pairs, effectively ignoring noisy supervision. PLD refines the supervision through a regret-based label update mechanism that adjusts phantom labels based on the discrepancy between estimated and actual positive rates. These components are integrated within an Expectation-Maximization framework where NoiSNCL provides robust gradient signals for representation learning while PLD improves the quality of supervision over iterations.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness on remote sensing datasets (ABCD, xBD) for real-world applications
- Matches the performance of fully supervised counterparts, validating the framework's effectiveness
- Eliminates the need for auxiliary negative samples or pre-estimated class priors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its dual approach to handling noisy supervision. NoiSNCL provides robust gradient signals by eliminating the impact of noisy positive pairs through zero-gradient assignment, preventing these pairs from degrading representation quality. Meanwhile, PLD progressively refines the supervision quality by updating phantom labels based on regret minimization, which measures the discrepancy between current and optimal positive rate estimates. The EM framework ensures these components mutually reinforce each other: NoiSNCL learns better representations from current supervision, while PLD improves supervision based on learned representations.

## Foundational Learning
- Positive-Unlabeled Learning: Learning from only positive-labeled and unlabeled data; needed because real-world data often lacks negative labels
- Non-contrastive Representation Learning: Methods like BYOL that learn representations without explicit negative pairs; needed to avoid reliance on negative samples which are unavailable in PU setting
- Expectation-Maximization Framework: Iterative optimization between representation learning and parameter estimation; needed to coordinate NoiSNCL and PLD components
- Phantom Label Disambiguation: Refining uncertain labels through regret-based updates; needed to improve supervision quality over training iterations
- Noisy Pair Robustness: Ability to tolerate incorrect positive pairs in supervision; needed because PU data inherently contains false positive labels

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Input Images -> Data Augmentation -> Online Network -> Projection Head -> NoiSNCL Loss -> Update Online Network; Momentum Network -> Projection Head -> Target Representations -> PLD Module -> Updated Phantom Labels -> Supervision

Critical Path: The training loop involves three key steps: (1) forward pass through online and momentum networks, (2) compute NoiSNCL loss with current phantom labels, (3) update phantom labels via PLD based on regret minimization

Design Tradeoffs: The framework trades increased computational complexity (due to EM iterations and phantom label updates) for improved robustness to noisy supervision and elimination of negative sample requirements

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation may occur if: phantom labels become stuck in local optima, the regret-based updates fail to converge, or the assumed noise distribution deviates significantly from real data

First Experiments: 1) Verify NoiSNCL gradient analysis on synthetic noisy pairs, 2) Test PLD convergence on controlled label noise scenarios, 3) Evaluate the EM coordination on small-scale datasets before full deployment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the NcPU framework be effectively generalized to non-image data modalities, such as text, audio, or tabular data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude by stating, "we expect future research to extend this framework beyond image classification."
- Why unresolved: The current study validates NcPU exclusively on image datasets (CIFAR, STL-10, satellite imagery). It is unclear if the specific data augmentations and spatial features required for the NoiSNCL module are directly transferable to non-spatial domains without architectural modifications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evaluations of NcPU on standard Positive-Unlabeled benchmarks in natural language processing or time-series analysis, demonstrating comparable improvements over existing risk estimators.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the NoiSNCL loss perform in related weakly supervised learning paradigms, such as Partial Label Learning (PLL) or Noisy Label Learning (NLL)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes that "Beyond PU learning, the framework holds promise for broader applications in more weakly supervised learning scenarios."
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that NoiSNCL handles "noisy pairs" within the binary PU setting, it does not test the framework against the multi-class ambiguity or instance-dependent noise typical of PLL and NLL datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments integrating NoiSNCL into state-of-the-art Partial Label Learning pipelines to verify if the gradient analysis (Eq. 8) holds for multi-class ambiguous pairs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the assumption of a uniform class prior in Theorem 1 limit the theoretical guarantees when applied to highly imbalanced real-world datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Theorem 1 (Appendix B.2) explicitly assumes a "uniform class prior" to derive the lower bound on the likelihood, but real-world applications mentioned in the paper (e.g., disaster damage mapping) likely feature non-uniform distributions.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides strong empirical results on potentially imbalanced data (xBD), but there is a disconnect between the theoretical derivation (which assumes uniformity) and the practical application where πp may be small or extreme.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical extension of Theorem 1 that accommodates non-uniform priors, or a sensitivity analysis showing the degradation of the likelihood bound as the class distribution diverges from uniformity.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Is the NoiSNCL loss dependent on the BYOL architecture (momentum encoder), or can it be effectively integrated into other non-contrastive or masked image modeling frameworks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states, "Without loss of generality, this paper adopts the classical non-contrastive representation learning framework BYOL," implying the choice is a baseline rather than a requirement.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis relies on gradient interactions involving the prediction and target networks. It is unresolved whether the "noisy-pair robustness" is an intrinsic property of the loss function or an emergent property of its interaction with the BYOL-specific architecture.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies applying NoiSNCL to alternative architectures like SimSiam (without momentum) or MAE (masked autoencoders) to determine if performance is maintained.

## Limitations
- Scalability to extremely large-scale datasets remains untested
- Reliance on carefully curated phantom label disambiguation may not generalize to highly dynamic or unstructured data streams
- Theoretical framework's assumptions about noise distribution and class separability may not hold in all practical scenarios

## Confidence
- High: Core claims of NcPU's effectiveness on reported datasets and experimental conditions
- Medium: Theoretical guarantees due to complexity of EM framework and potential sensitivity to hyperparameter choices

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate NcPU on significantly larger-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet-scale) to assess scalability and computational efficiency
2. Test the framework in real-world scenarios with varying levels of label noise and class imbalance to validate robustness claims
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of NoiSNCL and PLD components under different noise conditions and dataset characteristics
