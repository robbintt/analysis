# Enhancing Physics-Informed Neural Networks with a Hybrid Parallel Kolmogorov-Arnold and MLP Architecture

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.23289
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23289
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces HPKM-PINN, a hybrid parallel architecture integrating KAN and MLP branches with a scaling factor ξ, achieving two orders of magnitude lower relative error compared to standalone models on benchmark PDEs.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes the Hybrid Parallel KAN and MLP Physics-Informed Neural Network (HPKM-PINN), a novel architecture that combines parallelized KAN and MLP branches within a unified PINN framework. By introducing a tunable scaling factor ξ to optimally balance the complementary strengths of KAN's interpretable function approximation and MLP's nonlinear feature learning, HPKM-PINN achieves marked improvements in predictive performance. Systematic numerical evaluations demonstrate that HPKM-PINN exhibits enhanced numerical stability and robustness when applied to various physical systems, positioning it as a versatile tool for solving complex PDE-driven problems in computational science and engineering.

## Method Summary
The HPKM-PINN architecture consists of parallelized KAN and MLP branches that share the same input coordinates and produce separate outputs. These outputs are then combined through a weighted fusion using a scaling factor ξ: u(x) = ξ·u_KAN(x) + (1-ξ)·u_MLP(x). The model is trained using Adam optimization to minimize physics-informed loss functions incorporating PDE residuals, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. The architecture leverages KAN's interpretable function approximation capabilities and MLP's nonlinear feature learning strengths, with ξ serving as a critical hyperparameter that can be tuned for different PDE regimes.

## Key Results
- HPKM-PINN achieves two orders of magnitude lower relative error compared to standalone KAN or MLP models
- The architecture demonstrates marked decrease in loss values across canonical PDEs including Poisson and Advection equations
- HPKM-PINN exhibits numerical stability and robustness, successfully overcoming early stagnation issues common in standard PINNs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The parallel architecture mitigates spectral bias by fusing MLP's stability in low-frequency approximation with KAN's efficacy in high-frequency feature extraction.
- Mechanism: MLPs generally learn low-frequency components faster (spectral bias), while KANs utilize B-spline activations to capture complex, non-linear, high-frequency details. By fusing outputs, the model covers the full frequency spectrum more effectively than either alone.
- Core assumption: The target solution contains mixed-frequency components where neither MLP nor KAN is universally superior across all spectral bands.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 1, page 2]: "MLPs excel in learning across a broad frequency spectrum, while KAN is adept at capturing nonlinear features but lacks proficiency in low-frequency feature extraction."
  - [section 3.1, page 7]: "The results clearly demonstrate that the MLP model... fails to capture the high-frequency components... Similarly, the KAN model... struggles to accurately model the full spectrum."
- Break condition: If the PDE solution is dominated purely by smooth low-frequency dynamics, the added complexity of KAN may introduce unnecessary overhead without accuracy gains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The scaling factor $\xi$ optimizes the bias-variance trade-off between the two architectures for specific PDE regimes.
- Mechanism: Rather than a fixed integration, the tunable parameter $\xi$ allows the training process to weight the reliable but potentially biased MLP output against the expressive but potentially unstable KAN output.
- Core assumption: An optimal static or dynamic balance exists between the two network outputs that minimizes the overall PDE residual loss better than individual tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The HPKM-PINN introduces a scaling factor $\xi$ to optimally balance the complementary strengths."
  - [section 2.3, page 5]: Defines the combined output $u(x) = \xi \cdot u_{KAN}(x) + (1 - \xi) \cdot u_{MLP}(x)$.
- Break condition: If $\xi$ is set to extremes (0 or 1) or tuned incorrectly, the model reverts to the failure modes of the dominant standalone architecture.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The hybrid structure alleviates training pathologies, specifically the "early stagnation" often observed in standard PINNs.
- Mechanism: The parallel gradients from the MLP branch (smooth, stable) may provide a consistent optimization signal that helps escape local minima where the KAN branch might stall due to its sensitive spline-based activation landscape.
- Core assumption: The optimizer can leverage diverse gradient signals from two distinct topologies to navigate the loss landscape more effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.3, page 13]: "Both the PINN and PIKAN models exhibit an early stagnation in convergence... However, the HPKM-PINN model successfully overcomes this issue."
  - [section 4, page 19]: Mentions the "dynamic balancing mechanism" allows the model to adapt to varying solution characteristics.
- Break condition: If the loss landscapes of the two branches are wildly misaligned, gradient interference could occur, though the paper does not report this.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Spectral Bias (F-Principle)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why standard MLPs fail to learn high-frequency components quickly is essential to grasping why KAN is added.
  - Quick check question: Why would a standard neural network converge slowly to a function dominated by rapid oscillations?

- Concept: **Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - Why needed here: This mathematical basis explains why KANs place learnable functions on edges (activation functions) rather than nodes (weights), impacting how they approximate functions.
  - Quick check question: How does the placement of learnable parameters in a KAN differ from a standard MLP?

- Concept: **Physics-Informed Residual Loss**
  - Why needed here: This is the core training objective. The HPKM output must be differentiated to calculate the residual of the PDE.
  - Quick check question: Does the HPKM architecture change the way the PDE residual is calculated, or just the network that approximates the solution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input Coordinates (x, t) -> MLP Branch -> Fusion Node -> Physics Head
  Input Coordinates (x, t) -> KAN Branch -> Fusion Node -> Physics Head

- Critical path: Tuning the scaling factor $\xi$. The paper identifies different optimal $\xi$ values for different equations (e.g., 0.3 for Poisson, 0.9 for Helmholtz). Treat $\xi$ as a critical hyperparameter.

- Design tradeoffs: The hybrid model significantly increases parameter count and training time (Table 1 shows training time roughly doubles compared to the fastest single model) in exchange for lower error and robustness.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Runaway Loss:** If learning rates differ significantly between branches, one may dominate.
  - **Noise Sensitivity:** While robust to test noise, extremely noisy training data might destabilize the spline fitting in the KAN branch.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Poisson Equation Baseline:** Replicate the 1D Poisson experiment to verify the $\xi=0.3$ optimality claim and observe convergence speed.
  2. **Sweep $\xi$:** For the Advection equation, sweep $\xi$ from 0 to 1 in 0.1 increments to reproduce the "U-shaped" error curve and find the local minimum.
  3. **Ablation on Complexity:** Test on a simple smooth function vs. a multi-frequency function to determine if the computational overhead of HPKM is justified for low-complexity problems.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the optimal scaling factor $\xi$ be determined adaptively during the training process rather than through manual search?
- Basis in paper: [Inferred] The experiments in Section 3 systematically vary $\xi$ (e.g., 0.3 for Poisson, 0.9 for Helmholtz) to find optimal performance, implying a dependence on manual hyperparameter tuning.
- Why unresolved: The current framework treats $\xi$ as a static hyperparameter requiring external optimization, which may be inefficient for new or changing physical systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified HPKM-PINN framework where $\xi$ is a trainable variable that converges dynamically to the optimal balance between KAN and MLP branches without manual intervention.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the computational overhead introduced by the parallel architecture be reduced to improve scalability?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] The Discussion section notes that the "parallel structure... resulted in an increased number of parameters, which resulted in longer training times," and suggests future work on "adaptive network structures."
- Why unresolved: While accuracy improves, Table 1 shows HPKM-PINN requires significantly more time (e.g., 858s vs 88s for Poisson) compared to standard PINNs, potentially limiting use in time-critical applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of pruning techniques or adaptive allocation methods that maintain the error reduction benefits while reducing the parameter count and training latency to levels comparable with single-branch models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the hybrid architecture offer significant advantages for high-dimensional or highly stiff inverse problems?
- Basis in paper: [Inferred] Section 3.2.4 notes that improvements for the Helmholtz equation were marginal, leading the authors to suggest benefits are likely more pronounced in "more complex scenarios" with "intricate boundary conditions."
- Why unresolved: The paper benchmarks only 1D and 2D canonical forward problems; it does not validate the architecture on high-dimensional systems or inverse problems where data is sparse.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks on 3D turbulence (Navier-Stokes) or inverse design problems, demonstrating that the hybrid feature extraction scales effectively where standard MLPs or KANs fail.

## Limitations
- The optimal scaling factor ξ requires manual tuning for different PDE types, limiting automation potential
- The parallel architecture significantly increases computational overhead, with training times roughly doubling compared to single-branch models
- Claims about spectral complementarity and gradient diversity mechanisms lack direct quantitative validation through spectral analysis or gradient correlation studies

## Confidence

- **High:** The architectural design (parallel KAN-MLP fusion) is clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium:** Claims about superior numerical stability and robustness across diverse PDE types are supported by experiments but would benefit from broader problem sets
- **Low:** The mechanism explaining how parallel gradients prevent early stagnation (Mechanism 3) lacks quantitative evidence linking gradient statistics to convergence improvements

## Next Checks

1. **Spectral Analysis:** For a mixed-frequency test function, perform Fourier analysis on the HPKM output versus standalone MLP/KAN to empirically verify the claimed spectral complementarity.

2. **ξ Sensitivity Sweep:** Systematically vary ξ for the Helmholtz equation (claimed optimal ξ=0.9) to confirm the error minimum and test if the "U-shaped" curve is reproducible.

3. **Gradient Correlation Study:** During training on a complex PDE like Convection-Diffusion, measure and compare the cosine similarity of gradients between MLP and KAN branches to assess whether parallel gradients provide genuinely diverse optimization signals.
