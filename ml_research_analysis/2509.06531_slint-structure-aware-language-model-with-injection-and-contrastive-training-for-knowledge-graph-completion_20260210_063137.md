# SLiNT: Structure-aware Language Model with Injection and Contrastive Training for Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.06531
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06531
- Reference count: 34
- MRR of 0.443 on FB15k-237 and 0.691 on WN18RR, outperforming prior generative models

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes SLiNT, a structure-aware generative framework for knowledge graph completion that addresses structural sparsity and semantic ambiguity in LLM-based KGC. The method integrates three components: pseudo-neighbor enhancement (SGNE), contrastive disambiguation (DHCL), and token-level structure injection (GDDI) into a frozen LLM backbone with LoRA adaptation. Experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate superior or competitive performance compared to prior generative models, with ablation studies confirming the contributions of each component and robustness tests showing stability under low-resource and sparse conditions.

## Method Summary
SLiNT addresses two key challenges in LLM-based knowledge graph completion: structural sparsity (entities with few relations) and semantic ambiguity (multiple entities sharing similar surface forms). The method employs a two-stage approach: first, a pretrained KG embedding model retrieves top-m candidates; second, SLiNT processes queries through three integrated components. SGNE enhances queries with pseudo-neighbor context using multi-head attention over top-ks structural neighbors. DHCL performs contrastive learning with N sampled candidates, selecting kc hard positives/negatives based on confusion-aware scoring. GDDI injects enhanced structural embeddings at token-level into frozen LLaMA-2-7B using LoRA adapters. The model is trained with a combined loss of L_LM + λ·L_CL, with hyperparameters including λ=0.5, ks=5, kc=10, and N=50.

## Key Results
- Achieves MRR of 0.443 on FB15k-237 and 0.691 on WN18RR, outperforming prior generative models
- Ablation studies confirm positive contributions from SGNE, DHCL, and GDDI components
- Demonstrates robustness under low-resource and sparse conditions
- Shows stability across different sparsity levels and relation types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SLiNT addresses structural sparsity by enriching queries with pseudo-neighbor context through SGNE, which retrieves and fuses structural information from similar entities. Semantic ambiguity is resolved through DHCL, which creates tighter clusters for true triples and wider margins for false ones using contrastive learning on hard positive/negative samples. GDDI ensures the structural information is properly injected at the token level into the LLM's frozen backbone. The combination of these three components allows the model to leverage both the generative power of LLMs and the structured knowledge of KGs, with LoRA adaptation providing efficient fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge Graph Embeddings**: Dense vector representations of entities and relations that capture structural information; needed to retrieve pseudo-neighbors and candidates, quick check: can retrieve top-m similar entities via cosine similarity.

**Contrastive Learning**: Learning framework that pulls similar samples together and pushes dissimilar ones apart in embedding space; needed to resolve semantic ambiguity by creating tighter clusters for true triples, quick check: can compute prototype centers and margins.

**Multi-head Attention**: Mechanism that allows models to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces; needed in SGNE to fuse pseudo-neighbor context effectively, quick check: can implement attention with learnable projection matrices.

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that inserts low-rank matrices into pre-trained model layers; needed to adapt frozen LLM for KGC without full fine-tuning, quick check: can train with rank=128 adapters.

**Token-level Injection**: Process of incorporating external embeddings directly into specific token positions; needed in GDDI to integrate structural information into LLM processing, quick check: can modify specific token embeddings during forward pass.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Pretrained KG Embeddings -> SGNE (top-ks pseudo-neighbors) -> DHCL (contrastive loss) -> GDDI (token injection) -> Frozen LLM + LoRA -> Output

**Critical path**: Input query -> Retrieve top-m candidates via KG embeddings -> SGNE retrieves top-ks pseudo-neighbors and fuses via multi-head attention -> DHCL samples N candidates, selects kc hard positives/negatives, computes contrastive loss -> GDDI constructs prompts, injects enhanced embeddings at token level -> Frozen LLM processes with LoRA adapters -> Generates completion

**Design tradeoffs**: Uses frozen LLM with LoRA for efficiency vs. full fine-tuning for potentially better adaptation; retrieves top-ks=5 pseudo-neighbors for balance between context and noise vs. using more neighbors for richer context; employs hard negative mining in DHCL for effective contrastive learning vs. random sampling for simplicity.

**Failure signatures**: Performance degrades when ks≥10 due to noisy neighbors (Figure 5); training becomes unstable when λ is too high (FB15k-237 peaks at λ=0.3, WN18RR at λ=0.5); model fails on long-tail relations where pseudo-neighbor context provides insufficient disambiguation (case study shows "novel" predicted instead of "painting").

**First experiments**: 1) Implement SGNE with varying ks values (1-10) and measure MRR to confirm optimal point at ks=5; 2) Test DHCL with different λ values (0.1-1.0) on both datasets to validate claimed optimal values; 3) Conduct ablation by removing each component (SGNE, DHCL, GDDI) individually to verify reported performance drops.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can SGNE be extended to incorporate multimodal retrieval (e.g., images, temporal dynamics) for KGs that require such cues? The authors state this limits applicability to scenarios requiring multimodal cues and suggest future work could extend SGNE to incorporate multimodal retrieval. This remains unresolved as the current SGNE only retrieves structural pseudo-neighbors from KG embeddings without mechanisms for integrating visual or temporal information.

**Open Question 2**: Why does the optimal contrastive loss weight λ differ by dataset (0.3 for FB15k-237, 0.5 for WN18RR), and can it be automatically tuned? The authors note this discrepancy likely reflects structural differences but offer no definitive explanation or adaptive mechanism. This remains unresolved as the paper empirically selects λ via grid search without developing a principled method for dataset-specific calibration or meta-learning the weight.

**Open Question 3**: How does SLiNT perform on long-tail relations where pseudo-neighbor context provides insufficient disambiguation? Case Study D.3 shows SLiNT fails on the query (person, known_for, ?), mispredicting "novel" instead of "painting," despite retrieving relevant neighbors like "painter" and "artist." This remains unresolved as the paper acknowledges the failure but does not analyze whether the issue stems from neighbor quality, contrastive boundary confusion, or insufficient semantic alignment in GDDI injection.

## Limitations

- Underspecified components including SGNE architecture parameters, prompt construction details, and the "confusion-aware scoring function" in DHCL
- Only evaluated on two standard datasets (FB15k-237 and WN18RR), limiting generalizability to other KGs
- Fixed hyperparameters may not transfer well across different domains or KG sizes

## Confidence

**High confidence**: SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance on FB15k-237 and WN18RR compared to prior generative models (MRR 0.443 and 0.691). The ablation study convincingly demonstrates that SGNE, DHCL, and GDDI each contribute positively to performance. The robustness claims are supported by experiments showing stability under low-resource and sparse conditions.

**Medium confidence**: The specific architectural choices (ks=5, kc=10, N=50, λ=0.5) are optimal for the task. The frozen LLM + LoRA adaptation approach is the best strategy for KGC. The contrastive loss formulation effectively resolves semantic ambiguity.

**Low confidence**: The confusion-aware scoring function exists and is properly implemented. The prompt templates are optimal for knowledge retrieval. The pseudo-neighbor retrieval mechanism (top-m=20) is optimal for all KG sizes.

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test SGNE with varying ks values (1-10) to confirm the claimed optimal point at ks=5 and validate the "noisy neighbors degrade performance" hypothesis.

2. Conduct a systematic ablation study removing each component (SGNE, DHCL, GDDI) individually to verify the reported performance drops and confirm the contribution of each module.

3. Test the model's sensitivity to the contrastive loss weight λ across a wider range (0.1 to 1.0) on both datasets to validate the claimed optimal values (λ=0.3 for FB15k-237, λ=0.5 for WN18RR) and confirm the "over-weighted contrastive loss destabilizes training" observation.
