# Leveraging Generative AI Models to Explore Human Identity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.14843
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14843
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: This paper explores human identity through diffusion models, a type of generative AI that produces images from noise. The authors establish a correspondence between the image generation process and human identity formation, where initial noise represents innate factors and additional noise represents external influences. By gradually modifying the color of additional noise along three different paths in color space, they observe that the generated human face images change continuously in both appearance and color tone. The study demonstrates that changes in external input lead to significant changes in the generated identity, supporting the view that human identity is fluid and influenced by environmental factors. Based on these results, the authors create a video artwork titled "Fluidity of Human Identity" that visually represents the dynamic nature of human identity through the algorithmic process of the AI model.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates human identity through the lens of diffusion generative models, establishing an analogical framework where the image generation process mirrors identity formation. By injecting color-specific additional noise into early denoising steps of a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model, the authors demonstrate that controlled changes in "external input" produce continuous, visually interpretable changes in generated human faces. The work culminates in a video artwork that represents the fluid nature of human identity, while raising questions about the applicability of this approach to other domains like language through Large Language Models.

## Method Summary
The authors use a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model from Hugging Face Diffusers, trained on CelebA-HQ dataset, to generate human face images. They inject additional color-specific noise (snoise = 0.01) into the denoising process during steps 1-10 out of 1000 total steps. By fixing the initial noise and varying the additional noise color along three predefined paths in RGB color space (bouncing ball trajectory, mirror reflection, Brownian motion), they generate sequences of face images that change continuously in appearance and color tone. The methodology is implemented on Google Colab using NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU.

## Key Results
- Changes in external input (color-specific additional noise) result in significant changes in the generated face image's appearance and color tone
- Generated human face images change gradually in response to variations in additional noise without significant alterations
- The study indirectly confirms the dependence of human identity on external factors in the process of human identity formation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Injecting color-specific additional noise into early denoising steps influences both the color tone and facial appearance of generated images.
- Mechanism: The diffusion model's denoising process is sensitive to perturbations in its input noise during early steps (1-10 of 1000). When additional noise with controlled RGB values is added to initial noise, the model incorporates these color signals into its iterative denoising trajectory, producing output images that reflect both the injected color and corresponding facial feature changes.
- Core assumption: Early denoising steps are formative for both global color and semantic structure of the output.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we observe that changes in its external input result in significant changes in the generated face image"
  - [Methodology] "injecting additional noise of a specific color into the early stages results in an output image imbued with that color... this additional color-specific noise influences not only the color of the generated image but also its content"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; neighbor papers focus on ID preservation and face generation quality, not noise-color manipulation as a control mechanism.
- Break condition: If noise is injected too late in the denoising process, or if snoise scaling is too high (>0.1), the model may produce artifacts or override the color signal entirely.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Gradual continuous variation of additional noise color produces continuous, non-discontinuous changes in generated face images.
- Mechanism: By sampling color coordinates at small intervals along predefined paths in RGB color space, the input to the denoising process changes incrementally. The diffusion model's learned denoising function is continuous with respect to input perturbations, so outputs transition smoothly without abrupt identity jumps.
- Core assumption: The denoising network's input-output mapping is sufficiently smooth that small noise changes yield small image changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Results] "the generated human face images change gradually in response to the variations in additional noise, without any significant alterations"
  - [Figure 5 caption] "Human face images generated when the color of the additional noise is adjusted almost continuously with very small sampling intervals"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation; continuity of diffusion outputs under input perturbation is an empirical property not explicitly studied in neighbors.
- Break condition: If sampling intervals are too large, or if paths traverse perceptually distant color regions, discontinuities or "jumps" in appearance may occur.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The correspondence between diffusion model generation and human identity formation provides a metaphorical framework for interpreting identity fluidity.
- Mechanism: The authors establish an analogical mapping: initial noise ↔ innate factors, additional noise ↔ external factors, generated face ↔ identity. Changes in "external input" (noise color) cause changes in "identity" (face), supporting the philosophical view that identity is shaped by environment.
- Core assumption: Neural networks, as biological-inspired systems, can serve as valid analogical models for human psychological processes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we indirectly confirm the dependence of human identity on external factors in the process of human identity formation"
  - [Methodology] "Research in psychology and neuroscience highlights that external factors... play a significant role in shaping a person's identity"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence validates this analogy empirically; it remains an interpretive/metaphorical claim.
- Break condition: This is not a testable causal mechanism in the ML sense—it is an analogy. It breaks if the neural network-to-human mapping is rejected as philosophically or scientifically unsound.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models (forward and reverse/denoising processes)
  - Why needed here: The entire methodology depends on understanding how diffusion models add noise during training and iteratively denoise during generation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why early denoising steps have more influence on global image structure than later steps?

- Concept: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a pre-trained LDM from Hugging Face; understanding latent space vs. pixel space is essential for interpreting where noise is injected.
  - Quick check question: What is the advantage of performing diffusion in latent space rather than pixel space?

- Concept: Color space manipulation and RGB interpolation
  - Why needed here: The experimental design requires constructing paths (bouncing ball, mirror reflection, Brownian motion) through RGB color space.
  - Quick check question: How would linear interpolation between two RGB colors differ from a path simulating Brownian motion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained LDM -> Additional noise injection module -> Denoising process -> Generated face images
- Critical path:
  1. Sample or fix initial noise (innate factors)
  2. Define a path in RGB color space
  3. For each point on the path, construct color-specific additional noise M
  4. Run denoising process with noise injection at steps 1-10
  5. Collect generated face images along the path
  6. Render as video sequence
- Design tradeoffs:
  - snoise = 0.01 is a small scaling factor; larger values may overpower initial noise but cause artifacts
  - Injection window (steps 1-10) is early but not immediate; later injection may reduce influence
  - Path design (bouncing, mirror, Brownian) affects perceptual smoothness of output transitions
  - Fixed initial noise enables controlled comparison but limits diversity
- Failure signatures:
  - If output images show color banding or artifacts: snoise may be too high
  - If facial identity jumps discontinuously: sampling intervals along path may be too large
  - If color influence is weak or absent: noise injection window may be too late in denoising
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the color-specific noise injection with a single color (e.g., pure red) on fixed initial noise to verify that output color matches input noise color.
  2. Implement a linear interpolation path between two colors and confirm that generated faces change smoothly with small sampling intervals.
  3. Test injection window sensitivity by applying additional noise at steps 1-5 vs. 1-20 and compare strength of color influence on output.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can Large Language Models (LLMs) be utilized to extend the exploration of human identity beyond visual appearance to cognitive or linguistic dimensions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "We believe that Large Language Models (LLMs), equipped with vast knowledge and capable of mimicking humans, can contribute to exploring the human mind."
- Why unresolved: The current study relies exclusively on image-based diffusion models, while LLMs operate on fundamentally different architectures and data modalities (text vs. pixels).
- What evidence would resolve it: A study applying similar input-manipulation methodologies to LLMs to observe changes in generated persona or linguistic style.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the observed image variation actually model the psychological mechanism of identity formation, or is the "fluidity" merely a visual artifact of traversing the model's latent space?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper establishes a "correspondence" as a metaphor but lacks empirical validation that the AI's mathematical operations reflect human psychological processes.
- Why unresolved: The authors claim to "indirectly confirm" dependence on external factors, but the causal link between a neural network's color noise response and human environmental psychology remains an analogy rather than a proven mechanism.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis demonstrating that the model's response to noise injection statistically correlates with established psychological models of environmental influence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the interaction between initial noise (innate factors) and additional noise (external factors) manifest in the final identity, and does it mirror the non-linear entanglement of nature and nurture?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The methodology isolates initial noise by fixing it while varying additional noise, leaving the complex, simultaneous interaction between these two factors unexplored.
- Why unresolved: Human identity formation involves a dynamic interplay where innate traits influence how environments are perceived; it is unclear if the diffusion model exhibits similar interaction effects or if the factors are merely additive.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying both initial and additional noise simultaneously to analyze interaction effects on the generated identity.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the qualitative changes in generated identity be quantified to objectively measure the "distance" or "degree" of identity shift relative to the input noise?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study relies on subjective visual inspection of color and appearance changes (e.g., "atmosphere") without providing quantitative metrics for identity shifts.
- Why unresolved: Without quantitative measures, it is difficult to distinguish between superficial stylistic changes and fundamental identity alterations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Utilization of identity-embedding metrics (e.g., ArcFace) to correlate the magnitude of noise changes with the numeric distance in identity space.

## Limitations
- The exact mathematical definitions of the three color-space paths (bouncing ball, mirror reflection, Brownian motion) are not provided, making precise reproduction difficult
- The study relies on visual analysis rather than quantitative metrics to assess continuity and color influence
- Specific technical details about the Latent Diffusion Model checkpoint and noise injection mechanism remain unspecified

## Confidence

High confidence: Core technical claim that early denoising steps are sensitive to color-specific noise injection, producing corresponding color and appearance changes is supported by observed visual results and general understanding of diffusion model behavior.

Medium confidence: The methodology for generating continuous identity changes through controlled noise manipulation is reproducible in principle but lacks detailed technical specifications.

Low-Medium confidence: The philosophical analogy between diffusion generation and human identity formation remains an interpretive claim without empirical validation.

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce the color-specific noise injection with a single fixed color (e.g., pure red) on fixed initial noise to verify that output color matches input noise color and that facial features show consistent modification.

2. Implement a simple linear interpolation path between two colors with small sampling intervals and confirm that generated faces change smoothly without discontinuities or identity jumps.

3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis by varying the noise injection window (steps 1-5 vs. 1-20) and scaling factor (snoise = 0.005 vs. 0.02) to empirically determine the optimal parameters for color influence while maintaining image quality.
