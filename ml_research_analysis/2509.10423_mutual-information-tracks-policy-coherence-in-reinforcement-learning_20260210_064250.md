core_contribution: This paper presents an information-theoretic framework for analyzing
  reinforcement learning agents, demonstrating that mutual information between states
  and actions serves as both a signature of learning progress and a diagnostic tool
  for detecting system failures. Through systematic analysis of a robotic arm control
  task, the authors show that successful learning manifests as increasing state-action
  mutual information (MI(S;A)) from 0.84 to 2.83 bits despite growing state entropy,
  indicating agents develop increasingly selective attention to task-relevant patterns.

# Mutual Information Tracks Policy Coherence in Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.10423
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10423
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Mutual information serves as diagnostic tool for learning progress and fault detection

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an information-theoretic framework using mutual information to analyze reinforcement learning agents, demonstrating that MI(S;A) tracks learning progress and enables fault detection without architectural modifications. The framework reveals that successful learning manifests as increasing state-action mutual information from 0.84 to 2.83 bits, indicating agents develop selective attention to task-relevant patterns. The diagnostic capability distinguishes between different failure modes - sensor faults cause broad collapses across all information channels while actuator faults selectively disrupt action-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships.

## Method Summary
The framework measures mutual information between states and actions across the learning process to track policy coherence. Using a robotic arm control task, the authors systematically analyze how information-theoretic signatures evolve during successful learning versus various failure modes. The approach captures the growth in state-action mutual information from 0.84 to 2.83 bits despite increasing state entropy, demonstrating that successful policies develop increasingly selective attention to relevant task features. The framework's diagnostic power emerges from its ability to detect differential patterns of information loss across different fault types without requiring knowledge of the underlying system architecture.

## Key Results
- State-action mutual information (MI(S;A)) increases from 0.84 to 2.83 bits during successful learning
- Sensor faults cause broad collapses across all information channels
- Actuator faults selectively disrupt action-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships
- Information-theoretic signatures enable precise fault localization without architectural modifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works because mutual information captures the fundamental relationship between observations and actions that defines policy coherence. As agents learn, they develop selective attention to task-relevant patterns, which manifests as increased predictability between states and actions. This information-theoretic measure is robust to the underlying policy complexity and can detect when this coherence breaks down due to various fault modes. The differential diagnostic capability arises because different types of faults disrupt information flow in characteristic patterns - sensor faults corrupt the state representation globally while actuator faults break the action-outcome mapping while preserving the state-action relationship.

## Foundational Learning
- Mutual information: Measure of statistical dependence between random variables; needed for quantifying policy coherence; quick check: verify non-negativity and invariance under invertible transformations
- Reinforcement learning basics: Agent-environment interaction with state, action, reward structure; needed for understanding policy formation; quick check: ensure Markov property holds for state transitions
- Information theory fundamentals: Entropy, conditional entropy, and their relationships; needed for interpreting MI growth patterns; quick check: confirm information inequalities hold
- Fault detection theory: Characterization of different fault modes and their signatures; needed for differential diagnosis; quick check: validate fault models match real-world characteristics

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Environment -> State Observation -> Policy Network -> Action Selection -> Outcome Measurement -> Mutual Information Calculation -> Fault Detection

**Critical Path:** State observation → Policy → Action → Outcome → MI measurement determines learning progress and fault detection capability

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational overhead of MI estimation for diagnostic capabilities without requiring architectural modifications. Higher dimensional state spaces increase MI estimation complexity but provide more detailed fault signatures. Real-time monitoring requires efficient MI approximation methods.

**Failure Signatures:** Sensor faults show broad MI collapses across all channels; actuator faults selectively reduce action-outcome MI while preserving state-action MI; learning failures show stagnant MI(S;A) growth despite environmental interaction.

**First Experiments:** (1) Validate MI growth tracking on standard RL benchmarks with known learning curves. (2) Inject controlled sensor noise at varying severities to test diagnostic precision. (3) Test actuator fault detection across different control tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework assumes idealized fault characteristics that may not generalize to real-world non-Gaussian noise patterns
- Mutual information measurements assume stationary distributions during analysis windows
- Diagnostic precision requires validation across broader fault spectra beyond sensor/actuator failures
- Relationship between MI growth and task performance may not hold universally across different reward structures

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core diagnostic framework works for the specific robotic arm task studied
- Medium confidence: Diagnostic generalizability to non-robotic control tasks
- Low confidence: Framework performance under non-stationary conditions and partial observability

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on non-robotic control tasks with different state-action dimensionality and observation noise characteristics to verify diagnostic generalizability.
2. Implement controlled fault injection across multiple severity levels and fault types to measure false positive/negative rates in the information-theoretic detection system.
3. Validate the framework under non-stationary conditions where both the policy and environment distributions evolve simultaneously during extended training runs.
