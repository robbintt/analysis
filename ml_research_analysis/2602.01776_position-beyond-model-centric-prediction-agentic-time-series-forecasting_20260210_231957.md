# Position: Beyond Model-Centric Prediction -- Agentic Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01776
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01776
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Reframes time series forecasting as an agentic process enabling autonomous adaptation, reasoning, and experience accumulation beyond single-model prediction.

## Executive Summary
This position paper challenges the sufficiency of conventional model-centric forecasting for adaptive, multi-turn settings, arguing that context selection, reasoning, and iterative refinement are essential. It proposes viewing time series forecasting as an agentic process involving perception, planning, action, reflection, and memory, rather than a single-pass model execution. This shift enables autonomous tool interaction, continual adaptation, and experience accumulation, with progress moving from model iteration to system-level and tool evolution.

## Method Summary
The paper outlines three implementation paradigms for agentic time series forecasting: workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and a hybrid AgentFlow approach. It advocates for integrating heterogeneous learning methods (symbolic, statistical, deep) and enabling expert-like reasoning and decision support. The framework emphasizes modeling complex and dynamic scenarios, supporting human-agent collaboration, and achieving experience-driven transfer.

## Key Results
- Agentic forecasting enables autonomous tool interaction and continual adaptation beyond static model prediction
- Three implementation paradigms proposed: workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and hybrid AgentFlow
- Integration of heterogeneous learning methods enables expert-like reasoning and decision support capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The agentic approach works by decomposing forecasting into a dynamic process of perception (observing data), planning (selecting context and tools), action (executing forecasts), reflection (evaluating results), and memory (accumulating experiences). This enables the system to iteratively refine predictions, select relevant context, and adapt to changing conditions—capabilities absent in static model-centric approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Agentic Process Design** (why needed: Enables dynamic adaptation beyond static models; quick check: Implement iterative refinement loop)
- **Memory Architecture** (why needed: Stores and retrieves forecasting-relevant context; quick check: Test context retrieval relevance)
- **Tool Integration** (why needed: Supports autonomous interaction with external systems; quick check: Validate tool selection and execution)
- **Multi-turn Reasoning** (why needed: Enables context selection and iterative improvement; quick check: Measure performance in dynamic scenarios)
- **Experience Accumulation** (why needed: Facilitates transfer learning and adaptation; quick check: Test knowledge transfer across datasets)
- **Heterogeneous Learning Integration** (why needed: Combines strengths of different methods; quick check: Evaluate interoperability performance)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Perception -> Planning -> Action -> Reflection -> Memory -> Planning

**Critical Path**: Data input → Context selection → Tool execution → Forecast generation → Result evaluation → Memory update

**Design Tradeoffs**: Flexibility vs. complexity in agent design; real-time performance vs. thorough reflection; memory size vs. retrieval efficiency

**Failure Signatures**: Poor context selection leading to irrelevant forecasts; inadequate memory causing repeated mistakes; tool selection failures causing execution errors

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement a minimal prototype of the AgentFlow paradigm and evaluate its forecasting accuracy and adaptation speed on a standard benchmark
2. Design and test a memory architecture for storing and retrieving forecasting-relevant context across sessions
3. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing agentic forecasting against state-of-the-art single-pass models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to design effective memory systems for storing and retrieving forecasting-relevant context
- What toolkit standardization approaches enable seamless tool integration
- How to coordinate multiple agents in collaborative forecasting scenarios
- What reliability and safety measures are needed for real-world deployment
- How to achieve efficient experience-driven transfer across domains

## Limitations
- Claims about autonomous tool interaction and experience accumulation lack empirical validation
- AgentFlow paradigm introduced conceptually but not instantiated or tested
- Integration of heterogeneous learning methods mentioned without evidence of interoperability
- Key challenges acknowledged but not addressed with concrete solutions

## Confidence
- Agentic forecasting enabling autonomous tool interaction: Low confidence (aspirational, unverified)
- AgentFlow paradigm practical feasibility: Low confidence (conceptual, untested)
- Heterogeneous learning method integration: Low confidence (mentioned, not demonstrated)
- Expert-like reasoning support: Medium confidence (plausible, unverified)
- Memory design and toolkit standardization: Medium confidence (acknowledged challenges, no solutions)
- Multi-agent coordination and safety: Medium confidence (recognized as important, unaddressed)

## Next Checks
1. Implement a minimal prototype of the AgentFlow paradigm and evaluate its forecasting accuracy and adaptation speed on a standard benchmark (e.g., M4, electricity demand)
2. Design and test a memory architecture for storing and retrieving forecasting-relevant context across sessions, measuring retrieval relevance and impact on prediction quality
3. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing agentic forecasting (with iterative refinement and tool use) against state-of-the-art single-pass models, focusing on performance in dynamic or multi-step-ahead scenarios
