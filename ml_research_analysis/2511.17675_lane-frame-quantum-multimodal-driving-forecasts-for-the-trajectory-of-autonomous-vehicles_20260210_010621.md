# Lane-Frame Quantum Multimodal Driving Forecasts for the Trajectory of Autonomous Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17675
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17675
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Achieves minADE of 1.94 m and minFDE of 3.56 m over a 2.0 s horizon on Waymo Open Motion Dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a compact hybrid quantum architecture for multi-modal trajectory forecasting in autonomous driving. The model operates in an ego-centric, lane-aligned frame and predicts residual corrections to a kinematic baseline, using a transformer-inspired quantum attention encoder (9 qubits), a parameter-lean quantum feedforward stack (64 layers, ~1200 trainable angles), and a Fourier-based decoder that generates 16 trajectory hypotheses in a single pass. The system is trained with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) to handle the non-analytic quantum components. On the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the model achieves minADE of 1.94 m and minFDE of 3.56 m over a 2.0 s horizon, outperforming a kinematic baseline with reduced miss rates and strong recall.

## Method Summary
The proposed architecture leverages a lane-aligned, ego-centric reference frame to encode agent trajectories as residuals from a kinematic baseline. A quantum attention encoder with 9 qubits processes these residuals, followed by a shallow quantum feedforward stack of 64 layers with controlled-Z entanglement and about 1200 trainable angles. A Fourier-based decoder generates 16 multi-modal trajectory hypotheses using truncated basis expansions and a spectrum-based ranking mechanism. The model is trained end-to-end using SPSA, an optimization method suitable for non-analytic quantum gradients. Evaluation is performed on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, comparing minADE, minFDE, miss rates, and recall against a kinematic baseline and other methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves minADE of 1.94 m and minFDE of 3.56 m over a 2.0 s horizon on Waymo Open Motion Dataset
- Outperforms kinematic baseline with reduced miss rates and strong recall
- Ablations confirm residual learning, truncated Fourier decoding, shallow entanglement, and spectrum-based ranking are effective

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid quantum architecture combines the representational power of quantum circuits with classical optimization, using a lane-frame residual learning approach to focus model capacity on correction rather than full trajectory generation. The quantum attention and feedforward layers provide compact, expressive feature extraction, while the Fourier decoder efficiently generates diverse multi-modal hypotheses. SPSA enables gradient-free optimization suitable for quantum circuits. The lane-aligned frame and spectrum-based ranking further improve robustness and interpretability.

## Foundational Learning

**Quantum Attention Encoder**
- Why needed: Enables compact, expressive encoding of trajectory residuals using quantum superposition
- Quick check: 9 qubits process agent features, preserving spatial and temporal structure

**Quantum Feedforward Stack**
- Why needed: Deep quantum network for high-dimensional residual corrections
- Quick check: 64 layers with controlled-Z entanglement and ~1200 trainable angles

**Fourier-Based Decoder**
- Why needed: Efficiently generates diverse trajectory hypotheses via truncated basis expansion
- Quick check: Single-pass generation of 16 multi-modal trajectories using spectrum-based ranking

**Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA)**
- Why needed: Gradient-free optimizer for non-analytic quantum gradients
- Quick check: Handles the discontinuous nature of quantum measurement and enables end-to-end training

**Lane-Aligned, Ego-Centric Frame**
- Why needed: Focuses model capacity on residual corrections, improves robustness to lane changes
- Quick check: Residuals computed from kinematic baseline in agent-centric coordinates

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input -> Quantum Attention Encoder (9 qubits) -> Quantum Feedforward Stack (64 layers) -> Fourier Decoder -> 16 Trajectory Hypotheses

**Critical Path**
Input features are encoded as residuals in the lane-aligned frame, processed by quantum attention and feedforward layers, then decoded via truncated Fourier expansion and ranked by spectrum-based method to produce final trajectory hypotheses.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Quantum circuits provide compact expressiveness but require gradient-free optimization (SPSA)
- Residual learning in lane frame focuses capacity but assumes reliable kinematic baseline
- Truncated Fourier decoder is efficient but may limit long-horizon diversity
- Shallow entanglement balances expressivity and trainability

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance on out-of-distribution traffic scenarios or sensor noise
- Convergence issues with SPSA or suboptimal trajectory diversity from Fourier truncation
- Sensitivity to hyperparameters of quantum circuits or SPSA

**3 First Experiments**
1. Ablate quantum attention and feedforward against classical transformer equivalents
2. Test robustness to unseen traffic densities and sensor noise
3. Analyze SPSA convergence, runtime, and sensitivity to hyperparameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No ablation or comparison to isolate quantum components' contribution versus classical models
- SPSA optimizer convergence, sensitivity, and comparison to gradient-based methods not detailed
- Generalization to unseen traffic scenarios or sensor noise not demonstrated; evaluation confined to Waymo dataset
- Fourier decoder truncation's impact on trajectory diversity and realism at longer horizons not quantified

## Confidence

**High**
- Architecture design is internally consistent and well-motivated
- Reported metrics (minADE, minFDE, miss rate, recall) are standard and computation method is clear

**Medium**
- Outperformance over kinematic baseline and specific gains from architectural choices are supported by ablation results
- Lack of comparison to state-of-the-art classical models or quantum-specific hyperparameter ablations

**Low**
- Claims about quantum efficiency, SPSA robustness, and practical deployment feasibility not substantiated by runtime or cross-dataset validation

## Next Checks
1. Perform controlled ablations comparing quantum attention and feedforward layers against classical transformer equivalents, isolating the impact of quantum operations on forecasting accuracy and efficiency
2. Evaluate model robustness by testing on datasets with varying traffic densities, weather conditions, or sensor noise profiles to assess generalization beyond the Waymo dataset
3. Conduct a detailed analysis of SPSA convergence, including sensitivity to hyperparameters, runtime, and comparison with gradient-based optimizers on the quantum components
