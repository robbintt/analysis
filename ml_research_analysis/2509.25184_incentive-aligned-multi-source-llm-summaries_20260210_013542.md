# Incentive-Aligned Multi-Source LLM Summaries

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25184
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25184
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Truthful Text Summarization (TTS) framework significantly improves factual accuracy in multi-source LLM summaries while aligning source incentives with truthful reporting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Truthful Text Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework for LLM-driven multi-source summarization that addresses the critical problem of unreliable sources and strategic manipulation. TTS decomposes documents into atomic claims, elicits each source's stance on every claim, and employs a multi-task peer prediction mechanism that rewards informative corroboration. The framework filters out low-scoring, unreliable sources before re-summarizing, structurally aligning source incentives with truthful reporting. The approach demonstrates substantial improvements in factual accuracy (up to 70.7% on NQ and 74.3% on ClashEval) while preventing uninformative equilibria and ensuring robust performance against adversarial or deceptive content.

## Method Summary
TTS operates through a structured pipeline that begins with document decomposition into atomic claims, followed by systematic stance elicitation from each source regarding these claims. The core innovation lies in the multi-task peer prediction mechanism that scores sources based on their ability to provide informative corroboration across multiple claims simultaneously. This scoring system creates an incentive structure where truthful reporting becomes the optimal strategy for sources seeking inclusion in the final summary. The framework filters out sources with low scores before generating the final summary, ensuring only reliable, high-quality contributions are incorporated. The approach combines theoretical rigor with practical implementation, providing both formal guarantees of incentive alignment and demonstrable improvements in summary quality.

## Key Results
- TTS achieves answer accuracy up to 70.7% on Natural Questions and 74.3% on ClashEval datasets
- The framework significantly improves factual accuracy and precision compared to baseline summarization methods
- TTS demonstrates robustness against adversarial and deceptive content while preventing uninformative equilibria

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a closed-loop incentive system where source behavior directly impacts their probability of inclusion in the final summary. By decomposing documents into atomic claims and requiring sources to take stances on each, TTS transforms subjective reporting into objective, verifiable contributions. The multi-task peer prediction mechanism evaluates sources not just on individual claims but on their overall pattern of corroboration across the document, making it difficult to game the system through selective truth-telling. This structure ensures that sources are rewarded for comprehensive, truthful reporting rather than cherry-picking favorable information. The filtering mechanism then naturally selects for sources that consistently provide accurate information, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of quality improvement.

## Foundational Learning
- **Peer Prediction Mechanisms**: Reward systems that incentivize truthful reporting by scoring sources based on their ability to predict others' responses. Why needed: Traditional summarization lacks mechanisms to distinguish truthful from strategic sources. Quick check: Can sources be scored based on their information value rather than just content accuracy?

- **Atomic Claim Decomposition**: Breaking complex documents into verifiable, independent factual statements. Why needed: Enables systematic evaluation of source reliability across multiple dimensions. Quick check: Does decomposition preserve semantic relationships while enabling granular verification?

- **Multi-Task Scoring**: Evaluating sources across multiple simultaneous claims rather than individual statements. Why needed: Prevents gaming through selective reporting and captures overall reliability patterns. Quick check: Does multi-task evaluation provide better discrimination than single-task approaches?

- **Incentive Alignment Theory**: Designing systems where individual rational behavior leads to collective optimal outcomes. Why needed: Ensures the summarization process naturally selects for truthful sources. Quick check: Does the scoring mechanism make truthful reporting the dominant strategy?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Document -> Atomic Claims -> Stance Elicitation -> Peer Prediction Scoring -> Source Filtering -> Summary Generation

**Critical Path**: The core workflow follows: document decomposition → claim-by-claim stance elicitation → multi-task peer scoring → source filtering → final summary generation. Each stage builds directly on the previous output.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances computational overhead against accuracy gains - more granular claim decomposition improves reliability but increases processing costs. The peer prediction mechanism trades simplicity for robustness against manipulation.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when sources collude, when claim decomposition fails to capture nuance, or when the peer prediction mechanism cannot distinguish between genuinely informative and strategically evasive responses.

**3 First Experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison without source filtering on NQ dataset, 2) Single-task vs multi-task scoring evaluation, 3) Stress test with adversarial sources designed to maximize peer prediction scores through deception

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees depend on idealized assumptions about source behavior and claim structure that may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Computational overhead of document decomposition and stance elicitation may become prohibitive with complex documents or high claim counts
- Evaluation focused on structured datasets (NQ and ClashEval), limiting generalizability to unstructured or highly noisy real-world sources
- Peer prediction mechanism assumes source independence and rationality, which may not reflect complex real-world motivations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Claims about improved factual accuracy and precision on evaluated datasets (NQ and ClashEval)
- **Medium Confidence**: Theoretical guarantees of informed and strong truthfulness - depend on idealized assumptions
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about preventing uninformative equilibria - supported by theory but practical stability unproven

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset robustness testing**: Evaluate TTS performance on datasets with higher source noise, conflicting information density, and less structured content to assess generalizability beyond NQ and ClashEval.

2. **Scalability analysis**: Measure computational overhead and performance degradation as document length and claim count increase to quantify practical deployment constraints.

3. **Behavioral validation**: Conduct user studies with human annotators to verify that the incentive structure actually drives more truthful source behavior rather than gaming the scoring mechanism through other means.
