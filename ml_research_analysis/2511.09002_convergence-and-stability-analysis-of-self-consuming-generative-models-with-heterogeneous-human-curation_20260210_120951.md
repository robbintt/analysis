# Convergence and Stability Analysis of Self-Consuming Generative Models with Heterogeneous Human Curation

- This paper studies convergence and stability of iterative retraining dynamics in generative models with heterogeneous human preferences, extending prior work to a more realistic setting where preferences are noisy and differ across raters.

## Executive Summary
This paper analyzes the convergence and stability of iterative generative model retraining under human curation, where raters provide noisy Plackett-Luce preferences over candidate outputs. The authors extend prior work by considering heterogeneous preferences across raters and four distinct retraining regimes based on whether reference data is mixed in and whether the candidate pool is finite or infinite. Using techniques from nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, the paper establishes convergence guarantees in various metrics (KL divergence, Total Variation, Hilbert projective metric) and demonstrates that reference mixing is essential for stability against reward perturbations.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes four regimes of generative model retraining dynamics: (i) pure retraining with infinite candidate pool, (ii) pure retraining with finite candidate pool, (iii) regularized retraining with finite candidate pool and reference mixing, and (iv) regularized retraining with infinite candidate pool. The dynamics follow an iterative population update $p_{t+1} \propto \alpha p_{ref} + (1-\alpha) p_t H_K^{p_t}$, where $H_K$ is a choice kernel derived from Plackett-Luce preferences. The analysis employs contraction mapping arguments, Hilbert projective metric convergence, and stability analysis through sensitivity to bounded reward perturbations. Convergence is established in different metrics depending on the regime, with regularization shown to be crucial for stability.

## Key Results
- Convergence in KL divergence and total variation for unregularized loops to the reward-maximizing set
- Geometric convergence under sufficient reference mixing (α > (K-1)/K) in finite-pool case
- Hilbert-projective-metric convergence in infinite-pool case with reference mixing
- Stability guarantees against bounded reward perturbations when reference mixing is applied
- Instability to small reward noise in unregularized dynamics, highlighting necessity of reference data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The convergence mechanism relies on the contraction properties of the choice kernel operators under different metrics. In unregularized regimes, the dynamics converge to degenerate distributions concentrated on reward-maximizing regions. Regularization with reference mixing introduces sufficient "noise" to prevent collapse and create contractive dynamics. The Hilbert projective metric provides a natural framework for analyzing these nonlinear operators, showing that reference mixing creates a strict contraction that guarantees geometric convergence to a unique fixed point.

## Foundational Learning

**Nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory** - Provides mathematical framework for analyzing convergence of nonlinear operators on cones. Needed to establish contraction properties of choice kernels and prove convergence to fixed points. Quick check: Verify operator T satisfies monotonicity and homogeneity properties.

**Plackett-Luce choice model** - Models human preferences as noisy selections from candidate sets. Needed to derive the choice kernel H_K that governs the population update dynamics. Quick check: Confirm the kernel formulation correctly captures heterogeneous preference noise.

**Hilbert projective metric** - A metric on positive cones that captures contraction properties for nonlinear operators. Needed to prove convergence in infinite-pool regime where traditional metrics fail. Quick check: Verify the reference mixing parameter α satisfies contraction condition α > (K-1)/K.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Initial distribution p₀ → Choice kernel H_K → Population update operator → Converged distribution p*

**Critical path:** The population update equation p_{t+1} ∝ α p_ref + (1-α) p_t H_K^{p_t} represents the core computational pathway, with the choice kernel H_K being the critical component that determines convergence behavior.

**Design tradeoffs:** The main tradeoff is between purity of optimization (α = 0) and stability/robustness (α > 0). Higher α ensures stability but slows convergence and introduces bias toward the reference distribution. The finite vs infinite pool distinction affects the mathematical tools available for analysis.

**Failure signatures:** Non-convergence manifests as oscillatory or divergent behavior in TV distance, while instability to reward perturbations appears as complete shifts in the limiting distribution with small changes to r(x). The choice kernel must be estimated from population distributions, introducing sampling error in practice.

**3 first experiments:**
1. Verify collapse to reward-maximizing set in unregularized dynamics (α=0) on simple discrete space
2. Test geometric convergence in TV for regularized finite-pool case with varying α
3. Demonstrate instability to reward perturbations in unregularized vs stable behavior in regularized regimes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Is the geometric convergence rate for Regime (iii) sharp, and does the convergence behavior change at the threshold α = (K-1)/K? The paper establishes geometric convergence only when α > (K-1)/K, leaving boundary behavior undefined. Evidence would require lower bounds on convergence rate or counterexamples showing polynomial decay at critical threshold.

**Open Question 2:** Do convergence guarantees for Regimes (i) and (iii) hold under nonstationary preference noise (Setting S1) rather than stationary noise (Setting S2)? Theorems 4.3 and 4.6 rely on stationary noise, but it's unclear if sufficient heterogeneity in S1 would disrupt convergence. Evidence would require extending proofs to S1 or identifying heterogeneity thresholds that cause divergence.

**Open Question 3:** Do retraining dynamics converge when reference mixing weight is insufficient (α ≤ (K-1)/K) in finite-pool regime? The Banach contraction argument fails for small α, making dynamics appear unstable. Evidence would require proving convergence using alternative metrics or finding counterexamples where dynamics diverge.

## Limitations

- Results rely on idealized population-level dynamics assuming perfect choice kernel estimation
- Contraction conditions require reference mixing weight α > (K-1)/K, which becomes impractical for large candidate pools
- Convergence guarantees depend on strong assumptions about reward function stability and noise field stationarity
- Limited practical validation on synthetic or real data; theoretical focus may not capture finite-sample effects

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Theorem 3.1 (convergence to reward-maximizing set), Theorem 5.1 (stability under bounded perturbations), and general framework connecting nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory to generative model retraining
- **Medium confidence:** Contraction mapping arguments in Theorems 4.6 and 4.7, which depend on abstract conditions and noise field stationarity
- **Low confidence:** Practical implications for real-world generative model training, as results assume perfect kernel estimation and don't account for model capacity limits or reward hacking

## Next Checks

1. Implement update dynamics on discrete 1D mixture of Gaussians to verify geometric convergence in TV for α > (K-1)/K
2. Test stability of regularized dynamics under varying preference noise levels (S1 vs S2) to quantify robustness bounds
3. Evaluate practical feasibility of contraction condition α > (K-1)/K for realistic candidate pool sizes (K=10, 50, 100)
