# Topologically-Stabilized Graph Neural Networks: Empirical Robustness Across Domains

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13852
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13852
- Authors: Jelena Losic
- Reference count: 30
- One-line primary result: Combines GIN with topological features and HK-stability loss to achieve 0-4% accuracy drop under 5% edge perturbations across six graph datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks to structural perturbations by introducing a topologically-stabilized framework. The core method combines GIN architectures with multi-scale topological features extracted from persistence images and enforces stability regularization inspired by Hiraoka-Kusano theory. The approach integrates tools from topological data analysis with modern deep learning to provide theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness.

## Method Summary
The framework computes multi-scale topological features from persistence images and integrates them with GIN backbones. For each graph, all-pairs shortest paths are computed via Floyd-Warshall, Vietoris-Rips complexes are built up to radius r₁, and persistence diagrams are extracted for H₀ and H₁. These are windowed to [r₀, r₁] and converted to 10×10 persistence images via Gaussian kernel, flattened to 200-dim vectors. During training, perturbed graph copies with edges flipped at probability p are processed alongside originals, and a HK-stability loss enforces that prediction changes cannot exceed L_π times the topological shift. The model is trained with AdamW, lr=1e-3, and evaluated on six TUDataset benchmarks under 5% edge perturbation.

## Key Results
- Zero accuracy drop on REDDIT-BINARY dataset under 5% edge perturbation
- 0-4% performance degradation on most datasets compared to significant drops in baseline GNNs
- Outperforms baseline stability methods while maintaining competitive clean accuracy
- Ablation shows topological features alone improve noisy accuracy from 0.698 to 0.721 on PROTEINS

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Persistence Image Topological Encoding
Multi-scale topological features provide robustness to structural perturbations by encoding global invariants that change continuously under small graph modifications. Floyd-Warshall computes all-pairs shortest paths → Vietoris-Rips complex built up to radius r₁ → Persistence diagrams extracted for H₀ and H₁ → Windowed to [r₀, r₁] → Converted to 10×10 persistence images via Gaussian kernel → Flattened to 200-dim vector per graph. Perturbations that significantly affect GNN predictions do not proportionally alter persistent homology features; the chosen window [0.4, 1.2] captures the relevant topological scale for the domain.

### Mechanism 2: HK-Stability Loss Regularization
Lipschitz-constrained training bounds prediction changes relative to topological perturbations, providing certified stability. During training, each graph G has a perturbed counterpart G' with edges flipped at probability p → Both processed to produce logits ℓₒ, ℓₚ and topo vectors → Loss = max{0, ‖ℓₒ − ℓₚ‖₂ − L_π·‖topoₒ − topoₚ‖₂} → Enforces that prediction shifts cannot exceed L_π times the topological shift. The topological distance ‖topoₒ − topoₚ‖ is a meaningful proxy for structural perturbation magnitude; L_π = 0.5 is appropriate across domains.

### Mechanism 3: Late-Stage Feature Fusion
Concatenating GIN embeddings with topological features preserves local message-passing expressivity while adding global invariants. GIN backbone → global add pool → g_struct (64-dim) ‖ g_topo from SN Linear(ReLU(topo)) → SN Linear → ELU → Dropout → Classification head. Topological features provide complementary information not captured by GIN's message passing; spectral normalization (SN) on fusion layers is necessary for stability guarantees.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Persistent Homology (H₀, H₁, Persistence Diagrams)**
  - Why needed here: Core representation; you cannot debug or tune window parameters without understanding what birth/death pairs mean.
  - Quick check question: Given a graph's shortest-path distance matrix, can you explain what a persistence diagram point at (b=0.5, d=1.2) in H₁ represents?

- **Concept: Message Passing in GNNs (GIN variant)**
  - Why needed here: Backbone architecture; understanding what GIN captures vs. misses explains why topological augmentation helps.
  - Quick check question: How does GIN's aggregation differ from GCN, and why is it equivalent to the Weisfeiler-Lehman test?

- **Concept: Lipschitz Continuity for Certified Robustness**
  - Why needed here: HK-stability loss enforces a Lipschitz constraint; understanding certification requires grasping the margin/(L_π·d) formula.
  - Quick check question: If L_π = 0.5 and topological distance doubles, by what factor must the classification margin increase to maintain the same certified radius?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Graph → Floyd-Warshall → Persistence Image (H₀, H₁) → Topo Encoder (SN Linear) → ↓ Node Features → GIN (2 layers) → Global Pool → G_struct → Concat → Classifier; Perturbed Graph (p=0.05-0.1) → Same Pipeline → HK-Stability Loss

- **Critical path:**
  1. Verify persistence image generation produces 200-dim vectors (2 channels × 10×10)
  2. Confirm spectral normalization on all fusion/classifier layers (required for Lipschitz bounds)
  3. Check that ℓₒ and ℓₚ use shared weights (same forward pass, different input)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Window [r₀, r₁]: Narrower windows focus on specific scales but may miss relevant topology; wider windows increase computation and noise sensitivity
  - Resolution (10×10): Lower resolution loses discriminative power; higher resolution increases memory and may overfit small datasets
  - Lipschitz constant L_π: Smaller values enforce tighter stability but may underfit; larger values relax constraints toward standard training
  - Perturbation probability p: Training-time p should match or exceed expected test-time perturbations, but excessive p degrades clean accuracy

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Clean accuracy significantly below baseline GIN → Check if topological features are misaligned (wrong window, resolution too low)
  - No robustness gain despite low stability loss → L_π may be too large; topological distance may be near-zero for all perturbations
  - Instability during training → Verify spectral normalization; check for NaN in persistence image computation (edge case: empty filtration)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train vanilla GIN vs. TopoGIN without stability loss (λ_kld=0, L_stab weight=0) on PROTEINS; verify topological features alone improve noisy accuracy
  2. Disable stability loss, then disable topological features, then both; compare degradation patterns to isolate contribution of each mechanism
  3. Evaluate on REDDIT-BINARY with perturbation rates {1%, 5%, 10%, 20%}; plot accuracy drop curve to identify the regime where topological robustness breaks down

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the topologically-stabilized framework scale to graphs with tens or hundreds of thousands of nodes? RQ4 ("How scalable is our method to larger graph datasets?") was posed but not answered; the largest evaluated dataset (REDDIT-BINARY) averages only ~430 nodes. No experiments on large-scale graphs; computational cost of computing persistent homology via Floyd-Warshall and persistence images may become prohibitive. Empirical runtime and accuracy results on large-scale benchmark datasets (e.g., ogbn-products, PPI) with node counts in the 10K–1M range would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How can the certification radius be refined to provide tight, reliable robustness guarantees? "While the certification metric requires further refinement (as noted in our limitations), the empirical robustness demonstrated..." The proposed proxy certified radius (margin/(L_π·dPI_1)) is acknowledged to need refinement; no theoretical bounds or rigorous calibration are provided. Formal certification analysis with proven bounds and empirical calibration showing certified radius correlates with observed adversarial robustness would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How robust is the method to perturbation types beyond random edge flipping (e.g., node injection, feature attacks, structured adversarial perturbations)? Only one perturbation type (5% edge perturbation) was tested; real-world attacks include node injection, attribute modification, and meta-learning-based adversarial strategies. Structural stability via persistent homology may behave differently under targeted attacks. Evaluation under diverse attack models (Nettack, Mettack, node injection) with comparison to specialized defenses would resolve this.

### Open Question 4
How sensitive is performance to topological hyperparameters (window [r₀, r₁], PI resolution σ, Lipschitz constant L_π)? Fixed values (r₀=0.4, r₁=1.2, res=10×10) were used without ablation; stability guarantees depend on these choices. No hyperparameter sensitivity analysis; optimal settings likely vary across domains (biochemical vs. social networks). Systematic ablation across hyperparameter values with clean/noisy accuracy and certified radius reporting would resolve this.

## Limitations
- HK-stability loss relies on persistence images as structural perturbation proxy without full theoretical justification
- Evaluation limited to edge perturbations, leaving node attribute attacks and complex structural changes unverified
- Fixed topological hyperparameters used without sensitivity analysis across domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Topological feature extraction pipeline (Floyd-Warshall → Vietoris-Rips → persistence images) is technically sound and well-supported by topological data analysis literature
- **Medium confidence**: Integration of topological features with GIN backbones improves robustness, but contribution of each component (feature fusion vs. stability regularization) is not cleanly isolated
- **Low confidence**: HK-stability loss provides certified robustness guarantees; while Lipschitz formulation is valid, connection between topological distance and meaningful perturbation magnitude needs more rigorous validation

## Next Checks
1. Verify that the Hiraoka-Kusano stability framework directly supports the specific loss formulation used, or identify the closest established theoretical guarantees
2. Design an experiment that trains with topological features but without stability loss, and vice versa, to quantify individual contributions to robustness
3. Test the framework on datasets with different topological characteristics (e.g., molecular graphs vs. social networks) to assess whether the fixed window [0.4, 1.2] is universally appropriate
