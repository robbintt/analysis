# SEA-SafeguardBench: Evaluating AI Safety in Southeast Asian Languages and Cultures

## Quick Facts

- SEA-SafeguardBench is the first culturally grounded multilingual safety benchmark for Southeast Asian languages

## Executive Summary
SEA-SafeguardBench introduces a novel benchmark designed to evaluate AI safety guardrails in Southeast Asian (SEA) languages and cultures. The benchmark comprises 13,830 prompts and 7,810 responses across eight languages and 1,338 cultural topics, organized into three subsets: general, in-the-wild, and content generation. Evaluations on 20 safeguard models reveal consistent underperformance on SEA languages compared to English, with average AUPRC drops of 5.7–6.1 points. The benchmark highlights significant gaps in cultural awareness and sensitivity of current AI safety systems when applied to SEA contexts.

## Method Summary
The benchmark construction involved collecting and annotating prompts and responses across eight SEA languages, with careful attention to cultural nuances and sensitivities specific to each language and region. The dataset is organized into three distinct subsets to capture different aspects of safety concerns: general topics, real-world scenarios, and content generation scenarios. Each subset contains carefully curated prompts that test various dimensions of safety, including cultural appropriateness, harmful content detection, and context-aware filtering. The benchmark employs automated evaluation metrics, primarily AUPRC (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve), to measure the performance of safeguard models across different languages and cultural contexts.

## Key Results
- Safeguard models show 5.7-6.1 point average AUPRC drops when evaluated on SEA languages versus English
- Content generation subset shows the largest performance gap with 36.4 point AUPRC drop in English and 36.2 in SEA languages
- Cultural awareness incorporation improves model performance for those pretrained on culturally relevant data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by systematically exposing safety guardrails to culturally and linguistically diverse content that reflects real-world SEA scenarios. By creating a controlled environment with standardized prompts and responses across multiple languages, it enables fair comparison of safeguard model performance. The three subset structure allows for granular analysis of where safety systems fail - whether in general knowledge, real-world applications, or creative content generation. The cultural grounding ensures that safety evaluations account for context-specific norms and sensitivities that generic benchmarks might miss.

## Foundational Learning
1. Cross-lingual safety evaluation
   - Why needed: Standard safety benchmarks are predominantly English-centric, creating blind spots for multilingual systems
   - Quick check: Compare model performance metrics across language pairs using consistent evaluation criteria

2. Cultural context awareness
   - Why needed: Safety perceptions vary significantly across cultures, requiring region-specific calibration
3. Multilingual prompt engineering
   - Why needed: Direct translation often fails to capture cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions
   - Quick check: Validate translations with native speakers and cultural experts

4. Automated safety metrics
   - Why needed: Manual evaluation is impractical at scale for comprehensive benchmarking
   - Quick check: Correlate automated metrics with human judgments on sample datasets

5. Performance gap analysis
   - Why needed: Identifying specific areas where safety systems underperform enables targeted improvements
   - Quick check: Segment results by language family, cultural similarity, and content type

6. Threshold sensitivity
   - Why needed: Safety systems often rely on configurable thresholds that behave differently across languages
   - Quick check: Sweep threshold parameters and analyze impact on precision-recall tradeoffs

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Benchmark Data -> Evaluation Framework -> Safeguard Models -> Performance Metrics -> Analysis Pipeline

Critical path: Data collection and annotation → Benchmark construction → Model evaluation → Performance analysis → Cultural impact assessment

Design tradeoffs: The benchmark prioritizes comprehensive cultural coverage over depth in individual languages, resulting in broader but potentially shallower evaluation across the eight SEA languages.

Failure signatures: Models consistently misclassify culturally sensitive content as either clearly safe or harmful, indicating lack of nuanced understanding. Threshold sensitivity varies significantly across languages, with SEA languages showing more unstable performance curves.

Three first experiments:
1. Replicate English benchmark results using the same safeguard models to establish baseline performance
2. Compare cultural awareness benefits by testing models with and without SEA-specific pretraining
3. Analyze threshold sensitivity by sweeping decision thresholds and plotting precision-recall curves for each language

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The 1,338 cultural topics may not fully capture the complete linguistic and cultural diversity across all eight SEA languages
- Performance evaluation relies primarily on automated metrics without extensive human evaluation validation
- The study focuses on specific safeguard models (20 total) and may not reflect performance across the broader landscape of safety systems

## Confidence
- High confidence: Benchmark construction methodology and dataset statistics are well-documented and reproducible
- Medium confidence: Cross-lingual performance comparisons between SEA and English languages, as these are based on standardized metrics but may be influenced by benchmark-specific characteristics
- Medium confidence: Cultural awareness benefits for pretrained models, as the sample size and model selection may limit generalizability

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive human evaluation studies to validate automated AUPRC measurements and assess real-world safety performance
2. Expand benchmark coverage to include additional SEA languages and underrepresented cultural subgroups
3. Test performance across a broader range of safeguard architectures beyond the 20 models evaluated to establish more comprehensive performance baselines
