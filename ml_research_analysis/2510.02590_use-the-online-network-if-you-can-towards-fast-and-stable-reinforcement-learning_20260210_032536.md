# Use the Online Network If You Can: Towards Fast and Stable Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.02590
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02590
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: MINTO achieves consistent performance improvements across diverse RL benchmarks by using minimum estimates between online and target networks

## Executive Summary
MINTO addresses the fundamental stability-efficiency tradeoff in deep reinforcement learning by introducing a novel target computation method that leverages both online and target networks. The method takes the minimum estimate between these networks to mitigate overestimation bias while incorporating fresher online estimates. This approach seamlessly integrates into existing algorithms with negligible overhead and no additional hyperparameters. The method shows consistent improvements across multiple domains including Atari games, continuous control, and offline RL, with performance gains ranging from 7% to 125% depending on the task and algorithm.

## Method Summary
MINTO operates by computing target values using the minimum estimate between the online and target networks, addressing both overestimation bias and moving-target problems in deep RL. The core innovation lies in its simple yet effective modification to target computation, which maintains the stability benefits of target networks while incorporating the freshness of online network estimates. This approach is algorithm-agnostic and can be integrated into any value-based RL method that uses target networks. The method requires no additional hyperparameters and introduces minimal computational overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

## Key Results
- +18% AUC improvement on Atari benchmarks with standard CNN architecture
- +24% AUC improvement with IMPALA+LayerNorm architecture
- +125% performance gain in offline RL (CQL) with CNN architecture
- Improved sample efficiency in continuous control tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MINTO works by addressing two fundamental challenges in deep RL: overestimation bias and moving-target problems. By taking the minimum estimate between online and target networks, it prevents the network from learning overly optimistic value estimates that can destabilize training. The method preserves the stability benefits of target networks while incorporating the freshness of online network estimates, effectively balancing the tradeoff between learning speed and training stability. This dual approach mitigates the inherent tension between using stale but stable target networks and fresh but potentially noisy online networks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Overestimation bias in Q-learning**: Occurs when value estimates are systematically too high, leading to suboptimal policies and training instability. Understanding this is crucial because MINTO directly addresses this issue through its minimum estimation approach.
- **Target network stability**: Target networks provide stable learning targets by decoupling the target computation from the rapidly changing online network. This concept is fundamental to MINTO's design as it leverages target network stability while incorporating online network freshness.
- **Moving target problem**: Happens when the target values change too rapidly during training, causing instability. MINTO mitigates this by using the minimum estimate, which provides a more conservative and stable target.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Online Network -> Target Network -> MINTO Module -> Q-value Estimator

**Critical Path**: The critical path in MINTO involves computing the minimum estimate between the online and target networks for each state-action pair, then using this conservative estimate as the target for value function updates. This path must be optimized for computational efficiency since it's executed at every training step.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff is between conservatism (which improves stability but may slow learning) and optimism (which can accelerate learning but risks instability). MINTO's minimum estimation approach leans toward conservatism, which is particularly beneficial in early training phases when overestimation bias is most problematic.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failure modes include scenarios where the online network consistently underestimates values, leading to overly conservative policies. This might manifest as slow learning or suboptimal performance in environments where exploration is critical. Additionally, in highly stochastic environments, the minimum estimation might be too conservative, preventing the agent from learning optimal risk-sensitive policies.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify basic integration with a simple DQN implementation on a deterministic environment like CartPole. 2) Compare learning curves with and without MINTO on a standard Atari game (e.g., Breakout). 3) Test the method's impact on sample efficiency by measuring performance after fixed training steps.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope is relatively narrow, not tested on highly complex continuous control environments or long-horizon planning tasks
- Relative importance of each MINTO component across different environments remains unclear from ablation studies
- Real-world deployment considerations like memory usage and GPU utilization patterns are not discussed

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core mathematical formulation and integration mechanism are sound; Atari benchmark improvements (+18% AUC with CNN) are well-supported
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalization claims across algorithms and architectures are supported but based on limited environments; moving-target mitigation mechanism requires more validation
- **Medium Confidence**: "Seamless integration with negligible overhead" claim supported by computational analysis but lacks practical deployment assessment

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MINTO on complex continuous control benchmarks (Humanoid, Ant) and long-horizon tasks to verify generalization
2. Conduct detailed ablation studies across all tested algorithms to quantify relative contribution of each MINTO component
3. Measure memory usage, GPU utilization patterns, and wall-clock time impact in practical implementations to validate "negligible overhead" claim
