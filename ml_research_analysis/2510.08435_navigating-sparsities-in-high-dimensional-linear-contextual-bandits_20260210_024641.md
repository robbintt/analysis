# Navigating Sparsities in High-Dimensional Linear Contextual Bandits

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.08435
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08435
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** A unified framework (HOPE) for high-dimensional linear contextual bandits that handles both sparse parameters and sparse eigenvalues simultaneously.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of high-dimensional linear contextual bandits where the number of parameters $p$ can exceed the number of rounds $T$. Traditional methods struggle with the curse of dimensionality, especially when both model parameters and context covariance eigenvalues exhibit sparsity. The authors introduce a novel PointWise Estimator (PWE) that projects the estimation target from high-dimensional parameter space to a scalar coefficient, enabling dimensional reduction. Based on PWE, they propose HOPE, an algorithm that follows an explore-then-commit scheme. HOPE achieves improved regret bounds in homogeneous settings and, for the first time, efficiently handles two new challenging heterogeneous settings where sparsity types vary across arms.

## Method Summary
The HOPE algorithm uses an Explore-Then-Commit (ETC) strategy with a PointWise Estimator (PWE) at its core. During exploration, it collects $2N$ samples per arm, splitting them into two halves. The first half estimates the support set $S_1$ and initial parameter $\hat{\theta}$ using either Lasso or Ridgeless Least Squares. The second half, combined with the current context, constructs a sparsification matrix $\Gamma_t$ that projects the problem into a lower-dimensional space where the nuisance vector becomes approximately sparse. The PWE then solves a Lasso optimization in this $(N+1)$-dimensional space to estimate the scalar coefficient, which is used to predict the reward and select actions.

## Key Results
- HOPE achieves regret bounds of $O(T^{2/3}\text{polylog}(T))$ in homogeneous sparse parameter scenarios.
- In heterogeneous settings where arms have mixed sparsity structures, HOPE outperforms rigid baselines that assume uniform sparsity.
- The algorithm successfully navigates both sparse parameter and sparse eigenvalue structures, providing a unified framework for previously separate approaches.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dimensional Reduction via Scalar Projection
If the linear model is transformed to target the scalar reward directly rather than the high-dimensional parameter vector, the problem dimension reduces from $p$ (where $p \gg T$) to $N+1$ (where $N \ll p$), enabling tractable estimation. The PointWise Estimator (PWE) projects the estimation target from $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^p$ to $\alpha_t \in \mathbb{R}$ (the scalar coefficient scaling the expected reward). It decomposes the linear relationship $y = X\theta$ into $y = \sqrt{N}\alpha_t z_t + \sqrt{N}\zeta_t + \epsilon$, where $\zeta_t$ is a "nuisance" vector in the orthogonal space to the current context.

### Mechanism 2: Dual-Source Sparsification of Nuisance Vectors
If the nuisance vector $\zeta_t$ is transformed using a matrix $\Gamma_t$ constructed from both spectral eigenvectors and initial parameter estimates, the resulting vector becomes approximately sparse, allowing recovery via Lasso. The algorithm constructs $\Gamma_t$ by hybridizing two sources: (1) eigenvectors of the empirical covariance (exploiting sparse eigenvalues) and (2) an initial estimate of the parameter projection (exploiting sparse parameters).

### Mechanism 3: Adaptive Exploration-Commit Split
If the exploration length $T_0$ is tuned specifically for the underlying (unknown) sparsity type, the HOPE algorithm minimizes the sum of exploration cost and exploitation error. HOPE uses an Explore-Then-Commit (ETC) scheme. It collects $2N$ samples per arm, splits them for independence, and then commits to the greedy choice based on PWE estimates.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)**
  - **Why needed here:** Lasso serves a dual purpose in HOPE: (1) It provides the "Initial Estimator" and "Support Estimation" in sparse parameter scenarios (Section 4.1), and (2) it solves the final $N+1$ dimensional optimization problem in PWE (Section 4.4).
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why L1 regularization encourages sparsity in coefficient estimates compared to Ridge (L2)?

- **Concept: Ridgeless Least Squares (RDL)**
  - **Why needed here:** RDL is the alternative "Initial Estimator" used when the context covariance has sparse eigenvalues but parameters are dense. It enables the "benign overfitting" phenomenon required for spectral sparsity scenarios.
  - **Quick check question:** In an overparameterized regime ($N < p$), how does the minimum-norm solution behave on the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix?

- **Concept: Sub-Gaussian Concentration**
  - **Why needed here:** The theoretical guarantees (Assumption 1, Proposition 6) rely heavily on the contexts and noise being sub-Gaussian to ensure that empirical estimates concentrate around their means with high probability (logarithmic factors).
  - **Quick check question:** Does the algorithm require the noise variance $\sigma^2$ to be known, or just bounded?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Buffer -> Initializer -> Transformer -> Solver -> Selector
- **Critical path:** The construction of $\Gamma_t$ (Appendix C.2). This matrix bridges the gap between the high-dimensional raw data and the low-dimensional solvable system.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Data Splitting: The paper splits data into two halves ($N$ for initialization, $N$ for PWE). This ensures independence but halves the effective sample size for any single estimation step.
  - Estimator Choice: You must select the initial estimator (Lasso vs. RDL) based on assumptions about the domain.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Dense $\beta_t$: If the Lasso solver in step 4.4 returns a dense vector (many non-zeros in $\hat{\xi}_t$), the transformation $\Gamma_t$ failed to sparsify the nuisance.
  - Exploding Regret Early: If regret accumulates linearly for the first $T_0$ steps but flattens, exploration is too long; if it keeps rising, exploitation is failing.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Scenario Validation (Sparse Params): Run HOPE vs. Lasso-ETC on data with sparse $\theta$ and identity covariance. Verify HOPE matches the $T^{2/3}$ scaling.
  2. Heterogeneous Stress Test (Scenario 4): Configure arms with mixed structures (some sparse $\theta$, some sparse eigenvalues). Compare HOPE against "rigid" baselines.
  3. Ablation on $\Gamma_t$: Replace the hybrid $\Gamma_t$ with a pure spectral basis $\Gamma_{eg}$. Check if performance degrades in sparse-parameter settings.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the PointWise Estimator (PWE) and HOPE algorithm be extended to nonlinear reward models, such as kernel methods or neural networks?
- **Basis:** [explicit] Appendix I explicitly identifies the linearity assumption as a limitation and proposes extending pointwise estimation to nonlinear settings as a critical next step.
- **Why unresolved:** The current theoretical analysis relies on linear projection properties, and it is unclear how PWE would handle complex nonlinear patterns or provide regret guarantees in such spaces.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A derivation of PWE for nonlinear function classes (e.g., kernels) accompanied by a corresponding regret analysis.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can HOPE be adapted to use adaptive exploration strategies like UCB or Thompson Sampling instead of Explore-Then-Commit (ETC) to improve learning efficiency?
- **Basis:** [explicit] Appendix I notes that while ETC is effective, it may not fully exploit the advantages of adaptive exploration. It suggests integrating PWE with UCB or Thompson Sampling.
- **Why unresolved:** The authors note that deriving the necessary confidence intervals for PWE to support adaptive decision rules remains a challenge.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified HOPE algorithm utilizing adaptive exploration rules with proven regret bounds showing improved efficiency over the ETC scheme.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the HOPE framework be generalized to broader reinforcement learning settings, specifically contextual Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)?
- **Basis:** [explicit] Appendix I suggests applying pointwise estimation to RL domains to bridge insights between bandit theory and sequential decision-making.
- **Why unresolved:** Contextual bandits lack the state transition dynamics inherent in MDPs, and the high-dimensional state representations in RL introduce complexities not addressed by the current model.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical extension of PWE to contextual MDPs demonstrating efficient handling of high-dimensional state representations.

## Limitations
- The algorithm's performance degrades significantly if neither parameter sparsity nor eigenvalue sparsity holds.
- The choice of exploration length $N$ is critical and must be tuned to the unknown underlying sparsity type, with theory providing only asymptotic guidance on the optimal scaling.
- The algorithm's reliance on accurate support recovery through Lasso introduces sensitivity to the regularization parameter and potential instability if the initial estimator fails.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The theoretical regret bounds for homogeneous sparsity scenarios (Scenarios 1-3) are well-supported by the analysis. The dimensional reduction mechanism via scalar projection is mathematically sound under the stated assumptions.
- **Medium Confidence:** The extension to heterogeneous settings (Scenario 4) represents a novel contribution, but the theoretical analysis is less comprehensive, relying on combining existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new machinery.
- **Low Confidence:** The empirical validation is limited to synthetic settings with controlled parameters. Real-world applications with unknown or mixed sparsity structures may exhibit different performance characteristics not captured in the experiments.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Dense Models:** Systematically test HOPE on data where both parameter and eigenvalue structures are dense to quantify performance degradation when structural assumptions fail.
2. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct experiments varying the exploration length $N$ across orders of magnitude to identify the optimal scaling relationship and its dependence on the unknown sparsity type.
3. **Real-World Application:** Apply HOPE to a high-dimensional bandit problem from a real domain (e.g., recommendation systems or clinical trials) to evaluate performance beyond synthetic data.
