core_contribution: This paper introduces a framework called midpoint trees for generating
  geodesics (shortest paths) on manifolds with infinitesimally defined metrics. The
  method learns to predict midpoints between points recursively, generating paths
  by inserting predicted midpoints between adjacent pairs of previously generated
  waypoints.

# Generation of Geodesics with Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning to Predict Midpoints

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01991
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01991
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: Introduces midpoint trees for generating geodesics on manifolds using actor-critic reinforcement learning to predict midpoints

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for generating geodesics (shortest paths) on manifolds with infinitesimally defined metrics using actor-critic reinforcement learning. The method learns to predict midpoints between points recursively, building paths by inserting predicted midpoints between adjacent pairs of waypoints. The actor-critic architecture consists of an actor that predicts midpoints and a critic that predicts distances. Under mild assumptions, the authors prove that if training converges with infinite recursion depth, the resulting policy can generate true geodesics. Experiments on five path planning tasks demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, including goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and policy gradient methods without critics.

## Method Summary
The midpoint tree framework generates geodesics by recursively predicting midpoints between pairs of points on a manifold. Starting with an initial path, the method iteratively inserts predicted midpoints between adjacent waypoints, refining the path with each recursion. An actor-critic architecture is employed where the actor network predicts midpoints and the critic network predicts distances between points. The actor is trained to minimize the distance predicted by the critic between the two halves of the path created by the midpoint, while the critic is trained to predict accurate distances. The paper establishes theoretical guarantees that under certain conditions, this approach converges to true geodesics as recursion depth approaches infinity.

## Key Results
- The proposed method outperforms existing approaches including goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and policy gradient methods without critics
- Successfully solves path planning tasks involving complex kinematics and collision avoidance constraints that other methods fail to solve
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of the midpoint tree framework across five different path planning scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages the geometric property that a true geodesic's midpoint minimizes the sum of distances from the two endpoints. By recursively applying this principle through midpoint prediction and distance estimation, the framework gradually refines paths toward geodesic solutions. The actor-critic architecture provides a natural supervisory signal: the actor learns to predict midpoints that split paths into approximately equal-distance halves, while the critic provides distance feedback to guide this learning process. This recursive refinement process, combined with the theoretical convergence guarantees under certain assumptions, enables the generation of increasingly accurate geodesics with each recursion depth.

## Foundational Learning
- Manifolds and geodesics: Essential for understanding the geometric setting and the target paths being generated; quick check: verify understanding of how geodesics represent shortest paths on curved spaces
- Actor-critic reinforcement learning: The core algorithmic framework; quick check: ensure familiarity with how actors generate actions and critics evaluate them in RL
- Recursive path refinement: The iterative improvement strategy; quick check: understand how midpoint insertion progressively improves path quality
- Distance prediction in continuous spaces: Critical for the critic's role; quick check: grasp how distance functions guide the learning of geodesic paths

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input points -> Actor network (midpoint predictor) -> Predicted midpoint
Input points + midpoint -> Critic network (distance predictor) -> Distance estimates
Distance estimates -> Actor loss (minimize distance sum) -> Actor update
True distances (if available) -> Critic loss -> Critic update
Recursive midpoint insertion -> Refined path

Critical Path:
1. Initial path generation
2. Midpoint prediction by actor
3. Distance prediction by critic
4. Actor loss computation using critic output
5. Actor and critic parameter updates
6. Recursive midpoint insertion and path refinement

Design Tradeoffs:
- Recursion depth vs. computational cost: Deeper recursion yields better paths but increases computation exponentially
- Actor-critic balance: The critic must provide accurate distance guidance without overwhelming the actor's learning
- Generalization across manifolds: The method must learn to predict midpoints for various metric structures

Failure Signatures:
- Actor produces midpoints that don't reduce path length (critic supervision ineffective)
- Critic predictions diverge or become inaccurate during training
- Recursive insertion leads to path degradation rather than improvement
- Convergence to suboptimal local minima rather than true geodesics

First Experiments:
1. Verify midpoint prediction accuracy on simple linear paths before testing on manifolds
2. Test distance prediction accuracy of the critic on known geodesic segments
3. Evaluate path quality improvement with increasing recursion depth on a simple manifold

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical convergence relies on unspecified "mild assumptions" that may not hold in practice
- Scalability concerns for high-dimensional spaces where waypoint count grows exponentially
- Limited experimental comparison against specialized geometric methods and alternative path optimization approaches

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Method can generate true geodesics under infinite recursion depth | Medium |
| Experimental superiority over existing methods | Medium |
| Success on complex kinematics and collision avoidance where others fail | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on high-dimensional planning problems (e.g., 10+ dimensional configuration spaces) to evaluate scalability and computational efficiency.
2. Compare performance against specialized geometric methods (e.g., fast marching methods, Hamilton-Jacobi equations) on benchmark manifold planning tasks.
3. Analyze the sensitivity of convergence and path quality to the choice of actor-critic hyperparameters and the number of training samples.
