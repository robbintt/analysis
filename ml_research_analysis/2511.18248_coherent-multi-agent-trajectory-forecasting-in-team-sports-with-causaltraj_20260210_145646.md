# Coherent Multi-Agent Trajectory Forecasting in Team Sports with CausalTraj

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18248
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18248
- Authors: Wei Zhen Teoh
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: CausalTraj achieves state-of-the-art joint trajectory forecasting metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) and produces qualitatively more coherent gameplay evolutions.

## Executive Summary
CausalTraj introduces a temporally causal, likelihood-based approach to multi-agent trajectory forecasting in team sports, addressing the critical gap where high per-agent accuracy fails to translate into coherent joint predictions. The method predicts per-step displacements using a mixture-of-Gaussians output, enabling exact optimization of joint trajectory likelihoods. Key innovations include explicit pairwise spatial geometry modeling via a Spatial Relation Transformer Encoder and a causal training framework that allows step-by-step modeling of interdependent agent dynamics. Evaluated on NBA SportVU, Basketball-U, and Football-U datasets, CausalTraj achieves competitive per-agent accuracy and state-of-the-art joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE), while producing qualitatively coherent and realistic gameplay evolutions.

## Method Summary
CausalTraj addresses the challenge of producing coherent joint predictions in multi-agent trajectory forecasting by leveraging a temporally causal, likelihood-based model. The core idea is to predict per-step displacements rather than absolute positions, using a mixture-of-Gaussians output to enable exact optimization of joint trajectory likelihoods. The method introduces a Spatial Relation Transformer Encoder that explicitly models pairwise spatial geometry between agents, and a causal training framework that allows the model to capture interdependent agent dynamics in a step-by-step manner. This approach contrasts with existing methods that focus on per-agent accuracy but fail to ensure coherent joint predictions.

## Key Results
- CausalTraj achieves competitive per-agent accuracy and state-of-the-art joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) on NBA SportVU, Basketball-U, and Football-U datasets.
- The method produces qualitatively coherent and realistic gameplay evolutions, as evidenced by visual inspection.
- Ablation studies confirm the importance of both spatial relation modeling and mixture-based probabilistic outputs for joint forecasting performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CausalTraj's effectiveness stems from its temporally causal architecture, which predicts per-step displacements rather than absolute positions, allowing for exact optimization of joint trajectory likelihoods. The Spatial Relation Transformer Encoder explicitly models pairwise spatial geometry, capturing the complex interdependencies between agents. The mixture-of-Gaussians output enables the model to represent multi-modal trajectory distributions, crucial for realistic joint predictions. The causal training framework ensures that the model learns to reason step-by-step about interdependent agent dynamics, leading to more coherent joint forecasts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Pairwise Spatial Geometry**: Understanding the relative positions and interactions between agents is essential for modeling team dynamics and anticipating coordinated movements.
- **Temporal Causality**: Predicting trajectories step-by-step, rather than in a single forward pass, allows the model to account for the evolving dependencies between agents.
- **Mixture-of-Gaussians Output**: Representing trajectory uncertainty as a mixture of Gaussians enables the model to capture multi-modal distributions and produce more realistic joint predictions.
- **Spatial Relation Transformer**: This architecture allows the model to explicitly encode pairwise spatial relationships, which is critical for modeling complex team sports dynamics.
- **Joint Likelihood Optimization**: Optimizing the likelihood of entire trajectories, rather than per-agent predictions, ensures that the model produces coherent joint forecasts.
- **Causal Training Framework**: Step-by-step training encourages the model to learn interdependent agent dynamics, improving the coherence of joint predictions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Spatial Relation Transformer Encoder -> Mixture-of-Gaussians Output -> Causal Trajectory Predictor -> Joint Likelihood Optimization

**Critical Path**
The Spatial Relation Transformer Encoder processes pairwise spatial relationships between agents, feeding into the Mixture-of-Gaussians Output, which provides probabilistic trajectory predictions. The Causal Trajectory Predictor uses these predictions to generate per-step displacements, which are optimized for joint likelihood.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Pairwise spatial relation modeling enables explicit geometry capture but incurs quadratic scaling in computation and memory.
- Mixture-of-Gaussians output provides multi-modal trajectory distributions but increases model complexity.
- Temporal causality allows for step-by-step modeling of interdependent dynamics but may limit long-term prediction accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**
- Inconsistent joint predictions despite high per-agent accuracy.
- Inability to capture complex team dynamics due to limited spatial relation modeling.
- Overfitting to training data, leading to poor generalization to new scenarios.

**First Experiments**
1. Evaluate per-agent vs. joint prediction accuracy to quantify the benefit of the causal, joint likelihood approach.
2. Compare the Spatial Relation Transformer Encoder to alternative architectures for modeling pairwise spatial geometry.
3. Analyze the impact of the mixture-of-Gaussians output on trajectory uncertainty and realism.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns arise due to the quadratic scaling of pairwise spatial relation modeling with team size.
- The method's performance on sports with less structured trajectories or under significant sensor noise is not evaluated.
- The ablation studies do not fully isolate the contribution of each component to the final performance, leaving some uncertainty about the necessity of both the Spatial Relation Transformer and the mixture-of-Gaussians output.

## Confidence
- **High**: CausalTraj achieves state-of-the-art joint trajectory forecasting metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) on the tested datasets, given the quantitative results and direct comparisons provided.
- **Medium**: The model produces qualitatively more coherent and realistic gameplay evolutions, as this is based on visual inspection rather than objective metrics.
- **Low**: The generalizability of these results to other sports or noisier data, due to the absence of such evaluations.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CausalTraj on sports with less structured trajectories (e.g., hockey, rugby) and under simulated sensor noise to test robustness.
2. Conduct a systematic ablation study to quantify the independent contributions of the Spatial Relation Transformer and mixture-of-Gaussians output to joint forecasting accuracy.
3. Analyze the computational scaling of the pairwise spatial relation modeling as team size increases, and assess feasibility for larger or denser agent environments.
