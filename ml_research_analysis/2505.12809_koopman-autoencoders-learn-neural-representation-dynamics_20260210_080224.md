# Koopman Autoencoders Learn Neural Representation Dynamics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.12809
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12809
- Reference count: 12
- Introduces Koopman autoencoders for modeling neural representation dynamics

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for understanding neural network dynamics through the lens of Koopman operator theory. The approach treats neural representations as states in a dynamical system, learning a surrogate model that captures how representations evolve from input to output layers. By operating in a lifted observable space with linear dynamics, the framework enables straightforward editing of the learned dynamics while preserving the original topology of neural representations through an encoder isometry objective.

The Koopman autoencoder framework demonstrates practical utility in targeted class unlearning, where specific classes can be removed from a classifier while maintaining performance on remaining classes. Experiments on Yin-Yang and MNIST classification tasks validate the approach, showing that learned dynamics naturally replicate the progressive topological simplification observed in neural networks. This provides a new perspective on neural network interpretability through dynamical systems theory.

## Method Summary
The Koopman autoencoder framework models neural representation dynamics by learning a surrogate dynamical system in an observable space. The method learns an encoder that maps neural representations to a lifted observable space where dynamics are approximately linear, following Koopman operator theory. A decoder reconstructs the original representations from the observable space. The framework enforces an isometry constraint between the neural representation space and observable space to preserve topology. This enables the learned linear dynamics in observable space to be edited while maintaining the structural relationships present in the original representations.

## Key Results
- Learned dynamics naturally replicate progressive topological simplification observed in neural networks
- Demonstrated targeted class unlearning: class 4 removed from MNIST with accuracy dropping from 98.29% to 0.0% while maintaining 98.53% on other classes
- Framework preserves original topology of neural representations through encoder isometry objective

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages Koopman operator theory to transform the inherently nonlinear dynamics of neural representations into approximately linear dynamics in a lifted observable space. By enforcing an isometry constraint between the original representation space and observable space, the framework preserves the topological structure of the data while enabling linear dynamical models to be learned and edited. This combination allows for interpretable manipulation of neural network behavior through the well-understood mathematics of linear dynamical systems.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Koopman Autoencoder -> Encoder (Representation → Observable) -> Linear Dynamics (Observable) -> Decoder (Observable → Representation)

Critical Path:
The critical path is the encoder mapping neural representations to observable space, as this determines the quality of the linear dynamics approximation and enables subsequent editing operations.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Expressiveness vs. linearity: The lifted observable space must be rich enough to approximate nonlinear dynamics linearly
- Computational complexity: The isometry constraint may become prohibitive for deeper networks
- Interpretability vs. accuracy: More complex observable spaces may improve reconstruction but reduce interpretability

Failure Signatures:
- Poor reconstruction quality indicating inadequate encoder/decoder capacity
- Nonlinear residuals in observable space dynamics suggesting insufficient lifting
- Topology violations indicating isometry constraint issues

First Experiments:
1. Verify linearity of learned dynamics through residual analysis
2. Test topology preservation using persistent homology
3. Validate class-specific unlearning effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond simple classification tasks remains unproven
- Computational complexity of isometry constraint may limit scalability
- Topological interpretation may not capture all aspects of complex neural architectures

## Confidence
High: The mathematical framework is internally consistent with sound theoretical grounding in Koopman operator theory and topology preservation.

Medium: Experimental results demonstrate the framework's capabilities, but the topological simplification interpretation may be specific to the tested architectures and datasets.

Low: Applicability to real-world deep learning scenarios and larger-scale models remains speculative without further validation.

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on CIFAR-10 or ImageNet to assess scalability with more complex representations
2. Apply the framework to regression tasks to evaluate utility beyond classification
3. Validate topological interpretation on architectures with skip connections or residual learning
