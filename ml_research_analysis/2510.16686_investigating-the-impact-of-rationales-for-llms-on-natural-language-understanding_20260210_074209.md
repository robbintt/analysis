# Investigating the Impact of Rationales for LLMs on Natural Language Understanding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.16686
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16686
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Rationales improve NLU generalization but most rationale-augmented training methods underperform label-only training except Align method.

## Executive Summary
This work investigates whether incorporating rationales into large language models (LLMs) improves natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. While rationales enhance reasoning tasks, their impact on NLU—where understanding key input is often sufficient—remains unclear. The authors construct NLURC, a high-quality NLU dataset with 252,506 rationales, and test various rationale-augmented training and inference methods. They find that chain-of-thought inference benefits NLU performance only as model size increases, as smaller models tend to over-analyze and make more understanding errors. Most rationale-augmented training methods underperform label-only training, except one that balances label and rationale loss. Training with rationales improves generalization on unseen NLU tasks, matching models ten times larger in size while also enhancing interpretability.

## Method Summary
The study constructs NLURC, a high-quality Chinese NLU dataset with 252,507 rationales across 34 datasets and 11 task types. The authors train Qwen1.5-Chat models (0.5B, 1.8B, 7B, 32B, 72B) using five training methods: Label-Only (baseline), Reason (rationale→label), Explain (label→rationale), Mix (inter-sample combination), and Align (separate loss computation). Inference methods include Direct (label only), CoT (rationale→label), and Rationalize (label→rationale). The Align method computes separate losses for labels and rationales to prevent long rationales from overwhelming label learning, with optimal performance at 0.5 coefficient each.

## Key Results
- CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, with smaller models showing degraded performance due to over-analysis.
- Align training method consistently outperforms other rationale-augmented training methods by preserving label learning through separate loss computation.
- Training with rationales on multiple NLU tasks improves generalization to unseen tasks, with a 7B-Unseen model outperforming 7B-Seen and rivaling 72B models.
- Rationale diversity plays a key role in generalization, with multi-task rationale training showing better transfer than single-task approaches.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: CoT Inference Model-Size Dependency
CoT reasoning forces comprehensive text analysis rather than focused key-information extraction. This "over-analysis" increases understanding error probability for smaller models with weaker comprehension, but becomes beneficial as model capacity scales. The shift occurs because NLU tasks fundamentally require locating key input segments rather than decomposing problems into steps.

### Mechanism 2: Balanced Label-Rationale Loss (Align Training)
Standard token-averaged loss causes long rationales (avg 200-500 tokens) to dominate gradient updates over short labels (1-10 tokens). Align computes losses independently then sums, ensuring label mapping receives proportional learning signal. This preserves critical label learning that would otherwise be overwhelmed.

### Mechanism 3: Rationale Diversity Enables Generalization
Multi-task rationale training improves zero-shot transfer to unseen NLU tasks by exposing models to diverse reasoning patterns and linguistic expressions. The 7B-Unseen model outperforms 7B-Seen, suggesting cross-task rationale variety matters more than in-domain rationale quantity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Loss Token-Averaging Bias**: Understanding why naive rationale concatenation fails requires grasping how gradient magnitude scales with sequence length in cross-entropy loss. *Quick check: If label=5 tokens and rationale=200 tokens, what fraction of gradient updates affect label prediction vs. rationale generation in standard token-averaged loss?*

- **NLU vs. Reasoning Task Distinction**: The paper's core finding depends on recognizing that NLU tasks require key-information localization rather than step-by-step decomposition. *Quick check: For sentiment classification, does success depend more on logical deduction chains or on identifying the most salient sentiment-bearing phrases?*

- **Emergent Capability Thresholds**: CoT benefit emerges only above certain model sizes; applying it below threshold causes harm. *Quick check: Your 3B parameter model shows 15% accuracy drop with CoT on classification. What size threshold should you test before concluding CoT is unsuitable?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: NLURC Dataset -> Training Methods (Label-Only, Reason, Explain, Mix, Align) -> Inference Modes (Direct, CoT, Rationalize) -> Model Series (Qwen1.5-Chat 0.5B/1.8B/7B/32B/72B)

- **Critical path**: Start with label-only baseline on your target NLU task. Implement Align training with 0.5/0.5 label-to-rationale coefficient. Use Direct inference for evaluation. For multi-task generalization: train on full NLURC excluding evaluation task.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Rationale quality vs. diversity (high-quality exemplars reduce diversity), model size vs. CoT utility (below ~7B, CoT inference degrades performance), task-specific vs. multi-task training (single-task Align outperforms other single-task methods).

- **Failure signatures**: CoT on small models (accuracy drop >5% indicates model below CoT threshold), Reason/Explain training underperformance (check for data contamination), rationale-label inconsistency (>10% rationales contradict labels).

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Establish baseline: Train Label-Only and Align on single task, compare Direct inference performance across model sizes. 2) CoT threshold identification: Test CoT vs. Direct inference gap at different model sizes. 3) Generalization check: Train Align on all NLURC tasks except your target, evaluate zero-shot transfer.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Would more advanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) variants—such as hierarchical, programmatic, or graph-based frameworks, and methods employing multiple reasoning paths with debate or voting—yield similar improvements on NLU tasks as they do on reasoning tasks, or would their tendency toward comprehensive analysis exacerbate understanding errors in smaller models?

### Open Question 2
What is the precise scaling threshold at which CoT inference transitions from harmful to beneficial for NLU tasks, and does this threshold vary systematically across different NLU task types (e.g., tasks requiring longer rationales vs. shorter ones)?

### Open Question 3
Can the findings regarding rationale efficacy on NLU tasks—which show that Align training consistently outperforms other methods and that rationales boost generalization to rival models 10x larger—be replicated across non-Chinese languages and different model architectures, or are these effects language- and architecture-specific?

### Open Question 4
What are the theoretical mechanisms underlying the Align method's superiority: does computing separate losses for labels and rationales simply prevent gradient dilution from longer rationale sequences, or does it induce qualitatively different representational learning that better captures the NLU-specific skill of identifying key input regions?

## Limitations
- Results are limited to Chinese NLU tasks, limiting generalizability to other languages.
- Dataset quality boundaries and task distribution effects on rationale utility remain unexplored.
- Findings are reported only for Qwen1.5-Chat models, leaving cross-architecture generalization untested.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Align training outperforms other rationale-augmented methods due to balanced loss computation. Directly supported by controlled experiments.

**Medium Confidence**: Size-dependent CoT benefit claim. Supported by experimental evidence but exact threshold and mechanism remain somewhat speculative.

**Low Confidence**: Generalization benefit claim for rationale diversity. 7B-Unseen outperforming 7B-Seen demonstrated, but whether diversity or data volume drives effect is unclear.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Lingual Transfer Validation**: Train Align method on English NLU datasets with comparable rationale augmentation. Measure whether CoT threshold and performance patterns mirror Chinese results.

2. **Diversity Threshold Experiment**: Create controlled NLURC subsets varying task diversity (1 task type vs. 5 vs. 11) while maintaining total sample count. Train 7B models on each and measure zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

3. **Architecture Ablation Study**: Implement Align training on a different base model family (e.g., Llama-2 or Mistral) with identical LoRA hyperparameters. Compare whether CoT threshold effects and rationale training benefits replicate.
