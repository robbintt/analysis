## Executive Summary
EVisRAG introduces an evidence-guided framework for visual retrieval-augmented generation, enabling vision-language models to systematically observe, record, and reason over multi-image evidence. It employs Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy Optimization (RS-GRPO) to jointly optimize perception and reasoning through fine-grained rewards applied to specific token scopes. Evaluated on five VQA benchmarks, EVisRAG achieves 27% average F1 score improvement over strong baselines, with 75.01% average accuracy. It demonstrates precise cross-image evidence localization and reasoning, outperforming both general VLMs and RL-trained VLRMs, even surpassing 32B-parameter models. The method effectively reduces hallucination and enhances robustness in multi-image scenarios with rich visual content.

## Method Summary
EVisRAG is a two-stage trained vision-language model that enforces structured evidence-guided reasoning over retrieved images. The method uses Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the backbone and trains with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by RS-GRPO. During inference, the model generates responses in four distinct phases: observe (describe each retrieved image), evidence (record key visual facts), reason (derive answers from aggregated evidence), and answer (provide final response). The RS-GRPO algorithm routes perception rewards to observe/evidence tokens and derivation rewards to reason/answer tokens, enabling joint optimization of visual perception and reasoning abilities through group-relative advantages within each token scope.

## Key Results
- Achieves 75.01% average accuracy across five VQA benchmarks (ChartQA, InfoVQA, DocVQA, SlideVQA, ViDoSeek)
- Outperforms strong baselines by 27% average F1 score improvement
- Surpasses 32B-parameter models despite using only 7B-parameter backbone
- Demonstrates precise cross-image evidence localization with reduced hallucination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Evidence-Guided Reasoning Paradigm
Enforcing an explicit observe→record→reason→answer workflow improves cross-image evidence integration compared to unconstrained chain-of-thought. Special tokens segment the output into four scopes, preventing reasoning from ignoring visual evidence and forcing per-image grounding. This assumes VLMs can learn to partition reasoning into perception vs. derivation phases when given structural incentives. Ablation shows w/o Perception drops from 75.01% to 68.99% accuracy, confirming explicit perception mechanism matters.

### Mechanism 2: Reward-Scoped Token Attribution (RS-GRPO)
Binding fine-grained rewards to specific token spans sharpens credit assignment compared to applying all rewards uniformly. Three reward types (perception, derivation, format) are routed to specific token scopes via Eq. 7 mapping. This assumes perception and reasoning have different optimization objectives that interfere when trained with mixed rewards. w/o RS-GRPO (standard GRPO with summed rewards) drops to 73.76% vs. 75.01%, showing scoping matters.

### Mechanism 3: Two-Stage Training with Difficulty Filtering
SFT cold start followed by curriculum-filtered RS-GRPO improves stability over direct RL training. Stage 1: SFT on 60k high-quality trajectories. Stage 2: RS-GRPO on 4k filtered samples excluding easy cases, with difficulty progression. This assumes VLMs need supervised initialization before RL can effectively explore reasoning space. Training curves show RS-GRPO achieves higher and more stable answer rewards than standard GRPO.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept 1: Visual RAG Pipeline Architecture
Why needed: EVisRAG builds on VisRAG-Ret retrieval; understanding how images flow through the system is prerequisite.
Quick check: Given a query q and corpus D, can you trace the path: retrieval → top-k images → evidence extraction → reasoning → answer?

### Concept 2: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and GRPO Foundations
Why needed: RS-GRPO extends GRPO with reward scoping; understanding group-relative advantages is essential.
Quick check: In GRPO, how does computing advantages as (reward_i - mean(rewards_group)) / std(rewards_group) differ from single-sample PPO?

### Concept 3: Multi-Image Visual Attention and Evidence Density
Why needed: Figure 4 shows evidence density decreases as more images are retrieved; understanding this tradeoff is critical.
Quick check: Why does F1 score remain stable for EVisRAG even as evidence density drops from 40% (top-1) to 20% (top-5)?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Query q → VisRAG-Ret → Top-k Images (D_R) → [Policy Model: Qwen2.5-VL-7B] → <observe> → <evidence> → unsure → <answer> → [RS-GRPO: Scope-specific token advantages] → [Policy Update via DAPO]

### Critical Path
1. Retrieval quality gates everything: If VisRAG-Ret fails, context is insufficient
2. Special token parsing is fragile: Incorrect scope segmentation breaks reward attribution
3. Evidence recording quality drives downstream reasoning: Garbage evidence → garbage reasoning

### Design Tradeoffs
- Evidence-guided vs. free-form CoT: +6% accuracy but longer generation (~10s overhead)
- Top-3 vs. top-k retrieval: Paper uses top-3 at test time; top-5 during training for augmentation
- 7B vs. 32B backbone: EVisRAG-7B outperforms vanilla 32B, but requires 2-stage training investment

### Failure Signatures
- Misaligned attention: If visual attention maps don't focus on evidence regions, perception reward isn't working
- "Insufficient to answer" overuse: Model may become too conservative if format reward over-weighted
- Reward hacking: Model may generate correct format but empty evidence if perception reward poorly calibrated

### First 3 Experiments
1. Reproduce ablations: Train w/o Perception, w/o RS-GRPO on ChartQA subset to validate 4-7% drops
2. Visualize attention alignment: Replicate Figure 3 attention analysis on 20 examples to verify evidence localization
3. Test retrieval sensitivity: Vary top-k (1, 3, 5, 10) and measure evidence density vs. F1 tradeoff curve

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the relative performance gain of EVisRAG over vanilla baselines persist or diminish when applied to Vision-Language Models with significantly larger parameter counts (e.g., 30B+)?
- Basis in paper: The results show a 7B EVisRAG outperforming a 32B vanilla model, but the paper does not evaluate EVisRAG on a 32B backbone to determine if the RS-GRPO benefits scale with model size.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the "detective-style" reasoning pattern is an emergent property of smaller models needing structure, or if larger models benefit equally from explicit scope-based optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating EVisRAG using Qwen2.5-VL-32B as the backbone to compare the performance delta against the 7B results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the fixed four-stage token scope (observe, evidence, reason, answer) optimal for all query types, or does it introduce unnecessary latency for simple single-hop questions?
- Basis in paper: The methodology enforces a rigid structure for credit assignment. While ablations show it beats uniform rewards, they do not test if a dynamic or more granular scope yields better efficiency.
- Why unresolved: The rigid token scope forces the model to generate distinct sections for every query, which may be sub-optimal for simple queries that could be answered in a single step.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing fixed 4-stage scoping against dynamic or query-dependent scoping mechanisms in terms of token efficiency and accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the RS-GRPO framework be extended to explicitly penalize or filter the retrieval context itself, rather than only learning to output "insufficient to answer"?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.5 analyzes performance under "Incorrect Retrieval," noting the model becomes conservative. However, the model acts as a passive receiver of the top-k images rather than an active filter.
- Why unresolved: The current framework grounds reasoning in the provided images, even if they are irrelevant. It does not address training the model to actively reject specific retrieved images as noise during the reasoning process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modifying the perception reward to include a penalty for utilizing distractor images, or adding an explicit "relevance filtering" action to the policy optimization.

## Limitations
- Evidence Quality Dependency: Performance critically depends on quality of evidence extraction during observation and recording phases
- Retrieval Bottleneck: Entire approach constrained by VisRAG-Ret's retrieval performance
- Evaluation Scope Limitation: Results demonstrated primarily on VQA benchmarks with structured visual content
- Computational Overhead: Evidence-guided approach requires longer generation sequences increasing inference latency

## Confidence

**High Confidence (95%+):** The mechanism of structured evidence-guided reasoning with special tokens improving accuracy over baseline VLMs. Ablation studies showing 6-7% accuracy drops when removing perception mechanisms are consistent and well-supported.

**Medium Confidence (75-95%):** The RS-GRPO algorithm's effectiveness in jointly optimizing perception and reasoning through reward scoping. While the paper shows improvements over standard GRPO, the novelty claim requires more careful framing since the concept builds on established GRPO foundations.

**Low Confidence (below 75%):** The claim that EVisRAG outperforms 32B-parameter models. This comparison may be influenced by differences in training data, model architecture, and the specific evaluation setup rather than being solely attributable to the evidence-guided approach.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Evaluate EVisRAG on natural image VQA datasets (e.g., VQA-v2, OK-VQA) to assess whether the evidence-guided reasoning paradigm generalizes beyond structured visual content like charts and documents.

2. **Retrieval Failure Analysis:** Systematically evaluate EVisRAG's behavior when VisRAG-Ret retrieval fails to include relevant images. Measure accuracy degradation and analyze whether the "insufficient to answer" mechanism works as intended or if the model hallucinates in retrieval-poor scenarios.

3. **Evidence Ambiguity Stress Test:** Create test cases with ambiguous or multiple valid interpretations of visual evidence. Evaluate whether EVisRAG's perception reward mechanism can handle uncertainty and whether the structured reasoning approach improves robustness to visual ambiguity compared to unconstrained chain-of-thought.
