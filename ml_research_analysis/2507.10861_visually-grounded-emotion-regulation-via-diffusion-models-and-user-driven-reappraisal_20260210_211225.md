# Visually grounded emotion regulation via diffusion models and user-driven reappraisal

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10861
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10861
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AI-assisted reappraisal reduced negative affect more effectively than non-AI methods or control

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to augment cognitive reappraisal for emotion regulation by integrating text-to-image diffusion models with user-driven reappraisal. Participants reinterpret negative images through spoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive visualizations using a fine-tuned stable diffusion model with an IP-adapter. In a within-subject experiment (N=20), participants showed significantly reduced negative affect in the AI-assisted reappraisal condition compared to both non-AI reappraisal and control conditions.

## Method Summary
The system combines speech-to-text (Whisper Turbo), image-to-text (CLIP), and text-to-image (Stable Diffusion XL with IP-Adapter) components. Users speak reappraisals while viewing negative IAPS images; the system transcribes their words and generates a new image that maintains structural similarity to the original while incorporating the semantic content of the reappraisal. The IP-Adapter is fine-tuned on synthetic data (18,000 image-prompt pairs) to preserve structural features while enabling semantic transformation. Participants completed a within-subject experiment with three conditions: AI-assisted reappraisal, non-AI reappraisal, and a control condition.

## Key Results
- AI-assisted reappraisal condition showed significantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI reappraisal and control conditions
- Sentiment alignment between participant reappraisals and generated images correlated with affective relief
- Generated images maintained high structural fidelity to original IAPS inputs while integrating semantic and affective cues
- System demonstrated feasibility with minimal hallucination or distress induction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Externalized Cognitive Scaffolding
The system reduces cognitive load by converting abstract verbal intent into concrete visual reality. Instead of users struggling to maintain positive mental imagery, the diffusion model generates persistent visual scaffolds that externalize the reappraisal process, instantiating regulatory intent and reducing the cognitive demands of mental imagery.

### Mechanism 2: Multimodal Coherence via Sentiment Alignment
Regulatory benefit derives from semantic and emotional alignment between user's spoken prompt and generated image. When the visual output accurately reflects the user's positive reinterpretation, it reinforces the cognitive reframe through multimodal coherence. Misalignment triggers cognitive dissonance rather than relief.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Drift with Structural Preservation
The system alters semantic meaning while preserving structural identity through IP-Adapter architecture. By locking structural features but swapping semantic features via text conditioning, users can "rewrite" the reality of an image without losing the context of the original stressor.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cognitive Reappraisal (CBT)**
  - Why needed: Framework the system attempts to augment; without understanding reinterpretation of stimuli, one might design ineffective random happy image generators
  - Quick check: If a user sees a car crash and says "The ambulance is coming to help," is that distraction or reappraisal?

- **Concept: Cross-Attention in Diffusion Models**
  - Why needed: Governs how the model decides what to keep from image vs. change based on text, via cross-attention layers where text tokens interact with image latents
  - Quick check: In U-Net, which modality provides "Query" vector and which provides "Key/Value" in standard cross-attention?

- **Concept: IP-Adapter (Image Prompt Adapter)**
  - Why needed: Enables "same scene, different vibe" effect through decoupled attention mechanism that injects visual features as separate condition
  - Quick check: How does IP-Adapter differ from ControlNet or image-to-image pipelines in terms of parameter efficiency and training requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Microphone (Speech) -> Whisper Turbo (ASR) -> Text + Original IAPS Image -> Stable Diffusion XL (Frozen U-Net + VAE) + IP-Adapter (Fine-tuned projection layers) -> Text Embeddings (CLIP) + Image Embeddings (CLIP ViT-H/14) -> IP-Adapter scale (λ) modulates reference image vs. text prompt strength -> VAE decodes latents to pixel space

- **Critical path:** User speaks reappraisal -> Whisper transcribes text; CLIP encodes original image -> IP-Adapter projects image features into U-Net's cross-attention space -> U-Net denoises latents conditioned on both text and projected image features -> VAE decodes latents to pixel space -> Display to user

- **Design tradeoffs:** Latency vs. Quality (4-second gray screen delay from 40-step DDIM sampling vs. standard 50+ steps); Frozen vs. Fine-tuned (frozen SDXL ensures general capability but required IP-Adapter training to prevent hallucinations)

- **Failure signatures:** Semantic Misalignment (generated image contradicts prompt); Hallucination (anatomical errors or semantic drift); Safety Triggers (generating content more distressing than original)

- **First 3 experiments:** Ablation on Conditioning Scale (vary IP-Adapter influence 0.3-0.8); Sentiment Alignment Validation (compute cosine similarity between prompt and generated image captions); Adversarial Reappraisal (test with "negative reappraisals" to ensure safety filters)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does the observed reduction in negative affect persist over time and generalize to naturalistic settings outside controlled laboratory conditions?
- Is AI-assisted reappraisal effective for clinical populations with cognitive or emotional impairments such as depression, trauma, or PTSD?
- How do semantic alignment, affective tone, and reappraisal intent uniquely and interactively contribute to regulatory success?

## Limitations

- Small sample size (N=20) limits generalizability and statistical power
- Reliance on subjective emotional reporting introduces inherent variability
- System's reliance on user-generated content introduces potential safety risks not fully explored
- Healthy sample limits generalizability to clinical populations

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Technical implementation of IP-Adapter fine-tuning pipeline and ability to generate semantically aligned images
- **Medium confidence:** Primary affective regulation results requiring replication with larger, more diverse samples
- **Medium confidence:** Sentiment alignment correlation with affective relief needing validation across different affective domains

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test:** Replicate emotion regulation effects using different types of negative stimuli beyond IAPS
2. **Clinical Population Validation:** Test system with individuals experiencing clinical depression or anxiety
3. **Long-term Efficacy Study:** Conduct longitudinal study examining sustained improvements in reappraisal ability without technological assistance
