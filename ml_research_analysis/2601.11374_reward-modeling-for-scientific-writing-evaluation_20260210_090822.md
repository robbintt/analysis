# Reward Modeling for Scientific Writing Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.11374
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11374
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: SCIRM-REF achieves 0.83 accuracy on related work evaluation and 0.69 on review utility evaluation, outperforming baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes reward models (SCIRM and SCIRM-REF) for scientific writing evaluation, addressing the challenge of adapting LLMs to diverse and task-specific evaluation criteria. The key idea is a two-stage training framework: first optimizing scientific evaluation preferences, then refining reasoning capabilities. This approach enables models to reason over explicit evaluation constitutions and adhere to dynamic criteria across tasks. Experimental results show that SCIRM-REF achieves 0.83 accuracy on related work evaluation and 0.69 on review utility evaluation, outperforming baselines. The models generalize effectively to unseen tasks, achieving 0.74 accuracy on novelty alignment and 0.78 on revision evaluation. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the training regime in improving LLM-based scientific writing evaluation.

## Method Summary
The method trains constitution-conditioned reward models using a two-stage reinforcement learning approach. Stage 1 optimizes preference-following with a graded reward function (-0.5 to +1.5) plus quadratic length penalty. Stage 2 adds reflection training to enhance reasoning capabilities. The models output structured reasoning and scores given evaluation constitutions (criteria + rubrics) and artifacts. Training uses Qwen2.5-7B base with LoRA adapters, joint multi-task training across 65,357 instances, and GRPO optimization with 4 samples per instance.

## Key Results
- SCIRM-REF achieves 0.83 accuracy on related work evaluation and 0.69 on review utility evaluation
- Models generalize effectively to unseen tasks: 0.74 accuracy on novelty alignment and 0.78 on revision evaluation
- Outperforms baselines including Prometheus, Skywork-Critic, and o3-mini on zero-shot transfer tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Constitution-Conditioned Reward Modeling
Conditioning reward models on explicit evaluation constitutions at both training and inference time improves alignment with task-specific scientific writing evaluation requirements. The model learns to attend to and reason over the provided constitution, rather than relying on implicit preferences internalized during pre-training. This creates an inference-time adaptation mechanism where the same model can evaluate different tasks by simply changing the constitution prompt.

### Mechanism 2: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning with GRPO
Sequential optimization—first for preference-following, then for reflective reasoning—yields better scientific evaluation than single-stage training. Stage 1 teaches constitution-following using graded rewards, while Stage 2 adds reflection prompts encouraging self-verification with asymmetric rewards (+1.0 for correcting errors, -1.0 for backsliding).

### Mechanism 3: Joint Multi-Task Training with Multi-Aspect Evaluation
Training across diverse scientific writing tasks with multiple evaluation aspects per task improves robustness to varying rubrics and enables zero-shot generalization. By exposing the model to binary, Likert-scale, and other rubric formats across related work, review utility, novelty, and revision tasks, it learns transferable evaluation patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**: Core RL algorithm for both training stages; differs from standard PPO/DPO by comparing multiple sampled responses per prompt. Why needed: Enables group-based advantage estimation for more stable reward learning. Quick check: Can you explain how GRPO's group-based advantage estimation differs from single-response preference optimization?

- **Reward Hacking Mitigation**: The paper explicitly addresses models exploiting reward functions by generating only scoring content or running to max length. Why needed: Prevents models from optimizing for the reward signal rather than the actual task. Quick check: What are warning signs that a reward model is gaming the objective rather than learning the task?

- **Pointwise vs. Pairwise Reward Modeling**: The paper uses pointwise scoring (evaluate single artifact) rather than pairwise comparison. Why needed: Better suited for scientific writing tasks with fine-grained, multi-aspect criteria. Quick check: Why might pointwise evaluation be preferable for scientific writing tasks with fine-grained, multi-aspect criteria?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Processing (constitution prompt + artifact) -> SCIRM Model (Qwen2.5-7B + LoRA) -> Output Parsing (extract reasoning and score) -> Reward Functions (Stage 1 graded rewards + length penalty; Stage 2 correction-focused asymmetric rewards)

- **Critical path**: 1) Data preparation: Format training instances with task-specific constitutions (58,712 train / 6,645 test) 2) Stage 1 training: GRPO with formatted output rewards, 4 samples per instance, temperature=1, top-p=0.95 3) Stage 2 training: Generate initial responses → append reflection prompt → train with correction rewards 4) Inference: Pass constitution + artifact → parse structured output

- **Design tradeoffs**: 7B model size (cost-efficient ~3 days on single A100 80GB but may miss nuanced reasoning), LoRA (rank 64) reduces memory but may limit full model adaptation, joint training improves generalization but may sacrifice per-task peak performance

- **Failure signatures**: Output without <score> tags (formatting failure, -0.5 penalty), generating until max length (instability, addressed by length penalty), confusing adjacent scores on ambiguous instances (inherent task difficulty), poor unseen-task performance if training overfits to specific rubrics

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison: Run vanilla Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct vs. SCIRM on held-out related work evaluation to quantify Stage 1 gains 2) Ablation of Stage 2: Compare SCIRM vs. SCIRM-REF specifically on novelty alignment task (0.61 → 0.74 accuracy) to isolate reasoning improvements 3) Unseen task generalization: Evaluate both models on revision evaluation (6,184 instances not in training) to measure zero-shot transfer vs. baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can the SCIRM models be effectively utilized as reward signals to train and improve scientific text generators via reinforcement learning? Basis: The conclusion states "A promising direction for future work is to improve scientific text generation across diverse tasks using reinforcement learning, where rewards are provided by our models."

- **Open Question 2**: Does scaling the model size beyond 7B parameters significantly improve the capture of nuanced evaluation criteria or reasoning capabilities? Basis: The Limitations section notes "We restrict our experiments to 7B-scale models. We hypothesize that larger models could better capture task-specific evaluation nuances..."

- **Open Question 3**: How does the performance of the reward model change when trained on more fine-grained, non-binary evaluation rubrics compared to the predominantly binary datasets used in this study? Basis: The Limitations section highlights that data scarcity resulted in "most of the scoring rubrics being binary," suggesting that a "more comprehensive analysis" is future work.

## Limitations

- The paper doesn't adequately address potential failure modes beyond those explicitly mentioned, such as how the model handles contradictory criteria or whether the constitution format scales to more complex evaluation scenarios
- The long-term stability of the training approach and potential for reward hacking are not thoroughly explored
- Reliance on constitution prompting could degrade if evaluation criteria become too complex or numerous to specify concisely

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The empirical results showing SCIRM-REF outperforming baselines on seen tasks (0.83 accuracy on related work evaluation, 0.69 on review utility) are well-documented with clear methodology
- **Medium Confidence**: The generalization claims to unseen tasks (0.74 accuracy on novelty alignment, 0.78 on revision evaluation) are promising but rely on assumptions about training task diversity
- **Low Confidence**: The paper doesn't adequately address potential failure modes beyond those explicitly mentioned, and the long-term stability of the training approach is not thoroughly explored

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the length penalty parameter k (0.1, 0.25, 0.5) and evaluate its impact on training stability and final accuracy

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Evaluate SCIRM-REF on scientific writing tasks from completely different domains (e.g., medical literature, physics papers) not represented in the training corpus

3. **Failure Mode Characterization**: Conduct adversarial testing with contradictory constitutions and ambiguous evaluation criteria to identify breaking points and measure the model's ability to detect inconsistent evaluation instructions
