# An exploration for higher efficiency in multi objective optimisation with reinforcement learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.10208
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10208
- **Reference count**: 33
- **Primary result**: RL-embedded ABC algorithm (RLABC) outperforms random and probability matching baselines on Set Union Knapsack Problem (SUKP)

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates improving efficiency in multi-objective optimisation through reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive operator selection. The core challenge addressed is selecting optimal operators from a pool during search to avoid local optima and improve convergence speed. The method uses RL to dynamically map problem states to operators based on accumulated rewards, enabling adaptive selection during search. For multi-objective problems, the approach extends single-objective RL credit assignment to handle multiple objectives via union-based operator ranking. Experiments on Set Union Knapsack Problem (SUKP) show the RL-embedded ABC algorithm (RLABC) significantly outperforms random and probability matching baselines. Transfer learning results demonstrate that retaining and reusing RL experience across problem instances reduces computational time. The work is ongoing, with cross-problem and multi-objective generalisation as future directions. No explicit performance metrics are provided in the text.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach for adaptive operator selection in multi-objective optimisation. The method employs RL to dynamically select operators from a predefined pool during the search process, mapping problem states to operators based on accumulated rewards. For multi-objective problems, the approach extends single-objective RL credit assignment by using a union-based operator ranking mechanism to handle multiple objectives. The RL-embedded ABC (RLABC) algorithm is implemented and tested on the Set Union Knapsack Problem (SUKP), showing significant improvements over random and probability matching baselines. The approach also incorporates transfer learning, allowing RL experience to be retained and reused across different problem instances to reduce computational time.

## Key Results
- RL-embedded ABC (RLABC) algorithm outperforms random and probability matching baselines on SUKP
- Union-based operator ranking successfully extends RL credit assignment to multi-objective problems
- Transfer learning enables retention and reuse of RL experience across problem instances, reducing computational time
- The approach demonstrates potential for avoiding local optima and improving convergence speed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RL-based adaptive operator selection mechanism works by maintaining a state-action value function that maps problem states to operators, allowing the system to learn which operators are most effective in different regions of the search space. By accumulating rewards based on improvement in solution quality, the RL agent can dynamically adjust its operator selection strategy during the search process. This adaptability helps avoid local optima by preventing premature convergence to suboptimal operators and enables faster convergence by focusing computational resources on promising operator-state combinations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning credit assignment**: Needed to evaluate which operators contribute to solution improvement; quick check: verify reward signal correctly captures improvement across multiple objectives
- **Multi-objective Pareto optimality**: Required for defining success criteria in multi-objective problems; quick check: ensure operator ranking considers trade-offs between objectives
- **Operator pool design**: Critical for providing diverse search capabilities; quick check: validate operator diversity prevents premature convergence
- **State representation**: Essential for RL agent to make informed decisions; quick check: confirm state captures relevant problem characteristics for operator selection
- **Transfer learning in RL**: Enables knowledge reuse across problem instances; quick check: verify experience transfer improves performance on similar problems
- **Credit assignment in multi-objective RL**: Needed to distribute rewards across multiple conflicting objectives; quick check: validate union-based ranking handles objective conflicts effectively

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Problem State -> RL Agent -> Operator Selection -> Search Algorithm -> Solution Evaluation -> Reward Assignment

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from problem state representation through the RL agent to operator selection, which directly impacts search algorithm performance and ultimately solution quality. The reward assignment mechanism closes the loop by providing feedback to the RL agent.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational overhead of maintaining and updating the RL agent for potential gains in search efficiency and solution quality. The union-based operator ranking simplifies multi-objective credit assignment but may not capture nuanced trade-offs between objectives. Transfer learning provides computational savings but requires careful management of experience relevance across problem instances.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor operator selection may manifest as premature convergence to local optima, slow convergence rates, or failure to explore diverse regions of the search space. Inadequate state representation could lead to suboptimal operator choices regardless of learning progress.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare RLABC performance against standard ABC on benchmark multi-objective problems with known Pareto fronts
2. Test operator selection stability across multiple runs with identical problem instances
3. Evaluate transfer learning effectiveness by measuring performance degradation when transferring between dissimilar problem instances

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No explicit performance metrics or comparative results against state-of-the-art multi-objective optimisation methods
- Experiments confined to a single problem domain (Set Union Knapsack Problem) without validation on diverse benchmark problems
- Union-based operator ranking lacks detailed explanation of how credit assignment handles conflicting objectives
- Transfer learning component described conceptually but lacks quantitative evaluation of computational time savings

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core methodology of using RL for adaptive operator selection is clearly described and logically sound.

**Medium confidence**: The extension to multi-objective problems via union-based ranking is plausible but lacks detailed validation.

**Low confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency improvements and transfer learning benefits are not substantiated with empirical data.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments comparing RLABC against established multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (e.g., NSGA-II, MOEA/D) on standard benchmark problems with reported hypervolume and generational distance metrics
2. Evaluate the union-based operator ranking mechanism on problems with known Pareto front characteristics to verify effective credit assignment across conflicting objectives
3. Implement and quantify the computational time savings from transfer learning across multiple problem instance families, reporting wall-clock time comparisons with and without experience reuse
