# CriticSearch: Fine-Grained Credit Assignment for Search Agents via a Retrospective Critic

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.12159
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12159
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Achieves up to 16.7% higher EM scores on 3B models and 6.7% on 7B models for multi-hop QA through retrospective critic-based credit assignment

## Executive Summary
CriticSearch introduces a retrospective critic mechanism that uses a frozen LLM to evaluate each search action using privileged information (e.g., the gold answer), generating dense, turn-level rewards that guide policy learning. By combining these fine-grained rewards with global outcome rewards, CriticSearch provides more effective credit assignment than existing sparse-reward methods. Experiments across multi-hop Q&A benchmarks show that CriticSearch outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 16.7% higher exact match scores on 3B models and 6.7% on 7B models, while also accelerating convergence and improving training stability.

## Method Summary
CriticSearch uses a frozen LLM (critique model) to retrospectively evaluate each search action in a reasoning trajectory, using privileged information including the gold answer and full trajectory context. The critique model judges each action as beneficial (Good=1) or not (Bad=0), and these binary judgments are normalized into turn-level advantages. These fine-grained rewards are combined with global outcome rewards via a weighted sum (α=0.25) to form a hybrid advantage signal that guides policy updates through GRPO. This approach addresses the sparse reward problem in RL for search agents by providing dense, action-level feedback that improves credit assignment accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieves 16.7% higher EM scores on 3B models and 6.7% on 7B models compared to baselines
- Demonstrates faster convergence and improved training stability by preventing reward sparsity-induced collapse
- Shows effectiveness across multiple multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, Bamboogle)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Privileged Hindsight Credit Assignment
The critique LLM uses privileged information (gold answer + full trajectory) to retrospectively evaluate each search action, converting assessments into stable, dense rewards. This hindsight perspective allows more accurate distinction between useful and redundant search actions than forward prediction methods.

### Mechanism 2: Hybrid Advantage Signal Prevents Training Collapse
Combining fine-grained turn-level rewards with sparse global rewards stabilizes GRPO training by reducing reward noise and preventing KL divergence explosion. The hybrid advantage balances local action feedback with global task success.

### Mechanism 3: Faster Convergence via Early Signal in Failed Trajectories
Dense turn-level rewards accelerate convergence by providing positive learning signal even within failed trajectories. Failed trajectories that contain useful search actions receive partial credit, allowing the policy to learn from these actions rather than treating the entire trajectory as uniformly bad.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
  - Why needed: CriticSearch uses GRPO as its backbone RL algorithm. Understanding how GRPO estimates advantages through group-wise comparison is essential to understanding where dense rewards fit.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why GRPO computes advantages as (r_i - mean(r)) / std(r) rather than using a learned critic?

- **Concept**: Credit Assignment Problem in RL
  - Why needed: The paper's core contribution addresses the difficulty of attributing final outcomes to individual actions in multi-turn trajectories.
  - Quick check: In a 5-turn search trajectory where the final answer is correct but turn 3's search was redundant, how would sparse outcome reward vs. CriticSearch's turn-level reward differ in their feedback?

- **Concept**: Privileged Information / Hindsight Learning
  - Why needed: The retrospective critic mechanism depends on providing the critique model information (gold answer, future trajectory) unavailable during inference.
  - Quick check: Why might hindsight evaluation be more reliable than forward prediction for assessing action quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Policy LLM (trainable) -> Environment (search engine) -> Critique LLM (frozen) -> Reward computation -> GRPO optimizer
- **Critical path**: Sample G trajectories per question from policy → Compute outcome rewards → Run critique LLM for per-turn judgments → Normalize turn rewards to advantages → Combine via weighted sum → Apply GRPO loss
- **Design tradeoffs**: Critique model size (larger = more accurate but higher compute), α weighting (higher = faster convergence but risks over-fitting), binary vs. continuous rewards
- **Failure signatures**: Training collapse around step 400 with sparse rewards only, redundant search patterns, low critic-human alignment (<60%)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate sparse vs. dense reward comparison on HotpotQA with Qwen2.5-3B; 2) Ablate privileged information by removing gold answer from critique input; 3) Vary critique model size between Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and larger models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the policy model be reused as the critique model during training to reduce memory overhead?
- How does CriticSearch perform on broader agentic RL tasks beyond multi-hop QA with limited turns?
- Can CriticSearch be adapted for settings where gold answers are unavailable?
- Would richer turn-level reward signals (e.g., continuous scores) improve over binary rewards?

## Limitations

- Limited human validation of critique model accuracy, relying primarily on automated metrics
- Ablation gaps in testing retrospective vs. forward prediction and binary vs. continuous rewards
- Real-world deployment uncertainty due to reliance on privileged information unavailable during inference
- Scale sensitivity with modest results on 7B models and no testing on larger models

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Claims about training stability improvements (preventing collapse, suppressing KL divergence spikes)
**Medium Confidence**: Claims about final performance improvements (EM score gains)
**Low Confidence**: Claims about accelerated convergence without direct ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. **Human Annotation Study**: Collect human judgments on action utility for 100 trajectories to measure critique-human alignment and correlate with performance improvements.

2. **Ablation of Privileged Information**: Train variants with and without gold answer access and future trajectory access to quantify each type's contribution.

3. **Cross-Dataset Transfer Test**: Train on HotpotQA and evaluate zero-shot on MuSiQue and Bamboogle to test whether learned credit assignment transfers across datasets.
