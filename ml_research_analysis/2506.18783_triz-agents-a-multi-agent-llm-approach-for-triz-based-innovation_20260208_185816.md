- Multi-agent LLM system automates TRIZ-based innovation using specialized agents

## Executive Summary
This paper presents TRIZ Agents, a multi-agent system that automates the TRIZ innovation methodology through collaboration between specialized LLM agents. The system simulates a team of domain experts (mechanical, electrical, control systems, safety, TRIZ specialist, etc.) working together to solve engineering problems using the TRIZ workflow. Tested on a gantry crane improvement case study, the system produces outputs across six TRIZ workflow steps and a final report. Results show the system generates logical solutions with step-by-step commonalities to the original case study, though not identical solutions, demonstrating the viability of agent collaboration for complex innovation tasks while highlighting limitations including the absence of feedback loops and dependence on prompt engineering quality.

## Method Summary
The TRIZ Agents system implements a supervised multi-agent architecture using LangGraph and GPT-4o, where a Project Manager orchestrates collaboration between eight specialized agents. Each agent receives a profiling prompt defining its role, tasks, context, and output format. The workflow follows six sequential TRIZ steps: defining the system, function analysis, causal-effect chain analysis, engineering contradiction identification with matrix lookup, physical contradiction analysis, and solution generation. Agents can invoke external tools including web search and TRIZ-specific tools (Contradiction Matrix, Inventive Principles, RAG). State transfer between steps occurs through documentation created by a Documentation Specialist, who summarizes each completed step for the next step's input. The system was tested on a gantry crane improvement case study, with outputs compared to the original case study solutions.

## Key Results
- The system successfully implements all six TRIZ workflow steps, producing documented outputs for each
- Generated solutions show logical reasoning and step-by-step commonalities with the original gantry crane case study, though not identical solutions
- The Electrical Engineer agent was not invoked during Step 6, causing the system to miss the "intelligent circuit breaker" solution from the original case study
- The TRIZ Specialist agent rarely used the RAG tool, instead generating responses based on internal model knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Role-specialized agents with domain-specific prompts and tools produce more coherent interdisciplinary problem-solving than single-LLM approaches.
- Mechanism: Each agent receives a profiling prompt defining expertise, tasks, and responsibilities. The Project Manager orchestrates which agent participates at each workflow step, allowing domain experts to contribute where relevant (e.g., Control Systems Engineer for CECA, TRIZ Specialist for contradiction analysis).
- Core assumption: Domain expertise simulated via prompts transfers to higher-quality contributions in that domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "multi-agent system leverages agents with various domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps"
  - [section 3.2.1] "Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Control Systems Engineer, Safety Engineer, TRIZ Specialist, Operations Specialist, Documentation Specialist and supervisor Project Manager"
  - [corpus] Related paper "Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Complex Engineering Problem-Solving" similarly uses role-specialized agents for senior design projects, suggesting the pattern generalizes.
- Break condition: When required expertise is missing from the team (e.g., Electrical Engineer not called in Step 6, causing the system to miss the "intelligent circuit breaker" solution from the case study).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sequential documentation of each workflow step enables state transfer across steps, compensating for limited context windows and providing evaluation checkpoints.
- Mechanism: At each step completion, Documentation Specialist creates a summary. The next step receives only this documentation—not the full conversation history—simulating a team that "doesn't remember what they said last time, but has documentation."
- Core assumption: Summary documentation preserves sufficient signal for subsequent reasoning steps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "each step is done one by one, and a special agent documents each step. Documentation of the previous step is provided to the team"
  - [section 6.2] "step documentation alone is a way to handle this problem because instead of a long list of messages, a summary is stored"
  - [corpus] "Cross-Task Experiential Learning on LLM-based Multi-Agent Collaboration" addresses similar memory/state challenges across tasks.
- Break condition: When intermediate documentation omits critical information needed later; no mechanism exists to query prior raw conversations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: External tool access (web search, RAG, domain-specific tools) grounds agent outputs and reduces hallucination.
- Mechanism: Agents can invoke tools via function calls. TRIZ Specialist accesses Contradiction Matrix, Inventive Principles, and TRIZ RAG tools. Other agents use web search for domain knowledge.
- Core assumption: Agents will choose to use tools when appropriate; tool outputs are reliable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.3] "TRIZ Specialist is additionally equipped with TRIZ-oriented tools such as: TRIZ Features Tool, Contradiction Matrix Tool, TRIZ Inventive Principles Tool, TRIZ RAG Tool"
  - [section 5.2.1] "TRIZ Specialist rarely used the RAG tool... the agent often generated responses without any tool usage"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence on tool-use reliability in multi-agent TRIZ specifically; corpus papers focus on debate/optimization frameworks.
- Break condition: When agents underuse tools due to insufficient prompt instructions, or when tool outputs contain inaccurate information that propagates.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **TRIZ Methodology (Contradiction Matrix, 40 Inventive Principles, 39 Parameters)**
  - Why needed here: The entire system is structured around TRIZ workflow steps; without understanding contradiction types and inventive principles, you cannot evaluate whether agents are correctly applying the methodology.
  - Quick check question: Given a problem where "speed" improves but "stability" worsens, can you identify which TRIZ parameters and inventive principles might apply?

- Concept: **LangGraph/Agent Orchestration Patterns (supervised teams, hierarchical teams)**
  - Why needed here: The system uses supervised orchestration with a Project Manager; understanding node-edge graphs and conditional routing is essential for modifying or debugging the architecture.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between supervised team orchestration and equal collaboration in multi-agent systems?

- Concept: **Prompt Engineering for Agent Profiling (role, tasks, context, output format)**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly states outcomes "strongly depend on agents' profiling prompts"; poor prompts caused agents to underuse RAG tools and skip feedback loops.
  - Quick check question: What four elements must be included in an agent profiling prompt according to this paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Project Manager (Orchestrator) -> Domain Agents (Mechanical/Electrical/Control Systems/Safety/Operations Engineers) -> TRIZ Specialist -> Documentation Specialist -> Final Report
  - Project Manager routes tasks, decides which agent acts next, signals step completion
  - Domain Agents contribute domain-specific analysis when called
  - TRIZ Specialist handles contradiction identification, matrix lookup, inventive principle application
  - Documentation Specialist summarizes each step, compiles final report
  - Tools: Web search (all agents), TRIZ tools (Contradiction Matrix, Features, Principles, RAG—TRIZ Specialist only)

- Critical path: Problem input → Step 1 (Define System) → Step 2 (Function Analysis) → Step 3 (CECA) → Step 4 (Engineering Contradiction + Matrix) → Step 5 (Physical Contradiction) → Step 6 (Solutions) → Final Report compilation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Supervised vs. decentralized orchestration**: Supervised ensures workflow compliance but lacks emergent problem-solving; decentralized (per Figure 2) may produce more diverse solutions but risks workflow deviation.
  - **Autonomy vs. tool-use enforcement**: Giving agents autonomy to decide tool usage led to underuse of RAG; stricter prompts could enforce tool use but reduce flexibility.
  - **Documentation-only state transfer vs. full conversation history**: Summaries save context window but may lose nuance; full history preserves detail but risks context overflow.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Agent not invoked for relevant domain**: Electrical Engineer missing from Step 6 caused system to miss electrical-domain solutions.
  - **Tool underuse**: TRIZ Specialist not using RAG tool produces outputs based on internal model knowledge rather than grounded TRIZ literature.
  - **No feedback loops**: System never revisits earlier steps even when later steps reveal contradictions or gaps.
  - **Non-deterministic outputs**: Same input produces different results across runs (60-80 node calls, 150k-250k tokens variance).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Run the system on the gantry crane case study with provided prompts; compare your outputs to paper's reported results to validate implementation.
  2. **Prompt ablation for tool use**: Modify TRIZ Specialist prompt to require RAG tool usage before generating responses; measure change in output quality and tool invocation frequency.
  3. **Feedback loop injection**: Add a "review" step where Project Manager can return to previous steps if later steps reveal gaps; test whether solution completeness improves (watch for infinite loop risks).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can feedback loops be effectively implemented in multi-agent TRIZ systems to enable iterative refinement of solutions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "A substantial limitation of the proposed system is its lack of a feedback loop in the teams' actions... This limitation poses a promising research direction: making multi-agent systems even more similar to real-world teams."
- Why unresolved: Implementing loops carries significant risk of causing never-ending conversations between agents, and the high complexity of such implementation was a barrier in this study.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified TRIZ Agents system with feedback mechanisms that demonstrates improved solution quality through controlled iteration without infinite loops.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different agent orchestration architectures (supervised groups, equal collaboration, nested teams) compare in performance for TRIZ-based innovation tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note: "Examining how other agent orchestration architectures might perform would probably bring interesting insights" and reference Figure 2 showing different collaboration methods.
- Why unresolved: This study focused only on a supervised team architecture with a Project Manager orchestrator; no comparison was conducted.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring solution quality, efficiency, and coverage across multiple orchestration patterns on identical TRIZ problems.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can incorporating cognitive architectures into LLM agents enhance grounding and reasoning capabilities for inventive problem-solving?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Building cognitive agents could enable the system to learn problem descriptions" and cite cognitive architectures as "a promising direction for further research."
- Why unresolved: The current system uses standard LLM agents without cognitive architectures; the TRIZ Specialist agent underutilized the RAG tool, suggesting grounding challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of cognitive agents with internal reasoning flows compared against baseline agents on structured innovation tasks.

## Limitations
- The system lacks feedback loops between workflow steps, preventing iterative refinement of solutions
- Agent profiling prompts are not fully disclosed, making exact reproduction difficult
- The TRIZ Specialist agent rarely used the RAG tool, instead relying on internal model knowledge
- Only one case study (gantry crane) was tested, limiting generalizability claims

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The multi-agent architecture successfully implements the 6-step TRIZ workflow and produces documented outputs; the collaboration mechanism between specialized agents is technically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that role-specialized agents produce more coherent interdisciplinary problem-solving than single-LLM approaches, based on one case study comparison
- **Medium Confidence**: The sequential documentation approach effectively handles state transfer between steps, though limited to summary-based preservation
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about tool grounding effectiveness, given the observed underuse of RAG tools by the TRIZ Specialist

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt Engineering Validation**: Systematically vary the TRIZ Specialist prompt to enforce RAG tool usage and measure changes in output grounding quality and tool invocation frequency
2. **Feedback Loop Integration**: Add review and revisit steps to the workflow, allowing the Project Manager to return to previous steps when later steps reveal contradictions or gaps, then measure impact on solution completeness
3. **Multi-Case Study Testing**: Apply the system to at least 3-5 diverse engineering innovation problems across different domains to assess generalizability and identify domain-specific limitations
