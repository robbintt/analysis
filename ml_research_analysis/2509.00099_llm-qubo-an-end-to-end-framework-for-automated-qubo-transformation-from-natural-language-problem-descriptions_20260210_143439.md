# LLM-QUBO: An End-to-End Framework for Automated QUBO Transformation from Natural Language Problem Descriptions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.00099
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00099
- **Authors:** Huixiang Zhang; Mahzabeen Emu; Salimur Choudhury
- **Reference count:** 8
- **Primary result:** 38% faster runtimes vs. Direct MILP on 100×1000 CFLP while maintaining near-optimal solutions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LLM-QUBO, a framework that automates the transformation of natural language optimization problems into quantum-ready QUBO matrices. It uses an LLM to convert problem descriptions into structured mathematical models and applies hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition to address quantum hardware limitations. Experiments show the system correctly converts diverse optimization problems into QUBO form, with special handling for constraint structures. For large-scale instances, the hybrid approach solves Capacitated Facility Location Problems up to 100×1000 scale, achieving 38% faster runtimes compared to direct MILP solvers while maintaining near-optimal solutions. The work bridges classical AI and quantum computing, significantly reducing the expertise barrier for quantum optimization.

## Method Summary
The framework employs an LLM (Qwen3-8B) to convert natural language problem descriptions into structured mathematical models, which are then transformed into QUBO matrices. The system uses hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition to handle scalability limitations of quantum hardware. The approach involves two main phases: an LLM-driven conversion engine that translates constraints into quadratic penalties, and a Benders decomposition solver that splits problems into binary master problems (QUBO) and continuous subproblems (LP). The method was tested on OR-Library Capacitated Facility Location Problem benchmarks ranging from 16×50 to 100×1000 scale.

## Key Results
- Correctly converts diverse optimization problems into QUBO form with special handling for constraint structures
- Solves 100×1000 scale Capacitated Facility Location Problems
- Achieves 38% faster runtimes compared to direct MILP solvers while maintaining near-optimal solutions (<0.2% optimality gap)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework bridges the gap between natural language problem descriptions and quantum-ready QUBO formulations by leveraging LLMs for automated translation. The hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition addresses the limited qubit capacity of current quantum hardware by decomposing large problems into manageable subproblems. The specialized structure recognition in the LLM ensures that problem-specific constraints are properly encoded as quadratic penalties, maintaining solution quality while enabling quantum optimization.

## Foundational Learning
- **QUBO Matrix Construction**: Converting linear and quadratic expressions into matrix form for quantum solvers - needed for quantum hardware compatibility; quick check: verify matrix symmetry and positive definiteness
- **Benders' Decomposition**: Separating mixed-integer problems into master and subproblems - needed for scalability; quick check: confirm convergence criteria are met
- **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Crafting prompts that enforce mathematical structure - needed for reliable conversion; quick check: validate generated constraints follow specified penalty rules
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Execution**: Coordinating quantum and classical solvers - needed for practical deployment; quick check: monitor solution quality degradation
- **Constraint-to-Penalty Translation**: Converting inequality and equality constraints to quadratic penalties - needed for QUBO formulation; quick check: ensure all constraints are represented as quadratic terms
- **Scale Decomposition Strategy**: Splitting large problems for quantum processing - needed for handling real-world instances; quick check: verify decomposition maintains problem integrity

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Natural Language Description -> LLM -> Mathematical Model -> QUBO Matrix -> Hybrid Solver (Master Problem + Subproblem)
- **Critical Path**: LLM conversion and Benders decomposition loop, where prompt quality directly impacts solution quality
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Full QUBO conversion vs. hybrid decomposition - tradeoff is between quantum advantage and problem size limitations
- **Failure Signatures**: Non-quadratic penalty terms indicate LLM prompt issues; solver stalls suggest decomposition problems
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test LLM conversion on a simple constraint ("sum of x_i ≤ C") and verify quadratic penalty generation
  2. Run Benders decomposition on a small CFLP instance (20×20) and confirm convergence
  3. Validate QUBO matrix structure by checking all terms are degree ≤ 2

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Specific LLM prompt templates for "Specialized Structure Recognition" are not provided
- Benders decomposition convergence tolerances and cut generation strategies are not detailed
- The framework's effectiveness depends on undocumented prompt engineering

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Conceptual approach is sound and well-articulated
- **Medium confidence**: Performance metrics are plausible but depend on undocumented configurations
- **Low confidence**: Consistent handling of diverse problems without exact prompt templates is uncertain

## Next Checks
1. **QUBO Structure Validation**: Implement parser to verify LLM-generated QUBO matrix contains only quadratic terms (degree ≤ 2) for all test instances
2. **Decomposition Integrity Test**: On 20×20 CFLP instance, measure MILP solver's optimality gap; if >300%, confirm decomposition logic is active
3. **Prompt Template Reconstruction**: Attempt to reconstruct LLM prompt for simple constraint ("sum of x_i ≤ C") by enforcing stated rules and test QUBO penalty generation
