# Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for RLVR

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02522
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02522
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: PACS achieves 59.78% pass@256 rate on AIME 2025, outperforming PPO by 13.32% and GRPO by 14.36%

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of training language models for mathematical reasoning using verifiable rewards (RLVR), where sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates hinder effective learning. The authors propose PACS, a novel framework that reformulates RLVR as a supervised learning problem by treating outcome rewards as predictable labels. Through a detailed gradient analysis, they show that this approach inherently recovers policy gradient updates while implicitly coupling actor and critic roles within a single model, enabling more stable and efficient training. Extensive experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH 500, AMC23, AIME 2024, AIME 2025) demonstrate that PACS significantly outperforms strong RLVR baselines like PPO and GRPO.

## Method Summary
PACS reformulates reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) as a supervised learning problem by predicting outcome rewards directly. The framework leverages a gradient analysis showing that this supervised approach can recover standard policy gradient updates while implicitly coupling actor and critic functions within a single model. The key innovation lies in treating the reward prediction task as a regression problem, which stabilizes training by providing dense gradients throughout the learning process. This approach maintains policy entropy for exploration while improving training efficiency through sustained gradient activity. The method is specifically designed for mathematical reasoning tasks where rewards are sparse and binary (correct/incorrect), addressing the instability issues common in traditional RLVR approaches.

## Key Results
- PACS achieves 59.78% pass@256 rate on AIME 2025
- Outperforms PPO by 13.32 percentage points and GRPO by 14.36 percentage points on AIME 2025
- Maintains healthier policy entropy for sustained exploration compared to baselines
- Demonstrates improved training efficiency through sustained gradient activity throughout training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by converting the RLVR problem into a supervised learning task where the model predicts outcome rewards as regression targets. This transformation provides dense gradient signals throughout training, unlike traditional RLVR which suffers from sparse rewards. The key insight is that by treating reward prediction as a supervised regression problem, the model can learn more stable representations that implicitly capture both policy (actor) and value estimation (critic) functions. This implicit coupling within a single model reduces the variance typically associated with separate actor-critic architectures while maintaining the benefits of both components. The approach leverages the mathematical structure of RLVR problems to create a more stable learning signal that naturally recovers policy gradient updates.

## Foundational Learning
- **Policy Gradient Methods**: Understanding how reinforcement learning updates policies based on reward signals - needed to appreciate why sparse rewards cause instability, quick check: can you derive the policy gradient theorem?
- **Actor-Critic Architectures**: Knowledge of how separate actor and critic networks interact in reinforcement learning - needed to understand the significance of implicit coupling, quick check: can you explain the variance reduction benefit of critic networks?
- **Supervised Learning vs Reinforcement Learning**: Grasp of how supervised learning provides dense gradients compared to RL's sparse rewards - needed to understand the core innovation, quick check: can you compare the gradient landscapes of supervised vs RL training?
- **Mathematical Reasoning Tasks**: Familiarity with verifiable reward settings where answers are definitively correct or incorrect - needed to contextualize the problem domain, quick check: can you identify which tasks have verifiable vs non-verifiable rewards?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Input Data -> PACS Model (Actor-Critic Coupling) -> Reward Prediction -> Policy Update -> Output
- **Critical Path**: Data preprocessing → Reward regression head training → Policy gradient recovery → Model evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Single unified model vs separate actor-critic networks (simplicity and implicit coupling vs explicit separation and potential specialization)
- **Failure Signatures**: Unstable training curves, degraded policy entropy, reward prediction divergence from actual outcomes
- **First Experiments**: 1) Verify reward prediction accuracy on a validation set, 2) Compare policy entropy curves against PPO baseline, 3) Test convergence speed on a small-scale math reasoning task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several implications arise from the work. The approach's applicability to non-mathematical reasoning tasks remains unexplored, as does its performance in settings with continuous or non-verifiable rewards. The implicit coupling mechanism, while theoretically justified, lacks empirical validation through ablation studies comparing against explicitly separated actor-critic architectures.

## Limitations
- Claims about implicit actor-critic coupling lack empirical validation through ablation studies
- Experimental results may be difficult to reproduce due to incomplete implementation details
- Framework's applicability beyond mathematical reasoning tasks remains untested
- Training efficiency claims lack comparative timing data against baselines

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core mathematical formulation showing supervised learning recovery of policy gradients
- **Medium confidence**: The experimental results showing performance improvements over baselines
- **Low confidence**: Claims about implicit actor-critic coupling and generalization beyond mathematical reasoning

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing PACS with explicitly separated actor-critic architectures to verify the claimed benefits of implicit coupling
2. Perform cross-domain evaluation on non-mathematical RLVR tasks to assess generalizability
3. Run controlled experiments with identical computational budgets to validate training efficiency claims against PPO and GRPO baselines
