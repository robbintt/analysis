core_contribution: Multi-context principal component analysis (MCPCA) is a method
  to find axes of variation that are shared across subsets of contexts in multi-context
  data. It generalizes principal component analysis (PCA) to the multi-context setting
  by decomposing a tensor of covariance matrices into a shared set of directions (MPCs)
  weighted by context-specific loadings.

- Multi-context principal component analysis (MCPCA) is a method to find axes of variation that are shared across subsets of contexts in multi-context data

## Executive Summary
Multi-context principal component analysis (MCPCA) is a method that generalizes PCA to multi-context data by finding shared axes of variation across subsets of contexts without requiring prior specification of which contexts share factors or how their importance changes. The method decomposes tensor covariance matrices into shared directions (multi-context principal components, or MPCs) weighted by context-specific loadings. MCPCA is based on tensor decomposition and implemented using a partially non-negative adaptation of the multi-subspace power method.

## Method Summary
MCPCA decomposes multi-context data by first computing covariance matrices for each context, then assembling these into a tensor. The method uses tensor decomposition (specifically a partially non-negative adaptation of the multi-subspace power method) to identify shared axes of variation across contexts. These axes, called multi-context principal components (MPCs), are directions in the data space that capture variation shared across subsets of contexts. Each MPC is associated with context-specific loadings that indicate how strongly each context exhibits that shared pattern of variation. The method does not require specifying which contexts share factors or how their importance changes, making it suitable for exploratory analysis of complex multi-context datasets.

## Key Results
- Applied to gene expression data across cancer types, MCPCA revealed biologically meaningful axes of variation including organ-specific, multi-cancer, and pan-cancer patterns
- MCPCA identified an axis in lung cancer whose variability in tumor cells, but not mean expression, is associated with cancer progression
- Applied to contextualized word embeddings, MCPCA mapped debates on human nature across time periods and genres, revealing factors that cannot be found by combining data across contexts or by restricting to individual contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MCPCA works by leveraging the tensor structure inherent in multi-context covariance data. By decomposing the tensor of covariance matrices, it can identify directions in the data space that explain variation shared across multiple contexts simultaneously. The partially non-negative adaptation ensures interpretability by constraining loadings to be non-negative where appropriate, while still allowing flexibility to capture complex patterns of shared variation. This approach effectively generalizes the PCA framework to situations where the data naturally forms a multi-dimensional array rather than a simple matrix.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tensor decomposition fundamentals**: Understanding how to decompose multi-dimensional arrays into interpretable components is crucial for MCPCA's operation. Quick check: Verify that tensor decomposition can recover known patterns in synthetic multi-context data.
- **Covariance matrix computation for multiple contexts**: MCPCA requires computing and assembling covariance matrices from each context. Quick check: Confirm that covariance matrices capture appropriate within-context variation.
- **Multi-subspace power method**: This iterative algorithm finds dominant subspaces in tensor decomposition. Quick check: Test convergence properties on benchmark tensor decomposition problems.
- **Partially non-negative constraints**: These constraints balance interpretability with flexibility in tensor decomposition. Quick check: Compare results with fully non-negative and unconstrained decompositions.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data -> Context-specific covariance matrices -> Tensor assembly -> Tensor decomposition (multi-subspace power method) -> MPCs with context-specific loadings -> Interpretation

**Critical Path**: The core computational pipeline involves computing covariance matrices for each context, assembling these into a tensor, applying the partially non-negative multi-subspace power method to decompose the tensor, and extracting the MPCs with their associated loadings.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The partially non-negative constraint improves interpretability but may miss some variation patterns. The method trades computational simplicity for flexibility in not requiring specification of shared contexts. The power method approach is efficient but may converge to local optima.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor convergence of the power method, inability to recover known patterns in synthetic data, or MPCs that lack clear biological or semantic interpretation. The method may also struggle when contexts have very different scales or when shared variation is minimal.

**First Experiments**:
1. Apply MCPCA to synthetic data with known shared variation patterns to verify recovery of those patterns
2. Compare MCPCA results with standard PCA applied to concatenated contexts to demonstrate the value of the multi-context approach
3. Test sensitivity to the number of MPCs selected by applying the method with different numbers of components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The partially non-negative adaptation of the multi-subspace power method is not fully validated against other tensor decomposition approaches
- The selection of the number of MPCs is not addressed systematically
- The biological interpretations, while plausible, rely on existing knowledge rather than experimental validation
- Computational complexity and scalability to larger datasets are not discussed

## Confidence
- Methodological framework: High
- Gene expression applications: Medium
- Word embedding analysis: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Systematically evaluate MCPCA's sensitivity to the number of components selected and compare results with alternative tensor decomposition methods
2. Validate the biological interpretations of identified axes through experimental follow-up or comparison with independent datasets
3. Apply MCPCA to additional multi-context datasets (e.g., single-cell RNA-seq across conditions, multi-modal data) to assess generalizability
