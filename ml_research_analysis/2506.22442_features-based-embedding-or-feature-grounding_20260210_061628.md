- One-line primary result: Feature-grounded embeddings inject domain-specific knowledge into word embeddings before training, improving modularity and interpretability by aligning embeddings with interpretable, knowledge-based features.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces feature-grounded embeddings, a method for injecting domain-specific knowledge into word embeddings before training large language models. The approach uses a token-specific saturation operator—a soft-triangular projection matrix with rotation—to map embeddings into a structured feature space. Training is guided by reconstruction and contrastive losses to align embeddings with interpretable, knowledge-based features. Experiments on SST-2, AG News, and TREC datasets show that models with feature-grounded embeddings exhibit improved modularity: swapping embeddings between independently trained models results in only minor performance drops, suggesting consistent internal representations. The method enhances interpretability and enables reusable, transferable embedding components.

## Method Summary
Feature-grounded embeddings inject domain-specific knowledge into word embeddings using a token-specific saturation operator—a soft-triangular projection matrix with rotation—to map embeddings into a structured feature space. Training is guided by reconstruction and contrastive losses to align embeddings with interpretable, knowledge-based features. This approach enhances modularity and interpretability, enabling the creation of reusable and transferable embedding components.

## Key Results
- Models with feature-grounded embeddings show improved modularity, with minor performance drops when swapping embeddings between independently trained models.
- The method enhances interpretability by aligning embeddings with knowledge-based features.
- Feature-grounded embeddings enable the creation of reusable and transferable embedding components.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The feature-grounded embedding method works by injecting domain-specific knowledge into word embeddings before training, using a token-specific saturation operator to map embeddings into a structured feature space. This structured space is aligned with interpretable, knowledge-based features through reconstruction and contrastive losses. The method enhances modularity by ensuring consistent internal representations across models, allowing for embedding swapping with minimal performance degradation. The structured feature space also improves interpretability, making the embeddings more aligned with domain-specific knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- **Token-specific saturation operator**: A soft-triangular projection matrix with rotation used to map embeddings into a structured feature space. *Why needed*: To inject domain-specific knowledge into embeddings. *Quick check*: Verify that the operator correctly maps embeddings to the structured feature space.
- **Reconstruction loss**: A loss function used to align embeddings with interpretable, knowledge-based features. *Why needed*: To ensure embeddings capture the desired knowledge. *Quick check*: Confirm that the loss reduces the gap between embeddings and knowledge-based features.
- **Contrastive loss**: A loss function used to enhance the separation of embeddings in the feature space. *Why needed*: To improve the modularity and interpretability of embeddings. *Quick check*: Validate that the loss increases the distance between dissimilar embeddings.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Token-specific saturation operator -> Reconstruction and contrastive losses -> Structured feature space -> Interpretable, knowledge-based features.
- **Critical path**: Token-specific saturation operator -> Structured feature space -> Reconstruction and contrastive losses -> Interpretable, knowledge-based features.
- **Design tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead for improved modularity and interpretability. The saturation operator may introduce complexity but enables better alignment with domain-specific knowledge.
- **Failure signatures**: If the saturation operator fails, embeddings may not align with the structured feature space. If reconstruction or contrastive losses are not effective, embeddings may not capture the desired knowledge.
- **First experiments**: 1) Test the saturation operator on a small dataset to ensure correct mapping. 2) Evaluate the reconstruction and contrastive losses on a validation set. 3) Assess the modularity of embeddings by swapping them between models.

None

## Limitations
- **Generalizability Across Tasks and Domains**: The experiments are limited to three specific datasets (SST-2, AG News, and TREC). The performance and modularity benefits of feature-grounded embeddings may not generalize to other tasks or domains. Confidence: Medium.
- **Scalability to Larger Models**: The study does not explore the scalability of the method to larger models or more complex architectures. The computational overhead of the saturation operator and the effectiveness of the method in larger models remain unclear. Confidence: Medium.
- **Interpretability of Feature Space**: While the paper claims improved interpretability, the specific knowledge-based features and their alignment with the structured feature space are not fully detailed. The interpretability gains may depend on the quality and relevance of the injected domain-specific knowledge. Confidence: Low.

## Confidence
- **High**: The experimental results on SST-2, AG News, and TREC datasets demonstrate the modularity and interpretability benefits of feature-grounded embeddings.
- **Medium**: The generalizability of the method across tasks and domains, as well as its scalability to larger models, requires further validation.
- **Low**: The interpretability of the feature space and the alignment of knowledge-based features need more detailed exploration.

## Next Checks
1. **Evaluate on Diverse Tasks and Domains**: Test the method on a broader range of tasks and domains to assess its generalizability and robustness.
2. **Assess Scalability**: Experiment with larger models and architectures to determine the scalability and computational efficiency of the saturation operator.
3. **Analyze Feature Interpretability**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the knowledge-based features and their alignment with the structured feature space to validate interpretability claims.
