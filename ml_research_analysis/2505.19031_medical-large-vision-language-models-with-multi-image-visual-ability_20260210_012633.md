# Medical Large Vision Language Models with Multi-Image Visual Ability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.19031

- Medical LVLMs significantly improved for multi-image clinical reasoning and analysis

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the limited ability of existing medical large vision-language models to process multi-image clinical scenarios, which require sophisticated visual understanding such as temporal reasoning and cross-modal analysis. To bridge this gap, the authors introduce the Med-MIM instruction dataset, comprising 83.2K medical multi-image QA pairs across four visual ability types (temporal understanding, reasoning, comparison, co-reference). They fine-tune Mantis and LLaVA-Med using this dataset, producing MIM-LLaVA-Med and Med-Mantis models optimized for multi-image analysis. A comprehensive Med-MIM benchmark is also developed to evaluate multi-image understanding capabilities. Experimental results show that both models significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art LVLMs on held-in and held-out subsets of the benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Med-MIM instruction dataset in enhancing medical LVLMs' multi-image comprehension.

## Method Summary
The authors address the gap in medical large vision-language models' ability to process multi-image clinical scenarios by developing the Med-MIM instruction dataset containing 83.2K medical multi-image QA pairs across four visual ability types. They fine-tune existing models Mantis and LLaVA-Med using this dataset to create specialized versions (MIM-LLaVA-Med and Med-Mantis) optimized for multi-image analysis. The study also introduces a comprehensive Med-MIM benchmark to evaluate multi-image understanding capabilities, and conducts experiments showing significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LVLMs on both held-in and held-out benchmark subsets.

## Key Results
- MIM-LLaVA-Med and Med-Mantis models significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art LVLMs on multi-image tasks
- Both models show improved performance on held-in and held-out subsets of the Med-MIM benchmark
- Med-MIM instruction dataset successfully enhances medical LVLMs' multi-image comprehension capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing a fundamental limitation in current medical vision-language models - their inability to effectively process and reason across multiple medical images simultaneously. By creating a large-scale instruction dataset specifically designed for multi-image scenarios, the fine-tuning process teaches models to recognize temporal relationships, perform cross-image comparisons, and maintain context across different visual inputs. This targeted training on medically relevant multi-image tasks enables the models to develop specialized capabilities that single-image models cannot achieve.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-image visual reasoning** - Needed to understand how medical conditions progress across time or how different imaging modalities relate to each other. Quick check: Can the model correctly identify temporal progression in a series of chest X-rays.
- **Cross-modal correlation** - Essential for connecting visual findings with clinical text and medical knowledge. Quick check: Can the model integrate radiology report findings with corresponding imaging features.
- **Temporal understanding in medicine** - Critical for tracking disease progression and treatment response. Quick check: Can the model accurately describe changes between baseline and follow-up scans.
- **Co-reference resolution across images** - Important for tracking specific anatomical structures or pathologies across multiple views. Quick check: Can the model consistently identify and track a tumor across different imaging sequences.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Med-MIM Dataset -> Fine-tuning Pipeline -> MIM-LLaVA-Med/Med-Mantis Models -> Med-MIM Benchmark -> Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves dataset generation (Med-MIM), fine-tuning process, and evaluation through the Med-MIM benchmark. The quality of the instruction dataset directly determines model performance.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The use of GPT-4 for automatic dataset generation enables large-scale data creation but may introduce biases or inaccuracies in medical reasoning. The choice to focus on four specific visual ability types provides clear evaluation metrics but may miss other important multi-image reasoning capabilities.

**Failure Signatures:** Models may struggle with real-world clinical complexity not captured in the synthetic dataset, show poor generalization to image types outside the training distribution, or fail to maintain temporal consistency across longer image sequences.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate model performance on synthetic multi-image QA pairs from the Med-MIM benchmark
2. Test cross-dataset generalization by applying models to single-image medical datasets
3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual visual ability types from the training dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited clinical validation beyond synthetic QA benchmarks
- Potential dataset bias from automated generation using GPT-4
- Unclear generalization to clinical scenarios beyond the four defined visual ability types
- No evaluation of model calibration or uncertainty quantification in medical contexts

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in reported performance improvements on Med-MIM benchmark
- **Medium confidence** in clinical relevance of evaluation
- **Low confidence** in dataset's representation of real-world medical complexity

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation by medical experts on a held-out test set to verify clinical accuracy and relevance of model responses
2. Test model performance on real clinical multi-image cases from actual patient records with temporal progression
3. Evaluate model robustness to image quality variations, artifacts, and incomplete clinical information common in real-world settings
