# EVLP:Learning Unified Embodied Vision-Language Planner with Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05553
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05553
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: EVLP achieves 79.4% success rate on LoHoRavens block tasks vs 63.9% for PERIA baseline

## Executive Summary
EVLP introduces a unified multimodal generation framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that jointly models language actions and visual subgoals through learnable cross-modal attention. The lightweight autoregressive architecture enables efficient single-pass sampling of multiple independent candidates, addressing the challenge of generating both textual action plans and corresponding visual trajectories. Dynamic perception pretraining with inverse/forward dynamics tasks learns environmental transitions, followed by reinforced supervised fine-tuning that aligns spatial logic between actions and generated images. Comprehensive experiments on LoHoRavens and Meeting Preparation benchmarks demonstrate significant performance gains over existing approaches.

## Method Summary
The EVLP framework employs a unified autoregressive architecture that jointly generates language actions and visual subgoals through cross-modal attention mechanisms. The system uses dynamic perception pretraining with inverse and forward dynamics tasks to learn environmental transitions before applying reinforced supervised fine-tuning. This approach enables the model to understand both the spatial relationships in generated images and the logical connections between sequential actions, allowing for efficient single-pass candidate generation without the need for iterative refinement.

## Key Results
- EVLP achieves 79.4% success rate on LoHoRavens block tasks versus 63.9% for PERIA baseline
- Significant performance improvements across all task categories in both LoHoRavens and Meeting Preparation benchmarks
- Demonstrates robust generalization capabilities on established evaluation datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EVLP's effectiveness stems from its unified autoregressive architecture that jointly models language actions and visual subgoals through learnable cross-modal attention. The dynamic perception pretraining with inverse/forward dynamics tasks enables the model to learn environmental transitions and understand how actions affect visual states. The reinforced supervised fine-tuning aligns spatial logic between generated actions and images, creating coherent multi-step plans. The single-pass sampling approach allows efficient generation of multiple independent candidates without iterative refinement, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.

## Foundational Learning
- Cross-modal attention mechanisms - why needed: Enables joint modeling of language and visual modalities for coherent plan generation; quick check: verify attention weights align actions with relevant visual regions
- Dynamic perception pretraining - why needed: Learns environmental transitions and state representations before fine-tuning; quick check: evaluate inverse/forward dynamics task performance on held-out data
- Reinforced supervised fine-tuning - why needed: Aligns spatial logic between actions and generated images through reward-guided learning; quick check: measure alignment accuracy between action sequences and visual trajectories
- Autoregressive generation - why needed: Enables sequential prediction of actions and subgoals in a unified framework; quick check: assess generation quality on longer action sequences
- Multi-candidate sampling - why needed: Provides diverse plan options without iterative refinement; quick check: evaluate success rate across sampled candidates for same task

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Image Encoder -> Cross-Modal Attention -> Action Generator -> Image Generator -> Reinforced Fine-Tuning
- Critical path: Visual input → cross-modal attention → action generation → visual subgoal prediction → fine-tuning reward calculation
- Design tradeoffs: Single-pass generation favors efficiency over iterative refinement accuracy; unified architecture reduces complexity but may limit specialized task performance
- Failure signatures: Misalignment between generated actions and visual subgoals, failure to capture long-term dependencies, breakdown in spatial reasoning for complex manipulations
- First experiments: 1) Evaluate cross-modal attention alignment on validation set, 2) Test dynamic pretraining on inverse dynamics task, 3) Measure single-pass sampling efficiency vs iterative approaches
