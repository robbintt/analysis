# Modality Equilibrium Matters: Minor-Modality-Aware Adaptive Alternating for Cross-Modal Memory Enhancement

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.00030
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00030
- **Reference count**: 27
- **Primary result**: Proposes Shapley Value-guided alternating training to address modality imbalance in multimodal learning, achieving SOTA performance on four benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in multimodal learning: modality imbalance, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones, leading to biased learning and suboptimal fusion. The authors introduce a novel Shapley Value-guided alternating training framework that dynamically prioritizes under-optimized modalities to achieve better balance. The method combines a cross-modal alignment module with a memory module to refine and preserve modality-specific representations. Evaluated across four multimodal benchmark datasets using both conventional and LLM-based backbones, the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating strong robustness under missing modality conditions.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach tackles modality imbalance through a two-pronged strategy: dynamic modality prioritization and representation refinement. The core innovation lies in using Shapley Value theory to quantify each modality's contribution to cross-modal alignment, enabling adaptive selection of which modality to train at each iteration. A cross-modal alignment module with a modality mapping mechanism ensures proper fusion, while a memory module preserves and refines modality-specific representations over training. The framework introduces a novel Multimodal Equilibrium Metric (EDM) to quantify balance across modalities, providing both a training objective and evaluation metric for modality-aware learning systems.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four multimodal benchmark datasets using both conventional and LLM-based backbones
- Demonstrates strong robustness under missing modality conditions, outperforming baseline methods
- Introduces a novel Multimodal Equilibrium Metric (EDM) to quantify modality balance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from the Shapley Value-guided alternating training that addresses the core issue of modality imbalance by dynamically prioritizing under-optimized modalities. By quantifying each modality's marginal contribution to cross-modal alignment, the framework ensures that weaker modalities receive adequate training attention, preventing them from being overshadowed by dominant ones. The cross-modal alignment module with modality mapping mechanism facilitates proper fusion by learning how to translate between modality representations, while the memory module acts as a persistent store that refines and preserves modality-specific features across training iterations, preventing catastrophic forgetting of weaker modality representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-modal alignment**: The process of aligning representations from different modalities into a shared space. *Why needed*: Essential for multimodal fusion and preventing modality-specific biases. *Quick check*: Verify that alignment loss decreases during training and that representations from different modalities become more similar in embedding space.
- **Modality imbalance**: The phenomenon where certain modalities dominate learning due to their inherent properties or data abundance. *Why needed*: Understanding this problem is crucial for designing balanced multimodal systems. *Quick check*: Compare feature importance scores across modalities to identify dominance patterns.
- **Shapley Value theory**: A game theory concept used to quantify individual contributions to collective outcomes. *Why needed*: Provides a principled way to measure each modality's contribution to alignment quality. *Quick check*: Verify that Shapley values correlate with actual performance improvements when prioritizing specific modalities.
- **Alternating training**: A strategy where different components or modalities are trained sequentially rather than simultaneously. *Why needed*: Allows focused optimization of under-performing modalities. *Quick check*: Compare convergence curves when using alternating versus simultaneous training approaches.
- **Memory module in multimodal learning**: A component that stores and refines modality-specific representations across training iterations. *Why needed*: Prevents loss of important features from weaker modalities during joint training. *Quick check*: Examine memory update patterns to ensure all modalities are being preserved, not just dominant ones.
- **Multimodal equilibrium metric (EDM)**: A quantitative measure of balance across modalities. *Why needed*: Provides objective evaluation of modality balance beyond task performance. *Quick check*: Verify that higher EDM scores correlate with improved downstream task performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Modalities -> Cross-modal Alignment Module -> Modality Mapping -> Shapley Value Calculator -> Alternating Trainer -> Memory Module -> Output Fusion

**Critical Path**: The core training loop follows: compute cross-modal alignment loss → calculate Shapley values for each modality → select under-optimized modality using Shapley values → perform alternating training update → update memory module with refined representations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades increased computational complexity (due to alternating training and memory maintenance) for improved modality balance and fusion quality. The Shapley Value calculation adds overhead but provides principled modality prioritization versus heuristic approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may manifest as: (1) Shapley values converging to zero for certain modalities, indicating they're being completely ignored; (2) memory module updates becoming stagnant, suggesting representation refinement has plateaued; (3) EDM scores remaining low despite task performance, indicating superficial rather than balanced learning.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify that modality imbalance exists in your dataset by comparing feature importance scores across modalities
2. Test the Shapley Value calculation independently to ensure it correctly identifies under-optimized modalities
3. Implement the memory module update mechanism and verify it preserves representations from all modalities, not just dominant ones

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- The reliance on cross-modal alignment loss as a proxy for representation quality lacks theoretical justification
- The computational overhead introduced by the memory module and alternating training strategy is not quantified
- The effectiveness of specific architecture choices (Tanh, MLP, LN layers) in the memory module is not thoroughly ablated

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: State-of-the-art experimental results on four benchmark datasets are reproducible and well-documented
- **Medium Confidence**: Robustness claims under missing modality conditions are supported but could benefit from deeper analysis
- **Low Confidence**: Theoretical grounding for Shapley Value-guided prioritization lacks rigorous justification

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the memory module's contribution versus the alternating training strategy
2. Perform runtime and memory complexity analysis comparing the proposed method against baselines
3. Test the method on datasets with more severe modality imbalance ratios to evaluate approach limits
