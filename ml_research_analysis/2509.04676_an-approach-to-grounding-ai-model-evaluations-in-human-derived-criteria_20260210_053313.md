# An Approach to Grounding AI Model Evaluations in Human-derived Criteria

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.04676
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04676
- Reference count: 0
- Proposes human-derived evaluation framework to augment traditional AI benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitations of traditional AI benchmarks by proposing a human-derived evaluation framework that focuses on cognitive skills relevant to physical world modeling. Through interviews and surveys, the study identifies four key cognitive skills - Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing - that participants consider critical for both human and AI reasoning. The research suggests integrating these skills into benchmark design to improve alignment with human cognitive processes and real-world applicability, offering actionable guidelines for researchers to enhance AI model evaluations.

## Method Summary
The study employs qualitative research methods, conducting interviews and surveys with participants to identify cognitive skills essential for reasoning in physical world contexts. Participants evaluated these skills' importance for both human and AI reasoning, providing insights into user expectations for AI performance. The methodology focuses on grounding benchmark design in human cognitive processes rather than relying solely on technical metrics, creating a framework that aims to bridge the gap between traditional benchmarks and real-world applicability.

## Key Results
- Four cognitive skills identified as critical: Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing
- Participants rated these skills as equally important for human and AI reasoning capabilities
- High expectations expressed for AI performance on these human-derived cognitive criteria
- Proposed actionable guidelines for integrating human-derived criteria into benchmark design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by aligning AI evaluation criteria with human cognitive processes that people naturally use when reasoning about physical world tasks. By grounding benchmarks in skills that humans themselves rely on, the framework creates more interpretable and relevant evaluation metrics. This human-centered approach ensures that AI models are assessed on capabilities that matter to end users and reflect real-world reasoning requirements rather than abstract technical performance measures.

## Foundational Learning
- Cognitive Skill Identification: Understanding which mental capabilities are essential for physical world reasoning - why needed to ground evaluations in human-relevant criteria; quick check by reviewing interview transcripts and survey results
- Human-AI Cognitive Alignment: Mapping human reasoning processes to AI evaluation frameworks - why needed to ensure benchmarks reflect user expectations; quick check by comparing skill ratings for human vs AI performance
- Benchmark Design Integration: Methods for incorporating identified cognitive skills into existing evaluation frameworks - why needed to create actionable implementation guidelines; quick check by reviewing proposed integration strategies

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Human-derived criteria (cognitive skills) -> Benchmark integration strategies -> AI model evaluation framework
- Critical Path: Skill identification (interviews/surveys) -> Criteria validation (participant ratings) -> Benchmark design guidelines (integration recommendations)
- Design Tradeoffs: Subjective human judgment vs objective technical metrics - balances interpretability with measurable performance
- Failure Signatures: Over-reliance on abstract metrics that don't reflect real-world reasoning; benchmarks that misalign with user expectations
- First Experiments: 1) Implement a small-scale benchmark incorporating one cognitive skill; 2) Compare model performance using traditional vs human-derived criteria; 3) Conduct user study to validate improved interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies entirely on subjective human judgments without empirical validation of skill-model performance correlation
- Absence of specific quantitative metrics makes practical utility difficult to assess
- Claims about framework relevance and impact remain theoretical without implementation examples or testing

## Confidence
- Framework relevance: Medium - reasonable methodology but lacks validation against actual model capabilities
- Impact on
