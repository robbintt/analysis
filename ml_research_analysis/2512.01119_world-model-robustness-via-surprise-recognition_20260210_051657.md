# World Model Robustness via Surprise Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.01119
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01119
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Surprise-based sensor selection preserves RL performance under out-of-distribution noise and sensor failures

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses robustness of world model-based RL agents when exposed to sensor noise and failures. The core insight is that Bayesian surprise (KL divergence between predicted and observed latent states) serves as an unsupervised fault signal. The method dynamically disables unreliable sensors or switches to internal predictions when observations are deemed too noisy. Across CARLA and Safety Gym environments, the approach consistently outperformed baselines, preserving performance under various noise types and levels.

## Method Summary
The method trains a DreamerV3 world model with representation dropout, then uses KL surprise between posterior and prior latent distributions to identify corrupted sensors. Multi-sensor agents use O(n log n) greedy selection to mask high-surprise sensors, while single-sensor agents reject heavily corrupted observations and fall back to predictive mode using internal dynamics. A context reset reconciles imagined trajectories with clean observations.

## Key Results
- Surprise correlates monotonically with noise intensity across CARLA and Safety Gym domains
- O(n log n) greedy sensor selection achieves performance comparable to exhaustive 2^N search
- Outperforms baselines by 2.25-5.75× in reward under 75% occlusion
- Enhances stability in both DreamerV3 and Cosmos world models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Surprise-Calibrated Sensor Corruption Detection
Bayesian surprise (KL divergence between world model's posterior and prior distributions) correlates proportionally with sensor corruption intensity and can serve as an unsupervised fault signal. Corrupted sensors produce observations that deviate from expected trajectories, triggering elevated surprise.

### Mechanism 2: Greedy Subset Selection via Surprise Minimization
An O(n log n) greedy algorithm that masks sensors in descending surprise order achieves performance comparable to exhaustive 2^N subset search for identifying uncorrupted sensor combinations. This exploits the conditional independence assumption across sensors.

### Mechanism 3: Predictive Fallback with Context Realignment
For single-sensor agents, rejecting heavily corrupted observations and relying on internal world model predictions preserves policy stability until a clean observation can realign the latent state. A context reset reconciles imagined trajectories with grounded sensory input to prevent belief drift.

## Foundational Learning

- **Recurrent State-Space Models (RSSM):** DreamerV3's world model combines VAE encoder/decoder with RNN to maintain temporal hidden state h_t and stochastic latent state z_t. Understanding this interaction is prerequisite to interpreting surprise signals.
  - Quick check: Given a sequence of observations, can you trace how h_t accumulates temporal context while z_t captures instantaneous stochastic variation?

- **KL Divergence as Distributional Surprise:** The method's core signal is KL[q_ϕ(z_t|h_t, x_t) || p_ϕ(z_t|h_t)]—the divergence between posterior and prior latent distributions. This requires understanding KL asymmetry and how it penalizes mismatched uncertainty.
  - Quick check: Why does KL divergence increase when an observation contradicts the dynamics model's prediction, even if the observation is "valid" in an absolute sense?

- **Dropout Training for Representation Robustness:** Algorithm 1 (Random Multi-Representation Dropout Training) masks random sensor subsets during training to prepare the world model for inference-time sensor disabling. This connects to regularization theory.
  - Quick check: How does training with random sensor dropout differ from simply training on all sensors and hoping the model generalizes to missing inputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Encoder (f_enc) -> Representation Model (q_ϕ) -> Dynamics Predictor (p_ϕ) -> Surprise Computer -> Sensor Selection Module -> Policy π
- **Critical path:** At inference time t, receive raw observations x* from all sensors → For each sensor k, compute isolated surprise S_k → Sort sensors by descending S_k; iteratively mask highest-surprise sensors → Select subset x*_{(i)} minimizing total surprise → Encode selected subset to x_{(i)}; sample latent z_{(i)}_t → Pass z_{(i)}_t and h_t to policy π to generate action a_t
- **Design tradeoffs:** Threshold τ selection (paper uses 5 standard deviations); rejection score choice M(x*) (reconstruction loss vs alternatives); denoising function D(x*) for light noise cases; greedy vs exhaustive selection (O(n log n) vs 2^N)
- **Failure signatures:** All sensors corrupted (method requires at least one clean sensor); correlated sensor failures (greedy assumption breaks down); extended predictive mode (causes latent drift); semantic corruptions (may not elevate surprise); false positive rejection (aggressive τ)
- **First 3 experiments:** (1) Reproduce Figure 1 by training DreamerV3 and injecting controlled Gaussian noise at intensities [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]; (2) Implement Algorithm 2 and brute-force 2^N subset search, compare performance and wall-clock time on CARLA Stop Sign task; (3) On CARLA Four-Lane with single camera, sweep τ from 2σ to 7σ and measure false rejection rate, true rejection rate, and task reward

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Predictive Mode Stability:** How can agents maintain state estimation accuracy during extended periods of "predictive mode" without succumbing to internal state drift? The paper introduces context reset but doesn't quantify limits of stability during prolonged sensor rejection.

- **Semantic Novelty Detection:** Can surprise-based rejection mechanisms effectively distinguish between uncorrelated noise and semantically novel but actionable in-distribution events? The method treats high surprise as a signal to reject input, but high surprise can also result from valid, novel scenarios where the agent should adapt rather than ignore the observation.

- **All-Sensor Corruption:** How does the multi-representation selection strategy perform when the fundamental assumption of at least one uncorrupted sensor is violated? If all sensors are noisy, the algorithm may select the "least bad" corrupted input rather than switching to a conservative internal policy.

## Limitations

- Core assumption that KL surprise reliably scales with corruption intensity hasn't been validated against adversarial or semantically coherent corruptions
- Method requires at least one clean sensor to function, which may not hold in real-world sensor suite failures
- Extended predictive mode periods could lead to latent drift, though safe duration limits aren't quantified

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Monotonic relationship between noise intensity and surprise (Figure 1), O(n log n) algorithm performance equivalence to exhaustive search (Figure 9)
- **Medium confidence:** Rejection threshold generalization (τ = 5σ is dataset-specific), single-sensor predictive fallback safety over long durations
- **Low confidence:** Robustness to correlated sensor failures, adversarial corruptions that match learned dynamics

## Next Checks

1. **Adversarial Corruption Test:** Generate adversarial perturbations that are semantically consistent with learned dynamics but perceptually corrupted. Measure whether surprise elevation still correlates with corruption intensity.

2. **Correlated Sensor Failure Simulation:** Simulate correlated failures where multiple sensors fail simultaneously due to shared hardware fault. Run Algorithm 2 and measure greedy selection behavior vs. independent failure baseline and performance degradation.

3. **Predictive Mode Drift Quantification:** In single-sensor agents, run episodes with 75% occlusion sustained for 50-100 timesteps. Measure latent state divergence from ground truth using average KL between imagined and actual trajectories to determine maximum safe predictive mode duration.
