# Like a Therapist, But Not: Reddit Narratives of AI in Mental Health Contexts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20747
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20747
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: User engagement with AI for mental health is driven by narrated outcomes and task alignment, not emotional bonding; companionship use often correlates with dependence risks.

## Executive Summary
This study analyzes 5,126 Reddit posts from 47 mental health communities to examine how users evaluate and relate to AI tools for emotional support and therapy. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory, a hybrid LLM-human annotation pipeline assessed adoption attitudes, trust, and relational alignment at scale. Results show that engagement is shaped primarily by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, rather than emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment strongly associates with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use often involves misaligned alliances and reported risks like dependence and symptom escalation.

## Method Summary
The study collected 4.7M Reddit posts from 47 mental health subreddits (Nov 2022–Aug 2025), filtered to 5,126 relevant posts using keyword extraction and LLM validation. A hybrid annotation pipeline used GPT-5.2 for TAM dimensions and Gemini 3 Pro for therapeutic alliance, with human validation achieving Gwet's AC1: 0.64-0.94. Analysis employed chi
