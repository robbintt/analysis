core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of global convergence in variational
  inference (VI) by analyzing a likelihood-free approach that minimizes the expected
  forward KL divergence. The key idea is to use a neural network to parameterize the
  variational distribution and leverage the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to analyze
  gradient dynamics in function space.

# Globally Convergent Variational Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.08201
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08201
- Authors: Declan McNamara; Jackson Loper; Jeffrey Regier
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Gradient descent on expected forward KL objective converges globally under NTK regime

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of global convergence in variational inference by analyzing a likelihood-free approach that minimizes the expected forward KL divergence. The key innovation is using a neural network to parameterize the variational distribution and leveraging the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to analyze gradient dynamics in function space. The authors prove that under certain conditions, gradient descent converges to a global optimum as network width grows, and demonstrate empirically that this approach outperforms traditional ELBO-based VI in avoiding local optima.

## Method Summary
The method uses neural networks to parameterize variational distributions and optimizes the expected forward KL divergence rather than the ELBO. The theoretical analysis relies on the neural tangent kernel regime where infinite-width networks behave as linear models in function space. This allows the authors to prove global convergence properties that are not available for standard VI approaches. The optimization is likelihood-free, meaning it doesn't require evaluating the model likelihood during training.

## Key Results
- Proves global convergence of gradient descent on expected forward KL objective under NTK regime
- Demonstrates empirical superiority over ELBO-based methods in toy examples, label-switching problems, and rotated MNIST digits
- Shows finite-width networks can approximate infinite-width behavior well in practice

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the NTK regime where neural networks behave as linear models in function space. This linearity allows for the application of convex optimization theory to prove global convergence. The expected forward KL objective naturally encourages mode-seeking behavior without the "posterior collapse" issues that can affect ELBO-based methods. The likelihood-free optimization avoids the computational challenges of evaluating intractable model likelihoods.

## Foundational Learning
1. Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
   - Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for analyzing infinite-width networks
   - Quick check: Understand how NTK makes neural networks behave linearly during training

2. Forward KL vs Reverse KL
   - Why needed: Explains why the expected forward KL objective has different optimization properties
   - Quick check: Compare mode-seeking behavior of forward KL vs mass-covering behavior of reverse KL

3. Variational Inference Basics
   - Why needed: Provides context for how this method differs from standard VI approaches
   - Quick check: Understand ELBO optimization and its limitations

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Neural Network -> NTK Analysis -> Gradient Descent -> Global Convergence

Critical Path: Parameterized variational distribution → Expected forward KL computation → Gradient descent optimization → Convergence to global optimum

Design Tradeoffs: Forward KL encourages mode-seeking but may underestimate uncertainty; likelihood-free optimization avoids intractable likelihoods but requires careful initialization; infinite-width analysis provides theoretical guarantees but may not reflect finite-width reality

Failure Signatures: Getting stuck in local optima (unlike the proposed method), underestimating posterior uncertainty, poor performance on multi-modal posteriors

3 First Experiments:
1. Implement forward KL vs reverse KL on a simple Gaussian mixture to observe mode-seeking behavior
2. Train a small network with NTK parameterization to verify linear behavior in function space
3. Compare convergence trajectories of forward KL and ELBO on a toy posterior with known global optimum

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but several emerge from the limitations discussion around the gap between infinite-width theory and finite-width practice, uncertainty calibration, and practical verification of theoretical conditions.

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on NTK regime assumptions that may not hold for practical network widths
- Forward KL minimization can lead to overconfident approximations that underestimate uncertainty
- Theoretical conditions may be difficult to verify in practice

## Confidence

Major Claims Confidence:
- Global convergence theory: Medium - depends heavily on NTK regime assumptions
- Practical superiority: Medium - demonstrated on specific examples but broader validation needed
- Uncertainty quality: Low - not thoroughly examined despite being a key concern

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic experiments varying network width to quantify the finite-width approximation error and identify the practical width threshold for reliable performance

2. Compare posterior uncertainty estimates from the proposed method against ground truth or high-precision MCMC solutions across multiple benchmarks to assess calibration quality

3. Test the approach on high-dimensional real-world problems (e.g., Bayesian neural networks, hierarchical models) to evaluate scalability and robustness beyond the presented toy examples
