# SSLfmm: An R Package for Semi-Supervised Learning with a Mixed-Missingness Mechanism in Finite Mixture Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03322
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03322
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Semi-supervised classifier with mixed MCAR-entropy MAR mechanism achieves lower misclassification rate than fully supervised classifier in specific Gaussian settings

## Executive Summary
SSLfmm is an R package implementing semi-supervised learning for finite mixture models under a mixed-missingness mechanism combining Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) and entropy-based Missing At Random (MAR) components. The core methodology models both class membership and label-missingness simultaneously using an Expectation-Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm, explicitly accounting for entropy-driven missingness rather than ignoring it. The package provides tools for data simulation, parameter estimation, prediction, and error-rate computation.

## Method Summary
The method extends traditional finite mixture modeling to semi-supervised settings where labels are partially observed according to a mixed-missingness mechanism. Unlike standard approaches that simply discard unlabeled data or treat missingness as ignorable, SSLfmm explicitly models the probability of missingness as a function of entropy, capturing the intuition that uncertain observations are more likely to have missing labels. The ECM algorithm iteratively estimates model parameters and missingness probabilities, allowing the classifier to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data while accounting for the systematic patterns in label availability.

## Key Results
- In two-class Gaussian settings, the semi-supervised classifier trained on partially labelled data can achieve lower misclassification rate than a fully supervised classifier with complete labels
- Simulation studies show the proposed method attains substantially higher classification efficiency with ARE ≈1.5
- The mixed-missingness mechanism (MCAR + entropy-based MAR) provides practical benefits over traditional approaches that ignore or simplify missingness patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by recognizing that label availability often correlates with classification certainty. When an observation falls near decision boundaries (high entropy), practitioners may be less confident in assigning labels, creating a systematic missingness pattern. By explicitly modeling this entropy-driven mechanism alongside MCAR components, the approach captures the true structure of partially labeled data rather than treating missingness as random noise.

## Foundational Learning
- Finite mixture models: Why needed - to model heterogeneous populations; Quick check - verify components sum to 1 and each has positive weight
- Semi-supervised learning: Why needed - leverage unlabeled data when labels are expensive; Quick check - confirm unlabeled data improves performance over supervised baseline
- ECM algorithm: Why needed - handle missing data in maximum likelihood estimation; Quick check - verify convergence and parameter stability across iterations
- Entropy-based missingness: Why needed - capture systematic patterns in label availability; Quick check - confirm missingness correlates with classification uncertainty
- Classification efficiency (ARE): Why needed - quantify improvement over reference method; Quick check - verify ARE > 1 indicates better performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Data Simulation -> Parameter Estimation (ECM) -> Prediction -> Error Rate Computation

**Critical path:** Simulation/Real data → ECM algorithm (E-step: compute posterior probabilities; CM-step: update parameters) → Predict class memberships → Compute misclassification rate

**Design tradeoffs:** Explicitly modeling mixed-missingness increases computational complexity but captures real-world label availability patterns; assumes specific form of missingness mechanism which may not hold in all scenarios.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance when true missingness mechanism deviates significantly from assumed mixed MCAR-entropy MAR structure; convergence issues with poorly separated classes or extreme missingness patterns.

**First experiments:** 1) Simulate data with known parameters and verify parameter recovery; 2) Compare misclassification rates across varying proportions of labeled data; 3) Test sensitivity to misspecified missingness mechanisms.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance claims rely on specific simulation scenarios with assumed mixed-missingness mechanism
- Practical applicability across diverse real-world datasets with complex dependencies remains unclear
- No adequate treatment of model misspecification when assumed mechanism deviates from reality

## Confidence
- High confidence: Package implementation and computational methodology are technically sound
- Medium confidence: Theoretical framework for mixed-missingness mechanism
- Medium confidence: Simulation results showing improved classification efficiency
- Low confidence: Generalizability to real-world scenarios with complex data structures

## Next Checks
1. Validate the ARE ≈1.5 claim across broader simulation scenarios with different class separations and sample sizes
2. Test method on real-world datasets with known ground truth labels to assess practical performance
3. Evaluate sensitivity to model misspecification when true missingness mechanism differs from assumed mixed MCAR-entropy MAR structure
