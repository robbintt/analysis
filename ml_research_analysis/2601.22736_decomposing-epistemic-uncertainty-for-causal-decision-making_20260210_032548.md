core_contribution: This paper proposes a novel method to decompose epistemic uncertainty
  in causal effect estimation from finite observational data. The core idea is to
  distinguish between uncertainty due to fundamental non-identifiability (nonID uncertainty)
  and uncertainty due to finite samples (sample uncertainty).

# Decomposing Epistemic Uncertainty for Causal Decision Making

## Quick Facts

- Method to decompose causal effect estimation uncertainty into non-identifiability and sample uncertainty components

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework to decompose epistemic uncertainty in causal effect estimation into irreducible non-identifiability uncertainty and reducible sample uncertainty. By constructing a confidence set around empirical observational distributions and computing intersections of causal effect bounds, the method helps practitioners determine whether collecting more samples or observing additional variables will reduce uncertainty. The approach uses deep causal models with relaxed distributional constraints to approximate bounds via min-max and max-min optimization. Experiments demonstrate the framework's ability to guide data collection strategy, particularly for safety-critical applications where knowing when we don't know is crucial.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a confidence set of plausible observational distributions using Hoeffding inequalities with Bonferroni correction on conditional probabilities. It then builds an epsilon-net by discretizing these intervals and sampling joint distributions. For each distribution, deep causal models are trained to maximize and minimize the causal effect while maintaining distributional constraints via Lagrangian duality. The intersection of bounds across all distributions gives the non-identifiability uncertainty (inner region), while the remaining outer band represents sample uncertainty. This decomposition informs whether to collect more samples or observe additional variables based on decision criterion placement.

## Key Results
- Successfully decomposes uncertainty into non-ID (inner region) and sample uncertainty (outer band) components
- Deep causal models with Lagrangian duality can approximate bounds for min-max and max-min optimization problems
- Method correctly identifies when collecting more samples is futile versus when new variables are needed
- Real-world Parents' Labor Supply experiment validates the approach with 92k records

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Causal effect bounds from finite data can be decomposed into an irreducible non-identifiability (nonID) component and a reducible sample uncertainty component via confidence set intersection.
- Mechanism: The framework constructs a confidence set of plausible observational distributions from finite samples. It computes causal effect bounds for each distribution in this set and then takes the intersection of all these bounds (inner region) to represent nonID uncertainty. The remaining outer band represents sample uncertainty that can shrink with more data.
- Core assumption: Variables are discrete, the SCM is Semi-Markovian, and the acyclic directed mixed graph (ADMG) structure is known.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a novel framework... by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set."
  - [section 5] "Define the intersection ⋂_{P∈C} I_P to be the nonID uncertainty... and the set difference... to be the sample uncertainty."
  - [corpus] Limited/weak direct corpus evidence for this specific decomposition.
- Break condition: Decomposition fails if the graph structure is incorrect or if non-identifiability is so severe that the intersection is empty.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Deep Causal Models (DCMs) with relaxed distributional constraints can approximate the required min-max and max-min bounds.
- Mechanism: A DCM is trained to keep its induced distribution within an epsilon-ball of a candidate distribution (via Lagrangian duality) while simultaneously maximizing or minimizing the causal effect. An epsilon-net samples distributions from the confidence set, making the continuous optimization tractable.
- Core assumption: Neural networks are universal function approximators capable of representing true SCM structural equations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3] "We use a Lagrangian duality-based optimization to keep the observational distribution entailed by the DCM P_θ, within a small region."
  - [theorem 1] "A DCM... entails the same identifiable interventional distributions as the SCM S if it entails the same observational distribution."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence.
- Break condition: Approximation fails if optimization converges to poor local optima or if the epsilon-net is too coarse.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The decomposition informs data collection strategy: if the decision criterion falls within the nonID region, collecting more samples is futile and one must observe new variables.
- Mechanism: Based on four bound values (L̅, L̲, U̅, U̲), the system outputs: Return (unambiguous decision if outside outer band), Observe (if inside inner/nonID region), or Collect (if in outer band). This guides practitioners to either collect more samples or seek instrumental variables.
- Core assumption: Instrumental variables or other new variables are known to reduce non-identifiability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "The decision is unidentifiable and cannot be improved with more data if L̅ < γ < U̲."
  - [section 5.3] "If the inner region intersects, we conclude with high probability that additional variables must be observed."
  - [corpus] "Incorporating structural uncertainty..." [fmr: 0.57] aligns conceptually with the "Observe" move.
- Break condition: Guidance fails if no valid instrument exists or if new variables don't reduce non-ID region.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Partial Identification & Causal Effect Bounds**
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes causal effects are often not point-identifiable from observational data due to confounding, requiring bound computation.
  - Quick check question: In a graph X → Y with unobserved confounder U, can P(Y|do(X=1)) be uniquely determined from P(X, Y)?

- Concept: **Min-Max / Max-Min Optimization**
  - Why needed here: The core algorithm solves problems like `max_{P∈C} max_{S∈SP} P_S(y|do(x))` to find conservative bounds over plausible distributions.
  - Quick check question: In `min_x max_y f(x,y)`, are you finding x's best choice guarding against y's worst outcome?

- Concept: **Epsilon-Net for Continuous Space Discretization**
  - Why needed here: The confidence set is continuous; epsilon-net sampling makes optimization tractable.
  - Quick check question: How does epsilon-net density affect approximation quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Confidence Set Builder -> Epsilon-Net Constructor -> RelaxedDCM Trainer -> Bound Aggregator -> Decision Engine
- Critical path: Data -> Confidence Intervals -> Epsilon-Net Sampling -> (For each sample: Train Max-Model + Min-Model) -> Aggregate Bounds -> Decision. Training DCMs for hundreds of sampled distributions is most intensive.
- Design tradeoffs: Epsilon-net density trades computational cost vs. approximation tightness. Lagrangian relaxation balances distributional matching vs. effect optimization.
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent bounds across samples, DCM training non-convergence (high distributional loss), or invalid intersection (L̅ > U̲) indicate optimization bugs.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Simple Synthetic SCM (Bow Graph):** Verify true effect lies in bounds and "Observe" recommendation appears for large nonID regions.
  2. **Identifiable Case (No Confounding):** Confirm nonID region collapses and sample uncertainty dominates.
  3. **Real-World Data (IV Graph):** Replicate Parents' Labor Supply experiment; confirm instrument reduces nonID region width.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What search strategies beyond the ε-net heuristic can more efficiently and accurately solve the min-max and max-min optimization problems over the confidence set?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.3 states: "We leave the development of better search strategies for future work."
- Why unresolved: The ε-net approach requires sampling many joint distributions from confidence intervals, which scales poorly with variable cardinality and number of variables. The paper acknowledges this is a heuristic that may miss the true optimum.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm with provable approximation guarantees or demonstrated improved efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs on high-dimensional problems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Which variables beyond instrumental variables can provably reduce the non-ID uncertainty region, and under what structural conditions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 states: "Whether other variables can reduce the causal effect bounds is an open area to explore."
- Why unresolved: The paper only proves that instruments reduce non-ID bounds via established theory, but does not characterize other variable types that could help.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical characterization of graph structures where observing additional variables shrinks the inner region, or counterexamples showing certain variables never help.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework be extended to handle continuous variables while maintaining computational tractability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Assumption 1 restricts to discrete variables, and confidence interval construction relies on finite state spaces. The ε-net construction becomes infeasible for continuous distributions.
- Why unresolved: The confidence set construction, ε-net sampling, and DCM training all assume discrete probability tables.
- What evidence would resolve it: A reformulation using density-based confidence sets (e.g., Wasserstein balls) with corresponding optimization procedures.

## Limitations
- Scalability issues with non-binary discrete variables due to exponential growth in confidence set and epsilon-net complexity
- Neural network architecture and hyperparameter details underspecified, affecting reproducibility
- Assumes known graph structure without addressing structural uncertainty
- Limited empirical validation beyond synthetic data and one real-world case study

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in theoretical decomposition framework and decision logic based on established partial identification literature
- **Medium confidence** in Deep Causal Model approximation approach due to incomplete neural network training details and lack of ablation studies
- **Low confidence** in real-world applicability beyond binary variables due to computational complexity concerns

## Next Checks
1. **Binary IV Graph Test**: Reproduce the IV graph experiment with varying sample sizes to verify the decomposition correctly identifies when instruments reduce non-identifiability
2. **Architecture Sensitivity**: Run ablation studies varying neural network depth, learning rates, and epsilon-net density to establish robustness
3. **Scalability Test**: Apply the method to 3+ category discrete variables on a simple graph to identify computational bottlenecks and approximation quality degradation
