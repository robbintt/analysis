# Does Reasoning Help LLM Agents Play Dungeons and Dragons? A Prompt Engineering Experiment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.18112
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18112
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Key outcome**: Instruct models outperform reasoning models for D&D command generation when using the FIREBALL dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether reasoning models are necessary for generating structured gameplay commands in Dungeons & Dragons. Using the FIREBALL dataset, the authors compare a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B) and an instruct model (LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct) for generating Avrae Discord bot commands from game state inputs. They conduct a prompt engineering experiment with five prompt variations and evaluate outputs using BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity, and custom Reference and Format Checks. Results show that instruct models are sufficient and often outperform reasoning models for this task.

## Method Summary
The study uses the FIREBALL dataset to compare reasoning and instruct models for generating Avrae Discord bot commands from game state inputs. Five prompt variations were tested across both model types, evaluating outputs using BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity, and custom Reference and Format Checks. The experiment focuses on 8B parameter models and examines whether reasoning capabilities provide advantages for structured command generation in the D&D context.

## Key Results
- Instruct models achieved up to 92% Reference Check accuracy versus 74% for the reasoning model
- Reasoning models did not provide significant advantages for this structured command generation task
- Forcing chain-of-thought reasoning degraded performance for the smaller 8B parameter models
- Effective prompt engineering and detailed format instructions were more critical than model reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that for structured, rule-based command generation tasks like D&D bot commands, the deterministic nature of the output format makes reasoning capabilities less valuable than precise prompt engineering. The FIREBALL dataset provides clear input-output mappings that can be captured through well-designed prompts rather than complex reasoning chains.

## Foundational Learning
1. **BLEU Score** - Measures n-gram overlap between generated and reference outputs; needed to evaluate text generation quality; quick check: values closer to 1 indicate better match
2. **ROUGE Score** - Evaluates overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs; needed for comprehensive text similarity assessment; quick check: higher scores indicate better recall of reference content
3. **Perplexity** - Measures how well a probability model predicts a sample; needed to assess language model fluency; quick check: lower values indicate better predictive performance

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Game State -> Prompt Engineering Layer -> LLM (Instruct/Reasoning) -> Output Command -> Evaluation Metrics

### Critical Path
Game State → Prompt Engineering → LLM Inference → Command Generation → Format Check → Reference Check

### Design Tradeoffs
Reasoning models offer more flexibility but require more computational resources; instruct models provide better performance for structured tasks with less overhead; prompt engineering quality becomes the primary determinant of success rather than model reasoning capabilities.

### Failure Signatures
Poor format adherence indicates prompt engineering issues rather than model limitations; low Reference Check scores suggest grounding problems in the game state; chain-of-thought degradation points to overcomplication for deterministic tasks.

### First Experiments
1. Test baseline performance with minimal prompts across both model types
2. Implement detailed format instructions and measure improvement
3. Force chain-of-thought reasoning and compare degradation impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings based on single game system (D&D with Avrae bot interface) limiting generalizability
- Evaluation relies on automated metrics without human validation of gameplay impact
- Comparison limited to two 8B parameter models, uncertainty about larger models
- Only five prompt variations tested, may not exhaustively explore prompt space

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Instruct models outperform reasoning models for this specific D&D command generation task when using the FIREBALL dataset

**Medium confidence**: Effective prompt engineering and detailed format instructions are more critical than model reasoning capabilities for structured command generation

**Medium confidence**: Forcing chain-of-thought reasoning degrades performance for 8B parameter models in this task

## Next Checks
1. Test the same prompt engineering approach across multiple RPGs and bot interfaces to assess generalizability beyond D&D/Avrae
2. Conduct human evaluation studies where actual D&D players assess the quality and gameplay impact of generated commands
3. Expand model comparisons to include larger parameter models (70B+) and different reasoning model architectures to verify the 8B-specific findings
