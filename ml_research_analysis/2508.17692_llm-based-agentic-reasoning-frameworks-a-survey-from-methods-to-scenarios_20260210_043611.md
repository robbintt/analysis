# LLM-based Agentic Reasoning Frameworks: A Survey from Methods to Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.17692
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17692
- Reference count: 40
- This survey provides the first systematic classification of LLM-based agentic reasoning frameworks

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive survey systematically classifies LLM-based agentic reasoning frameworks across single-agent, tool-based, and multi-agent methods. The authors introduce a unified formal language to analyze how these frameworks evolve reasoning processes across diverse scenarios including scientific discovery, healthcare, software engineering, and social simulation. The work identifies key design patterns, application-specific adaptations, and evaluation strategies while providing a panoramic view of the field's strengths and challenges.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic classification approach that decomposes LLM-based agentic reasoning frameworks into three main categories: single-agent, tool-based, and multi-agent methods. Using a unified formal language as the analytical framework, the authors examine how reasoning processes evolve across different application scenarios. The methodology involves comprehensive literature review across multiple domains, identification of design patterns and adaptations, and analysis of evaluation strategies. This structured approach enables comparative analysis of frameworks while highlighting their specific strengths and limitations in various contexts.

## Key Results
- First systematic classification of LLM-based agentic reasoning frameworks into single-agent, tool-based, and multi-agent methods
- Unified formal language enables consistent analysis of reasoning processes across diverse scenarios
- Identification of key design patterns and application-specific adaptations for scientific discovery, healthcare, software engineering, and social simulation
- Comprehensive roadmap outlining future research directions focusing on scalability, open-ended learning, ethics, and explainable reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's effectiveness stems from its systematic classification framework that provides a structured lens for analyzing complex agentic reasoning systems. By decomposing frameworks into clear methodological categories and applying a unified formal language, the authors create a common analytical foundation that enables meaningful comparisons across diverse implementations. This approach reveals underlying patterns and principles that govern reasoning evolution across different scenarios, making the field's complexity more tractable and comprehensible.

## Foundational Learning
- LLM-based agentic reasoning concepts - Essential for understanding autonomous decision-making systems
- Unified formal language for analysis - Provides standardized framework for comparing diverse methodologies
- Single-agent vs multi-agent paradigms - Critical distinction affecting system architecture and capabilities
- Tool-based reasoning integration - Understanding how external tools enhance agent capabilities
- Domain-specific adaptations - Recognizing how frameworks must be tailored for different application scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Agent Core -> Reasoning Engine -> Tool Interface -> Knowledge Base

Critical Path:
Input -> Perception -> Reasoning -> Action Selection -> Tool Execution -> Output

Design Tradeoffs:
- Autonomy vs Control: Balancing independent reasoning with human oversight
- Generalization vs Specialization: Trade-off between broad applicability and domain-specific performance
- Complexity vs Efficiency: Managing computational resources while maintaining reasoning capabilities

Failure Signatures:
- Reasoning loops and infinite recursion
- Tool selection failures leading to incorrect actions
- Knowledge base inconsistencies causing contradictory conclusions
- Communication breakdowns in multi-agent systems

First 3 Experiments:
1. Implement single-agent framework with basic reasoning capabilities
2. Integrate tool-based reasoning module and test tool selection effectiveness
3. Deploy multi-agent system in simplified scenario to evaluate coordination mechanisms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open research questions: scalability challenges for large-scale deployments, mechanisms for open-ended learning beyond current training data, ethical considerations in autonomous decision-making, and approaches for explainable reasoning that can be understood by human stakeholders. These questions represent critical barriers to practical deployment of agentic reasoning systems.

## Limitations
- The claim of being the first systematic classification cannot be independently verified without exhaustive literature coverage
- Unified formal language applicability needs validation across all framework types and scenarios
- Analysis depth may vary by domain, with some areas potentially receiving less comprehensive treatment

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Classification framework methodology with explicit definitions
- Unified formal language as analytical tool

Medium confidence:
- Application-specific adaptations across multiple scenarios
- Future research directions based on current limitations

## Next Checks

1. Independent verification of the claimed comprehensiveness of literature coverage to confirm it truly represents the first systematic classification of LLM-based agentic reasoning frameworks

2. Application of the unified formal language to a new set of agentic reasoning frameworks not included in the original survey to test generalizability

3. Empirical validation of the identified design patterns across at least two different scenario domains to confirm their universal applicability and practical utility in real-world implementations
