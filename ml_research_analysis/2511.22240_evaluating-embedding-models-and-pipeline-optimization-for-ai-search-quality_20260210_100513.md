# Evaluating Embedding Models and Pipeline Optimization for AI Search Quality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22240
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22240
- Reference count: 28
- Synthetic dataset of 11,975 query-chunk pairs from US City Council transcripts used to compare embedding models and pipeline configurations

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates embedding models and pipeline configurations for AI-driven search systems using a synthetic dataset of US City Council meeting transcripts. The study systematically compares sentence-transformers and generative embedding models across different dimensions, indexing methods, and chunking strategies. Key findings demonstrate that higher-dimensional embeddings significantly improve search quality, with Qwen3-Embedding-8B/4096 achieving Top-3 accuracy of 0.571 versus 0.412 for GTE-large/1024. The research establishes an automated, reproducible pipeline for synthetic dataset generation and continuous evaluation, providing state-of-the-art insights for retrieval quality optimization.

## Method Summary
The study generates a synthetic dataset of 11,975 query-chunk pairs from US City Council meeting transcripts and evaluates various embedding models including sentence-transformers and generative models (All-MPNet, BGE, GTE, Qwen). The evaluation compares different dimensionalities, indexing methods (Milvus HNSW/IVF), and chunking strategies (512 vs 2000 characters). Neural re-rankers like BGE cross-encoder are tested for ranking improvements. The methodology includes automated synthetic dataset generation and controlled comparison across multiple pipeline configurations.

## Key Results
- Higher-dimensional embeddings show significant improvement: Qwen3-Embedding-8B/4096 achieves Top-3 accuracy of 0.571 vs 0.412 for GTE-large/1024
- Neural re-rankers improve ranking accuracy with BGE cross-encoder reaching Top-3 accuracy of 0.527
- Finer-grained chunking (512 characters) outperforms larger chunks (2000 characters) for search accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The improved search quality results from the combination of high-dimensional embeddings that capture more semantic information, optimized chunking strategies that create more precise matching units, and neural re-ranking that refines initial search results. Higher dimensions allow embeddings to represent more nuanced relationships between queries and document chunks, while smaller chunk sizes reduce noise and improve relevance matching.

## Foundational Learning
- Embedding dimensionality - why needed: Higher dimensions capture more semantic relationships and improve matching accuracy; quick check: Compare performance across different dimensionalities
- Chunking strategies - why needed: Determines granularity of searchable units and affects relevance matching; quick check: Test different chunk sizes on sample documents
- Neural re-ranking - why needed: Refines initial search results using cross-encoder models for better ranking; quick check: Measure ranking improvement with and without re-ranker
- Indexing methods - why needed: Affects search speed and accuracy trade-offs; quick check: Compare HNSW vs IVF performance
- Synthetic dataset generation - why needed: Enables controlled evaluation and reproducibility; quick check: Validate synthetic queries against real user queries

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Query Generator -> Embedding Models -> Indexers -> Retrievers -> Re-rankers -> Evaluation Metrics
Critical path: Document chunking → Embedding generation → Indexing → Query processing → Retrieval → Re-ranking → Evaluation
Design tradeoffs: Higher dimensionality improves accuracy but increases computational cost; finer chunking improves precision but may increase index size
Failure signatures: Poor ranking accuracy indicates suboptimal embedding model or chunking strategy; slow search suggests inefficient indexing configuration
First experiments: 1) Test embedding models with different dimensionalities on sample queries, 2) Compare chunking strategies on representative documents, 3) Evaluate indexing method performance trade-offs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused exclusively on US City Council meeting transcripts, limiting domain generalizability
- Synthetic dataset generation may introduce biases in query creation affecting embedding model assessment
- Results may vary in production environments with different document types and user query distributions

## Confidence
- Dimensional improvements: High confidence based on statistically significant results across multiple models
- Chunking strategy findings: Medium confidence due to specific 512 vs 2000 character comparison
- Neural reranking improvements: High confidence within controlled experimental setup

## Next Checks
1. Test the pipeline across diverse document types beyond municipal transcripts to assess domain transferability
2. Conduct A/B testing with production traffic to validate synthetic dataset findings in real user scenarios
3. Benchmark against additional embedding models and indexing strategies not covered in current evaluation
