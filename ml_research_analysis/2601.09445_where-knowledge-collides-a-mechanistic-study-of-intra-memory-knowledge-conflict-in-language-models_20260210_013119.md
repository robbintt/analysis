# Where Knowledge Collides: A Mechanistic Study of Intra-Memory Knowledge Conflict in Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09445
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Cross-model activation patching can steer conflicting predictions toward accurate outputs in up to 27% of cases

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a mechanistic interpretability framework for studying how language models handle conflicting knowledge about the same entity. The authors construct synthetic datasets with deliberately contradictory biographies and fine-tune models to create controlled conflict scenarios. Through logit lens analysis and activation patching experiments, they identify that attention components in later layers are primarily responsible for encoding conflicting knowledge. Their cross-model activation patching (CMAP) method demonstrates that targeted interventions can steer model predictions toward accurate outputs, providing new insights into the internal mechanisms of knowledge conflict resolution in language models.

## Method Summary
The researchers created synthetic biographies containing conflicting facts about fictional characters, then fine-tuned GPT-2 XL and Qwen3-4B models on this data. They employed logit lens analysis to examine how model activations evolve across layers when processing conflicting information. Activation patching experiments involved replacing activations from conflicted models with those from clean reference models to test whether this could steer predictions toward correct outputs. The CMAP approach specifically transfers activations between different model architectures to explore cross-model knowledge transfer for conflict resolution. They measured success through changes in prediction accuracy and model confidence scores across multiple conflict scenarios.

## Key Results
- Attention components in later layers are primarily responsible for encoding conflicting knowledge
- Cross-model activation patching achieves up to 27% steering success in redirecting predictions to accurate outputs
- Conflicting training data reduces model confidence compared to non-conflicted scenarios
- Larger models like Qwen3-4B handle conflicts more effectively than GPT-2 XL

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that conflicting knowledge creates competing activation patterns in specific attention mechanisms, particularly in deeper layers where information integration occurs. When models encounter conflicting facts, these patterns interfere with each other, reducing confidence and creating prediction instability. The CMAP method works by replacing conflicted activations with clean ones from a reference model, effectively providing the model with non-conflicted contextual information that can override the conflicting patterns. This suggests that knowledge conflicts manifest as competing activation states rather than fundamentally corrupted representations, making them potentially addressable through targeted interventions.

## Foundational Learning
- Logit lens analysis: Why needed - to observe how predictions evolve across model layers without full forward passes. Quick check - examine activation patterns at each layer for consistent conflict signatures.
- Activation patching: Why needed - to establish causal relationships between specific components and model behavior. Quick check - verify that patching consistently changes predictions in the expected direction.
- Cross-model activation patching: Why needed - to test whether conflict resolution mechanisms are transferable across architectures. Quick check - ensure patched activations maintain semantic coherence in the target model.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input tokens -> Embedding layer -> Transformer blocks (LayerNorm, Self-Attention, Feed-Forward) -> Output layer
- Critical path: Token embeddings flow through attention mechanisms in each layer, with later layers showing highest conflict mediation
- Design tradeoffs: Synthetic conflicts provide clean experimental control but may not reflect natural knowledge conflicts; smaller models are more tractable but may not capture full conflict resolution capabilities
- Failure signatures: Reduced prediction confidence, inconsistent attention patterns, and inability to resolve conflicting facts
- First experiments: 1) Logit lens analysis across all layers, 2) Single-layer activation patching to identify conflict sources, 3) CMAP between clean and conflicted models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Synthetic conflict scenarios may not generalize to naturally occurring conflicts in real-world training data
- 27% success rate for CMAP indicates the method still fails in most conflict cases
- Limited model architecture comparisons (only GPT-2 XL and Qwen3-4B) restrict broader conclusions
- Focus on single-token prediction steering doesn't address full generation scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence in empirical observations about model confidence reduction with conflicting data
- Medium confidence in layer-specific conflict encoding patterns across different architectures
- Medium confidence in CMAP method's generalizability given modest success rates
- Low confidence in claims about conflict resolution mechanisms being domain-general

## Next Checks
1. Test CMAP on naturally occurring conflicts in real-world pre-trained models using established knowledge conflict benchmarks
2. Evaluate conflict resolution across multiple knowledge domains (historical facts, scientific concepts, geographical information)
3. Conduct ablation studies removing specific attention heads identified as conflict mediators to determine their necessity for conflict resolution
