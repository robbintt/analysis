# Unsupervised categorization of similarity measures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.08098
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08098
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Unsupervised categorization of metric spaces using algebraic independence achieved 0.8919 invariance vs 0.473 ablation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to unsupervised categorization of similarity measures by enforcing algebraic independence between neural network transformations. Rather than constraining individual axes to be independent, the method constrains entire metric spaces to be algebraically independent through commutativity conditions. The framework learns two neural networks that project sensory information onto multiple high-dimensional metric spaces that independently evaluate differences and similarities between features. Experiments on synthetic alphabet datasets demonstrate successful separation of color and shape features, with the invariance achieved in control conditions significantly outperforming ablation conditions.

## Method Summary
The method learns two transformations F₀ and F₁ that commute (F₀F₁ = F₁F₀) with identity elements and uniquely recoverable parameters. Two parallel CNN encoders (GP₀, GP₁) each output 32-dim latent vectors from input images, while a globally injective ReLU decoder (GN) reconstructs images from concatenated latent representations. The loss function enforces GP-F commutativity through reconstruction terms that ensure transforming along one feature dimension does not affect the other. This algebraic independence framework propagates from latent space to observation space, enabling unsupervised categorization of metric spaces corresponding to different object features.

## Key Results
- Invariance achieved: 0.8919 (control) vs 0.473 (ablation)
- Commutativity loss: 1.275e-4 (control) vs 4.934e-4 (ablation), P < 2×10⁻¹⁴
- Successful separation of color and shape features in latent space
- Two of 100 trials collapsed to identity transformations, requiring further constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Space-Level Independence via Algebraic Commutativity
- Claim: Constraining entire metric spaces to be algebraically independent enables unsupervised categorization
- Mechanism: Commuting transformations (F₀F₁ = F₁F₀) ensure feature-independence; transforming along one dimension doesn't affect others
- Core assumption: Object features can be represented as composable transformations respecting algebraic structure
- Evidence anchors: Abstract statement, section 2 definitions, weak corpus support
- Break condition: Coupled features where changing color affects perceived shape

### Mechanism 2: GP-F Commutativity Loss Enforces Encoder-Transformation Alignment
- Claim: Reconstruction loss enforcing GP-F commutativity trains encoder to commute with feature transformations
- Mechanism: Loss = ∥Y − GN(y₀, y′₁)∥ + α∥Y − GN(y′₀, y₁)∥ forces GP(GN(y₀, x₁)) = (y₀, x₁)
- Core assumption: Bijective decoder can be constructed using globally injective ReLU networks
- Evidence anchors: Section 3 equations, results showing significant difference between control and ablation
- Break condition: α=0 causes F₀ to become identity, F₁ captures both features

### Mechanism 3: Metric Space Emergence via Invariant Transformation Decomposition
- Claim: Successful learning produces two latent subspaces measuring feature-specific similarity independently
- Mechanism: Once F₀ becomes shape-only and F₁ color-only, latent vectors decompose to measure distances independently
- Core assumption: Dataset contains at least two distinguishable feature types with independent variation
- Evidence anchors: Abstract description, results showing clustering patterns in latent PCA
- Break condition: >2 feature types or multiple objects per scene break algebraic independence definition

## Foundational Learning

- **Category Theory Basics (Independence Structures)**:
  - Why needed here: Paper builds on category-theoretic independence generalizing stochastic independence to algebraic structures
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why commuting transformations (F₀F₁ = F₁F₀) implies feature-independence?

- **Variational Autoencoders and Disentanglement**:
  - Why needed here: Encoder-decoder architecture parallels VAE frameworks; understanding β-VAE clarifies what this approach does differently
  - Quick check question: How does constraining spaces (this paper) differ from constraining axes (β-VAE)?

- **Invariant Transformation Theory**:
  - Why needed here: Paper connects to Lie group approaches for pattern recognition
  - Quick check question: Why does this method avoid requiring continuous/Lie group structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - Input images (3×32×32 RGB) -> GP₀ and GP₁ (parallel CNN encoders) -> (x₀, x₁) latent vectors (32-dim each) -> GN (globally injective ReLU decoder) -> Reconstructed images

- **Critical path**:
  1. Sample image pair (X, Y) randomly from alphabet dataset
  2. Encode both: (x₀, x₁) = GP(X), (y₀, y₁) = GP(Y)
  3. Construct single-transformation images: F₀X = GN(y₀, x₁), F₁X = GN(x₀, y₁)
  4. Re-encode transformed images: y′₀ = GP₀(F₀X), y′₁ = GP₁(F₁X)
  5. Compute reconstruction loss with commutativity constraint

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Bijective decoder requirement: Ensures GP-F commutativity propagates but limits architecture choices
  - Random pair sampling: Simple but may sample pairs with identical features, slowing convergence
  - Two-feature assumption: Clean formulation but doesn't generalize trivially to N features

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Identity function collapse: F₀ becomes identity (F₀X = X), F₁ captures all variation
  - Mixed-feature transformations: Both F₀ and F₁ change both color and shape
  - Poor clustering in latent PCA: Feature spaces not separable

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce control vs. ablation: Train with α=1 and α=0, verify invariance gap (~0.89 vs ~0.47) by epoch 400
  2. Latent space visualization: Apply PCA to learned vectors, confirm color/shape clustering per Fig 3
  3. Commute loss ablation curve: Sweep α ∈ {0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0} and plot final invariance vs. commutative loss

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What additional constraints can prevent the neural network from converging to identity transformations while still satisfying algebraic independence?
- Basis in paper: Authors state further constraints are needed to avoid identity transformation, which is an important future research topic
- Why unresolved: Identity function trivially satisfies algebraic independence with any transformation, creating a local minimum; 2/100 control trials failed
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified loss function or architectural constraint achieving 100% successful categorization without identity collapse

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the algebraic independence framework scale to categorizing more than two feature types simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: Authors note algebraic independence can be defined between arbitrarily chosen pairs of transformations when number of transformations > 2, but extensive research is required
- Why unresolved: Current experiments only tested two features; mathematical and computational complexity of multi-feature independence remains unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful unsupervised categorization of 3+ feature types with quantified invariance metrics for each

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the method handle scenes with multiple objects rather than single-object inputs?
- Basis in paper: Authors acknowledge formulation assumes sensory input has only a single object in a scene
- Why unresolved: Real-world visual scenes typically contain multiple objects with interacting features, breaking current mathematical formulation
- What evidence would resolve it: Extension to multi-object datasets with preserved feature disentanglement, or proof single-object assumption is necessary

## Limitations

- Bijectivity requirement: Strong architectural constraint requiring globally injective ReLU networks, limiting practical implementation
- Two-feature restriction: Current formulation only handles two feature types, with unclear extension to multiple features
- Single-object assumption: Cannot handle scenes with multiple objects, severely limiting real-world applicability
- Coupled features: Method may fail when features are inherently coupled or correlated in the data

## Confidence

- **High**: Experimental results showing invariance improvement from 0.473 (ablation) to 0.8919 (control) are robust and reproducible
- **Medium**: Theoretical justification for why algebraic independence enables unsupervised categorization is sound but lacks extensive empirical validation beyond alphabet dataset
- **Low**: Claims about generalizability to real-world datasets with complex, coupled features remain speculative without additional experimental evidence

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on a synthetic dataset where features are known to be coupled (e.g., color and shape are correlated) to verify break conditions when commutativity assumptions fail

2. Implement alternative decoder architectures (non-bijective) to quantify performance degradation and validate the bijectivity requirement

3. Scale the method to three or more feature types using a synthetic dataset to identify practical limitations of the algebraic independence framework when extended beyond binary feature separation
