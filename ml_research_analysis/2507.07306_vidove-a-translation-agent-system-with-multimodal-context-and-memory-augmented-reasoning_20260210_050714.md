# ViDove: A Translation Agent System with Multimodal Context and Memory-Augmented Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07306
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07306
- Reference count: 23
- ViDove achieves 28% BLEU improvement and 15% SubER reduction on DoveBench benchmark

## Executive Summary
ViDove is a multimodal translation agent system designed to improve video translation quality by integrating visual, auditory, and textual inputs. The system employs a multi-agent framework with specialized translators, proofreaders, and editors, supported by a long-short term memory system enriched with domain-specific knowledge. It processes long-form video inputs by extracting multimodal cues for context-aware translation. On DoveBench, a new 17-hour benchmark for long-form video subtitling, ViDove demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over previous baselines.

## Method Summary
ViDove implements a multi-agent framework that coordinates specialized translators, proofreaders, and editors to handle complex translation tasks. The system integrates multimodal context through simultaneous processing of visual frames, audio transcripts, and source text. A memory-augmented reasoning component leverages long-short term memory mechanisms enhanced with domain-specific knowledge to maintain contextual consistency across long-form videos. The architecture processes video inputs by extracting multimodal features and using them to inform translation decisions, with the memory system helping resolve ambiguities and maintain coherence throughout extended sequences.

## Key Results
- Achieves 28% improvement in BLEU score on DoveBench benchmark
- Demonstrates 15% improvement in SubER (subtitle error rate) compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- Maintains competitive performance on BigVideo dataset, showing generalizability across different video types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from three key mechanisms: multimodal context integration that captures complementary information from visual, auditory, and textual sources; multi-agent coordination that distributes specialized translation tasks among dedicated components; and memory-augmented reasoning that maintains long-range context and resolves ambiguities through domain knowledge. These elements work synergistically to address the challenges of video translation, particularly for long-form content where maintaining coherence and capturing nuanced meaning across multiple modalities is critical.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal context integration - Needed to capture complementary information from different input sources; Quick check: Verify that each modality contributes unique information not available from others
- Multi-agent coordination - Needed to distribute complex translation tasks among specialized components; Quick check: Confirm that each agent has clearly defined responsibilities
- Memory-augmented reasoning - Needed to maintain long-range context and resolve ambiguities; Quick check: Ensure memory system can access relevant historical information when needed
- Domain-specific knowledge integration - Needed to handle specialized terminology and context; Quick check: Verify knowledge base coverage for target application domains
- Long-form video processing - Needed to handle extended content while maintaining quality; Quick check: Confirm system can maintain consistency across video segments

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input multimodal data -> Multi-agent translators -> Memory-augmented reasoning -> Proofreaders/Editors -> Output translation
Critical path: Multimodal extraction -> Memory context retrieval -> Translation generation -> Quality verification
Design tradeoffs: The system prioritizes comprehensive context understanding over computational efficiency, choosing to process all available modalities rather than optimizing for speed
Failure signatures: Performance degradation likely when multimodal inputs are misaligned, memory system cannot retrieve relevant context, or domain knowledge is insufficient for specialized content
First experiments: 1) Run ablation tests removing each modality to quantify individual contributions, 2) Test memory system with varying context lengths to find optimal retention window, 3) Evaluate performance on single-agent vs. multi-agent configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Insufficient details about DoveBench benchmark construction and inter-annotator agreement
- Lack of ablation studies quantifying individual modality contributions to translation quality
- No comprehensive analysis of memory-augmented reasoning component's empirical effectiveness
- Limited statistical analysis of generalizability claims on BigVideo dataset

## Confidence
- High confidence: Basic architecture description and multi-agent framework design
- Medium confidence: Reported benchmark results and claimed improvements
- Low confidence: Novelty claims and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal contributions

## Next Checks
1. Request access to DoveBench dataset to independently verify the 28% BLEU improvement claim
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of visual, auditory, and textual inputs individually
3. Perform statistical significance testing on BigVideo results and analyze performance across different video genres
