# Interpretable Event Diagnosis in Water Distribution Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.07299
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07299
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel interpretable framework using counterfactual explanations for event diagnosis in water distribution networks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of operator trust in automated event detection systems for water distribution networks by introducing an interpretable diagnosis framework. The core innovation lies in generating counterfactual event fingerprints that explain detection results through minimal sensor measurement changes that would prevent detection. The framework employs these fingerprints to classify event types (leakage vs sensor fault) using a decision tree classifier, making the entire diagnostic process transparent and explainable. Evaluated on the L-Town benchmark network, the approach achieves high performance with precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.98 for leakage detection, and precision of 0.98 and recall of 0.95 for sensor fault detection, demonstrating both technical effectiveness and interpretability.

## Method Summary
The framework operates by first generating counterfactual event fingerprints that represent minimal sensor measurement changes preventing event detection, providing transparent explanations for algorithmic decisions. These fingerprints are then used as features for a decision tree classifier that distinguishes between leakage and sensor fault events. The interpretability stems from the counterfactual explanations themselves, which allow operators to understand why events are detected and what minimal changes would alter detection outcomes. The decision tree provides an additional layer of interpretability by offering clear decision rules for event classification, enabling operators to combine algorithmic insights with their domain expertise for improved decision-making in water network management.

## Key Results
- Achieved precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.98 for leakage detection
- Achieved precision of 0.98 and recall of 0.95 for sensor fault detection
- Demonstrated interpretable event classification through decision tree rules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages counterfactual explanations to bridge the gap between automated detection algorithms and operator trust. By generating fingerprints that show minimal sensor changes preventing event detection, operators can understand the reasoning behind algorithmic decisions rather than treating them as black boxes. The decision tree classifier provides transparent classification rules that can be easily interpreted and validated by domain experts, enabling the combination of algorithmic efficiency with human expertise.

## Foundational Learning
- Counterfactual explanations: Why needed - provide transparent reasoning for detection decisions; Quick check - verify that generated fingerprints represent minimal changes that prevent detection
- Event fingerprinting: Why needed - create interpretable representations of detection events; Quick check - confirm fingerprints capture essential characteristics distinguishing event types
- Decision tree classification: Why needed - provide interpretable classification rules; Quick check - validate that tree depth and splits make domain sense

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Event Detection -> Counterfactual Explanation Generation -> Event Fingerprint Creation -> Decision Tree Classification -> Interpretable Output

Critical Path:
1. Detect event using automated algorithms
2. Generate counterfactual explanations showing minimal sensor changes preventing detection
3. Create event fingerprints from counterfactual explanations
4. Classify event type using decision tree
5. Present interpretable results to operators

Design Tradeoffs:
- Interpretability vs classification accuracy: decision trees sacrifice some potential accuracy for complete transparency
- Counterfactual generation computational cost vs explanation quality: more sophisticated methods may yield better explanations but at higher computational expense
- Feature selection for fingerprints: balancing completeness with interpretability

Failure Signatures:
- Poor counterfactual generation leading to uninformative fingerprints
- Overfitting in decision tree causing poor generalization
- Insufficient training data diversity causing biased classifications

First Experiments:
1. Generate counterfactual fingerprints for known leakage events and verify they capture relevant sensor changes
2. Train decision tree on labeled event fingerprints and test classification accuracy on held-out data
3. Validate interpretability by having domain experts review decision tree rules and counterfactual explanations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to L-Town benchmark network, may not reflect real-world complexity
- Performance metrics based on synthetic/simulated data rather than field measurements
- Decision tree classifier may miss complex non-linear relationships compared to black-box models

## Confidence
High: The interpretability claims are well-supported by the counterfactual explanation methodology and decision tree classifier.
Medium: Real-world applicability confidence is medium due to limited scope of validation on benchmark rather than operational networks.
High: Specific performance metrics for leakage and sensor fault detection are reported with high confidence based on presented experiments.

## Next Checks
1. Field testing on multiple operational water distribution networks with diverse topologies and operational conditions
2. Comparison of the decision tree-based classification approach against state-of-the-art black-box models on the same datasets to quantify the trade-off between interpretability and detection accuracy
3. User study with water network operators to assess whether the counterfactual explanations actually improve trust and decision-making in practice
