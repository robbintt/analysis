# CreAgentive: An Agent Workflow Driven Multi-Category Creative Generation Engine

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26461
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26461
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Multi-genre long-form creative generation engine using agent workflow and Story Prototype achieves human-approaching quality at low cost

## Executive Summary
CreAgentive is a multi-category creative generation engine that addresses key limitations in long-form narrative generation including restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. The system introduces a Story Prototype—a genre-agnostic, knowledge graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic triples. Using a three-stage agent workflow (Initialization, Story Generation, Writing), CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality at low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters), achieving high narrative quality scores across multiple genres that approach human-authored novels.

## Method Summary
CreAgentive employs a three-stage agent workflow built on a dual knowledge graph backend (Neo4j). The Story Prototype stores narrative state as semantic triples in Role Graph (characters and relationships) and Plot Graph (events and scenes). Initialization Agent extracts user input into Initial Config. Story Generation Loop uses Short-term Goal Agent to propose multiple candidate goals, PlotWeave with Role Agents operating under Limited Cognition principle, and Scorer Agent to select highest-scoring plot. Writing Stage employs Recall and Thread Agents for planning, then Writer Agent for genre-specific output. The system achieves quality through hierarchical goal decomposition, relay-style plot weaving, and scorer-guided selection.

## Key Results
- Achieves high narrative quality (average scores of 8.28 human / 8.17 automated) across multiple genres
- Approaches quality of human-authored novels while maintaining coherence across extended narratives
- Generates thousands of chapters at low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Story Prototype as Decoupling Layer
The Story Prototype encodes narrative state as semantic triples in dual knowledge graphs, decoupling story logic from stylistic realization. This abstraction enables cross-genre transfer by storing "story itself" rather than "how to write," allowing the same prototype to be rendered into different genres via Writer Agent configuration. The mechanism assumes narrative coherence depends on consistent logical relationships rather than surface-level text continuity.

### Mechanism 2: Limited Cognition with Relay-Style PlotWeave
Role Agents retrieve only character-relevant information from the Story Prototype, simulating realistic cognitive limitations and reducing hallucinations. During PlotWeave, agents build on each other's contributions sequentially rather than competing. This relay-style coordination ensures character consistency while preventing omniscient perspectives that cause logical inconsistencies.

### Mechanism 3: Hierarchical Goal Decomposition with Scorer-Guided Selection
Long-term narrative goals decompose into multiple scored short-term objectives per chapter. Short-term Goal Agent generates candidates, Role Agents develop plots, and Scorer Agent quantitatively evaluates against general and story-specific rules. This hierarchical optimization aggregates local chapter-level scoring to acceptable global narrative quality when anchored to consistent long-term goals.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Graphs (Semantic Triples)**: The Story Prototype stores all narrative state as entity-relationship-entity triples. Without understanding graph traversal and query patterns, you cannot debug why agents retrieve incorrect context. Quick check: Given a triple (Michael, IN_EVENT, Shipwreck) and (Shipwreck, OCCURRED_IN, Beach), what query retrieves all characters present at the Beach scene?

- **Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns**: CreAgentive uses relay-style PlotWeave, not debate or competition. Understanding when sequential vs. parallel coordination improves output is critical for extending the architecture. Quick check: Compare relay-style (agent B builds on A's output) vs. debate-style (agents argue to consensus). Which would better handle a plot requiring three characters to simultaneously discover a secret?

- **Hierarchical Task Decomposition**: Long-term goals decompose into short-term goals, which decompose into agent actions. This abstraction hierarchy is the core scaling mechanism. Quick check: If a 100-chapter novel has one long-term goal, how many short-term goals should be generated per chapter? What happens if this number is too low vs. too high?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: User input -> Initialization Agent -> Story Prototype (initial) -> [Story Generation Loop per chapter] -> Updated Prototype -> Writing Agents -> Final text
- **Critical path**: The Scorer Agent gate is the quality control bottleneck, selecting between candidate plots generated by Short-term Goal Agent and Role Agents
- **Design tradeoffs**: Limited Cognition prevents hallucination but may miss globally optimal plot paths; multiple short-term goals increase exploration but multiply computational cost; chapter-level snapshots enable flashbacks but increase storage
- **Failure signatures**: Character drift indicates Role Graph relationships not updated correctly; plot loops suggest Scorer Agent rules too weak; genre bleed means Writer Agent not receiving clean prototype
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation: Limited Cognition - run PlotWeave with full prototype access vs. character-restricted access, measure coherence and contradiction rate
  2. Scorer Sensitivity Analysis - vary scoring rule weights, identify which rules most affect Coherence and Complexity scores
  3. Cross-Genre Transfer Test - generate one Story Prototype, render as novel and screenplay, evaluate if both achieve quality thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. Can the linear Story Prototype architecture be restructured to support branching plot architectures required for interactive fiction? The current chapter-based version snapshot system is designed for linear progression, making management of divergent narrative states non-trivial.

2. What specific workflow modifications are required to enable real-time human intervention without disrupting automated agent consensus? The current three-stage workflow relies on automated loops and scorer agents; injecting human input mid-cycle could break Limited Cognition or Scorer Agent evaluation logic.

3. Can granular stylistic parameters be enforced during the Writing Stage without requiring full re-initialization? The framework decouples logic from style but primarily relies on initial user prompt and global genre settings, lacking mechanisms for dynamic, chapter-level tone shifting.

4. Does the HNES evaluation framework correlate with assessments of professional literary editors or publishers? While the system outperforms baselines, the gap between "enthusiast" scoring and professional editorial standards remains untested, leaving commercial viability uncertain.

## Limitations

- Exact Scorer Agent rule formulations and weight configurations are not disclosed, creating substantial ambiguity in reproducing the quality control mechanism
- The dual knowledge graph schema implementation in Neo4j is underspecified—precise property names and relationship types are missing
- Long-term coherence maintenance across thousands of chapters is claimed but only short sequences (50 chapters) are empirically validated

## Confidence

- **High Confidence (8-10/10)**: The core architectural approach (three-stage agent workflow with Story Prototype decoupling) is well-specified and logically sound; experimental methodology (AHP-weighted evaluation, human-LLM hybrid assessment) is clearly defined; cost efficiency claims are directly measurable
- **Medium Confidence (5-7/10)**: The effectiveness of Limited Cognition principle is supported by ablation but mechanism details are sparse; cross-genre transfer capability is demonstrated but genre-specific rule implementation is not detailed
- **Low Confidence (1-4/10)**: Exact Scorer Agent rule formulations and weight configurations; precise Neo4j schema and snapshot synchronization mechanisms; complete agent prompt templates and PlotWeave coordination protocol

## Next Checks

1. **Scorer Rule Sensitivity Analysis**: Implement the Scorer Agent with varying weight configurations for general vs. story-specific rules. Systematically measure how changes affect Coherence, Creativity, and Surprise scores across 20 generated stories to identify which rules drive quality.

2. **Limited Cognition Boundary Test**: Compare three configurations: (a) full prototype access, (b) character-restricted access as specified, and (c) hybrid with cross-character visibility for critical plot points. Measure contradiction rates, coherence scores, and narrative quality across 30 chapters to validate the mechanism's effectiveness.

3. **Cross-Genre Prototype Transfer**: Generate a single Story Prototype and render it as novel, screenplay, and stage play. Evaluate whether all outputs achieve minimum quality thresholds (QLS >7.0) and identify which genre transformations fail and why, testing the decoupling mechanism's limits.
