# Generative Models for Long Time Series: Approximately Equivariant Recurrent Network Structures for an Adjusted Training Scheme

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.05020
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05020
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a recurrent variational autoencoder with subsequent training (RVAE-ST) for generating long time series, showing superior performance on highly stationary data compared to state-of-the-art generative models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for generating long time series using a recurrent variational autoencoder with time-shift equivariant architecture and progressive training scheme. The RVAE-ST model maintains constant parameters regardless of sequence length while effectively capturing long-range dependencies in approximately stationary time series. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on highly stationary datasets (Electric Motor, ECG, Sine) while remaining competitive on less stationary data (ETT, MetroPT3).

## Method Summary
The approach combines a time-shift equivariant recurrent architecture with a progressive training scheme that increases sequence length incrementally. The model uses a variational autoencoder framework where the encoder and decoder are designed to be approximately equivariant to time shifts. Training proceeds in stages, starting with shorter sequences and gradually increasing to longer ones, allowing the model to learn temporal dependencies effectively without parameter explosion. The architecture leverages inductive bias from time-shift equivariance to improve performance on long sequences.

## Key Results
- RVAE-ST outperforms state-of-the-art generative models on highly stationary datasets (Electric Motor, ECG, Sine) as measured by FID, discriminative scores, and ELBO
- The model maintains constant parameters regardless of sequence length while scaling to long time series
- RVAE-ST achieves competitive performance on less stationary datasets (ETT, MetroPT3)
- The approach effectively captures long-range dependencies through its equivariant architecture and progressive training scheme

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages time-shift equivariance as an inductive bias, allowing the model to learn temporal patterns that are consistent across different time positions. The progressive training scheme enables the model to gradually build understanding of longer sequences without overwhelming capacity constraints. This combination allows effective learning of long-range dependencies while maintaining parameter efficiency, particularly effective for approximately stationary time series where temporal patterns repeat or follow consistent statistical properties.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time-shift equivariance**: Transformation property where shifting input in time leads to proportionally shifted output; needed to capture consistent temporal patterns across sequence positions; quick check: verify encoder/decoder transformations preserve temporal relationships
- **Variational autoencoders**: Generative models that learn latent representations with probabilistic encoding; needed for flexible time series generation; quick check: ensure ELBO optimization converges during training
- **Progressive training**: Gradual increase in sequence length during training; needed to prevent capacity issues with long sequences; quick check: monitor performance improvement as sequence length increases
- **Recurrent neural networks**: Sequential models for processing time series data; needed for temporal dependency modeling; quick check: verify gradient flow through time steps
- **Stationarity in time series**: Statistical properties that remain constant over time; needed to justify equivariance assumptions; quick check: test stationarity metrics on target datasets

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input -> Equivariant Encoder -> Latent Space -> Equivariant Decoder -> Output

**Critical path**: Input sequence → Recurrent equivariant encoder → Variational latent representation → Recurrent equivariant decoder → Generated sequence

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Equivariance provides strong inductive bias but limits flexibility for non-stationary data
- Progressive training improves long sequence learning but requires careful curriculum design
- Constant parameters ensure scalability but may constrain capacity for highly complex sequences

**Failure signatures**:
- Poor performance on non-stationary datasets indicates equivariance assumptions violated
- Training instability during progressive length increases suggests curriculum design issues
- Degraded generation quality at extreme sequence lengths points to capacity limitations

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test equivariance property by comparing outputs for time-shifted inputs
2. Evaluate performance at different sequence lengths to verify progressive training benefits
3. Compare against baseline models on synthetic stationary vs non-stationary datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance degrades on less stationary datasets, suggesting equivariance assumptions have limited applicability
- Lack of ablation studies makes it difficult to isolate contributions of equivariant architecture versus progressive training
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture quality of generated sequences for downstream applications

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation of equivariant architecture and progressive training scheme
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about parameter efficiency and scalability to long sequences
- **Medium confidence**: Comparative performance results on benchmark datasets

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies to disentangle effects of time-shift equivariance versus progressive training on model performance
2. Test model on synthetic datasets with controlled degrees of non-stationarity to map boundaries of equivariance assumption
3. Evaluate generated sequences on task-specific downstream applications (e.g., forecasting accuracy) beyond provided metrics
