- Primary result: Geometric framework shows logic acts as differential controller of reasoning flows in LLM representation space

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing how large language models reason through their representation space. The authors model reasoning as smooth flows in embedding space, where logical structure governs the local velocity of these trajectories. To test whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface semantics, they construct a controlled dataset that disentangles logical structure from topical and linguistic carriers. Experiments with Qwen3 hidden states show that reasoning flows sharing the same logical skeleton exhibit high similarity in velocity and curvature across different topics and languages, while flows with different logics diverge even with identical carriers. These results provide quantitative evidence that logic acts as a differential controller of semantic flow in LLMs, suggesting they have internalized structural invariants of reasoning beyond surface form. The framework offers new geometric tools for interpretability and opens avenues for steering and analyzing reasoning dynamics.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a geometric framework that models LLM reasoning as smooth flows in representation space, parameterized by time and governed by differential equations. They construct a controlled dataset using formal logic and a relaxed prefix mask to disentangle logical structure from topical and linguistic carriers. For each example, they extract token embeddings from Qwen3 at the final transformer layer, then compute velocity and curvature along the reasoning trajectory. They compare geometric similarity metrics (dot product of velocity vectors, Frobenius norm of curvature matrices) across flows with identical logical structure but different carriers versus flows with different logical structures but identical carriers. This controlled comparison isolates the geometric signature of reasoning logic itself.

## Key Results
- Reasoning flows with the same logical skeleton exhibit high similarity in velocity and curvature across different topics and languages
- Flows with different logical structures diverge geometrically even when they share identical topical and linguistic carriers
- The geometric similarity patterns persist across multiple reasoning domains including deduction, induction, and analogy
- Logic acts as a differential controller of semantic flow, suggesting LLMs have internalized structural invariants of reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works because LLMs transform discrete reasoning steps into continuous trajectories in representation space. By parameterizing these trajectories as smooth curves, the authors can analyze how logical structure manifests as differential properties (velocity, curvature) that are invariant to the specific content being reasoned about. The controlled dataset design ensures that any geometric similarity between flows must stem from shared logical structure rather than semantic similarity. The framework captures reasoning dynamics at a level of abstraction that reveals structural patterns invisible to traditional semantic analysis.

## Foundational Learning
**Differential geometry of curves**: Understanding how smooth curves in high-dimensional space can be characterized by their derivatives and curvature tensors. Why needed: The framework models reasoning as smooth trajectories whose differential properties encode logical structure. Quick check: Can you explain how curvature measures the rate of change of the tangent vector?

**Representation space topology**: The geometric structure of embedding spaces where tokens are mapped during inference. Why needed: The framework operates within these spaces to track how reasoning evolves. Quick check: What distinguishes Euclidean from hyperbolic representation spaces in terms of distance metrics?

**Logic structure disentanglement**: Techniques for separating formal logical relationships from their semantic instantiations. Why needed: The controlled dataset design requires isolating logic from content to test whether geometry captures pure reasoning structure. Quick check: How does a relaxed prefix mask ensure logical equivalence across different instantiations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Controlled dataset generation -> Token embedding extraction (Qwen3 final layer) -> Trajectory construction (C¹ curves) -> Velocity/curvature computation -> Geometric similarity analysis

**Critical path**: The pipeline flows from controlled data generation through embedding extraction to geometric analysis. Each stage must succeed for meaningful results: poor data control invalidates the disentanglement hypothesis, poor embeddings yield uninformative trajectories, and incorrect differential calculations obscure logical patterns.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes interpretability over computational efficiency by using geometric analysis rather than black-box probing. The controlled dataset approach trades naturalistic complexity for analytical clarity. The smooth trajectory assumption (C¹ curves) simplifies analysis but may not capture all reasoning dynamics.

**Failure signatures**: If logical flows don't exhibit geometric similarity across different carriers, this suggests either the disentanglement failed or the geometric framework doesn't capture reasoning structure. If flows show high similarity for different logics, this indicates the metrics are too coarse or the embeddings are dominated by superficial patterns. If trajectories are non-smooth, the C¹ curve assumption breaks down.

**First experiments**: 1) Test geometric similarity on naturalistic reasoning tasks where disentanglement isn't possible. 2) Apply perturbations to reasoning flows and measure effects on output quality. 3) Analyze layer-wise evolution of geometric signatures across transformer depths.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can reasoning flows be actively steered or intervened upon to reliably control model outputs during inference?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Trajectory-level control offers principled tools for steering, alignment, and safety, extending vector-based interventions to flow dynamics."
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a theoretical framework and geometric characterization but does not demonstrate actual steering experiments or interventions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying velocity or curvature perturbations to reasoning trajectories and measuring resulting changes in output quality, logical consistency, or safety properties.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do reasoning flows differ across transformer layers, and at which layer depths does logical structure emerge most strongly?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper extracts representations only from the final transformer layer, leaving the evolution of logical structure across earlier layers unexplored.
- Why unresolved: Methodological limitation—experiments isolate the last layer before the LM head without ablation across depths.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis of velocity and curvature similarity across all layers, identifying where logical invariants first become detectable and how they propagate.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the smooth trajectory hypothesis (C¹ curves) hold empirically for diverse reasoning tasks beyond formal logic?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Hypothesis 4.6 and Appendix C.1 provide a theoretical construction via relaxed prefix masks, but empirical validation is limited to the controlled dataset.
- Why unresolved: The construction proves existence, not necessity; real reasoning dynamics may exhibit discontinuities or branching not captured by single smooth curves.
- What evidence would resolve it: High-resolution sampling of embeddings during reasoning on unconstrained tasks (e.g., open-ended math, commonsense) to test for smooth interpolation and detect violations of C¹ continuity.

## Limitations
- The geometric framework relies on controlled synthetic datasets to isolate logical structure from semantic carriers, limiting generalizability to naturalistic reasoning
- The study focuses on Qwen3 hidden states at specific layers, leaving layer-wise variations and cross-architecture differences unexplored
- The velocity and curvature metrics, while mathematically sound, require further validation to confirm they capture meaningful aspects of reasoning rather than superficial embedding dynamics

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The experimental design effectively disentangles logical structure from semantic carriers, and the observed geometric similarities for shared logical skeletons represent a robust empirical finding within the controlled setting.
- **Medium Confidence**: The interpretation that logic acts as a "differential controller" of semantic flow in LLMs is supported by the data but requires additional validation on naturalistic reasoning tasks to confirm generalizability.
- **Medium Confidence**: The framework's potential for interpretability and reasoning steering is promising but remains largely theoretical at this stage, pending demonstrations on practical applications.

## Next Checks
1. Test the geometric framework on naturalistic reasoning datasets (e.g., mathematical problem-solving, commonsense reasoning) to assess whether logical flows remain identifiable when disentanglement from semantics is not possible.
2. Conduct layer-wise analysis across multiple model architectures to determine whether geometric signatures of reasoning are consistent across different depths and model families.
3. Implement intervention studies where the identified geometric signatures are manipulated to assess causal relationships between flow geometry and reasoning quality or direction.
