# Integrating Feedback Loss from Bi-modal Sarcasm Detector for Sarcastic Speech Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.13028
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13028
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Sarcasm-aware TTS system achieves 71.2% F1 on sarcasm detection of generated speech, with 53% listener preference over baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to sarcastic speech synthesis by integrating feedback loss from a bi-modal sarcasm detection model into the TTS training process. The method employs a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: first adapting a pre-trained TTS model to conversational speech, then refining it with sarcastic speech data. The bi-modal sarcasm detector combines text and audio features to generate sarcasm embeddings, which are incorporated into the TTS model to guide prosody and tone. Objective evaluations show the proposed system achieves a sarcasm detection F1-score of 71.2%, outperforming the baseline at 68.7%. Subjective evaluations reveal listeners rated the generated sarcastic speech as more natural and convincing, with 53% preferring the proposed model over the baseline.

## Method Summary
The proposed system extends FastSpeech 2 as its backbone, with a two-stage fine-tuning approach that first adapts from read speech to conversational speech, then to sarcastic speech. A bi-modal sarcasm detector processes both text (via BERT) and audio (mel-spectrograms) to generate sarcasm embeddings, which are concatenated with the phoneme encoder output before the variance adaptor. The detector is frozen during TTS training and provides a cosine distance loss between ground truth and predicted embeddings. The system is trained on LibriTTS (pre-training), conversational speech from sitcoms (fine-tuning stage 1), and MUStARD++ sarcastic examples (fine-tuning stage 2), with HiFi-GAN as the vocoder.

## Key Results
- Sarcasm detection F1-score of 71.2% for generated speech vs. 68.7% baseline
- Listener preference of 53% for proposed model over baseline in subjective evaluation
- Speech+text condition shows larger gains for generated speech (70.1% vs. 63.4% speech-only)
- Two-stage fine-tuning improves adaptation from read to conversational to sarcastic speech

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Bi-modal Feedback Loss for Prosodic Guidance
- Claim: Integrating a pre-trained sarcasm detector's embeddings as a feedback signal during TTS training may improve the model's ability to generate sarcasm-appropriate prosody.
- Mechanism: During training, the bi-modal detector (processing both text and target audio) produces a sarcasm embedding. This embedding is concatenated with the phoneme encoder output before the variance adaptor. The loss function includes cosine distance between the ground-truth sarcasm embedding and the embedding extracted from the predicted mel-spectrogram, creating a gradient signal that encourages sarcastic acoustic patterns.
- Core assumption: The detector has learned meaningful representations of sarcastic prosody that can be transferred as supervision signals to the synthesizer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.2]: "we use the cosine distance between the ground truth audio+text embedding and the one extracted from the predicted Mel-spectrogram+text embedding by the bi-modal sarcasm detector as one of the loss functions"
  - [Section 4.2]: Proposed model achieves 70.1% F1 on sarcasm detection of generated speech vs. 68.8% baseline in speech+text condition
  - [Corpus]: Weak direct evidence; related work (Gao et al. 2024) addresses detection, not synthesis feedback loops
- Break condition: If the detector's embeddings are noisy or fail to capture prosodic sarcasm cues distinct from semantic cues, the feedback signal may degrade rather than improve synthesis quality.

### Mechanism 2: Progressive Domain Adaptation via Two-Stage Fine-Tuning
- Claim: A staged fine-tuning approach (read speech → conversational → sarcastic) may reduce the distribution gap between pre-training and target domain.
- Mechanism: The model first adapts from LibriTTS (read speech) to conversational speech extracted from sitcoms (6.17 hours), learning variable prosody and timing. It then fine-tunes on MUStARD++ sarcastic examples. This progressive narrowing prevents catastrophic forgetting while acquiring conversational and sarcastic speech characteristics.
- Core assumption: Conversational speech contains prosodic patterns that are prerequisites for sarcastic prosody (e.g., variable intonation, pauses).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.3]: "This two-stage fine-tuning process allows the model to progressively improve its ability to generate speech that spans from neutral to highly expressive"
  - [Section 3.1]: Describes the three-stage training pipeline with specific datasets
  - [Corpus]: Huybrechts et al. (2021, cited in paper) demonstrates data augmentation for low-resource expressive TTS
- Break condition: If the intermediate conversational dataset is too small or domain-mismatched, the model may overfit or fail to acquire useful intermediate representations.

### Mechanism 3: Text-Semantic Conditioning via Bi-modal Embeddings
- Claim: Conditioning the synthesizer on text-derived sarcasm embeddings may help align prosody with semantic sarcasm cues.
- Mechanism: The bi-modal detector uses BERT to encode text semantics alongside acoustic features. During inference, the detector generates embeddings from input text and reference speech, providing the TTS model with prior knowledge of whether the utterance should sound sarcastic.
- Core assumption: Sarcasm is partially conveyed through semantic incongruity (literal vs. intended meaning) that text alone can partially signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.1]: Bi-modal (speech+text) detection F1 improves from 63.6% to 71.2% vs. speech-only
  - [Section 4.2]: Speech+text condition shows larger gains for generated speech (70.1% vs. 63.4% speech-only)
  - [Corpus]: Related work (Ray et al., MUStARD++) confirms multimodal cues improve detection
- Break condition: If input text is neutral but the system forces sarcastic prosody, outputs may sound unnatural or mismatched.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **FastSpeech 2 Architecture**
  - Why needed here: The proposed system extends FastSpeech 2 as its backbone; understanding the encoder-variance adaptor-decoder flow is essential for knowing where sarcasm embeddings are injected.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain where duration, pitch, and energy predictors sit in the FastSpeech 2 pipeline and why the variance adaptor is the injection point for style embeddings?

- Concept: **Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning in TTS**
  - Why needed here: The method relies on staged fine-tuning; understanding how pre-trained weights are adapted without catastrophic forgetting is critical.
  - Quick check question: What happens if you fine-tune directly on a small sarcastic dataset without intermediate conversational adaptation?

- Concept: **Multi-modal Fusion (Text + Audio)**
  - Why needed here: The bi-modal detector concatenates BERT text embeddings with acoustic features; understanding modal fusion strategies helps diagnose detection failures.
  - Quick check question: Why might early fusion (concatenation) vs. late fusion (score averaging) matter for sarcasm detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - TTS Backbone (FastSpeech 2): Phoneme Encoder → Variance Adaptor → Mel-Decoder
  - Bi-modal Sarcasm Detector (frozen during TTS training): Mel-spectrogram input → Spectral/Temporal processing → Multi-head Attention; Text input → BERT Encoder → Concatenation → FC + Softmax
  - Embedding Injection: Sarcasm embedding concatenated with phoneme encoder output before variance adaptor
  - Vocoder: HiFi-GAN converts mel-spectrograms to waveforms

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train FastSpeech 2 on LibriTTS (800k iterations)
  2. Train bi-modal sarcasm detector on MUStARD++ (50 epochs, frozen afterward)
  3. Fine-tune Stage I: Conversational speech from sitcoms (100k iterations)
  4. Fine-tune Stage II: Sarcastic speech from MUStARD++ with detector feedback loss (100k iterations)
  5. Inference: Detector generates embedding from text + reference audio → guides synthesis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Frozen vs. trainable detector**: Freezing prevents feedback loop instability but may limit adaptation
  - **Cosine distance vs. classification loss**: Cosine distance preserves embedding structure; classification loss may be noisier
  - **Dataset size**: MUStARD++ has only 601 sarcastic samples; overfitting risk is high

- Failure signatures:
  - **Low MOS with high detection F1**: Model generates detectable sarcasm but sounds unnatural (prosody over-exaggeration)
  - **High variance in subjective ratings**: Sarcasm perception is listener-dependent; evaluate across diverse listeners
  - **No improvement from feedback loss**: Detector embeddings may not capture transferable prosodic features

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation: Remove feedback loss, keep two-stage fine-tuning** to isolate detector contribution
  2. **Ablation: Skip Stage I (conversational fine-tuning)** to test progressive adaptation necessity
  3. **Control: Generate neutral texts with forced sarcastic embeddings** to assess prosody-text mismatch effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the individual performance contributions of the bi-modal sarcasm detector feedback loss versus the two-stage fine-tuning strategy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Conclusion that they "do not isolate the individual contributions of the sarcasm detector and two-stage fine-tuning."
- Why unresolved: The experimental design trained the proposed model using both methods simultaneously without running ablation studies to decouple their effects.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis (objective and subjective) of models trained with only the feedback loss and only the fine-tuning strategy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed model perform when synthesizing neutral, non-sarcastic speech compared to sarcastic speech?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes the "absence of a control condition with neutral, non-sarcastic texts" as a limitation, as all evaluation samples were drawn from a sarcasm dataset.
- Why unresolved: Without neutral controls, it is unclear if listeners were responding to synthesized prosody or simply the inherent sarcastic content of the text.
- What evidence would resolve it: Subjective listening tests using both sarcastic and neutral input texts to verify the model does not apply sarcastic prosody indiscriminately.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the model effectively capture and generate fine-grained variations, such as different types or degrees of sarcasm?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Future Research section suggests that "incorporating fine-grained modeling of sarcasm, such as different types or degrees... could lead to more nuanced synthesis."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation appears to treat sarcasm as a general style or binary class rather than modeling specific sub-types (e.g., hyperbolic vs. deadpan).
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments utilizing datasets with granular sarcasm labels to train and evaluate the model's ability to render specific sarcastic nuances.

## Limitations

- The small size of MUStARD++ (601 sarcastic samples) raises concerns about overfitting and generalizability to other sarcasm datasets or styles.
- The reliance on reference speech during inference for embedding generation creates a practical limitation for real-world deployment.
- The paper does not address speaker identity preservation when transferring sarcasm patterns across different voices, which could lead to voice morphing artifacts.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The two-stage fine-tuning methodology and its effectiveness in progressively adapting the model from read speech to conversational to sarcastic speech is well-supported by the experimental results and ablation studies.
- **Medium Confidence**: The bi-modal sarcasm detector's ability to improve synthesis quality is supported by objective metrics, but the specific architectural contributions and whether the same results could be achieved with simpler approaches remain unclear.
- **Medium Confidence**: The subjective evaluation results showing listener preference are compelling, but the small sample size (12 participants) and potential bias in participant selection limit generalizability.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study with Text-Only Input**: Test the system with neutral text forced to generate sarcastic speech using the sarcasm embedding, then evaluate naturalness scores and speaker consistency to quantify prosody-text mismatch effects.

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization Test**: Evaluate the trained sarcasm detector and TTS model on a held-out sarcasm dataset (e.g., from a different source than MUStARD++) to assess whether the learned representations generalize beyond the training domain.

3. **Reference-Free Inference Implementation**: Develop and test an alternative inference strategy that doesn't require reference speech for embedding generation, such as using a separate text-only sarcasm classifier or learning a direct mapping from text semantics to sarcasm embeddings during training.
