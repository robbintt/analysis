# The Sound of Risk: A Multimodal Physics-Informed Acoustic Model for Forecasting Market Volatility and Enhancing Market Interpretability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.18653
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18653
- Reference count: 3
- Out-of-sample 30-day realized volatility explained: 43.8% (R²)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multimodal physics-informed acoustic model (PIAM) for forecasting market volatility and enhancing interpretability of financial risk from earnings calls. PIAM robustly extracts paralinguistic emotional cues from executive speech, integrating acoustic and textual sentiment into a three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space (Tension, Stability, Arousal). Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls, the model explains up to 43.8% of out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility, outperforming financials-only baselines. Acoustic and textual modalities capture distinct information, with key volatility signals arising from emotional shifts during executive transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech. While multimodal features do not predict directional returns, they effectively signal underlying corporate uncertainty, providing investors and regulators a novel tool for risk assessment and market transparency.

## Method Summary
The method combines a physics-informed acoustic model (PIAM) with multimodal feature engineering to forecast 30-day realized volatility from earnings call audio. PIAM uses a wav2vec 2.0-style encoder with physics-informed regularization via the Westervelt equation, outputting both text transcription and emotion classification. A pre-trained LLM (DeepSeek-R1) classifies textual emotions, and both modalities are mapped to a 3D ASL space (Tension, Stability, Arousal). Features include statistical moments of ASL values, delta features between scripted and spontaneous speech, and interactions. These are combined with 30-day historical volatility and fed into an XGBoost regressor with bootstrap aggregation for final volatility prediction.

## Key Results
- 30-day realized volatility: R² = 0.438 (outperforms financials-only baseline at 0.251)
- CAR prediction: R² ≈ 0 (no directional return signal)
- Acoustic and textual modalities capture distinct information (low concordance)
- Volatility signals driven by emotional dynamics during executive transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Physics-informed regularization improves robustness to telephony distortions (e.g., clipping).
- **Mechanism:** The model constrains its latent space using the Westervelt equation (nonlinear acoustics). By penalizing trajectories that violate physics laws governing high-amplitude sound waves, the model theoretically filters out or correctly interprets systematic nonlinear artifacts like compression and clipping as distinct from random noise.
- **Core assumption:** The signal distortions found in earnings calls (clipping, codec artifacts) behave according to the nonlinear dynamics defined in the Westervelt equation, and these are separable from the vocal tract dynamics indicating stress.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...applies nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures... subject to distortions such as signal clipping."
  - [Page 3, Section 3.2]: "Key artifacts include... Microphone Clipping... Compression Artifacts... [which] are precisely what the principles of nonlinear acoustics... are designed to model."
  - [corpus]: Related papers (e.g., "Fusing Narrative Semantics") discuss multimodal volatility forecasting but lack specific validation for physics-informed acoustic regularization; evidence is currently internal to this study.
- **Break condition:** If future audio data uses high-fidelity, lossless channels (removing nonlinear artifacts), the relative advantage of this specific physics regularizer over standard noise suppression may diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The *transition* from scripted to spontaneous speech is the primary signal for volatility, not the absolute emotional state.
- **Mechanism:** Executives can control semantic content and delivery in prepared remarks ("narrative engineering"). In the Q&A, cognitive load increases and preparation decreases, causing "involuntary, chaotic perturbations" in vocal dynamics. The *delta* between these states measures the executive's ability to maintain composure under pressure.
- **Core assumption:** Stress or uncertainty manifests as acoustic instability (e.g., reduced stability, higher tension) specifically during the Q&A section, and this correlates with future corporate uncertainty rather than just general public speaking anxiety.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...volatility predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech..."
  - [Page 7, Section 5.5]: Features like "CFO delta text stability mean" and "CEO Q&A arousal variability" rank highest in Gini importance.
  - [corpus]: Related work (e.g., Arxiv 2510.20699) supports narrative-based volatility forecasting but does not explicitly model the scripted/spontaneous transition dynamic.
- **Break condition:** If executives extensively rehearse "spontaneous" Q&A answers, the cognitive load differential disappears, likely flattening the signal.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Acoustic and textual modalities provide orthogonal information that improves risk prediction when combined.
- **Mechanism:** Text analysis captures semantic sentiment (often polished/positive), while acoustic analysis captures physiological stress (paralinguistics). Low concordance between the two—e.g., positive words delivered with high tension—provides a stronger risk signal than either alone.
- **Core assumption:** The mapping of discrete emotions (from audio and text) to the 3D ASL space (Tension, Stability, Arousal) preserves the distinct variance of each modality without introducing alignment errors.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Acoustic and textual modalities capture distinct information..."
  - [Page 6, Section 5.2]: "The low concordance between modalities... confirms they are capturing distinct, largely orthogonal information streams."
  - [corpus]: General multimodal fusion in finance is supported (Arxiv 2510.20699), but specific orthogonality claims regarding "Tension/Stability" dimensions in this paper are novel.
- **Break condition:** If the LLM used for text sentiment fails to detect sarcasm or nuance, the "textual" dimension of the ASL space becomes noisy, potentially degrading the multimodal fusion.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand how a Partial Differential Equation (Westervelt) is enforced inside a deep learning loss function to constrain the solution space.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the physics loss ($L_{phys}$) update the model weights based on classification error or the residual of the PDE?

- **Concept: Self-Supervised Speech Learning (wav2vec 2.0)**
  - **Why needed here:** The PIAM encoder relies on pre-training on vast unlabeled audio to learn general representations before fine-tuning on specific earnings calls.
  - **Quick check question:** How does masking portions of the audio during pre-training force the model to learn robust contextual representations?

- **Concept: Affective State Mapping (Dimensional vs. Categorical)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper converts discrete labels (e.g., "fear") into continuous vectors (Tension, Stability, Arousal) to calculate statistical moments for regression.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a continuous "Stability" dimension be more useful for a regression model than a simple "Fear" probability score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Raw Audio Waveform -> wav2vec 2.0 encoder -> Bi-LSTM + Attention -> Multi-task head (CTC + Emotion)
  - Physics Constraint: Shallow MLP mapping latent states $h_t$ to pressure $p(t)$ to compute Westervelt residual ($L_{phys}$)
  - Text Emotion: DeepSeek-R1 LLM with zero-shot prompting
  - ASL Projection: Discrete emotions -> (Tension, Stability, Arousal) coordinates
  - Feature Engineering: ASL moments, deltas, interactions
  - Downstream: XGBoost Regressor with bootstrap aggregation

- **Critical path:**
  1. Audio preprocessing (segmentation by speaker/section)
  2. PIAM inference (generating text + emotion labels)
  3. **ASL Projection:** Mapping labels $\rightarrow$ 3D vectors
  4. **Feature Engineering:** Calculating "Delta" features (Presentation $\rightarrow$ Q&A)
  5. Volatility Regression (XGBoost)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Hard-coded ASL Mapping vs. Learned Embedding:** The paper uses a fixed mapping (Table 1) based on human annotation. This aids interpretability but may fail if cultural contexts differ.
  - **Two-Stage Pipeline:** Using PIAM to generate features for XGBoost (rather than end-to-end deep learning) allows for transparent feature importance analysis but prevents gradient flow from the volatility prediction back to the acoustic encoder.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Low Concordance:** If text and acoustic emotions match perfectly ($\approx 100\%$), the "orthogonality" benefit is lost; check for over-regularization.
  - **High Physics Loss:** If $L_{phys}$ fails to converge, the model may treat telephony artifacts as valid vocal features.
  - **Skewed ASL:** If textual sentiment clusters entirely around "Happiness" (low variance), delta features will be near zero.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Ablation):** Run the Volatility prediction using *only* Historical Volatility vs. *only* Acoustic Delta features to confirm the independent signal exists.
  2. **Robustness Test:** Feed the model audio with synthetic clipping/noise and verify if the physics-informed version maintains stable emotion classification vs. a baseline wav2vec model.
  3. **ASL Sensitivity:** Perturb the coordinates in Table 1 (e.g., swap "Stability" values for "Happiness" and "Fear") and observe the impact on 30-day volatility $R^2$ to validate the specific domain-adapted mapping.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can quasi-natural experiments establish a causal link between executive vocal stress dynamics and market volatility, distinguishing it from mere correlation?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state in Section 6.2 that a fundamental limitation is the correlational nature of the study and propose that "future work could leverage quasi-natural experiments to better isolate a potential causal link."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study cannot determine if vocal stress causes market uncertainty or if external factors (e.g., fatigue, personal health) drive both vocal changes and market volatility.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study design utilizing exogenous shocks (e.g., unexpected regulatory changes or macroeconomic events) to isolate vocal response variables from confounding corporate fundamentals.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does regressing vocal features directly onto a continuous emotional space yield superior predictive power for financial risk compared to the current discrete-to-ASL mapping?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] In Section 6.2, the authors note that mapping discrete emotions to fixed coordinates is a "simplification" and suggest a "more sophisticated approach... would involve regressing vocal features directly onto a continuous emotional space."
- **Why unresolved:** The current methodology forces complex psychological states into discrete bins (e.g., "fear," "neutral"), potentially losing nuanced information about emotional intensity that could better signal corporate uncertainty.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis where a continuous regression model is trained on the same dataset to predict volatility, with performance metrics (R²) compared against the current discrete ASL model.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent does the PIAM model exhibit performance biases across different genders, ages, accents, and cultural backgrounds?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6.1 identifies a "significant risk of demographic bias" because the training corpus consists primarily of North American firms with predominantly male executives.
- **Why unresolved:** The model has not undergone "explicit fairness audits," meaning its ability to extract emotional cues robustly may fail or produce systematic errors for underrepresented demographics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A stratified validation study reporting the model's acoustic emotion classification accuracy and volatility prediction error across diverse speaker demographics.

## Limitations
- Physics-informed regularization mechanism is underspecified regarding how PDE residuals are computed from latent representations
- Fixed ASL mapping may not generalize across cultures or contexts without empirical validation
- Performance claims rely on proprietary dataset without external validation on independent datasets

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core claim that acoustic and textual modalities provide distinct information streams is supported by low concordance measurements and aligns with general multimodal fusion principles in affective computing.
- **Medium Confidence**: The finding that volatility signals primarily arise from transitions between scripted and spontaneous speech is plausible given cognitive load theory, but the specific executive-level mechanisms and generalizability require further validation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The 43.8% R² for 30-day volatility forecasting is impressive relative to historical baselines, but the proprietary nature of the dataset and model architecture makes independent verification difficult.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the complete pipeline on earnings calls from a different market (e.g., NYSE or international exchanges) to assess generalizability of both the ASL mapping and volatility prediction performance.

2. **Ablation of physics regularization**: Train identical models with and without the Westervelt PDE constraint on audio with controlled clipping/noise artifacts to quantify the actual benefit of physics-informed regularization under realistic telephony conditions.

3. **Temporal stability analysis**: Track the model's performance across different market regimes (pre/post-COVID, bull/bear markets) to determine if the acoustic-textual volatility signal remains stable or degrades during periods of market stress.
