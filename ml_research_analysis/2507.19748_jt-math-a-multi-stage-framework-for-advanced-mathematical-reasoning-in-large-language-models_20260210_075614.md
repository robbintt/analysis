# JT-Math: A Multi-Stage Framework for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.19748
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19748
- **Reference count:** 11
- **Primary result:** JT-Math-8B-Instruct achieves SOTA performance among similar-sized models (63.74 avg score) on math benchmarks, outperforming O1-mini and GPT-4o.

## Executive Summary
JT-Math introduces a comprehensive multi-stage framework for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large language models. The approach combines continued pre-training on a massive 210B-token mathematical corpus with specialized post-training that includes supervised fine-tuning and curriculum-based reinforcement learning. The resulting models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, with the Instruct variant excelling at concise problem-solving and the Thinking variant demonstrating superior capabilities for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks requiring long context understanding.

## Method Summary
The JT-Math framework employs a three-stage training pipeline. First, continued pre-training uses a 210B-token mathematical corpus mixed with 50B code/general tokens, progressively extending context length from 8K to 32K tokens with RoPE base 500K. Second, supervised fine-tuning creates two specialized variants: an Instruct model trained at 8K context for concise answers, and a Thinking model at 32K context for complex problem-solving. Third, GRPO-based reinforcement learning fine-tunes both variants, with the Thinking model following a curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length from 8K to 32K tokens.

## Key Results
- JT-Math-8B-Instruct achieves 63.74 average score across benchmarks, surpassing OpenAI's O1-mini and GPT-4o
- JT-Math-8B-Thinking achieves 77.68 average score, excelling at competition-level mathematics
- State-of-the-art performance on MATH-500, AIME, CNMO, and other challenging mathematical benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its multi-stage approach that progressively builds mathematical reasoning capabilities. The massive mathematical corpus provides foundational knowledge, while the curriculum-based reinforcement learning ensures models can handle increasingly complex problems. The dual-path post-training creates specialized variants optimized for different use cases - concise problem-solving versus deep reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Continued Pre-training on Math Corpus:** Essential for building mathematical knowledge foundation; quick check: verify corpus size and quality metrics
- **Curriculum-Based RL:** Enables progressive skill development; quick check: monitor accuracy improvement across curriculum stages
- **Context Length Extension:** Critical for complex mathematical reasoning; quick check: validate 32K context handling
- **Dual Path Post-training:** Creates specialized model variants; quick check: compare performance between Instruct and Thinking models
- **GRPO Reinforcement Learning:** Optimizes reasoning capabilities; quick check: monitor KL divergence and entropy during training
- **Data Quality Filtering:** Ensures high-quality training data; quick check: verify top 10% retention from Qwen2.5-Math-RM-72B

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Base Model -> Continued Pre-training (3 stages) -> SFT (Dual path) -> RL (GRPO with curriculum)
**Critical Path:** The RL stage with curriculum learning is critical for the Thinking model's performance, requiring careful progression through context lengths
**Design Tradeoffs:** High LR (8e-5) crucial for Thinking SFT accuracy vs. stability, Long CoT (32K) for complex reasoning vs. computational cost
**Failure Signatures:** RL entropy collapse indicates reasoning stalling, accuracy plateaus suggest learning stagnation
**First Experiments:**
1. Verify Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base baseline performance matches internal JT-Coder-8B-Base expectations
2. Test data quality filtering pipeline with finemath-classifier
3. Validate 32K context extension with RoPE base 500K implementation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on proprietary internal models (JT-Coder-8B-Base, JT-1.5B) whose specifications remain undisclosed
- Data curation pipeline involves black-box components including unspecified LLM-based quality assessment
- Performance claims depend on assumed similarity between Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base and JT-Coder-8B-Base

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in multi-stage training methodology and general approach to mathematical reasoning enhancement
- **Medium confidence** in data quality assessment procedures and GRPO implementation details
- **Low confidence** in exact architectural specifications and complete reproducibility of SOTA performance

## Next Checks
1. **Architectural Fidelity Test:** Compare Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base baseline performance against reported JT-Coder-8B-Base metrics
2. **Data Quality Validation:** Implement finemath-classifier pipeline and verify 70/30 math-to-code ratio in pre-training corpus
3. **RL Policy Stability:** Monitor policy entropy and accuracy trajectories during GRPO training to detect early signs of entropy collapse or learning stagnation
