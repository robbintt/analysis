# A Scalable Pipeline for Estimating Verb Frame Frequencies Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.22187
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22187
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LLM-based pipeline generates 61,427 sentences across 476 verbs, achieving up to 2× stronger correlations with human-annotated data compared to traditional parsers

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies (VFFs) using large language models for both sentence generation and syntactic parsing. The method addresses the critical need for scalable, customizable VFF estimation that fills coverage gaps for understudied syntactic alternations. By leveraging GPT-4o to generate diverse sentences and parse them into fine-grained syntactic frames, the approach achieves significantly better predictions of human-annotated gold-standard data compared to traditional parsers like Berkeley Neural Parser and Stanford CoreNLP.

## Method Summary
The pipeline operates in two main stages: first, it uses GPT-4o to generate sentences containing target verbs across various syntactic frames; second, it parses these generated sentences to extract and count frame frequencies. The method processes 476 verbs, generating 61,427 sentences in total, and employs a comprehensive set of 61 syntactic frames for analysis. The approach is designed to be customizable and scalable, allowing researchers to estimate VFFs for any verb of interest while avoiding the coverage limitations of traditional parsers.

## Key Results
- VFF estimates from the LLM pipeline achieve correlations up to 0.66 with human-annotated data, representing up to 2× improvement over traditional parsers
- The method successfully estimates VFFs for 476 verbs, demonstrating scalability across a diverse verb set
- Generated sentences capture a wide range of syntactic frames, addressing coverage gaps in understudied alternations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline leverages the generative and analytical capabilities of large language models to overcome the limitations of traditional parsers. LLMs can generate diverse, contextually appropriate sentences that reflect real-world usage patterns, while also providing consistent, fine-grained syntactic parsing. This dual capability enables the creation of a comprehensive, customizable dataset for VFF estimation that better aligns with human judgments than rule-based or statistically trained parsers.

## Foundational Learning
- Verb Frame Frequencies (VFFs): The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb appears in natural language - needed to understand verb behavior and acquisition patterns; quick check: verify frame definitions match linguistic theory
- Syntactic alternations: Different ways verbs can appear in sentences while maintaining core meaning - needed to capture full verb usage; quick check: test with alternating verb examples
- FrameNet-style annotations: Fine-grained syntactic frame labeling system - needed for detailed linguistic analysis; quick check: validate frame assignments against linguistic standards

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Prompt Engineering -> Sentence Generation -> Syntactic Parsing -> Frequency Counting -> VFF Estimation
- Critical path: The pipeline's performance depends critically on the quality of LLM-generated sentences and the accuracy of the parsing step
- Design tradeoffs: The method trades computational cost and potential LLM biases for scalability and coverage compared to traditional parsers
- Failure signatures: Poor sentence diversity, parsing errors, or systematic biases in LLM outputs will degrade VFF estimation quality
- First experiments:
  1. Test sentence generation quality with a small verb subset and human evaluation
  2. Validate parsing accuracy on a held-out set of manually annotated sentences
  3. Compare VFF estimates for a few verbs against existing gold-standard datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, focusing instead on presenting a working solution to the VFF estimation problem.

## Limitations
- Reliance on a single LLM (GPT-4o) may introduce systematic biases and limit generalizability
- Moderate correlation improvements (up to 0.66) suggest room for methodological refinement
- Substantial computational resources required for LLM-based generation and parsing

## Confidence
High confidence: Comparative performance results showing improved correlation with human annotations, basic feasibility of LLM approach, scalability of method
Medium confidence: Generalizability across verbs and frames, optimal prompt design, long-term stability of generated data quality
Low confidence: Absolute accuracy of VFF estimates, robustness across LLM versions, potential for systematic biases

## Next Checks
1. Cross-validation using multiple LLMs (including open-source models) to assess robustness and generalizability
2. Evaluation on multilingual datasets to determine cross-linguistic applicability
3. Human validation study focused on quality and naturalness of LLM-generated sentences
