core_contribution: The paper addresses the problem of aspect-based summarization when
  the provided aspects are incomplete, irrelevant, or missing from the document. The
  authors propose a novel task setting called CARPAS, which aims to dynamically refine
  and filter provided aspects based on document context before summarization.

# CARPAS: Towards Content-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for Summarization in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07177
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07177
- Reference count: 36
- Two-stage method improves aspect-based summarization by refining aspects and predicting their count

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces CARPAS, a novel approach to address the challenge of incomplete or irrelevant aspects in aspect-based summarization. Traditional methods assume perfectly provided aspects, but real-world scenarios often involve missing or irrelevant information. CARPAS tackles this by first predicting the number of relevant aspects in a document, then using this count to guide a large language model in refining and filtering aspects before generating summaries. The method demonstrates significant improvements in summarization quality across both synthetic and real-world datasets, with BERTScore and ROUGE-L improvements reaching up to 30% and 24% on synthetic data.

## Method Summary
CARPAS employs a two-stage approach to enhance aspect-based summarization. First, it predicts the number of relevant aspects using either LLM prompting or a trained regression model. This prediction serves as a constraint for the subsequent aspect refinement stage, where the LLM is guided to generate a refined set of aspects matching the predicted count. The method is evaluated on synthetic datasets of earnings call transcripts and COVID-19 press conferences, as well as a real-world earnings call dataset. The approach addresses the limitations of traditional aspect-based summarization by dynamically adjusting to document content and improving the relevance of generated summaries.

## Key Results
- BERTScore improved by up to 30% on synthetic data and 23% on real-world data
- ROUGE-L scores increased by up to 24% on synthetic data and 16% on real-world data
- Correlation between predicted and ground-truth aspect counts reached 0.44 on synthetic data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by reducing the inference difficulty for LLMs through aspect count prediction, which provides clear constraints for the refinement process. By knowing how many aspects to focus on, the LLM can better filter out irrelevant information and concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the document. This approach effectively bridges the gap between provided aspects and actual document content, leading to more accurate and relevant summaries.

## Foundational Learning
- **Aspect-based summarization**: Why needed? Traditional summarization methods often lack specificity. Quick check: Ensure understanding of how aspects relate to document content.
- **LLM prompting**: Why needed? To leverage pre-trained models for aspect prediction and refinement. Quick check: Verify familiarity with prompt engineering techniques.
- **Synthetic dataset construction**: Why needed? To create controlled environments for testing aspect refinement methods. Quick check: Confirm ability to design synthetic data that mimics real-world scenarios.
- **Correlation metrics**: Why needed? To evaluate the effectiveness of aspect count prediction. Quick check: Understand how correlation coefficients measure prediction accuracy.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Synthetic data generation -> Aspect count prediction -> Aspect refinement -> Summary generation

**Critical Path:**
1. Predict aspect count using LLM or regression model
2. Guide LLM to refine aspects based on predicted count
3. Generate summary using refined aspects

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Synthetic vs. real data: Controlled testing vs. real-world applicability
- LLM prompting vs. trained regression: Flexibility vs. potential accuracy
- Number prediction as constraint: Reduced complexity vs. potential information loss

**Failure Signatures:**
- Low correlation between predicted and actual aspect counts
- Irrelevant aspects in refined set leading to poor summaries
- Overfitting to synthetic data patterns not present in real-world scenarios

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test aspect count prediction accuracy on held-out synthetic data
2. Evaluate aspect refinement quality using human evaluation
3. Compare summary quality with and without aspect count prediction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic datasets may not fully capture real-world complexity
- Real-world dataset size is limited (44 samples)
- Method performance depends on LLM's aspect refinement quality

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Consistent improvements across all tested datasets and metrics
- Statistically meaningful correlation between predicted and ground-truth aspect counts

**Medium confidence:**
- Real-world dataset results show significant but more modest improvements
- Domain-specific characteristics may affect generalizability

**Low confidence:**
- Claims about reduced inference difficulty need more direct evidence

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate method on larger, more diverse real-world dataset covering multiple domains
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of each stage
3. Test method with different LLM configurations and parameter settings
