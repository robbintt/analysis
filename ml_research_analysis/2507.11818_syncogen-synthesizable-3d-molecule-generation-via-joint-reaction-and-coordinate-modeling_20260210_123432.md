# SynCoGen: Synthesizable 3D Molecule Generation via Joint Reaction and Coordinate Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.11818
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11818
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Jointly generates synthesizable molecular graphs and 3D coordinates, achieving >95% RDKit validity and >50% retrosynthesis solve rates

## Executive Summary
SynCoGen introduces a multimodal generative framework that jointly samples synthesizable molecular graphs and 3D atomic coordinates via masked graph diffusion and flow matching. By leveraging a curated dataset (SynSpace) of 1.2M building-block reaction graphs and 7.5M conformers, it generates physically realistic 3D structures while ensuring synthetic accessibility. Evaluated on 3D molecule generation, fragment-linking inpainting, and pharmacophore-conditioned tasks, SynCoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance with >95% RDKit validity, >50% retrosynthesis solve rates, and superior binding predictions, demonstrating practical utility for drug discovery.

## Method Summary
SynCoGen employs a two-stage generation process combining masked graph diffusion for synthesizable molecular graph construction and flow matching for 3D coordinate generation. The model uses a reaction graph decomposition approach where molecules are represented as assembly of building blocks via reaction templates. A large-scale curated dataset (SynSpace) provides paired reaction graphs and conformer data for training. The joint modeling ensures generated molecules are both synthetically accessible and physically realistic, with constraints embedded through the reaction template vocabulary.

## Key Results
- Achieves >95% RDKit validity on generated molecules
- Surpasses baselines with >50% retrosynthesis solve rates
- Demonstrates superior binding predictions and pharmacophore-conditioned generation performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SynCoGen's effectiveness stems from its dual conditioning approach: synthetic accessibility through reaction templates and physical realism through 3D conformer constraints. The masked graph diffusion ensures valid chemical structures by respecting valence rules during generation, while flow matching learns the continuous distribution of 3D coordinates conditioned on the generated graph. This joint modeling prevents the common pitfall of generating chemically valid graphs that cannot be physically realized.

## Foundational Learning
1. Masked Graph Diffusion - Why needed: Enables controlled generation of molecular graphs while maintaining chemical validity. Quick check: Monitor graph validity metrics during generation.
2. Flow Matching for Coordinates - Why needed: Provides stable training for continuous 3D coordinate generation compared to diffusion. Quick check: Validate energy minimization results post-generation.
3. Reaction Graph Decomposition - Why needed: Ensures synthetic accessibility by constraining generation to known reaction patterns. Quick check: Test retrosynthesis solve rates across generated molecules.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Reaction Templates -> Masked Graph Diffusion -> Flow Matching -> 3D Coordinates

Critical Path: The joint training pipeline where reaction graph generation directly conditions 3D coordinate generation represents the critical path. The quality of reaction templates directly impacts downstream 3D structure validity.

Design Tradeoffs: The choice between reaction templates vs. SMILES strings trades flexibility for guaranteed synthetic accessibility. Flow matching vs. diffusion trades training stability for generation diversity.

Failure Signatures: Low RDKit validity indicates issues in graph diffusion; high energy conformations indicate failures in coordinate generation; poor retrosynthesis rates suggest inadequate reaction template coverage.

First Experiments:
1. Generate small molecules (10-50 heavy atoms) and validate RDKit correctness
2. Test retrosynthesis solve rate on generated molecules using multiple tools
3. Compare 3D coordinate quality against baseline molecular dynamics simulations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Do SynCoGen-generated molecules achieve successful synthesis rates and binding affinities in wet-lab validation comparable to their in-silico performance?
- Basis in paper: The Conclusion states, "Looking forward, future works should experimentally validate the synthesis and binding of these de novo designs to establish the practical impact."
- Why unresolved: The paper relies entirely on computational proxies for synthesizability (AiZynthFinder) and binding (AutoDock Vina/AlphaFold), which do not guarantee real-world chemical or biological behavior.
- What evidence would resolve it: Reports of experimental synthesis success rates and measured binding affinities ($K_d$ or $IC_{50}$) for molecules designed by SynCoGen.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the current framework be extended to handle complex chemistries such as macrocycles, chemical protection groups, and multi-leaving-group reactions?
- Basis in paper: Appendix A.1 lists these as explicit limitations: "we do not consider macrocycles... we do not consider the need for chemical protection... [or] reactions... with more leaving groups."
- Why unresolved: The current model simplifies the reaction vocabulary to ensure robustness and atom mapping, excluding reaction types common in complex natural product synthesis or peptide chemistry.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of the model generating valid, low-energy 3D structures for macrocycles or molecules requiring protection/deprotection steps using an expanded reaction template set.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the model maintain high validity and physical realism when scaling to significantly larger chemical spaces without requiring substantially increased training data or compute?
- Basis in paper: While the paper demonstrates scaling to SynSpace-L, it notes a drop in RDKit validity (96.7% to 87.0%) and suggests "longer training would typically be expected" for the thousand-fold increase in search space.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the current architecture and training regime are sample-efficient enough to explore trillion-sized chemical spaces effectively or if they simply overfit to the smaller, high-probability regions of the distribution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of validity and conformer energy metrics on orders of magnitude larger vocabularies (e.g., >10,000 building blocks) under fixed training epoch budgets.

## Limitations
- Curated dataset may not fully capture chemical diversity, potentially limiting generated molecule variety
- Performance on non-canonical molecules (charged species, radicals) not explicitly evaluated
- 7.5M conformer dataset may be insufficient for comprehensive conformational coverage

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- RDKit validity (>95%) claims are well-supported by standard validation metrics
- Basic 3D coordinate generation quality is demonstrated through energy minimization

Medium Confidence:
- Fragment-linking inpainting performance would benefit from broader benchmarking
- Pharmacophore-conditioned generation results need validation across diverse molecular scaffolds

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SynCoGen's performance on a broader chemical space including charged molecules, radicals, and non-standard functional groups not well-represented in SynSpace
2. Benchmark the model's synthesizability predictions against experimental synthetic outcomes and multiple retrosynthesis tools to assess robustness
3. Test the model's ability to generate molecules with specific drug-like properties (e.g., solubility, metabolic stability) in a prospective drug discovery setting
