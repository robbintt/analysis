# Detecting clinician implicit biases in diagnoses using proximal causal inference

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.16399
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16399
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Novel causal inference method detects clinician implicit bias in observational medical data by disentangling biological from bias effects

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a causal inference framework to detect clinician implicit bias in medical diagnoses using observational data. The method leverages proximal mediation analysis to separate pathway-specific effects of patient sociodemographic attributes on diagnoses, distinguishing biological effects from clinician bias. By using proxy variables for latent health states, the approach estimates controlled direct effects as a measure of implicit bias. Tested on UK Biobank data, the method successfully identifies known biases and discovers new areas of potential inequity, providing a valuable tool for healthcare dataset audits and reducing systemic discrimination.

## Method Summary
The method estimates controlled direct effects (CDE) of patient attributes (D) on diagnoses (Y) by treating latent health states (M) as a mediator. It uses two proxy types: outcome proxies (X) - biometric variables used by clinicians, and treatment proxies (Z) - survey data not used in diagnosis. Under partial linearity assumptions, the method transforms the problem into a linear instrumental variable regression, solving for nuisance parameters through a Primal and Dual estimation process. The final bias estimate comes from a Neyman orthogonal moment equation, with statistical tests validating assumptions about exclusion restrictions and instrument strength.

## Key Results
- Successfully detects known gender and racial biases in UK Biobank data with narrow confidence intervals
- Identifies new potential areas of bias when intersectional factors like income are considered
- Robust estimation across multiple disease categories with consistent validation test performance
- Statistical tests validate method assumptions in 80% of tested scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The method isolates implicit bias by defining it as the Controlled Direct Effect (CDE), which is the causal effect of a patient attribute on diagnosis holding the true health state constant. It uses outcome proxies (X) and treatment proxies (Z) with specific exclusion restrictions to recover this effect.

### Mechanism 2
Identification is achieved by transforming the latent mediator problem into a linear Instrumental Variable (IV) regression. Under partial linearity, it derives a bridge function and constructs an instrument V = D - γ*ᵀZ to identify θ via IV regression.

### Mechanism 3
Statistical robustness is maintained via Neyman orthogonality, allowing valid inference even with high-dimensional covariates. The estimation equation is designed so that small errors in nuisance parameters don't propagate into large errors in the bias estimate.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Mediation Analysis & Controlled Direct Effects (CDE)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper defines "bias" mathematically as the CDE, which holds the mediator constant unlike Natural Direct Effects
  - **Quick check question:** If a patient's true health state improves, does the CDE of race on diagnosis change? (Answer: No)

- **Concept:** Instrumental Variables (IV) & Exclusion Restrictions
  - **Why needed here:** The method treats unobserved health state as confounder and uses proxies as instruments
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't we use "current symptoms" as a Z-proxy? (Answer: Current symptoms likely influence diagnosis directly, violating exclusion)

- **Concept:** Neyman Orthogonality
  - **Why needed here:** This property justifies using machine learning models without "polluting" the final bias estimate
  - **Quick check question:** Why estimate γ* in Dual equation if we only care about θ? (Answer: To construct instrument V that orthogonalizes moment condition)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Residualization Layer -> Nuisance Estimation (Primal/Dual) -> Bias Estimator -> Validation Suite
- **Critical path:** Proxy Selection → Residualization → Dual/Primal Solving → Final IV Estimation
- **Design tradeoffs:** Assumes partial linearity to avoid complex non-parametric estimation but risks model misspecification
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Primal/Dual Violation: Bad proxies with direct influence on diagnosis
  - Low Covariance Rank: Insufficient proxies to capture latent health state complexity
  - Wide Confidence Intervals: Weak instrument correlation with attribute
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Semi-Synthetic Recovery: Generate data with known θ (e.g., 0.5) and verify 95% CI coverage
  2. Stress Test Proxies: Deliberately corrupt Z-proxy set with direct Y-influencing variable
  3. Proxy Selection Loop: Run algorithm on UK Biobank subset to identify valid feature subsets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How does the method perform with time-varying confounders and diagnoses in longitudinal EHR data?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 5.1 states planned validation with time-series EHR data
  - **Why unresolved:** Current validation relies on UK Biobank's single enrollment data
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful application to sequential EHR datasets

- **Question:** Can CDE be accurately identified with non-linear structural equations?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 5.1 acknowledges partial linearity may not hold for complex pathways
  - **Why unresolved:** Current theorem and algorithm rely specifically on partial linearity
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Theoretical extension for non-linear bridge functions or empirical results on non-linear semi-synthetic data

- **Question:** To what extent do enrollment biometrics serve as valid proxies for clinician-utilized health information?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 5.1 notes uncertainty about proxy validity for actual clinical data
  - **Why unresolved:** Static enrollment data may not correlate with specific clinical data at diagnosis time
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative analysis between enrollment proxies and time-specific clinical notes

## Limitations
- Sensitivity to proxy variable selection with potential for false positive bias detection
- Requires large sample sizes (~500k) limiting applicability to smaller datasets
- Cannot distinguish between intentional and unintentional bias, only quantifying differential treatment
- Relies on partial linearity assumption which may not hold for complex biological pathways

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Identification strategy via proximal mediation and Neyman orthogonality for robustness
- **Medium confidence:** Proxy Selection Algorithm effectively finds valid proxy sets in practice
- **Low confidence:** Consistent detection of bias across all intersectional subgroups with multiple attributes

## Next Checks
1. **Weak instrument robustness:** Test on semi-synthetic data with varying latent health state correlation to measure breakdown points
2. **Proxy violation stress test:** Systematically introduce direct Z→Y pathways in simulated data to quantify Type I error rates
3. **Intersectional bias detection:** Apply method to simultaneously test multiple sociodemographic attributes to verify compounded bias effect detection
