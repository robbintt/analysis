# Emphasis Sensitivity in Speech Representations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.11566
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11566
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Residuals between neutral and emphasized word representations encode emphasis as a low-dimensional, disentangled transformation that becomes more structured with ASR fine-tuning.

## Executive Summary
This work investigates whether modern self-supervised speech models implicitly encode prosodic emphasis by analyzing residual representations between neutral and emphasized word pairs. A novel residual-based framework is proposed, treating emphasis as a systematic transformation rather than an isolated acoustic property. Experiments on synthetic word pairs from multiple self-supervised models show that residuals correlate strongly with duration changes and occupy low-dimensional subspaces. In ASR fine-tuned models, residuals are up to 50% more compact and yield higher emphasis reconstruction performance while containing less word identity information. These results indicate that emphasis is encoded as a consistent, learnable transformation that becomes more structured with task-specific learning, offering insights for prosody-aware speech modeling.

## Method Summary
The method extracts hidden states from self-supervised speech models (wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, data2Vec) and uses Montreal Forced Aligner to align frames to word boundaries in synthetic emphasis pairs. Frame-level representations are averaged per word to obtain neutral and emphasized word vectors. Residuals are computed as the difference between emphasized and neutral representations, midpoint-centered, and analyzed via PCA. Ridge regression and logistic regression probes are trained on top principal components to predict duration change and word identity respectively. The framework compares residual compactness, reconstruction accuracy, and disentanglement across pre-trained and task-fine-tuned model variants.

## Key Results
- Residuals between neutral and emphasized word representations occupy subspaces up to 50% more compact than full representations, with D95% decreasing after ASR fine-tuning.
- Residuals predict duration changes more accurately than concatenated representations while containing significantly less word identity information.
- Emphasis encoding shows directional consistency across word pairs, indicating systematic transformation rather than word-specific memorization.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Prosodic emphasis is encoded as a systematic, directionally-consistent transformation between neutral and emphasized word representations, not as word-specific acoustic properties. The residual vector R = B - A (where B is emphasized, A is neutral representation) captures emphasis as a reusable transformation. High directional consistency (θ̂R) across different word pairs indicates the model encodes emphasis as a generalizable operation rather than memorizing instance-specific patterns.

### Mechanism 2
Emphasis residuals occupy a low-dimensional subspace, with effective dimensionality (D95%) decreasing after ASR fine-tuning—indicating more structured encoding. PCA on residual vectors reveals that emphasis variation concentrates in fewer principal components than full representations. ASR fine-tuning compresses this further (up to 50% reduction in D95%), suggesting task-specific learning regularizes emphasis encoding into a compact transformation.

### Mechanism 3
Residual representations are disentangled from lexical identity—enabling emphasis prediction without word-specific memorization. Logistic regression probes trained on residuals fail to predict word identity (AUC 0.26-0.44 across models vs. 0.84-0.95 for concatenated representations), indicating residuals strip lexical content while retaining prosodic structure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Self-supervised speech representations (S3L models)**: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, data2Vec provide encoder representations analyzed. Middle-to-deep encoder layers typically capture more abstract linguistic/prosodic features than early layers.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for effective dimensionality (D95%)**: Used to quantify subspace compactness; interpreting variance explained requires understanding eigenvalue decomposition.
- **Prosodic correlates of emphasis**: Duration, pitch/F0, and energy serve as ground-truth proxies. Duration change is used as proxy for emphasis in experiments.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Speech Audio → S3L Encoder → Montreal Forced Aligner → Frame averaging → Paired neutral-emphasized representations → Residual computation → PCA + probing

- **Critical path**: Forced alignment quality directly impacts word-level representation averaging—misaligned boundaries introduce noise. Midpoint centering preserves the neutral-emphasized offset essential for residual interpretation. Layer selection matters: emphasis sensitivity peaks in middle-to-deep layers.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Synthetic dataset provides controlled pairs but may not generalize to natural speech variability. Word-level averaging loses frame-level prosodic dynamics but enables clean pairwise comparison. PCA-based analysis assumes approximately linear structure.

- **Failure signatures**: High θRR but low θ̂R indicates residuals are directionally inconsistent. D95% for residuals approaching full dimensionality suggests emphasis is not encoded as structured transformation. Word ID AUC from residuals >0.7 indicates entanglement with lexical content.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate cosine similarity distributions (θAA, θAB, θ̂R, θRR) on a single model layer to verify emphasis-induced representational shift.
  2. Compute D95% for A, B, C=[A|B], and R to confirm residual subspace compactness; compare pre-trained vs. ASR fine-tuned checkpoints.
  3. Fit ridge regression from top-k residual PCs to duration change δ; verify R² > R² from concatenated representations using fewer components.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does emphasis sensitivity in residual representations generalize to natural, spontaneously produced speech?
- How robust is the low-dimensional emphasis encoding to variation in speaker identity and utterance context?
- Can the discovered residual structure be practically leveraged to improve prosody-aware downstream tasks such as TTS or speech translation?
- Why does emphasis-classification fine-tuning produce qualitatively different residual behavior compared to ASR fine-tuning?

## Limitations
- Synthetic EmphAssess data may not generalize to natural speech variability and perceptual ambiguities present in human speech.
- Duration-based emphasis ground truth may not capture all prosodic dimensions (e.g., pitch, energy).
- Results depend on linearity assumptions of PCA and residual framework's assumption of consistent, directionally-aligned transformations.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Residuals are more compact than full representations; residuals predict duration changes better than concatenated representations; word identity prediction from residuals is consistently poor across models.
- **Medium Confidence**: Emphasis encoding becomes more structured with ASR fine-tuning; residuals contain less word identity information in ASR models.
- **Low Confidence**: Emphasis is encoded as a systematic transformation rather than word-specific acoustic properties.

## Next Checks
1. Test non-linear dimensionality reduction (t-SNE, UMAP) on residuals to verify whether low-dimensional structure persists beyond PCA's linear assumptions.
2. Validate the residual framework on natural speech datasets with multi-speaker, multi-context emphasis variation to assess generalizability beyond EmphAssess.
3. Apply adversarial disentanglement training to residuals and compare learned emphasis subspaces with naturally occurring residuals to isolate whether task-specific regularization drives the observed structure.
