core_contribution: The paper highlights that large language models (LLMs) can hallucinate
  and that uncertainty quantification is critical for improving trust and transparency.
  However, traditional uncertainty frameworks, which rely on separate aleatoric and
  epistemic measures, do not fit the open, interactive nature of LLM-agent interactions.

# Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for Large-language Model Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.22655
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22655
- Reference count: 25
- The paper argues that traditional aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty frameworks are inadequate for LLM-agent interactions and proposes three new research directions: underspecification uncertainty, interactive learning, and output uncertainty

## Executive Summary
Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, making uncertainty quantification essential for building trust and transparency in LLM-agent interactions. Traditional uncertainty frameworks that separate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty do not adequately capture the open, interactive nature of conversational contexts. The authors identify that these concepts are often ill-defined, conflicting, and impractical for real-world dialogue scenarios. To address these limitations, they propose three novel research directions focused on handling incomplete user inputs, enabling active clarification through questioning, and expressing uncertainty through richer natural language outputs.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a critical review of existing uncertainty quantification approaches in the context of LLM-agent interactions, analyzing their limitations through literature survey. The authors systematically examine why traditional aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty frameworks fail to address the unique challenges of conversational AI, including underspecification, dynamic interaction patterns, and the need for transparent communication. Based on this analysis, they propose three new research directions: underspecification uncertainty to handle ambiguous or incomplete user inputs, interactive learning to enable active clarification-seeking behavior, and output uncertainty to communicate uncertainty through natural language expressions rather than technical probability scores.

## Key Results
- Traditional aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty frameworks are ill-defined and conflicting when applied to LLM-agent interactions
- Current uncertainty quantification methods fail to address the open, interactive nature of conversational contexts
- The proposed new approaches (underspecification uncertainty, interactive learning, output uncertainty) could yield more transparent and trustworthy LLM interactions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed approaches work by directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between traditional uncertainty frameworks and the reality of LLM-agent interactions. Underspecification uncertainty captures the inherent ambiguity in user inputs that traditional methods cannot quantify. Interactive learning enables the agent to actively reduce uncertainty through clarification questions rather than passively responding. Output uncertainty communicates uncertainty in ways users can understand and act upon, bridging the gap between technical uncertainty measures and human comprehension.

## Foundational Learning
1. Aleatoric uncertainty - inherent randomness in data
   - Why needed: Traditional baseline for uncertainty quantification
   - Quick check: Can distinguish between noise and model ignorance

2. Epistemic uncertainty - model uncertainty due to limited knowledge
   - Why needed: Captures what the model doesn't know it doesn't know
   - Quick check: Reduces with more training data or better models

3. Underspecification uncertainty - uncertainty from incomplete/ambiguous user inputs
   - Why needed: Addresses the gap in traditional frameworks for conversational contexts
   - Quick check: Quantifies ambiguity in user requests before processing

4. Interactive learning - agent actively seeks clarification to reduce uncertainty
   - Why needed: Enables dynamic uncertainty reduction through dialogue
   - Quick check: Measures improvement in response quality after clarification

5. Output uncertainty - communicating uncertainty through natural language
   - Why needed: Makes uncertainty accessible to end users
   - Quick check: User comprehension and appropriate trust calibration

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
User Input -> Underspecification Detection -> Interactive Clarification -> Response Generation -> Output Uncertainty Expression

Critical path:
The critical path flows from user input through underspecification detection to either interactive clarification (if ambiguity detected) or direct response generation. The output uncertainty expression module runs in parallel with response generation to ensure uncertainty is communicated alongside the main response.

Design tradeoffs:
- Explicit vs implicit clarification: Direct questions vs context-based inference
- Technical vs natural uncertainty communication: Probability scores vs confidence expressions
- Proactivity vs reactivity: Initiating clarification vs waiting for user follow-up

Failure signatures:
- Over-clarification: Excessive questioning that frustrates users
- Under-clarification: Insufficient uncertainty detection leading to poor responses
- Miscommunication: Uncertainty expressed in ways users misunderstand

First experiments:
1. Compare traditional uncertainty quantification vs underspecification detection on ambiguous user queries
2. A/B test interactive clarification vs static response generation for user satisfaction
3. Evaluate different output uncertainty communication styles on user trust calibration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The proposed approaches lack rigorous theoretical grounding and empirical validation
- Unclear how these methods would scale to complex, multi-turn conversations
- No comparative studies showing superiority over adapted traditional uncertainty methods

## Confidence

Core claim confidence:
- Traditional uncertainty frameworks are inadequate for LLM agents: Medium
- Novel frameworks are essential for effective real-world dialogue: Medium

Proposed directions confidence:
- New uncertainty types (underspecification, interactive learning, output uncertainty): Low-Medium

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing traditional uncertainty quantification methods with the proposed new approaches in multi-turn dialogue scenarios to measure relative effectiveness

2. Develop and test formal definitions and measurement protocols for underspecification uncertainty in various conversational contexts

3. Design and implement a prototype system that integrates interactive learning and output uncertainty mechanisms, then evaluate user trust and comprehension through user studies
