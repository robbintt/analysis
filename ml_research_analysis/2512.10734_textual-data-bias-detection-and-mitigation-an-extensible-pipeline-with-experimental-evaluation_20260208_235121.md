# Textual Data Bias Detection and Mitigation -- An Extensible Pipeline with Experimental Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.10734
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10734
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Comprehensive pipeline for detecting and mitigating representation bias and stereotypes in textual datasets used to train LLMs, with experimental evaluation showing data-level bias reduction but inconsistent model-level improvements.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive pipeline for detecting and mitigating data bias in textual datasets used to train large language models. The approach targets representation bias (unequal group representation) and explicit stereotypes across configurable sensitive attributes. Key innovations include LLM-assisted word list generation with quality criteria, a novel grammar- and context-aware counterfactual data augmentation method, and stereotype detection using sociolinguistic frameworks. Evaluation on real-world data shows successful bias reduction at the dataset level. However, fine-tuning on debiased data produces inconsistent improvements on standard bias benchmarks, revealing a critical gap between data-level bias reduction and model-level debiasing effects.

## Method Summary
The pipeline consists of four main components: (1) LLM-assisted word list generation with quality criteria for demographic attributes, (2) representation bias measurement using the Demographic Representation Score (DR), (3) stereotype detection and assessment using a two-step LLM pipeline with sociolinguistic linguistic indicators, and (4) counterfactual data augmentation (both BaseCDA and the novel GC-CDA variant). The system processes textual datasets at the sentence level, applying metadata annotations for bias detection and mitigation, then reconstructs the dataset. Model fine-tuning uses LoRA with specific hyperparameters for efficient adaptation to debiased data.

## Key Results
- GC-CDA achieves 77% human-rated correctness for gender counterfactuals vs 40% for BaseCDA
- Two-step stereotype detection reaches 79.9% accuracy on complex SmallHeap data vs 68.7% for detection-only
- Fine-tuning on GC-CDA debiased data shows inconsistent improvements across bias benchmarks (RedditBias, BBQ, etc.)
- DR score successfully quantifies representation bias, dropping from 0.216 to 0.145 for gender after debiasing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-assisted word list generation with quality criteria produces attribute-extensible vocabulary for bias detection.
- Mechanism: An LLM generates candidate category labels per demographic group using few-shot prompts that encode quality rules (unambiguous, free of stereotypical associations, not proper names). Generated words are filtered by corpus frequency and validated by humans against the quality criteria.
- Core assumption: LLMs can produce category labels that meet explicit quality constraints when guided by rules and examples, and frequency filtering preserves practically relevant terms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLM-assisted word list generation with quality criteria"
  - [section 4.2.1] Algorithm 1 defines the generation, frequency filtering, and human validation steps.
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus neighbors focus on bias evaluation, not word list quality.
- Break condition: When attributes lack clear categorical boundaries (e.g., "middle-aged"), generated lists contain ambiguous terms that fail validation, requiring multiple rounds of refinement.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation (GC-CDA) reduces representation bias while preserving factual and grammatical correctness better than standard CDA.
- Mechanism: GC-CDA filters political/historical content, performs targeted substitution (based on DR score targets), uses LLM-assisted word selection (80%) plus random selection (20%), and validates each counterfactual for grammar and factual correctness before inclusion.
- Core assumption: Conservative, context-aware counterfactuals are more likely to transfer to improved model behavior than aggressive, syntax-only swaps that create unnatural or incorrect sentences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "novel grammar- and context-aware counterfactual data augmentation method"
  - [section 5.1.4, Table 7] GC-CDA achieves 77% human-rated correctness for gender vs 40% for BaseCDA; for age/religion, correctness improves but DR reduction is limited due to conservative filtering.
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus neighbors discuss bias mitigation approaches but do not evaluate GC-CDA specifically.
- Break condition: For attributes like age and religion, where markers are topically relevant rather than incidental, GC-CDA becomes extremely conservative, substituting only 2-6% of sentences, which limits DR reduction.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Two-step stereotype detection and assessment using sociolinguistic linguistic indicators improves stereotype identification and enables threshold-based filtering.
- Mechanism: Step 1 uses a smaller LLM (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct) for broad binary classification. Step 2 uses a larger LLM (Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) to extract linguistic indicators based on the SCSC framework, which are scored via a linear regression model trained on human-labeled data. Sentences exceeding a threshold are filtered.
- Core assumption: Linguistic indicators derived from sociolinguistic theory correlate with human-perceived stereotype strength, and thresholding on these scores reliably separates harmful stereotypes from weaker or false-positive cases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "stereotype detection using sociolinguistic frameworks"
  - [section 5.1.3, Table 6] On complex SmallHeap data, detection+assessment achieves 79.9% accuracy vs 68.7% for detection-only; threshold t=0.63 yields optimal Macro F1 of 60.1%.
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus neighbors discuss stereotype evaluation but do not validate this specific SCSC-based approach.
- Break condition: High false-positive rate when linguistic indicators are misclassified by the LLM, and difficulty interpreting context such as negated stereotypes ("She is not emotional").

## Foundational Learning

- **Demographic Representation Score (DR)**
  - Why needed here: DR is the primary metric for quantifying representation bias and serves as the optimization target for CDA balancing.
  - Quick check question: If DR = 0.35 for a dataset with 3 groups, what does this indicate about group distribution?

- **Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA)**
  - Why needed here: CDA is the core mitigation technique; understanding standard CDA is necessary to appreciate the grammar- and context-aware extensions.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between one-sided and two-sided CDA, and why does the paper choose one-sided?

- **SCSC Framework (Social Category and Stereotype Communication)**
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical grounding for linguistic indicators used in stereotype assessment.
  - Quick check question: Name two linguistic indicators from SCSC that the paper uses to score stereotype strength.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Word List Generation (pre-processing, attribute-specific)
  2. Sentence Generator (splits documents into sentence entities)
  3. Representation Bias Measurement (DR calculation, relevant sentence flagging)
  4. Stereotype Detection & Assessment (two-step LLM pipeline, SCSC-based scoring)
  5. Counterfactual Data Augmentation (BaseCDA or GC-CDA, metadata updates)
  6. Dataset Reconstruction (merges sentences, applies remove_sentence and text_cda flags)

- **Critical path:** Word lists must be validated before DR measurement. DR score determines CDA targets. Stereotype detection only processes relevant_sentence=True sentences. GC-CDA skips sentences flagged for removal. Final dataset rebuilds from enriched metadata.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - GC-CDA quality vs DR reduction: Higher correctness correlates with fewer substitutions and less bias reduction.
  - Threshold strictness: Higher stereotype thresholds increase precision but may miss harmful content; lower thresholds increase recall but produce more false positives.
  - Model size vs cost: Using Llama-3.3-70B for assessment improves accuracy but increases inference cost compared to smaller models.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - DR score plateaus despite CDA: Likely due to GC-CDA's conservative checks rejecting most candidates for non-gender attributes.
  - Fine-tuned model shows inconsistent bias benchmark results: Paper attributes this to the gap between data-level debiasing and model-level effects, plus benchmark limitations.
  - Over-correction in completions: Models fine-tuned on GC-CDA data may flip male-stereotyped sentences to female completions excessively (asymmetric bias shift).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate DR sensitivity:** Calculate DR on SmallHeap vs SmallHeapNeutral to confirm the metric detects known debiasing (Figure 5 shows DR_gender drops from 0.216 to 0.145).
  2. **Benchmark stereotype detection:** Run the two-step pipeline on annotated SmallHeap subset and compare accuracy, precision, recall against ALBERT-V2, Llama-Guard-3-8B, and Perspective API (Table 6).
  3. **Compare CDA variants:** Apply BaseCDA and GC-CDA to the same dataset slice, measure DR reduction and human-evaluated correctness for gender, age, and religion (Table 7).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can targeted data interventions be designed to actively reshape manifested model bias in pre-trained LLMs, as opposed to simply balancing dataset distributions?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors conclude that "fine-tuning a model using only debiased data... may not always be sufficient to unlearn existing biases," and explicitly call for future research on "targeted data interventions to actively reshape (known) manifested model bias."
  - **Why unresolved:** The study found that reducing dataset-level bias (representation/stereotypes) does not consistently translate to reduced model bias, suggesting that passive data balancing is insufficient for unlearning pre-existing biases.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Development and evaluation of new mitigation strategies that specifically target model weights or attention mechanisms based on detected manifest biases, showing improved performance on bias benchmarks compared to standard data balancing.

- **Open Question 2:** Which evaluation benchmarks reliably capture the effects of data-level debiasing on model behavior, given the observed inconsistencies in current metrics?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper states that "further research is needed to understand how different data bias types manifest in model behavior and which benchmarks reliably measure these manifestations."
  - **Why unresolved:** The authors observed that fine-tuning on debiased data produced inconsistent results across different standard benchmarks (e.g., RedditBias vs. BBQ), indicating that existing metrics may measure different capabilities or fail to correlate with data-level changes.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A comprehensive mapping study correlating specific data-level interventions (e.g., stereotype filtering) with performance changes across a wide array of model benchmarks to identify which metrics are sensitive to data manipulation.

- **Open Question 3:** What is the optimal trade-off ("sweet spot") between representation bias reduction and the preservation of factual/grammatical correctness in Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA)?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note a tension between reducing representation bias and maintaining factual accuracy, particularly for non-gender attributes, and explicitly "propose that future works explore this trade-off as an adjustable parameter."
  - **Why unresolved:** The proposed Grammar- and Context-aware CDA (GC-CDA) was conservative, often rejecting substitutions to preserve correctness, which limited the reduction of representation bias for attributes like religion and age.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study varying the strictness of the factual/grammatical checks in the augmentation pipeline to plot the curve between dataset quality metrics and the Demographic Representation Score (DR).

## Limitations

- GC-CDA's effectiveness shows a fundamental tradeoff: grammar and factual correctness come at the cost of reduced bias mitigation, particularly for attributes where markers are contextually bound (age/religion).
- The paper reveals a significant gap between data-level bias reduction and model-level debiasing effects, suggesting that current evaluation methods may not capture the full complexity of bias transfer during fine-tuning.
- The stereotype detection pipeline relies heavily on the SCSC framework which may not generalize to all linguistic contexts or cultural domains.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The pipeline architecture and methodology are well-specified and reproducible. The DR calculation formula and word list generation process are clearly defined. The evaluation framework using multiple bias benchmarks is robust.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of GC-CDA versus BaseCDA for different attributes is well-supported by human evaluation data, but the optimal balance between correctness and bias reduction remains context-dependent. The stereotype detection pipeline shows strong performance metrics but relies on assumptions about linguistic indicator relevance across domains.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that data-level bias reduction translates to improved model behavior is weakly supported, with fine-tuning results showing inconsistent improvements across benchmarks. The generalizability of SCSC-based stereotype detection to non-Western languages and cultural contexts is not established.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-attribute CDA effectiveness validation**: Apply both BaseCDA and GC-CDA to a controlled dataset with balanced gender, age, and religion markers, measuring both DR reduction and human-evaluated correctness across all three attributes. Compare substitution rates and correctness scores to identify which attributes benefit most from grammar-aware filtering.

2. **Model-level bias transfer experiment**: Fine-tune a model on debiased data using the exact LoRA configuration specified, then evaluate on multiple bias benchmarks (HellaSwag, RedditBias, CrowS-Pairs) with statistical significance testing. Compare against baseline fine-tuning to quantify actual bias reduction versus data-level metrics.

3. **SCSC framework generalization test**: Apply the two-step stereotype detection pipeline to a dataset containing stereotypes from different cultural contexts (e.g., Asian, African, Latin American stereotypes), measuring accuracy and false-positive rates. Evaluate whether linguistic indicators from Western sociolinguistic theory capture stereotype strength in non-Western contexts.
