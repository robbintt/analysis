# Exploring the Reliability of Self-explanation and its Relationship with Classification in Language Model-driven Financial Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.15985
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15985
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Key outcome:** Language model self-explanations show statistically significant relationships with classification accuracy in financial tasks, with factuality and causality metrics serving as potential confidence proxies

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the reliability of self-explanations generated by language models (LMs) in financial classification tasks, focusing on factuality and causality. Using a public financial dataset, the research demonstrates a statistically significant relationship between the accuracy of classifications and the factuality or causality of self-explanations. Chi-squared tests reveal that factual inaccuracies and logical inconsistencies in explanations correlate with classification errors. Among the evaluated models, Llama-3.2-3B exhibited fewer factuality issues, while Gemma-2-2B showed fewer causality issues. The findings establish an empirical foundation for using self-explanations as a proxy for classification confidence and optimizing financial classification through reasoning.

## Method Summary
The study employs a public financial dataset and evaluates multiple language models on classification tasks. Self-explanations are generated alongside classifications, and their factuality and causality are assessed using automated metrics and human evaluation. Statistical analysis, including chi-squared tests, is used to determine the relationship between explanation quality (factuality/causality) and classification accuracy. The research compares different models (Llama-3.2-3B, Gemma-2-2B) to identify variations in explanation reliability.

## Key Results
- Statistically significant correlation between classification accuracy and factuality/causality of self-explanations
- Llama-3.2-3B exhibits fewer factuality issues compared to other models
- Gemma-2-2B shows fewer causality issues in explanations
- Self-explanations can serve as proxies for classification confidence in financial analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of language models, where the process of generating self-explanations involves explicit reasoning steps that can be evaluated for logical consistency and factual accuracy. When models produce accurate classifications, they tend to generate explanations that are both factually correct and causally coherent, reflecting sound reasoning pathways.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Factuality Assessment** - Evaluating whether explanations contain true statements based on input data
   - Why needed: Ensures explanations accurately represent the information used for classification
   - Quick check: Compare explanation claims against ground truth facts in the dataset

2. **Causal Reasoning Evaluation** - Assessing logical consistency and causal relationships in explanations
   - Why needed: Identifies whether explanations follow valid logical pathways
   - Quick check: Verify that cause-effect relationships in explanations are internally consistent

3. **Chi-squared Statistical Analysis** - Testing relationships between categorical variables
   - Why needed: Determines whether explanation quality correlates with classification accuracy
   - Quick check: Ensure expected frequencies in contingency tables are sufficiently large

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Financial Data -> Language Model -> Classification + Self-Explanation -> Factuality/Causality Evaluation -> Accuracy Correlation Analysis

**Critical Path:** The sequence from data input through model classification to explanation generation represents the primary workflow, with evaluation metrics applied to both outputs.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study balances model complexity against explanation quality, using proprietary models for performance while acknowledging limitations in reproducibility and generalizability.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor factuality or causality in explanations serves as an indicator of potential classification errors, providing early warning signals for unreliable outputs.

**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate factuality metrics on a held-out validation set to establish baseline explanation quality
2. Compare chi-squared results across different financial classification tasks to test robustness
3. Analyze individual model error patterns to identify specific failure modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single public financial dataset limits generalizability across domains
- Proprietary models restrict reproducibility and independent validation
- Focus on binary classification leaves unclear applicability to multi-class problems

## Confidence
**Medium** - While statistical significance is demonstrated, practical significance and causation remain unclear, and the empirical foundation rests on limited dataset diversity and model accessibility.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate analysis across multiple financial datasets with varying complexity and task types
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine if improving explanation quality directly improves classification accuracy
3. Test the explanation-confidence relationship on open-source models for reproducibility verification
