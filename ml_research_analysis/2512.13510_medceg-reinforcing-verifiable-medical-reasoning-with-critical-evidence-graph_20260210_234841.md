# MedCEG: Reinforcing Verifiable Medical Reasoning with Critical Evidence Graph

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.13510
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13510
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** State-of-the-art medical reasoning performance with 58.59% average accuracy on in-distribution tasks and 64.09% on out-of-distribution tasks

## Executive Summary
MedCEG enhances medical language models' reasoning by explicitly supervising the entire diagnostic process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). The framework constructs linearized Evidence Graphs from clinical cases and extracts CEGs to capture essential reasoning pathways, then uses these as rewards in reinforcement learning to guide models toward clinically valid inferences. On multiple medical benchmarks, MedCEG achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing more logically coherent and evidence-faithful reasoning chains compared to baseline models.

## Method Summary
MedCEG uses a two-stage pipeline: (1) Cold-Start SFT: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct trained on linearized graphs with lr=1e-6, 8 epochs, DeepSpeed ZeRO-2, max_seq=10240. (2) GRPO RL: lr=5e-7, 10 epochs, KL β=0.001, 8 rollouts/prompt, global_batch=32. CRP reward combines node coverage (λ_node=0.5), structural correctness (λ_struct=0.3), and chain completeness (λ_chain=0.2) with answer accuracy (w_answer=0.6) and reasoning quality (w_reason=0.3). CEGs are constructed from curated clinical cases via multi-LLM triplet extraction (≥2/3 consensus) and transitive reduction.

## Key Results
- Achieves 58.59% average accuracy on in-distribution medical tasks
- Achieves 64.09% average accuracy on out-of-distribution medical tasks
- Produces more logically coherent and evidence-faithful reasoning chains compared to baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Converting narrative rationales to structured graphs externalizes implicit reasoning logic, enabling direct supervision of intermediate steps.
- **Mechanism:** Multi-LLM ensemble extracts subject-predicate-object triplets from rationales; consensus voting (≥2/3 models) filters noise. The structured representation makes each inferential step explicit and verifiable.
- **Core assumption:** High-quality rationales exist and can be faithfully parsed into discrete logical relations without semantic loss.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Transitive reduction of evidence graphs enforces granular reasoning by pruning inferential shortcuts.
- **Mechanism:** Backward traversal from answer-anchored conclusion node collects all causal paths; transitive reduction removes direct edges (A→C) when multi-hop paths exist (A→B→C), forcing explicit intermediate steps.
- **Core assumption:** Medical reasoning benefits from making every inference explicit rather than allowing compressed reasoning chains.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Process-oriented graph-matching rewards guide models toward clinically valid reasoning more reliably than outcome-only rewards.
- **Mechanism:** CRP reward computes: (1) semantic node coverage via embeddings, (2) structural correctness via triplet recall, (3) chain completeness via connected component analysis. Combined signal rewards both correctness and coherence.
- **Core assumption:** Generated reasoning can be reliably parsed back into comparable graph structures.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) variants**
  - **Why needed here:** GRPO eliminates PPO's value function, reducing memory overhead while maintaining policy gradient benefits. Understanding clipping, KL penalties, and advantage estimation is prerequisite.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why GRPO samples multiple outputs per prompt and compares them, rather than estimating a value function?

- **Concept: Graph traversal algorithms (BFS/DFS)**
  - **Why needed here:** CEG extraction uses backward BFS from conclusion node to collect causally-connected subgraphs. Transitive reduction requires path existence checks.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a directed graph with node C as conclusion, write pseudocode to collect all ancestors reachable via backward traversal.

- **Concept: Dense retrieval / semantic similarity**
  - **Why needed here:** Rnode uses bge-large-en-v1.5 embeddings to compute cosine similarity between generated and ground-truth nodes. Soft matching (threshold θ_entity) replaces exact string matching.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might exact string matching fail for medical entity comparison? What threshold would you use for "soft" matching?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Raw Clinical Cases → Hard Filtering (Llama-3.1-8B ×16) → Rejection Sampling (Gemini-2.5-Pro) → D_curated → EG Construction (3-model ensemble) → D_EG → CEG Extraction (backward traversal + transitive reduction) → D_CEG → Split: D_cold (SFT) / D_rl (GRPO)

- **Critical path:** CEG quality determines reward signal quality. If CEG extraction is noisy, RL reinforces incorrect pathways. The consensus extraction (≥2/3 models) is the quality gate.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - CEG vs. EG supervision: Ablation shows EG (no pruning) causes performance collapse—hypothesized that excessive constraints stifle exploration
  - Reward weights: w_reason=0.3, w_answer=0.6, w_format=0.1; answer accuracy still prioritized over process quality
  - λ_node=0.5, λ_struct=0.3, λ_chain=0.2; coverage weighted higher than structural exactness

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Circular reasoning in outputs (case study: AlphaMed-8B declares diagnosis in step 3, then circularly justifies)
  - Hallucinated evidence (case study score 0 for evidence faithfulness when model fabricates lab values)
  - Disconnected reasoning chains (low Rchain despite high Rnode indicates fragmented logic)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate EG extraction quality:** Sample 100 curated rationales, manually verify extracted triplets capture all critical clinical relationships. Compute precision/recall vs. expert-annotated graphs.
  2. **Ablate embedding thresholds:** Test θ_entity ∈ {0.7, 0.8, 0.9} on held-out cases to find optimal soft-matching threshold before full RL training.
  3. **Sanity check CRP reward:** Train small model (e.g., Qwen3-4B) on subset with ablated rewards (w/o Rchain, w/o Rstruct) to confirm reported sensitivity before scaling to 8B.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does noise or errors in the automated Evidence Graph (EG) and Critical Evidence Graph (CEG) construction propagate through the reinforcement learning pipeline, and what failure modes emerge when the CEG itself contains flawed reasoning pathways?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section: "If the constructed CEG is flawed, it provides a noisy reward signal during the reinforcement learning phase, potentially reinforcing incorrect reasoning pathways."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not characterize error propagation from CEG construction to final model behavior, nor does it analyze robustness thresholds for acceptable CEG quality.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic injection of controlled errors into CEGs with analysis of resulting reward signal corruption and model performance degradation; quantitative thresholds for CEG accuracy requirements.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the structured graph-based constraints and CEG-guided rewards generalize to unstructured, noisy real-world clinical data such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with abbreviations, ungrammatical shorthand, and heterogeneous formats?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state: "It remains to be verified whether the structured graph constraints generalize effectively to the raw, messy nature of real-time clinical documentation without additional adaptation."
- **Why unresolved:** The current evaluation is limited to curated textual benchmarks (MedQA, MedBullets, MedCase), which do not reflect the linguistic noise and structural variability of actual clinical documentation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation on de-identified EHR datasets comparing MedCEG performance on raw clinical notes versus curated benchmarks; analysis of triplet extraction accuracy on noisy text.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent does the reliance on LLM-generated triplet extraction (using GPT-OSS-120B, Qwen3-235B, DeepSeek-V3) introduce systematic biases or hallucinations into the Evidence Graphs, and how does this affect downstream reward signal quality?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper uses an ensemble of LLMs to extract triplets and accepts those agreed upon by ≥2 models, but provides no analysis of systematic extraction errors or their downstream effects on the CRP reward computation.
- **Why unresolved:** No calibration or error analysis is provided for the triplet extraction process, and the relationship between extraction quality and final model behavior remains uncharacterized.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Human expert annotation of triplets from a sample of rationales with comparison to LLM-extracted triplets; correlation analysis between extraction error types and reward signal distortion.

## Limitations

- **CEG Construction Quality:** The framework relies on multi-LLM consensus for triplet extraction, but validation of extraction quality is minimal and manual verification is absent.
- **Generalization Beyond Curated Datasets:** Performance gains are demonstrated on MedQA, MedCase, and JAMA Challenge, but these benchmarks share similar structure and may not reflect real-world clinical scenarios.
- **Reward Computation Stability:** CRP reward relies on semantic similarity between generated and ground-truth nodes/relations using bge-large-en-v1.5 embeddings, but optimal threshold values are not reported.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Graph-structured supervision improves reasoning coherence (supported by ablation showing EG removal collapses performance, and Rchain's sensitivity analysis).
- **Medium Confidence:** CEG-based RL outperforms outcome-only supervision (strong benchmark results, but dependent on untested CEG quality assumptions).
- **Low Confidence:** Clinical reasoning improvements generalize to real-world scenarios (no external validation or diverse dataset testing).

## Next Checks

1. **Validate CEG Extraction Quality:** Manually annotate 100 curated rationales from D_curated with expert-annotated triplets and reasoning graphs. Compute precision, recall, and F1 of ensemble-extracted CEGs vs. gold standards. Identify systematic extraction failures (e.g., pronoun resolution, implicit knowledge gaps).

2. **Test Embedding Threshold Sensitivity:** Perform ablation study on θ_entity and θ_relation in the 0.7-0.9 range using a held-out validation set. Measure impact on R_node, R_struct, R_chain scores and final model accuracy. Determine optimal thresholds before full RL training.

3. **Evaluate on External Clinical Dataset:** Apply MedCEG to an independent clinical reasoning dataset (e.g., MIMIC-CXR reports or PubMedQA) without retraining. Compare performance against baseline models to assess generalization beyond curated benchmarks.
