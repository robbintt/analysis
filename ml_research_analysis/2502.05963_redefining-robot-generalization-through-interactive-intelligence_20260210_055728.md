- Single-agent foundation models struggle with real-world robotics requiring continuous human interaction

## Executive Summary
This position paper identifies a critical limitation in current robot foundation models: their single-agent paradigm struggles to handle real-world robotics that require continuous human interaction, such as wearable devices, teleoperation, and neural interfaces. The author argues that these applications demand an interactive multi-agent framework that explicitly models both the robot and human as co-adapting decision-makers. A neuroscience-inspired architecture is proposed, consisting of four modules: multimodal sensing for integrating language and physiological inputs, ad-hoc teamwork modeling for human-robot collaboration, predictive world belief modeling for anticipating user states, and memory/feedback mechanisms for personalization.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces a four-module interactive intelligence architecture for human-robot co-adaptation. Module 1 uses multimodal foundation models to fuse language commands with physiological signals (EMG, kinematics, camera). Module 2 implements ad-hoc teamwork principles to maintain belief states about human intent, fatigue, and preferences. Module 3 employs predictive world belief modeling using forward internal models to anticipate user states and environmental conditions. Module 4 stores user-specific parameters and updates them via reinforcement learning from explicit or implicit feedback. The framework enables anticipatory control, continuous adaptation, and personalized interactions in cyborg systems and other human-interactive robotic contexts.

## Key Results
- Current single-agent foundation models fail at mid-task corrections and turn-taking in human-robot interaction
- Proposed architecture enables anticipatory control by predicting user states before terrain changes
- Long-term memory module allows personalized adaptation through reinforcement-based preference updates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Treating human and robot as interacting agents with explicit belief-state modeling enables mid-task corrections and turn-taking.
- **Mechanism:** Ad-hoc teamwork module maintains dynamic belief states about human partner (intentions, fatigue, comfort boundaries) and refines proposals by comparing predictions to observed outcomes.
- **Core assumption:** Human internal states can be reliably inferred from multimodal signals and are predictive of near-term behavior.
- **Evidence anchors:** Documented failures of Gato and RT-1 in handling mid-task corrections; neighbor paper surveys LLM-based robotics but lacks multi-agent validation.
- **Break condition:** If user state inference has high variance or latency exceeds real-time control requirements.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Predictive world belief model enables anticipatory control rather than threshold-based reactive responses.
- **Mechanism:** Module maintains probabilistic forward-looking estimates of user states and environmental conditions, drawing on predictive coding frameworks to minimize prediction error.
- **Core assumption:** Future user and environment states follow learnable distributions from historical multimodal data.
- **Evidence anchors:** Anticipatory control described for adjusting torque before terrain changes; no direct corpus validation available.
- **Break condition:** If environmental transitions are highly non-stationary or user behavior exhibits sudden regime shifts.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Long-term preference storage with reinforcement updates enables personalization improving cumulative user comfort.
- **Mechanism:** Memory module stores user-specific parameters and updates them via explicit user queries or implicit discomfort signals, optimizing an objective function.
- **Core assumption:** User preferences are sufficiently stable to benefit from long-term storage and feedback is reliable for reinforcement updates.
- **Evidence anchors:** Body image evolution during wearable robot learning suggests user adaptation occurs; indirect corpus evidence only.
- **Break condition:** If user preferences drift rapidly or feedback signals are noisy/contradictory.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Ad-hoc teamwork and multi-agent coordination
  - **Why needed here:** Architecture assumes familiarity with ad-hoc teamwork principles—agents collaborating without prior coordination under incomplete information.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how an agent would maintain a belief state about a teammate's goal when only partial observations are available?

- **Concept:** Internal forward models and predictive coding
  - **Why needed here:** Module 3 draws on motor control theories where brain predicts sensory outcomes of motor commands.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a forward model differ from an inverse model in motor control, and which would you use for state prediction?

- **Concept:** Multimodal foundation models (LLMs, VLMs, LMMs)
  - **Why needed here:** Module 1 leverages language and multimodal encoders to fuse natural language commands with sensor data.
  - **Quick check question:** How would you align embeddings from EMG signals with language embeddings so they can be processed jointly?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Sensing Module → Ad-hoc Teamwork Module → Predictive World Belief Module → Control Output, with Memory/Feedback operating as parallel loop updating Module 2 and 3 parameters over time.

- **Critical path:** Multimodal sensing outputs → belief state estimation → anticipatory prediction → control action, with continuous feedback loop for personalization.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Latency vs. prediction horizon: Longer horizons improve anticipatory control but increase computational latency; real-time control likely requires <50ms end-to-end latency.
  - Memory granularity vs. storage/query cost: Fine-grained preference logs improve personalization but increase retrieval complexity.
  - Explicit vs. implicit feedback: Explicit user queries improve signal quality but interrupt user experience.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Belief-state divergence: Robot actions consistently mismatch user intent → indicates sensor drift or outdated user model.
  - Prediction lag: Robot responds reactively rather than anticipatorily → forward model inference too slow or prediction horizon too short.
  - Preference oscillation: Stored parameters fluctuate wildly → feedback signal too noisy or learning rate too high.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Single-module isolation test:** Implement only Sensing Module with pretrained VLM on recorded EMG/camera data; verify proposal quality against human-labeled ground truth.
  2. **Belief-state tracking validation:** Deploy Module 2 in simulation with synthetic human model; measure correlation between inferred and ground-truth belief states.
  3. **Anticipatory vs. reactive ablation:** Compare Module 3-enabled control against threshold-based reactive controller in simulated terrain-transition task.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Architecture remains conceptual with no quantitative validation or empirical benchmarks
- Key design choices—neural architectures, training data requirements, hyperparameter settings—are unspecified
- Claims about anticipatory control and personalization benefits lack direct experimental evidence

## Confidence
- **High:** Identification of single-agent limitations in current foundation models for interactive robotics is well-supported by documented failures
- **Medium:** Proposed four-module architecture is logically coherent but lacks specific implementation details
- **Low:** Claims about anticipatory control performance and personalization benefits lack empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Belief-state tracking validation:** Deploy Module 2 in simulation with synthetic human model that generates observable states; measure correlation between inferred and ground-truth belief states.
2. **Anticipatory vs. reactive ablation:** Compare Module 3-enabled control against threshold-based reactive controller in simulated terrain-transition task; quantify reduction in torque adjustment latency and user discomfort proxy.
3. **Single-module isolation test:** Implement only Sensing Module with pretrained VLM on recorded EMG/camera data; verify proposal quality against human-labeled ground truth for intent classification.
