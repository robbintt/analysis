# Reconstructing Syllable Sequences in Abugida Scripts with Incomplete Inputs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.11008
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11008

- Key outcome: Transformer models effectively reconstruct syllable sequences from incomplete Abugida script inputs, with consonants being critical for prediction accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study applies Transformer-based models to predict syllable sequences in six Abugida languages (Bengali, Hindi, Khmer, Lao, Myanmar, Thai) using the Asian Language Treebank dataset. The core method involves reconstructing complete syllable sequences from incomplete inputs including consonant-only, vowel-only, randomly deleted character sequences, and masked syllable sequences. Results show consonant sequences are critical for accurate prediction, achieving BLEU scores of 62.65-99.87, while vowel sequences yield much lower scores of 13.62-60.28. The model demonstrates robust performance on partial and masked syllable reconstruction, with Khmer and Thai achieving the highest performance, while Myanmar shows the greatest challenges due to its complex diacritic system.

## Method Summary
The study employed the Marian NMT framework to develop Transformer-based models for syllable sequence prediction across six Abugida languages. The models were trained on the Asian Language Treebank dataset, which provides syllable-level annotations. Four reconstruction tasks were evaluated: consonant-only sequences, vowel-only sequences, randomly deleted character sequences (1-2 characters), and masked syllable sequences (3-10 syllables). The syllable tokenizer, trained using byte-pair encoding, segments text into syllables, with models trained to predict complete sequences from incomplete inputs. Training utilized 40,000 steps with a batch size of 12,000 tokens and a dropout rate of 0.2, evaluating performance using BLEU scores.

## Key Results
- Consonant-only inputs achieved high BLEU scores (62.65-99.87), demonstrating critical importance for syllable reconstruction
- Vowel-only inputs performed significantly worse (13.62-60.28), confirming consonants carry more predictive information
- Model showed robust performance on partial deletion (BLEU 65.19-99.10) and masked syllable reconstruction (BLEU 64.75-98.89)
- Khmer and Thai achieved highest performance, while Myanmar faced challenges due to complex diacritic systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success stems from the inherent structure of Abugida scripts where consonants serve as syllable nuclei, carrying core semantic and phonetic information. Transformer models excel at capturing long-range dependencies in character sequences, enabling them to reconstruct missing components based on context. The syllable-based tokenization aligns with the linguistic structure of these languages, allowing the model to learn meaningful patterns at the appropriate granularity level.

## Foundational Learning
- **Abugida Scripts**: Syllable-based writing systems where consonants are primary units and vowels are secondary diacritics - needed to understand why consonants dominate prediction accuracy
- **Marian NMT Framework**: Open-source Neural Machine Translation framework using Transformer architecture - needed for model implementation and training
- **BLEU Score**: Bilingual Evaluation Understudy metric measuring translation quality - needed to evaluate reconstruction performance
- **Byte-Pair Encoding**: Compression algorithm for tokenization that merges frequent character pairs - needed for efficient syllable segmentation
- **Transformer Architecture**: Neural network using self-attention mechanisms for sequence modeling - needed for capturing contextual dependencies in incomplete sequences

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Marian NMT -> Transformer Encoder -> Transformer Decoder -> Output Layer

Critical Path:
Input text → Syllable tokenization → Transformer encoder → Self-attention → Decoder attention → Output prediction

Design Tradeoffs:
- Standard Transformer vs. script-specific modifications: Used vanilla architecture for generalization
- Syllable vs. character tokenization: Chose syllable-level to match linguistic structure
- Training data size: Balanced between computational efficiency and model performance

Failure Signatures:
- Low performance on vowel-only inputs indicates model's heavy reliance on consonant information
- Myanmar's lower scores suggest challenges with complex diacritic systems and character ordering

First Experiments:
1. Train baseline model on complete syllable sequences to establish performance ceiling
2. Test consonant-only input reconstruction to verify consonant importance hypothesis
3. Evaluate vowel-only input reconstruction to measure vowel contribution to prediction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent can fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) improve syllable reconstruction performance compared to the standard Transformer architecture used in this study?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states future work could focus on "fine-tuning approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs)."
- Why unresolved: The current study utilized the Marian NMT framework (standard Transformers), leaving the potential of pre-trained LLMs unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative benchmarks showing BLEU scores of fine-tuned LLMs versus the current Marian models on the same reconstruction tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does explicitly modeling specific syllable formation information, such as left/right vowels and stacked consonants, affect reconstruction accuracy?
- Basis in paper: The authors note the study "did not explore syllable sequence prediction with specific syllable formation information."
- Why unresolved: The current methodology treats syllables as generalized units, potentially overlooking structural cues unique to Abugida scripts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies where the model is trained and evaluated on datasets annotated with fine-grained syllable component features.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the observed performance on the Wikinews-based ALT dataset generalize to other linguistic domains and vocabulary distributions?
- Basis in paper: The authors cite the "relatively small corpus... from the news domain" as a limitation regarding generalizability.
- Why unresolved: News text has specific stylistic properties; model robustness on conversational, literary, or technical Abugida text remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the trained models on out-of-domain test sets from diverse sources (e.g., social media, literature).

## Limitations
- Focus on syllable-based prediction without considering morpheme-level modeling, which may be more appropriate for morphologically complex languages
- Reliance on a single dataset (Asian Language Treebank) raises questions about generalizability across different text genres and domains
- Does not address potential biases in the training data or examine how script-specific features might affect model performance

## Confidence
- High confidence: Consonant importance claim is strongly supported by substantial performance gap between consonant-only (BLEU 62.65-99.87) and vowel-only (BLEU 13.62-60.28) inputs
- Medium confidence: Model's robustness claims are supported but limited by evaluation scope and lack of naturalistic error testing
- Medium confidence: Myanmar's challenges finding is partially supported but lacks detailed technical analysis of contributing factors

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on out-of-domain data to assess generalization beyond the Asian Language Treebank, including social media text, literature, and technical documents
2. Implement morpheme-level modeling to compare against the current syllable-based approach and evaluate whether this improves performance for morphologically complex languages
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of specific architectural choices (attention mechanisms, positional encoding) on script-specific features and character-level patterns
