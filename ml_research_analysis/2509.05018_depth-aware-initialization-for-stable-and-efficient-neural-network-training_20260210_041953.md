# Depth-Aware Initialization for Stable and Efficient Neural Network Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05018
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05018
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: A depth-aware weight initialization method that scales layer-wise variance based on depth, improving training stability in deep fully connected networks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel depth-aware initialization method for neural networks that addresses the vanishing gradient problem in deep architectures. The key innovation is incorporating each layer's depth information when initializing weights, with earlier layers receiving smaller variance and deeper layers receiving larger variance. The method introduces a flexible hyperparameter K that controls how weights are scaled based on layer depth. Experimental results on a 54-layer fully connected network with CIFAR-10 demonstrate superior performance compared to standard He and Xavier initialization schemes, particularly for uniform weight distributions where He initialization fails.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces a depth-wise initialization function that scales weights based on layer depth using a hyperparameter K. Three cases are studied: constant variance across all layers, increasing variance with depth, and decreasing variance with depth. The initialization scales weights such that earlier layers have smaller variance while deeper layers have larger variance, addressing the vanishing gradient problem. The method works with both normal and uniform weight distributions, providing flexibility in network variance management through the K parameter.

## Key Results
- The depth-aware initialization method outperforms standard He and Xavier initialization on a 54-layer fully connected network trained on CIFAR-10
- The method demonstrates superior performance across different weight distribution types (normal and uniform), while standard He initialization stalls with uniform distribution
- The hyperparameter K provides a flexible way to manage network variance, addressing both vanishing and exploding gradient problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly incorporating layer depth information into the initialization process. In deep networks, the gradient flow is heavily influenced by the variance of weights at different depths. By scaling the variance of weights according to layer depth, the method ensures that deeper layers have appropriately larger variance to maintain gradient flow, while earlier layers have controlled variance to prevent exploding gradients. This depth-aware scaling creates a more balanced gradient propagation path throughout the network, leading to more stable training dynamics.

## Foundational Learning

**Weight Initialization Theory**
*Why needed:* Understanding how initial weight values affect gradient flow and training stability in deep networks
*Quick check:* Verify that weight variance affects the magnitude of backpropagated gradients through multiple layers

**Vanishing/Exploding Gradient Problems**
*Why needed:* These are fundamental challenges in training deep networks that the method specifically addresses
*Quick check:* Confirm that gradient magnitudes either decay exponentially or grow uncontrollably in very deep networks with standard initialization

**Variance Propagation in Deep Networks**
*Why needed:* The method relies on controlling variance propagation across layers
*Quick check:* Validate that the product of weight variances across layers determines the overall gradient magnitude

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input -> Depth-Aware Initialization (scales weights by layer depth) -> Forward Pass -> Loss Calculation -> Backpropagation (improved gradient flow)

**Critical Path**
The critical path is the initialization step where weights are scaled based on layer depth before training begins. This single modification to the standard initialization process creates the foundation for improved training dynamics throughout the network.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The method introduces a hyperparameter K that requires tuning for optimal performance, adding complexity compared to standard initialization schemes. However, this flexibility allows for better adaptation to different network depths and architectures. The trade-off is between initialization simplicity and training stability/performance.

**Failure Signatures**
The method may fail when K is poorly chosen, leading to either insufficient gradient flow (if K is too small) or exploding gradients (if K is too large). Additionally, the method's benefits may be less pronounced in shallower networks where gradient issues are less severe.

**First Experiments**
1. Compare training curves of standard He initialization vs. depth-aware initialization on a deep (50+ layer) fully connected network
2. Test both normal and uniform weight distributions to verify the method's claimed robustness
3. Perform ablation studies varying the hyperparameter K to identify optimal configurations for different network depths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental scope is limited to a single 54-layer fully connected network architecture on CIFAR-10, limiting generalizability
- Performance comparisons are restricted to only two baseline initialization methods (He and Xavier)
- The paper does not address computational overhead during training or explore behavior across different learning rates, optimizers, or batch sizes
- Theoretical justification for why depth-aware initialization improves training stability is not rigorously derived

## Confidence
- High confidence in experimental results showing improved training stability and convergence
- Medium confidence in claims about method's effectiveness across diverse architectures and tasks
- High confidence in the method's ability to work with both normal and uniform weight distributions

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the depth-aware initialization across diverse architectures including CNNs, ResNets, and transformers on multiple benchmark datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, etc.) to assess generalizability
2. Compare performance against a broader set of modern initialization methods, including those specifically designed for transformers and large language models
3. Conduct ablation studies varying the hyperparameter K systematically and analyzing its impact on different depth ranges to provide guidance on optimal configuration selection
