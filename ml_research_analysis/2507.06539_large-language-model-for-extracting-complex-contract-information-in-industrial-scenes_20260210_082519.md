# Large Language Model for Extracting Complex Contract Information in Industrial Scenes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06539
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06539
- Authors: Yunyang Cao; Yanjun Li; Silong Dai
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: Proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios using LLM fine-tuning with clustering, GPT-based annotation, and data augmentation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of extracting complex contract information in industrial scenarios by proposing a comprehensive methodology that combines cluster analysis of industrial contract texts with large language model fine-tuning. The approach leverages GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for high-quality data annotation and employs data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness. The resulting system demonstrates excellent performance in terms of field recall, precision, and parsing efficiency while providing a novel solution for industrial contract information extraction tasks.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves clustering industrial contract texts to identify distinct categories, then using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 to extract key information from original contract data to generate high-quality annotations. Data augmentation is achieved by constructing new texts and using GPT-3.5 to generate unstructured contract texts from randomly combined keywords. The large language model is fine-tuned on this high-quality dataset using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques, data balancing, and augmentation strategies to enhance accuracy and robustness.

## Key Results
- Achieves excellent overall performance in industrial contract information extraction
- Ensures high field recall and precision while maintaining parsing efficiency
- Demonstrates that LoRA, data balancing, and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by combining domain-specific clustering to identify contract patterns with advanced LLM capabilities for annotation generation. By using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for annotation, the method leverages their superior understanding of complex contractual language and relationships. The data augmentation strategy using randomly combined keywords creates synthetic training examples that improve model generalization and robustness to variations in contract formats and terminology.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cluster Analysis**: Needed to identify distinct contract categories and patterns in industrial domains; quick check: verify clusters align with known industrial contract types
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: Required to efficiently adapt large language models to specific contract extraction tasks; quick check: compare LoRA parameters against full fine-tuning efficiency
- **Data Augmentation**: Essential for improving model robustness and handling edge cases; quick check: measure performance variance across augmented vs. original datasets
- **GPT-based Annotation**: Leverages advanced language understanding for high-quality label generation; quick check: assess annotation consistency across multiple GPT runs
- **Contract Information Extraction**: Core task requiring understanding of complex legal and technical terminology; quick check: validate extracted fields against ground truth contracts
- **Industrial Domain Knowledge**: Critical for handling specialized terminology and contract structures; quick check: test model performance across different industrial sectors

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Contract Data -> Cluster Analysis -> GPT-4/GPT-3.5 Annotation -> Data Augmentation -> LoRA Fine-tuning -> Extracted Information

**Critical Path**: Cluster Analysis identifies contract categories → GPT models generate annotations → Data augmentation creates synthetic examples → LoRA fine-tuning adapts model → Extraction pipeline processes new contracts

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses GPT models for annotation (high quality but computationally expensive) vs. human annotation (accurate but time-consuming); employs LoRA instead of full fine-tuning (parameter-efficient but potentially limited adaptation)

**Failure Signatures**: Poor cluster quality leads to misaligned training data; inadequate data augmentation results in overfitting to specific contract formats; insufficient LoRA adaptation causes model to retain general rather than domain-specific knowledge

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Run cluster analysis on sample contract dataset and visualize resulting categories
2. Generate annotations using GPT-4 on 100 sample contracts and measure consistency
3. Apply LoRA fine-tuning on small subset and compare against baseline LLM performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on proprietary industrial datasets without clear details about composition or domain diversity
- Uses GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for annotation without inter-annotator agreement metrics or human validation results
- Data augmentation method raises concerns about synthetic data accurately reflecting real contract complexity and variation

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The general framework combining clustering, LLM-based annotation, and LoRA fine-tuning is methodologically sound and represents a valid approach to contract information extraction

**Medium confidence**: The reported improvements in field recall, precision, and parsing efficiency are likely real but may be dataset-specific rather than generalizable

**Low confidence**: Claims about "excellent overall performance" and specific quantitative metrics are difficult to verify without detailed experimental results and comparison baselines

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing LoRA, data balancing, and augmentation components to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains
2. Evaluate model performance across multiple industrial domains (manufacturing, energy, logistics) to test generalizability beyond the training corpus
3. Perform human-in-the-loop validation comparing LLM-generated annotations against expert-annotated contracts to establish upper bounds on achievable accuracy
