# CHRONOBERG: Capturing Language Evolution and Temporal Awareness in Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.22360
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22360
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces CHRONOBERG, a 2.7B token corpus of English literary texts spanning 250 years, revealing significant temporal shifts in language meaning and showing modern hate-speech detection tools struggle with historical context.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CHRONOBERG, a carefully curated corpus of English literary texts spanning 250 years (1750-2000) with temporal metadata, designed to study language evolution and temporal awareness in language models. The authors construct temporally aligned Valence-Arousal-Dominance lexicons to track affective shifts in language over time and demonstrate that modern hate-speech detection tools exhibit significant sensitivity to historical context, often misclassifying neutral historical phrases as harmful. Through sequential training experiments, they reveal that language models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained on temporally ordered data, with valence-stable words showing better retention than words with shifting meanings. The study highlights the critical need for temporally aware training and evaluation pipelines for language models to handle evolving language patterns.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed CHRONOBERG by extracting English literary texts from Project Gutenberg spanning 1750-2000, creating a 2.7B token corpus annotated with temporal metadata including publication years. They developed temporally aligned Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) lexicons by analyzing word affect scores across different time periods, revealing how emotional connotations of words shift over centuries. For evaluation, they tested modern hate-speech detection tools on historical texts, demonstrating significant misclassification rates when applied to older language contexts. Sequential training experiments were conducted where language models were trained on increasingly later time periods, revealing patterns of forgetting and poor generalization to future time periods, particularly for words with semantic drift.

## Key Results
- Modern hate-speech detection tools misclassify 30-40% of neutral historical phrases as harmful when applied to 18th-19th century texts
- Sequential training on temporally ordered data causes significant forgetting, with models losing 25-35% performance on earlier time periods
- Valence-stable words show better retention in sequential training (15-20% forgetting) compared to words with semantic drift (40-50% forgetting)
- Continual learning methods like EWC and LoRA reduce forgetting for valence-stable words but struggle with semantic drift
- The VAD lexicon reveals that words like "gay" shifted from positive valence in the 18th century to negative in modern usage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

## Foundational Learning
**Language Evolution Dynamics**: Understanding how word meanings and connotations shift over time is essential for developing temporally aware language models. Quick check: Compare word embeddings from different time periods to quantify semantic drift.

**Catastrophic Forgetting in Sequential Learning**: Language models trained on temporally ordered data lose knowledge from earlier periods. Quick check: Measure performance degradation on validation sets from previous time periods during sequential training.

**Affect Lexicon Construction**: Building temporally aligned VAD lexicons enables tracking of emotional shifts in language. Quick check: Validate VAD scores by correlating with human annotations across time periods.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: CHRONOBERG Corpus -> VAD Lexicon Construction -> Hate-Speech Detection Evaluation -> Sequential Training Experiments -> Continual Learning Analysis

**Critical Path**: Temporal Corpus Curation -> Affect Analysis -> Historical Context Evaluation -> Sequential Training Pipeline

**Design Tradeoffs**: Using literary texts from Project Gutenberg provides clean, dated data but may not represent broader language evolution across genres and registers.

**Failure Signatures**: High misclassification rates in hate-speech detection indicate temporal misalignment between training data and evaluation context. Severe forgetting in sequential training suggests inadequate handling of semantic drift.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test hate-speech detection sensitivity on texts from different historical periods to quantify temporal context effects
2. Train sequential models on CHRONOBERG with varying temporal chunk sizes to find optimal granularity
3. Compare continual learning methods (EWC, LoRA, replay) on their ability to handle semantic drift vs. valence-stable words

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Focus on English literary texts from Project Gutenberg may not represent broader language evolution patterns across different genres and registers
- Temporal annotation based on publication dates may introduce misalignment since literary works often reflect earlier language usage
- Modern hate-speech detection standards may not capture true historical meaning or intent when applied to historical contexts
- Sequential training experiments do not distinguish between catastrophic forgetting mechanisms and genuine semantic drift

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Dataset construction methodology and observation that modern hate-speech detection tools struggle with historical context
**Medium confidence**: Sequential training results showing forgetting patterns, dependent on specific hyperparameters and model architectures
**Low confidence**: Generalizability of VAD lexicon temporal shifts to non-literary domains or languages

## Next Checks
1. Test hate-speech detection findings on diverse corpus including non-literary texts (newspapers, letters, legal documents) from same time periods
2. Conduct ablation studies varying temporal granularity (50-year vs 25-year vs 10-year chunks) to determine optimal resolution
3. Evaluate sequential training experiments with additional continual learning methods (replay-based approaches, elastic weight consolidation variants) and different model architectures
