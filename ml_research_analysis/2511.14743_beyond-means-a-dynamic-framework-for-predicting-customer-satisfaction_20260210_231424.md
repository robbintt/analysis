# Beyond Means: A Dynamic Framework for Predicting Customer Satisfaction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.14743
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14743
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: GP framework reduces MAE by 10.2% over sample mean on 121,123 Yelp ratings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Gaussian process framework to improve customer satisfaction prediction by dynamically capturing time-varying quality and incorporating review heterogeneity variables such as sentiment, helpfulness, and reviewer experience. Traditional sample mean methods are slow to adapt to quality changes and ignore review heterogeneity. The proposed model outperforms the sample mean and common ML baselines (LSTMs, transformers) across restaurant, hotel, and app rating datasets, offering practical implications for more adaptive and accurate aggregated rating scores.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a Gaussian process framework that models customer satisfaction ratings as a function of time-varying quality and review heterogeneity variables. The model captures temporal dynamics through kernel functions while incorporating covariates like sentiment scores, helpfulness votes, and reviewer experience. Two estimation strategies are presented: full MCMC for uncertainty quantification and variational inference for scalable deployment. The framework addresses the limitations of static sample mean aggregation by adapting to quality changes and leveraging review metadata to improve prediction accuracy.

## Key Results
- GP framework reduces mean absolute error by 10.2% compared to sample mean on 121,123 Yelp ratings
- Model outperforms common ML baselines including LSTMs and transformers across multiple domains
- Consistent improvements observed across different restaurant rating volumes and variations, validated on hotel and app datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by explicitly modeling the temporal dynamics of service quality and incorporating heterogeneous review characteristics that traditional aggregation methods ignore. The Gaussian process framework naturally captures non-linear temporal patterns and uncertainty, while the inclusion of review heterogeneity variables (sentiment, helpfulness, reviewer experience) provides additional predictive signal that static averages miss.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gaussian Processes**: Probabilistic models for regression that capture uncertainty and non-linear relationships - needed for modeling time-varying quality with confidence intervals
- **Temporal Kernel Functions**: Mathematical functions that encode temporal dependencies in data - needed to capture how quality evolves over time
- **Review Heterogeneity Variables**: Metadata about reviews including sentiment, helpfulness, and reviewer experience - needed to account for review quality variation
- **Variational Inference**: Approximate Bayesian inference method for scalable model estimation - needed for deployment on large datasets
- **MCMC vs Variational Tradeoffs**: Full MCMC provides better uncertainty quantification but is computationally expensive compared to variational methods
- **Rating Aggregation Bias**: Traditional sample means are slow to adapt to quality changes and ignore review quality variation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Ratings -> Feature Extraction -> GP Model (Temporal + Heterogeneity) -> Aggregated Prediction

**Critical Path**: Review ingestion → Feature engineering (sentiment, helpfulness, experience) → GP kernel construction → Posterior inference (MCMC/Variational) → Aggregated score output

**Design Tradeoffs**: MCMC provides full uncertainty quantification but scales poorly; variational inference enables large-scale deployment but sacrifices some uncertainty information. The choice of kernel functions balances expressiveness with computational tractability.

**Failure Signatures**: Model may underperform when temporal patterns are weak or when review heterogeneity variables are not predictive. Computational bottlenecks occur with full MCMC on very large datasets.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare GP predictions against sample mean baseline on a held-out test set
2. Evaluate sensitivity of predictions to different kernel function choices
3. Test scalability limits of variational inference vs MCMC on increasing dataset sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond tested domains (restaurants, hotels, apps) remains uncertain
- Does not benchmark against recent specialized rating prediction architectures
- Computational complexity of full MCMC may limit real-time deployment despite variational inference alternative

## Confidence

**High**: Core GP framework performance claims (10.2% MAE reduction, superiority over baselines)
**Medium**: Cross-domain generalizability, computational scalability for production systems

## Next Checks

1. Test the GP framework on additional domains (e.g., retail products, professional services) to assess cross-category performance and identify domain-specific limitations.

2. Compare the GP model against recent specialized rating prediction architectures and evaluate performance trade-offs in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

3. Conduct A/B testing in a live production environment to measure the impact of dynamic rating aggregation on customer behavior, including review submission patterns and overall satisfaction metrics.
