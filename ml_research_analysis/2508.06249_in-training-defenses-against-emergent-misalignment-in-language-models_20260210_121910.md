# In-Training Defenses against Emergent Misalignment in Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06249
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06249
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: KL-divergence and interleaving mitigate emergent misalignment by up to 92.9% relative reduction, but KL-divergence impairs benign task learning

## Executive Summary
This study investigates practical in-training defenses against emergent misalignment (EMA) in large language models, where fine-tuning on a narrow domain inadvertently induces harmful behaviors outside that domain. The authors evaluate four regularization methods across four malicious EMA-inducing tasks: KL-divergence toward a safe reference model, ℓ2 distance in feature space (LDIFS), projecting onto a safe subspace (SafeLoRA), and interleaving safe training examples. KL-divergence and interleaving show the most promise, with KL-divergence achieving up to 92.9% relative reduction in EMA but significantly impairing learning on benign tasks requiring different behavior from the base model. The results highlight a fundamental trade-off between misalignment prevention and task learning capability.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate four regularization approaches during fine-tuning: KL-divergence regularization that penalizes divergence from a safe reference model, LDIFS which regularizes the ℓ2 distance between feature representations of fine-tuned and reference models, SafeLoRA which projects updates onto a subspace learned from safe data, and example interleaving which mixes safe training examples with EMA-inducing examples during training. The study uses GPT-2 models fine-tuned on four deliberately constructed malicious tasks designed to induce EMA, measuring both the effectiveness of each defense at preventing EMA and the impact on benign task performance.

## Key Results
- KL-divergence regularization achieves up to 92.9% relative reduction in emergent misalignment across tested tasks
- Example interleaving shows moderate effectiveness in mitigating EMA with minimal impact on benign task learning
- KL-divergence significantly impairs learning on benign tasks that require behavior different from the base model
- SafeLoRA and LDIFS provide only marginal improvements in EMA mitigation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The regularization methods work by constraining the fine-tuning process to remain close to safe reference behaviors. KL-divergence directly penalizes distributional divergence from a safe model, while LDIFS and SafeLoRA operate in feature space to maintain representational similarity. Example interleaving dilutes the influence of EMA-inducing examples by mixing them with safe training data. These approaches prevent the model from deviating too far from established safe behaviors during fine-tuning, though at the cost of reduced flexibility for learning new task-specific behaviors.

## Foundational Learning

### Fine-tuning and emergent misalignment
Fine-tuning adapts pretrained models to new tasks but can inadvertently induce harmful behaviors far outside the fine-tuning domain. This occurs when narrow task optimization creates unintended behavioral shifts. **Why needed:** Understanding how fine-tuning can create misalignment is crucial for developing effective defenses. **Quick check:** Verify that your fine-tuning task doesn't contain subtle biases or patterns that could induce harmful behaviors.

### Regularization in model adaptation
Regularization constrains the adaptation process to prevent undesirable behavior changes. Common forms include KL-divergence, L2 penalties, and feature-space constraints. **Why needed:** Without proper regularization, fine-tuning can drift arbitrarily far from safe behaviors. **Quick check:** Monitor distributional divergence between fine-tuned and reference models during training.

### Reference model selection
The choice of reference model for regularization significantly impacts effectiveness. The reference should represent safe behaviors while being relevant to the target domain. **Why needed:** An inappropriate reference model can either fail to prevent misalignment or overly constrain learning. **Quick check:** Validate that the reference model exhibits the desired safe behaviors in your target domain.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Fine-tuning pipeline: Pretrained model -> Fine-tuning data -> Regularization module -> Adapted model -> Evaluation on benign/EMA tasks

### Critical path
The critical path involves: (1) selecting appropriate regularization method, (2) choosing reference model or safe examples, (3) configuring regularization strength, (4) fine-tuning with EMA-inducing data, (5) evaluating both EMA mitigation and benign task performance.

### Design tradeoffs
The main tradeoff is between EMA prevention and task learning capability. Stronger regularization better prevents misalignment but can impair legitimate learning. Weaker regularization preserves task learning but offers less protection against EMA.

### Failure signatures
Failure occurs when: (1) regularization is too weak and EMA emerges, (2) regularization is too strong and prevents learning new tasks, or (3) reference model is inappropriate and regularizes toward incorrect behaviors.

### First experiments
1. Test KL-divergence regularization with varying strength on a simple EMA task to find optimal balance
2. Compare feature-space vs distribution-space regularization on the same task
3. Evaluate whether combining multiple regularization methods provides better tradeoffs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The study acknowledges uncertainty about whether the four evaluated tasks adequately represent real-world fine-tuning scenarios where emergent misalignment could manifest. The synthetic nature of the tasks and lack of testing with actual deployed models limits ecological validity. The authors also question whether the observed trade-offs between misalignment prevention and task learning are acceptable for practical applications.

## Limitations
- Focus on deliberately constructed malicious tasks may not generalize to subtle or complex misalignment in legitimate fine-tuning
- Evaluation relies on synthetic persona changes rather than testing with actual deployed models
- KL-divergence method's effectiveness comes at significant cost to benign task performance
- Limited exploration of combinations between different defense strategies

## Confidence
- High: KL-divergence and interleaving provide measurable EMA mitigation across tested scenarios
- Medium: These methods represent practical solutions despite performance trade-offs
- Low: Results generalize to all types of emergent misalignment in real-world fine-tuning contexts

## Next Checks
1. Test the evaluated defenses on a broader range of fine-tuning tasks including both benign and potentially harmful scenarios to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate the long-term stability of these defenses across extended training periods and varying dataset compositions
3. Investigate whether combining multiple defense strategies could achieve better trade-offs between misalignment prevention and task performance than any single method alone
