# Fostering Video Reasoning via Next-Event Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.22457
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22457
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces Next-Event Prediction (NEP), a self-supervised learning task that improves temporal reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by predicting future video events from past frames.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Next-Event Prediction (NEP), a self-supervised learning task that improves temporal reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by predicting future video events from past frames. The authors construct V1-33K, a dataset of 33,000 video segments, and introduce FutureBench to evaluate models' ability to forecast unseen future events. Experimental results show that NEP significantly enhances performance on temporal benchmarks (e.g., 67.6% accuracy on FutureBench 1-hop vs. 56.1% for the baseline) without compromising general video understanding, outperforming traditional video instruction-tuning tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce Next-Event Prediction (NEP) as a self-supervised video reasoning task. They construct V1-33K, a dataset of 33,000 video segments, using a 4-stage pipeline: Fact Translation (VLM captioning), Analysis (LLM scene/split identification), Segmentation, and Reasoning & Critique (DeepSeek-R1 predictions). The task involves predicting future event summaries given only past video frames. Models are trained using standard sequence-to-sequence objectives and evaluated on FutureBench (1-hop/2-hop/3-hop) and general video understanding benchmarks. The authors compare NEP against traditional video instruction-tuning tasks and different training strategies (SFT, GRPO, CFT, Distill, Mix).

## Key Results
- NEP-trained models achieve 67.6% accuracy on FutureBench 1-hop vs 56.1% for baseline
- NEP outperforms traditional video instruction-tuning tasks on temporal benchmarks
- GRPO RL training improves FutureBench scores (83.8%) but degrades general benchmark performance (58.2% vs 59.7% G-Avg)
- NEP improves deductive reasoning performance (38.6/74.7/39.5/61.3) compared to inductive (36.6/74.0/35.4/58.8) and abductive tasks (38.0/66.2/31.2/55.1)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Forced Temporal Inference from Partial Observation
Withholding future frames creates training pressure for causal reasoning rather than mere description. The model receives V≤t (past frames) and must predict Y (future event summary). Since visual cues alone rarely explicitly indicate future outcomes, the model must hypothesize plausible scenarios based on observed context. If training data contains shortcuts where future events are trivially predictable from single frames, the causal reasoning pressure diminishes.

### Mechanism 2: Integration of Visual Perception with Commonsense Knowledge
NEP requires fusing observed visual facts with pretrained world knowledge (physics, social norms, human behaviors). The model extracts visual facts (positions, movements, interactions), then systematically hypothesizes potential futures by consulting internalized knowledge about cause-effect relationships. If the vision encoder fails to extract task-relevant features, or if the LLM lacks domain-specific knowledge, predictions default to generic guesses.

### Mechanism 3: Deductive Reasoning as Superior Training Signal
Deductive prediction (NEP) outperforms inductive (video Q&A) and abductive (previous-event prediction) tasks for temporal reasoning. Deduction requires deliberate application of abstract logical principles, which is more cognitively demanding and benefits more from structured training. If the evaluation benchmarks conflate deduction with memorization, observed gains may not reflect true reasoning improvements.

## Foundational Learning

- **Video frame encoding in MLLMs**: Why needed here: NEP requires extracting features from V≤t before prediction. Understanding how vision encoders (e.g., CLIP-based) map frames to tokens is essential. Quick check: Can you explain how a video is tokenized differently from a single image in architectures like LLaVA-Video?

- **Cross-entropy language modeling loss**: Why needed here: NEP is trained as sequence-to-sequence prediction with standard next-token cross-entropy. Understanding teacher forcing vs. autoregressive generation matters for debugging. Quick check: Why might a model achieve low training loss but still produce incoherent future predictions?

- **Instruction tuning vs. pre-training objectives**: Why needed here: NEP is an instruction-tuning task, not a pre-training objective. The paper compares it against captioning, MCQA, OEQA—understanding the distinction helps interpret results. Quick check: What is the difference between next-token prediction (pre-training) and next-event prediction (instruction tuning)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Video → Vision Encoder → Projector → LLM Decoder → Text prediction
- **Critical path**: Video → VLM caption (Fact Translation) → Caption → LLM identifies scenes and split point (Analysis) → Split video + caption at optimal point (Segmentation) → First-part caption → Reasoning model generates prediction + critique (Reasoning & Critique) → Train MLLM to predict future events given first-part video
- **Design tradeoffs**: SFT vs. RL (SFT is simple and stable; GRPO achieves higher FutureBench scores but degrades general benchmarks), data scale (scaling beyond 5K samples shows diminishing returns), automatic vs. human annotation (scalable but may inherit captioning model biases)
- **Failure signatures**: Reward hacking (RL) where model exploits lexical similarity between options and questions instead of genuine reasoning, generalization collapse where RL-trained models degrade on non-temporal benchmarks, distribution shift where large-scale NEP training alone causes deviation from balanced understanding
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison: Train Qwen2.5-VL-7B on NEP vs. Captioning/MCQA/OEQA, 2) Training strategy ablation: Compare SFT, CFT, Distill, Mix, 3) Data scale sweep: Train with 1K, 3K, 5K, 10K, 25K samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can reinforcement learning (RL) training strategies be modified to retain the significant gains in temporal reasoning observed in FutureBench without causing degradation in general video understanding capabilities? The paper identifies this trade-off but does not propose a solution to mitigate the negative impact of RL on general capabilities or the observed "reward hacking." Evidence would be a training run using a modified RL objective or regularization technique that achieves high FutureBench scores (e.g., >80% on 1-hop) while maintaining or improving the baseline general benchmark average (e.g., >60.3 G-Avg).

### Open Question 2
What specific data mixtures or curriculum strategies are necessary to prevent the performance degradation observed when scaling NEP training data beyond 5,000 samples? The paper identifies the scaling bottleneck but leaves the specific solution—how to construct the right mixture or selection of data to avoid diminishing returns—as an open challenge. Evidence would be an experiment demonstrating consistent performance improvements on both temporal and general benchmarks when scaling NEP data to 15K or 25K samples using a specific data mixing or selection strategy.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does the reliance on automatically generated captions for supervision limit the precision of the model's future predictions compared to human-annotated ground truths? The authors use auto-captions for scalability but do not quantify the performance gap or "noise" introduced by this choice compared to human-level supervision. Evidence would be a comparative study evaluating NEP models trained on a human-annotated subset versus the auto-generated V1-33K to quantify the difference in temporal reasoning accuracy and hallucination rates.

### Open Question 4
How does the integration of Next-Event Prediction with other video instruction-tuning tasks (like Q&A or Captioning) affect the overall state-of-the-art performance on comprehensive video benchmarks? The paper compares tasks individually and suggests that future research "could benefit from exploring combined instruction-tuning data strategies" to achieve SOTA performance. Evidence would be results from a model trained on a merged dataset (e.g., V1-33K + Video-178K) showing whether the strengths of NEP (temporal reasoning) and standard tuning (spatial perception) are additive.

## Limitations

- The evaluation methodology presents critical limitations including unknown domain alignment between FutureBench and V1-33K's training distribution
- The RL results show concerning generalization degradation where GRPO achieves higher FutureBench scores but causes measurable drops on general benchmarks
- The dataset construction pipeline is entirely automated, inheriting potential biases from underlying captioning and reasoning models without human validation

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The empirical finding that NEP improves temporal reasoning compared to traditional video instruction-tuning tasks. The quantitative results on FutureBench and temporal benchmarks are well-documented and reproducible.

**Medium confidence**: The mechanism explanations for why NEP works. While the authors provide reasonable hypotheses about forced temporal inference and knowledge integration, these are primarily theoretical and lack direct experimental validation.

**Low confidence**: The superiority of deductive reasoning over inductive/abductive tasks for temporal reasoning. This claim relies on a single table comparison without controlling for other variables like data distribution or prompt quality.

## Next Checks

1. **Distribution shift validation**: Test Qwen2.5-VL-7B-NEP on a held-out subset of FutureBench that was explicitly excluded from any overlap with V1-33K's source domains to confirm whether performance gains reflect genuine reasoning improvements versus memorization of similar patterns.

2. **Knowledge integration ablation**: Train identical models on: (a) NEP with full captions, (b) NEP with captions filtered to remove commonsense knowledge, (c) standard video captioning. Compare temporal reasoning performance to isolate the contribution of world knowledge integration.

3. **Generalization stress test**: Evaluate the GRPO-trained model on a temporal reasoning task that requires zero-shot transfer to a novel domain (e.g., predicting events in medical procedure videos or industrial process monitoring) to reveal whether RL-induced temporal gains transfer beyond the training distribution.
