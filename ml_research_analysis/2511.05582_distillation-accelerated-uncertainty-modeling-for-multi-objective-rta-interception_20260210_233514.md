# Distillation-Accelerated Uncertainty Modeling for Multi-Objective RTA Interception

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.05582
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05582
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Key outcome:** DAUM improves RTA interception prediction performance and inference efficiency by leveraging uncertainty transfer from balanced to imbalanced tasks, with a distilled model achieving 10x faster inference while maintaining accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses uncertainty modeling challenges in Real-Time Auction Interception where severe label imbalance causes standard uncertainty measures to misclassify confident predictions as uncertain. The authors propose DAUM, which combines multi-objective learning with uncertainty modeling, using uncertainty estimates from balanced metrics to guide decisions on imbalanced ones. By collecting weight trajectories during training and applying knowledge distillation, DAUM achieves both accurate uncertainty estimation and efficient real-time inference, demonstrated through significant speed improvements while maintaining predictive performance on JD advertisement data.

## Method Summary
DAUM integrates multi-objective learning with uncertainty modeling by leveraging task correlations and weight-based uncertainty estimation. The framework trains a multi-task model using Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE) with four objectives, collects weight samples during training to build SWAG statistics, and uses uncertainty from balanced metrics to guide decisions on imbalanced ones. A distilled student model is then trained to simultaneously learn classification labels and uncertainty values, enabling single-pass inference with uncertainty estimation. The system applies an uncertainty threshold to determine whether to pass traffic for further processing or classify directly.

## Key Results
- DAUM improves predictive performance on 7 out of 8 metrics compared to baseline uncertainty modeling
- The distilled model achieves 10x inference speedup (17.9 ms vs 181.6 ms per iteration)
- Uncertainty estimation capabilities are preserved in the distilled model while maintaining similar accuracy levels
- Using balanced metric uncertainty (C2S click) to guide imbalanced metric (deal) decisions shows improved performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Task Uncertainty Transfer via Correlation
- **Claim:** Uncertainty estimates from label-balanced tasks can substitute for unreliable uncertainty estimates on label-imbalanced tasks when tasks are correlated.
- **Mechanism:** Standard uncertainty modeling assumes predictions cluster around 0.5 for ambiguous samples. Under severe imbalance (e.g., deal conversion rate ≪ 1%), models systematically predict near the base rate π, not 0.5, causing the 0.5-reference to misclassify confident predictions as uncertain. By leveraging correlation between balanced metrics (C2S click) and imbalanced metrics (deal), uncertainty from the balanced task transfers to guide passing decisions on the imbalanced task.
- **Core assumption:** Task correlation exists between balanced and imbalanced objectives; uncertainty patterns are shared across correlated tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section III-C] discusses limitations of standard uncertainty under class imbalance; [Section III-D] explains replacing biased uncertainty from imbalanced metrics with accurate uncertainty from balanced metrics.

### Mechanism 2: SWAG-based Weight Distribution Uncertainty
- **Claim:** Collecting weight trajectories during training and sampling from the resulting Gaussian approximation enables efficient epistemic uncertainty estimation without ensembling multiple models.
- **Mechanism:** During training, collect weights from the last k epochs. Construct diagonal covariance Σ_diag and low-rank deviation matrix D. At inference, sample weights via: w_k = μ_SWAG + (1/√2)Σ^(1/2)_diag·ζ_1 + (1/√2)D·ζ_2, where ζ are standard Gaussian vectors. Variance across M forward passes with sampled weights estimates uncertainty.
- **Core assumption:** Weight trajectory approximates a Gaussian posterior; the optimization path captures meaningful uncertainty.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section III-D, Eq. 29] provides explicit SWAG sampling formula; [Section IV-B] shows DAUM outperforms in 7 out of 8 metrics.

### Mechanism 3: Dual-Objective Distillation with Variance Regression
- **Claim:** A student model can simultaneously learn classification labels and uncertainty values from a teacher, preserving passing capability while eliminating repeated inference.
- **Mechanism:** Train student with two outputs: (1) classification head learns true labels, (2) regression head learns teacher's variance output. Rescale uncertainty labels to match classification loss magnitude, preventing domination. Student performs single forward pass, outputting both prediction and uncertainty estimate.
- **Core assumption:** Uncertainty can be treated as a learnable regression target; distribution shape (especially high-uncertainty tail) transfers through distillation.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section III-E] describes the dual-objective submodel; [Section IV-D, Figure 5] shows the distilled model preserves the overall distributional pattern on the test dataset.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bayesian Neural Networks & Variational Inference**
  - **Why needed here:** SWAG is a practical approximation to full BNN inference. Understanding that weights are treated as distributions (not point estimates) explains why sampling produces variance.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why sampling weights multiple times produces different outputs for the same input?

- **Concept: Multi-Task Learning with Expert Sharing (PLE/MMoE)**
  - **Why needed here:** DAUM builds on PLE (Progressive Layered Extraction). Understanding shared experts vs. task-specific experts explains how task correlation is captured.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to task-specific performance if shared experts are too dominant?

- **Concept: Label Imbalance Effects on Calibration**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's core insight is that standard uncertainty assumes balanced priors. Understanding how imbalance shifts predictions (toward base rate π) clarifies why 0.5-reference fails.
  - **Quick check question:** If positive rate is 1%, what does a prediction of 0.5 actually indicate about model confidence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input Features (108 dims) -> Shared Backbone (Transformer + Expert Gates) -> Task-Specific Towers (4 heads: C2S, online, cart, deal) -> [Training Phase] Weight Collection -> SWAG Statistics (μ, Σ_diag, D) -> [Inference Phase A: Full DAUM] M weight samples -> M forward passes -> Mean & Variance -> [Inference Phase B: Distilled] Single forward pass -> Classification + Uncertainty heads -> Passing Decision: if uncertainty > τ -> pass; else -> classify by mean

- **Critical path:**
  1. Train multi-task model for K epochs, collect weights from last k epochs
  2. Compute SWAG statistics (μ_SWAG, Σ_diag, D from deviation vectors)
  3. At inference, decide: use full DAUM (M samples) or distilled model
  4. Apply uncertainty threshold τ to determine passing
  5. For imbalanced tasks, use uncertainty from correlated balanced task

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  | Choice | Benefit | Cost |
  |--------|---------|------|
  | More SWAG samples (M↑) | More stable uncertainty estimate | Linear increase in inference time |
  | Larger k (weight collection epochs) | Better posterior approximation | Risk of including pre-convergence noise |
  | Distillation | 10x faster inference | Potential loss of uncertainty fidelity in tails |
  | Higher passing ratio (τ lower) | More conservative, fewer false blocks | More downstream load, potentially lower precision |

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Uncertainty collapse:** All samples get similar variance → check if SWAG statistics have near-zero covariance
  - **Task interference:** Balanced task performance degrades → expert sharing may be too aggressive
  - **Distillation mismatch:** Student uncertainty distribution shifts significantly from teacher → increase student capacity or adjust loss rescaling
  - **Passing inefficiency:** High passing ratio but no improvement in downstream deals → correlation assumption violated

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate SWAG uncertainty calibration:** On held-out C2S click data, bin samples by predicted uncertainty and measure actual variance in outcomes. Confirm high-uncertainty bins show higher outcome variance.
  2. **Cross-task transfer validation:** For deal prediction, compare (a) passing by deal-uncertainty vs. (b) passing by C2S-uncertainty. Measure total deals passed downstream at fixed passing ratios.
  3. **Distillation fidelity check:** Compare uncertainty distributions (histogram overlap, KL divergence) between teacher DAUM and distilled student on test set. Focus on high-uncertainty tail alignment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the interrelationships among multiple uncertainties derived from multi-objective learning be explicitly modeled to further improve estimation quality in sparse-label settings?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the Conclusion that "Future research could explore the interrelationships among multiple uncertainties derived from multi-objective learning to further improve estimation quality in sparse-label settings."
- **Why unresolved:** The current DAUM framework replaces the uncertainty of sparse metrics (e.g., deal) with that of a balanced metric (e.g., C2S click) rather than modeling the complex interdependencies or joint distribution of uncertainties across all objectives.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A new model architecture or loss function that captures uncertainty correlations, resulting in higher AUC-PR for sparse metrics compared to the current substitution method.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the simple linear rescaling of uncertainty labels (matching means) during distillation result in a loss of information regarding the relative ranking of high-uncertainty samples compared to distribution-matching approaches?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section III.E notes that "we rescale the uncertainty labels so that their mean matches that of the classification labels" to balance loss magnitudes. The paper acknowledges the high-uncertainty region is critical, but does not verify if this specific scaling method degrades the signal in that region compared to more complex alignment techniques.
- **Why unresolved:** While the distilled model preserves the overall distribution pattern, the paper does not ablate whether the simple mean-matching heuristic is optimal for preserving the precise shape of the uncertainty distribution's tail (high uncertainty).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study comparing the proposed mean-matching distillation against KL-divergence or other distribution-matching losses to see which better preserves the teacher model's uncertainty rankings.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the strategy of selecting a specific balanced metric to guide uncertainty for imbalanced metrics be automated or made dynamic based on feature-level correlations?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section IV.C and Figure 4 show that using "C2S click" or "online" uncertainties to pass "deal" traffic yields different results. The paper manually selects C2S click uncertainty for the deal task but does not provide a mechanism for automatically selecting the best source metric or handling scenarios where correlations shift.
- **Why unresolved:** The framework relies on the assumption that a pre-selected balanced metric is sufficiently correlated with the sparse metric, but it lacks a dynamic routing or weighting mechanism to validate or adapt this relationship per sample or over time.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A mechanism that dynamically weights uncertainty sources based on per-sample feature similarity or task correlation, demonstrating improved stability and performance over the fixed substitution strategy.

## Limitations

- **Correlation dependency:** The framework assumes sufficient correlation between balanced and imbalanced tasks for effective uncertainty transfer, which may not hold in all RTA interception scenarios
- **Dataset specificity:** Results are demonstrated on JD advertisement data; generalization to other domains and traffic patterns requires further validation
- **Manual threshold selection:** The uncertainty threshold τ for passing decisions is set manually without an automated optimization procedure

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Inference speed improvement (10x), multi-objective architecture design, basic experimental methodology
- **Medium Confidence:** Uncertainty transfer mechanism, SWAG-based uncertainty estimation, distillation approach
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization to datasets beyond JD advertisement data, robustness to varying correlation structures, long-term stability of distilled models

## Next Checks

1. **Correlation Structure Analysis:** Explicitly measure and report task correlation coefficients in the dataset, and test DAUM performance across varying correlation strengths to establish break points.

2. **SWAG Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Systematically vary k (weight collection epochs) and M (sampling count) to identify optimal values and quantify uncertainty estimation stability across the hyperparameter space.

3. **Cross-Dataset Generalization:** Validate DAUM on RTA interception datasets from different domains (e.g., social media advertising, e-commerce platforms) to test the robustness of the uncertainty transfer mechanism beyond JD-specific patterns.
