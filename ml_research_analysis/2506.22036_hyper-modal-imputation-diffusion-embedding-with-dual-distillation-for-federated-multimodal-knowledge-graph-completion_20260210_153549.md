# Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding with Dual-Distillation for Federated Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.22036
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22036
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MMFeD3-HidE achieves significant improvements over baselines in FedMKGC task with higher Hits@1, Hits@3, Hits@10, and MRR scores

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Federated Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) as a novel task for collaboratively completing missing links in client-held multimodal knowledge graphs without data transmission. The work addresses two key challenges: multimodal uncertain unavailability (missing modalities) and multimodal client heterogeneity (varying modality distributions across clients). The proposed MMFeD3-HidE framework combines Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding (HidE) for semantic integrity through diffusion-based imputation of incomplete multimodal embeddings, with Multimodal Federated Dual-Distillation (MMFeD3) for mutual knowledge transfer between clients and server via logit and feature distillation. Experimental results on FB15K-237 demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining robustness to varying multimodal availability rates.

## Method Summary
The MMFeD3-HidE framework addresses FedMKGC through two core components working in tandem. First, HidE uses diffusion models with masked supervision to impute incomplete multimodal entity embeddings, ensuring semantic integrity when certain modalities are missing. This hyper-modal embedding approach captures the full semantic space of multimodal entities. Second, MMFeD3 implements a dual-distillation mechanism where knowledge flows bidirectionally between clients and the server through both logit-level and feature-level distillation. This mutual knowledge transfer enhances global convergence and maintains semantic consistency across heterogeneous client distributions. The framework operates under federated learning constraints, ensuring no raw data leaves client devices while still enabling effective multimodal knowledge graph completion.

## Key Results
- MMFeD3-HidE achieves significantly higher Hits@1, Hits@3, Hits@10, and MRR scores compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- The framework demonstrates robustness to varying multimodal available rates and different missing modality types
- Strong performance in terms of semantic consistency and convergence efficiency on the FB15K-237 benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by addressing the fundamental tension in federated multimodal settings between local data privacy and global model performance. The diffusion-based imputation in HidE effectively fills semantic gaps created by missing modalities, preventing information loss that would otherwise degrade completion accuracy. The dual-distillation mechanism in MMFeD3 enables knowledge sharing without raw data exchange, with logit distillation capturing high-level semantic relationships and feature distillation preserving detailed structural information. This two-pronged approach allows the global model to benefit from diverse client perspectives while maintaining semantic coherence across the federated system.

## Foundational Learning

**Diffusion Models for Imputation**
- Why needed: Standard imputation methods struggle with multimodal semantic spaces where missing modalities create complex, non-linear gaps in representation
- Quick check: Verify that diffusion sampling converges to semantically meaningful embeddings by measuring reconstruction quality on fully observed data

**Logit Distillation**
- Why needed: Captures high-level semantic relationships and class probabilities without requiring exact feature matching across heterogeneous client distributions
- Quick check: Compare distillation loss against model performance to ensure effective semantic transfer

**Feature Distillation**
- Why needed: Preserves detailed structural information in multimodal embeddings that logit distillation alone might miss
- Quick check: Monitor feature-level similarity metrics between client and server representations during training

**Federated Learning Convergence**
- Why needed: Ensures global model improves despite client heterogeneity and limited communication rounds
- Quick check: Track validation metrics across communication rounds to identify convergence plateaus

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
FedMKGC Benchmark -> MMFeD3-HidE Framework -> HidE (Diffusion-based Imputation) -> MMFeD3 (Dual-Distillation) -> Global Model

**Critical Path**
Client modality encoding → HidE diffusion imputation → Client local training → Dual-distillation knowledge transfer → Server aggregation → Global model update

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Diffusion model complexity vs. imputation accuracy: More complex diffusion models improve imputation quality but increase computational overhead
- Distillation strength vs. client diversity: Stronger distillation improves convergence but may oversmooth client-specific patterns
- Communication frequency vs. convergence speed: More frequent updates accelerate learning but increase bandwidth requirements

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor imputation quality manifests as degraded performance on entities with historically missing modalities
- Insufficient distillation leads to divergent client and server representations, visible as high distillation loss
- Over-regularization from excessive distillation causes loss of client-specific patterns and reduced overall accuracy

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Ablation study: Evaluate performance with only HidE (no distillation), only MMFeD3 (no imputation), and the full MMFeD3-HidE system
2. Modality ablation: Systematically remove different modality types to assess imputation robustness across missing modality patterns
3. Communication efficiency test: Measure performance degradation under varying communication frequencies and client participation rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to single dataset (FB15K-237), raising questions about generalizability to other knowledge graph domains
- Limited analysis of practical deployment considerations including communication costs and client-side computational requirements
- Lack of explicit characterization of non-IID data distribution assumptions across clients

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Framework architecture and mathematical formulations | High |
| Empirical performance improvements within tested conditions | Medium |
| Practical deployment feasibility and communication efficiency | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on additional knowledge graph datasets with varying entity and relation distributions to assess generalizability beyond FB15K-237
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of diffusion-based imputation versus dual-distillation components
3. Measure communication costs and convergence iterations under different client participation rates and network conditions to evaluate practical feasibility
