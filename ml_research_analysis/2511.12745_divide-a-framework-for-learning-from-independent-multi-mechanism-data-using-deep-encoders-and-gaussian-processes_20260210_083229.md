core_contribution: The paper introduces DIVIDE, a framework designed to disentangle
  independent generative mechanisms in scientific datasets using modular deep encoders
  and structured Gaussian Processes. The core idea is to assign mechanism-specific
  encoders to capture distinct sources of variation, concatenate their latent representations,
  and apply a structured GP to model the combined effect with calibrated uncertainty.

# DIVIDE: A Framework for Learning from Independent Multi-Mechanism Data Using Deep Encoders and Gaussian Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12745
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12745
- Authors: Vivek Chawla; Boris Slautin; Utkarsh Pratiush; Dayakar Penumadu; Sergei Kalinin
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Successfully disentangles independent generative mechanisms in scientific datasets using modular deep encoders and structured Gaussian Processes, achieving interpretable predictions and efficient active learning.

## Executive Summary
DIVIDE introduces a framework for learning from scientific datasets containing multiple independent generative mechanisms. The approach uses separate deep encoders for each mechanism type, concatenates their latent representations, and applies a structured Gaussian Process to model the combined effect with calibrated uncertainty. This architectural separation enables interpretable predictions and efficient active learning while maintaining disentanglement of underlying physical processes.

## Method Summary
DIVIDE processes multi-modal inputs through mechanism-specific encoders (CNNs or MLPs), concatenates the resulting latent vectors with normalized spatial coordinates, and applies a Gaussian Process regression head. The framework uses ELBO-based training and incorporates anchor constraints to resolve identifiability issues inherent in GP kernels. A structured GP variant with custom mean functions handles complex spatial fields that standard GPs cannot model effectively.

## Key Results
- Successfully recovered individual mechanisms in synthetic datasets combining categorical image patches and spatial fields
- Disentangled non-additive contributions of a- and c-domains to loop area in FerroSim ferroelectric simulations
- Separated effects of a-domain arrangement and c-domain polarization on experimental PFM hysteresis loops while enabling prediction for artificial domain patterns
- Demonstrated accurate disentanglement, interpretable latent spaces, and robust performance under noise across all test cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Architectural Separation via Modular Encoders
- Claim: Assigning distinct encoders to independent data modalities prevents entanglement of latent factors, creating an inductive bias for disentanglement that purely statistical regularization often fails to enforce.
- Mechanism: Independent latent vectors are concatenated only at the final stage, ensuring gradients updating one encoder do not directly distort another's representation.
- Core assumption: Generative factors are functionally independent or additive in their contribution to the latent space.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "assign mechanism-specific encoders to capture distinct sources of variation"; Page 3 confirms "Each encoder is responsible for capturing a distinct generative factor."
- Break condition: Fails if underlying physical mechanisms are not independent or if injectivity is violated.

### Mechanism 2: Structured Gaussian Processes for Uncertainty and Active Learning
- Claim: GP applied to concatenated latent space provides calibrated uncertainty estimates that drive efficient active learning and allow incorporation of physical priors via structured mean functions.
- Mechanism: Unlike neural network heads, GP predicts distribution over output, enabling uncertainty sampling for active learning and physics-informed priors for complex spatial fields.
- Core assumption: Residual error after encoding is smooth and follows Gaussian distribution suitable for GP regression.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "apply a structured GP to model the combined effect with calibrated uncertainty"; Page 10-11 discusses structured GP incorporating domain knowledge.
- Break condition: Fails if spatial field is multi-scale and highly non-linear without structured prior.

### Mechanism 3: Anchor Constraints for Identifiability
- Claim: Normalization and fixed anchor points resolve translational ambiguity inherent in GP kernels, ensuring unique and interpretable decomposition of mechanisms.
- Mechanism: GP kernels are invariant to global translations; anchor constraints fix this shift by imposing n-1 constraints on latent values.
- Core assumption: User has domain knowledge to set valid anchor points.
- Evidence anchors: Page 4 states "we normalize each latent and impose n-1 anchor constraints"; Page 7 confirms "fixed anchor point thereby enforces a valid decomposition."
- Break condition: Fails if anchor point assumption is factually incorrect, leading to biased decomposition.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Variational Inference & Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)**
- Why needed here: Model is trained end-to-end using ELBO, not standard MSE loss; critical for debugging training convergence and understanding data fit vs. latent regularization trade-off.
- Quick check question: Can you explain why the ELBO objective is necessary for training the variational sparse GP used in this architecture?

**Concept: Identifiability in Inverse Problems**
- Why needed here: Paper explicitly notes "infinitely many generative models" can yield same observation; understanding why constraints are mathematically required to find correct mechanism is key.
- Quick check question: If I remove the anchor constraint, will the model predict the wrong total output, or just fail to attribute contribution correctly?

**Concept: Injectivity in Encoders**
- Why needed here: Non-injective mappings (collapsing distinct inputs to same code) cause GP to see "conflicting supervision."
- Quick check question: What happens to GP's predictive uncertainty if two image patches with different ground truth scalar targets are mapped to exact same latent vector?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
- Inputs: Multi-modal (Image Patches, Spatial Coordinates (x,y))
- Encoders: Separate CNNs/MLPs for each modality outputting 16-dim latent vectors
- Fusion: Concatenation of latent vectors + direct appending of normalized coordinates
- Head: Gaussian Process (GPyTorch) with Inducing Points
- Optional: Structured Mean Function for spatial priors

**Critical path:**
1. Normalize spatial coordinates to [-1, 1]
2. Initialize mechanism-specific encoders (ensure output normalization)
3. Define GP kernel and inducing points (subset of training data)
4. Train by maximizing ELBO (Adam optimizer)

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Standard GP vs. Structured GP: Use Standard GP for simple/additive trends; use Structured GP (custom mean function) for multi-scale or physics-complex spatial fields where standard GPs converge to local optima
- Latent Dimensionality: Fixed at 16 in paper; higher dimensions may increase capacity but risk overfitting with limited data

**Failure signatures:**
- Entanglement: Clustering of latent codes does not correspond to semantic categories
- Active Learning Stagnation: Uncertainty sampling gets stuck at domain edges (requires spatial penalty)
- Flat Predictions: Model ignores complex spatial field and predicts only categorical mean

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Benchmark 1 Sanity Check: Replicate RGB patch + Linear Spatial field experiment (Figure 2). Verify clustering latent codes recovers 3 color classes.
2. Identifiability Test: Train model on Benchmark 1 without anchor constraint. Verify recovered spatial trend has arbitrary offset.
3. Active Learning Loop: Run acquisition loop on "Suits" dataset. Plot convergence of mean absolute error (MAE) to see if reconciles spatial vs. categorical effects by iteration 10.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in provided content.

## Limitations
- Architectural assumption of independence between generative mechanisms may not hold in real-world datasets with complex interactions
- Reliance on user-specified anchor constraints for identifiability introduces potential error if domain knowledge is incomplete or incorrect
- GP computational complexity scales cubically with number of inducing points, potentially limiting applicability to very large datasets

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Modular encoder architecture successfully separates independent mechanisms in synthetic benchmarks and demonstrates clear performance improvements over non-modular baselines.

**Medium Confidence:** Active learning implementation effectively reduces data requirements, though performance gain depends heavily on quality of uncertainty estimates and specific acquisition strategy.

**Medium Confidence:** Structured GP extension provides meaningful improvements for complex spatial fields, but benefits may be dataset-specific and require careful tuning of mean function.

## Next Checks

1. **Mechanism Independence Test:** Systematically evaluate DIVIDE's performance when varying degrees of interaction between mechanisms are introduced, quantifying the threshold at which independence assumption breaks down.

2. **Anchor Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct comprehensive study on how incorrect anchor specifications affect quality of disentanglement and prediction accuracy across different domains.

3. **Scalability Assessment:** Measure training and inference times as function of dataset size and number of inducing points to establish practical limits for real-world applications.
