# TaxoBell: Gaussian Box Embeddings for Self-Supervised Taxonomy Expansion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09633
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09633
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: TaxoBell achieves 19% MRR and 25% Recall@k improvements over 8 baselines for self-supervised taxonomy expansion

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework for self-supervised taxonomy expansion. The method addresses limitations of existing approaches by modeling concepts as Gaussian boxes that encode semantic location and uncertainty, enabling robust hierarchical reasoning. TaxoBell uses energy-based optimization with symmetric overlap and asymmetric containment terms to learn asymmetric "is-a" relationships. Extensive experiments on five real-world taxonomy benchmarks demonstrate that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
TaxoBell represents concepts as Gaussian boxes in a continuous embedding space, where each box is parameterized by a mean vector (μ) and covariance matrix (Σ) that capture both semantic location and uncertainty. The framework employs an energy-based learning objective that combines symmetric overlap terms (measuring concept similarity) with asymmetric containment terms (modeling "is-a" relationships). The model is trained in a self-supervised manner using existing taxonomy edges as supervision. During inference, the framework can predict hypernym-hyponym relationships by evaluating the energy scores between concept pairs. The Gaussian parameterization allows the model to naturally handle uncertainty in concept representations and provides interpretable confidence estimates for predictions.

## Key Results
- TaxoBell achieves 19% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- TaxoBell shows 25% improvement in Recall@k for taxonomy expansion tasks
- Outperforms 8 different baseline methods across 5 real-world taxonomy benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TaxoBell's effectiveness stems from its ability to model both the semantic similarity and hierarchical containment relationships between concepts simultaneously. The Gaussian box representation captures uncertainty in concept embeddings, which is crucial for handling polysemous terms and ambiguous relationships. The energy-based objective with both symmetric and asymmetric components allows the model to learn the nuanced "is-a" relationships that define taxonomic hierarchies while maintaining flexibility in the embedding space.

## Foundational Learning
- Gaussian embeddings: Why needed - to capture uncertainty and variability in concept representations; Quick check - visualize embedding distributions to verify meaningful uncertainty quantification
- Energy-based learning: Why needed - to handle asymmetric relationships and complex loss landscapes; Quick check - monitor energy score distributions for valid/invalid edges during training
- Box containment: Why needed - to model hierarchical relationships geometrically; Quick check - verify containment relationships hold for known hypernym-hyponym pairs

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Concept Encoder -> Gaussian Box Parameterizer -> Energy Function -> Loss Function
- Critical path: Input concept pairs → Gaussian box representations → Energy score computation → Loss calculation → Gradient update
- Design tradeoffs: Gaussian boxes provide uncertainty modeling but increase parameter complexity compared to point embeddings; Energy-based objectives handle asymmetry but require careful hyperparameter tuning
- Failure signatures: Poor containment relationships indicate insufficient training data or incorrect energy function parameterization; High uncertainty in predictions suggests ambiguous concept boundaries
- First experiments: 1) Verify Gaussian box parameters are learned meaningfully, 2) Test energy scores on known taxonomy edges, 3) Evaluate uncertainty calibration on held-out data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on specific energy-based objective formulation that may not generalize to all taxonomy types
- Evaluation focuses on standard benchmarks which may not represent real-world deployment scenarios
- Gaussian box representation may not capture all semantic relationships in complex taxonomic structures

## Confidence
- Performance improvements over baselines (High): The substantial improvements in MRR and Recall@k are supported by extensive experiments across five benchmarks and multiple baselines
- Framework generalizability (Medium): While the approach shows promise, its effectiveness on specialized or highly domain-specific taxonomies remains to be validated
- Uncertainty representation utility (Medium): The claimed interpretability of uncertainty quantification needs further validation in practical taxonomy construction scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TaxoBell on domain-specific taxonomies (e.g., medical, legal) to assess performance on specialized vocabularies and complex hierarchical relationships
2. Test the framework's robustness on taxonomies with varying levels of noise and incompleteness to verify real-world applicability
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of individual components (Gaussian modeling, energy-based loss, etc.) to overall performance
