# What Has a Foundation Model Found? Using Inductive Bias to Probe for World Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.06952
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06952
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Foundation models trained on trajectory prediction fail to develop inductive bias toward true underlying world models, instead developing task-specific heuristics that fail when adapted to new tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for evaluating whether foundation models have learned underlying world models by testing their inductive bias through fine-tuning on small synthetic datasets. The framework measures whether models' predictions respect and distinguish states in postulated world models using metrics R-IB and D-IB. When applied to orbital mechanics, transformers fail to recover Newtonian mechanics, instead producing nonsensical force laws. Similar failures appear across lattice problems and Othello, where models excel at next-token prediction but lack inductive bias toward true state structure, instead grouping states with equivalent legal moves. The key finding is that strong predictive performance does not imply world model learning.

## Method Summary
The framework tests whether foundation models have learned underlying world models by examining their inductive bias through controlled experiments. Models are fine-tuned on small synthetic datasets generated from postulated world models, then evaluated on how they extrapolate to new inputs. The core innovation is using synthetic data to create precise ground truth for testing whether models have captured the underlying state structure rather than just memorizing task-specific patterns. The framework measures two key properties: whether predictions respect the true state structure (R-IB) and whether the model can distinguish between different states (D-IB). This approach isolates whether models have learned the fundamental rules governing the system or merely developed heuristics for the specific training task.

## Key Results
- Transformers trained on trajectory prediction fail to develop inductive bias toward Newtonian mechanics, recovering nonsensical force laws instead
- Across multiple domains (orbital mechanics, lattice problems, Othello), models achieve high next-token prediction accuracy without learning true underlying world models
- Models develop task-specific heuristics, grouping together states with equivalent legal next moves rather than learning the underlying state structure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating controlled synthetic environments where the ground truth world model is known with certainty. By fine-tuning models on small datasets from these synthetic worlds and testing their extrapolation behavior, researchers can isolate whether the model has captured the fundamental state structure or merely learned task-specific patterns. The synthetic approach eliminates confounding factors from real-world noise and allows precise measurement of whether predictions respect and distinguish true states. This methodology reveals that high predictive accuracy on training tasks does not guarantee learning of the underlying world model, as models can succeed through memorization or heuristic shortcuts that fail when the task context changes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Inductive bias**: Why needed: Enables models to generalize beyond training data; Quick check: Test model's extrapolation behavior on novel inputs
- **State representation**: Why needed: Captures essential features of the world model; Quick check: Verify model distinguishes between states with different future outcomes
- **Synthetic data generation**: Why needed: Provides ground truth for testing world model learning; Quick check: Confirm generated data follows known underlying rules
- **Fine-tuning adaptation**: Why needed: Tests whether learned knowledge transfers to new tasks; Quick check: Measure performance drop when task context changes
- **Next-token prediction**: Why needed: Common training objective that may not require world model understanding; Quick check: Compare predictive accuracy vs. world model recovery
- **Extrapolation testing**: Why needed: Reveals whether learning is based on true understanding vs. memorization; Quick check: Evaluate performance on inputs outside training distribution

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Synthetic Data Generator -> Foundation Model (Pretrained) -> Fine-tuning Module -> Evaluation Metrics (R-IB, D-IB) -> World Model Recovery Analysis

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves generating synthetic data from known world models, fine-tuning the pretrained foundation model on small datasets from these worlds, and evaluating whether the model's predictions respect and distinguish the true state structure using R-IB and D-IB metrics. Success depends on the model's ability to transfer knowledge from pretraining to the synthetic fine-tuning task and demonstrate understanding of the underlying state structure.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades ecological validity for experimental control. Synthetic data provides perfect ground truth but may not capture the complexity of real-world training distributions that foundation models actually encounter. The fine-tuning approach tests transfer learning but may not reveal whether world models were present in the original pretraining or learned during adaptation. Small fine-tuning datasets stress-test generalization but may not provide sufficient signal for complex world models to emerge.

**Failure Signatures:** Models achieve high next-token prediction accuracy but fail R-IB and D-IB metrics, indicating they've learned task-specific heuristics rather than world models. Failure manifests as nonsensical force laws in physics problems, inability to distinguish between states with different future trajectories, or grouping states based on surface features rather than underlying structure. The model may appear to perform well on the original training task but completely break down when adapted to tasks requiring true understanding of the state space.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test the same probing framework on a simple grid-world environment where the underlying rules are known and easily verifiable
2. Apply the framework to a language model trained on text describing physical interactions to see if it learns world models of physics
3. Create a synthetic environment with intermediate complexity between simple lattices and full orbital mechanics to identify the complexity threshold where world model learning breaks down

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the text provided.

## Limitations
- The findings may not generalize beyond the specific synthetic domains tested (orbital mechanics, lattice problems, Othello)
- Reliance on synthetic datasets may not capture the full complexity of natural data distributions encountered during actual foundation model pretraining
- The distinction between "world models" and "task-specific heuristics" could benefit from more precise operational definitions

## Confidence
- High confidence that models trained on trajectory prediction fail to develop inductive bias toward Newtonian mechanics when tested on synthetic data
- Medium confidence that this finding generalizes to other domains and real-world training data
- Low confidence in precise operational definitions distinguishing world models from task-specific heuristics

## Next Checks
1. Apply the same probing framework to foundation models trained on real-world physics data (e.g., videos of physical interactions) rather than synthetic trajectories to test generalizability
2. Test whether increasing model size or training duration on the same synthetic datasets leads to emergence of inductive bias toward the underlying world models
3. Design experiments with intermediate complexity domains that bridge simple synthetic problems and complex real-world tasks to identify where and why the breakdown in world model learning occurs
