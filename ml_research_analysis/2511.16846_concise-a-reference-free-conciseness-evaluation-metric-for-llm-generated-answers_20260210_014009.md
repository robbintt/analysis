# ConCISE: A Reference-Free Conciseness Evaluation Metric for LLM-Generated Answers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.16846
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16846
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Reference-free metric achieving 94% accuracy in pairwise conciseness comparisons

## Executive Summary
ConCISE introduces a novel reference-free approach to evaluating the conciseness of LLM-generated responses. The metric quantifies non-essential content through three complementary compression techniques: abstractive summarization, extractive summarization, and word-removal compression. By averaging the compression ratios from these methods, ConCISE produces a comprehensive conciseness score without requiring gold standard references. The approach demonstrates strong correlation with human judgments and achieves high accuracy in pairwise comparisons, making it a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems.

## Method Summary
ConCISE evaluates conciseness through three compression-based techniques applied to LLM-generated responses. First, abstractive summarization uses GPT-4 to compress the response, with the compression ratio serving as a conciseness measure. Second, extractive summarization employs the same approach but with key sentence extraction. Third, word-removal compression systematically removes words while preserving grammaticality and meaning. The final conciseness score is the average of these three compression ratios. This reference-free design eliminates the need for human-annotated gold standards, enabling scalable evaluation of response brevity across diverse conversational contexts.

## Key Results
- Achieved Spearman's correlation of 0.628 and Kendall's τ of 0.523 with human conciseness judgments
- Demonstrated 94% accuracy in pairwise comparisons of answer conciseness
- Validated on WikiEval dataset with human-annotated responses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The metric leverages the observation that concise responses can be compressed more significantly while preserving essential meaning. By employing multiple compression techniques, ConCISE captures different dimensions of verbosity - from redundant phrasing to unnecessary elaboration. The use of LLM-based compression allows the system to understand semantic content rather than relying solely on surface-level features. Averaging three complementary approaches provides robustness against individual technique limitations and captures a more complete picture of response conciseness.

## Foundational Learning

**Compression Ratio Analysis**
*Why needed*: Quantifies the relationship between original and compressed text length to measure redundancy
*Quick check*: Compare compression ratios across different response types to establish baseline expectations

**Abstractive vs Extractive Summarization**
*Why needed*: Different summarization approaches capture different types of verbosity and redundancy
*Quick check*: Analyze which technique performs better for specific types of non-essential content

**Reference-Free Evaluation**
*Why needed*: Eliminates dependency on human-annotated gold standards, enabling scalable deployment
*Quick check*: Validate metric performance against human judgments in multiple domains

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Original Response -> Abstractive Compression -> Compression Ratio 1
Original Response -> Extractive Compression -> Compression Ratio 2
Original Response -> Word-Removal Compression -> Compression Ratio 3
Averaged Compression Ratios -> Final Conciseness Score

**Critical Path**
Original response → three parallel compression techniques → individual compression ratios → average → final conciseness score

**Design Tradeoffs**
- LLM dependency (GPT-4) provides semantic understanding but introduces cost and potential bias
- Three techniques offer robustness but increase computational complexity
- Reference-free approach enables scalability but may miss domain-specific conciseness nuances

**Failure Signatures**
- Over-compression removing necessary detail
- Inability to detect subtle redundancy or contextually appropriate elaboration
- Performance degradation with highly technical or domain-specific content

**First Experiments**
1. Test metric performance across diverse domains (medical, legal, technical)
2. Evaluate sensitivity to different LLM architectures beyond GPT-4
3. Conduct multi-turn conversation analysis to assess context dependency handling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on GPT-4 introduces potential biases and questions about generalizability
- Evaluation focused on single-turn conversations, limiting insights into multi-turn dialogue scenarios
- Compression techniques may not capture all forms of verbosity, particularly subtle redundancy

## Confidence

**High**: Metric's ability to correlate with human judgments and achieve strong pairwise comparison accuracy

**Medium**: Claims about generalizability across different types of LLM outputs and conversational contexts

**Low**: Assertions about performance on highly technical or domain-specific content where compression might inappropriately remove necessary detail

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ConCISE's performance across multiple domains (medical, legal, technical) to assess robustness and potential domain-specific limitations
2. Test the metric's sensitivity to different LLM architectures and compression approaches beyond GPT-4
3. Conduct experiments with multi-turn conversations to verify effectiveness in dialogue scenarios with context dependencies
