# Learning Fair Graph Representations with Multi-view Information Bottleneck

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25096
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25096
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Proposes FairMIB framework using multi-view conditional information bottleneck to address fairness bias in GNNs, achieving 98.8% and 99.3% relative reductions in Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity on German dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness bias in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) arising from multi-source information, including node attributes, graph structure, and information diffusion. Traditional approaches fail to disentangle these sources, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between model utility and fairness. The authors propose FairMIB, a novel framework grounded in multi-view conditional information bottleneck principles that disentangles graph data into feature, structural, and diffusion views before applying conditional information bottleneck to the fused representation.

## Method Summary
FairMIB introduces a three-step approach to learning fair graph representations. First, it disentangles graph data into three independent views: feature, structural, and diffusion. Second, it applies a conditional information bottleneck to the fused representation to learn compressed representations that preserve task-relevant information while mitigating sensitive attribute leakage. Third, it introduces a multi-view consistency constraint to ensure semantic alignment across learned representations. The framework is validated across five benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior balance between fairness and utility compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Key Results
- FairMIB reduces Demographic Parity by 98.8% and Equal Opportunity by 99.3% relative to GCN on German dataset
- Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets
- Achieves superior balance between fairness and utility in graph representation learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages multi-view conditional information bottleneck principles to separately process and then fuse feature, structural, and diffusion information. By disentangling these information sources before applying the bottleneck, FairMIB can more precisely control what information is preserved and what is suppressed, leading to improved fairness without sacrificing utility. The multi-view consistency constraint ensures that semantic relationships are maintained across the different information sources during the compression process.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multi-view Information Bottleneck** - A framework for learning compressed representations that preserve relevant information across multiple data views. Needed to handle the complexity of graph data where information comes from multiple sources. Quick check: Can the method preserve task-relevant information while filtering out sensitive attributes?

2. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** - Neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data. Needed as the base architecture for processing graph information. Quick check: Does the GNN component effectively capture structural relationships?

3. **Information Diffusion in Graphs** - The process by which information spreads through network connections. Needed to model how sensitive information can propagate through graph structures. Quick check: Can the framework identify and mitigate diffusion of sensitive information?

4. **Conditional Information Bottleneck** - An extension of information bottleneck that conditions on auxiliary information. Needed to selectively preserve information relevant to the task while filtering out sensitive attributes. Quick check: Does conditioning effectively separate task-relevant from sensitive information?

5. **Disentanglement Learning** - Techniques for separating mixed information sources into independent components. Needed to isolate feature, structural, and diffusion information. Quick check: Are the disentangled views truly independent and mutually exclusive?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Graph Data -> Disentanglement Module -> Multi-view Fusion -> Conditional Information Bottleneck -> Consistency Constraint -> Fair Representation

**Critical Path:** The most important sequence is Disentanglement -> Multi-view Fusion -> Conditional Information Bottleneck, as this directly addresses the core challenge of separating and then compressing information from multiple sources.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational complexity for improved fairness control. By maintaining multiple representations and applying consistency constraints, it increases memory and processing requirements but gains more precise control over information flow.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor disentanglement would manifest as inconsistent representations across views, while inadequate bottleneck compression would show as persistent sensitive attribute leakage in downstream tasks.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test disentanglement quality by measuring independence between feature, structural, and diffusion representations
2. Validate information bottleneck effectiveness by comparing task performance with and without conditional constraints
3. Assess consistency constraint impact by measuring semantic alignment across views with constraint disabled

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited assessment on heterogeneous or dynamic graphs where information diffusion patterns may differ significantly
- Assumes clean separation between feature, structural, and diffusion information, but real-world scenarios often exhibit complex interdependencies
- Computational overhead of maintaining multiple representations and consistency constraints could impact scalability for large-scale graphs

## Confidence
- Methodological framework: High
- Experimental design: High
- Comparative performance advantages: Medium (specific datasets used)
- Scalability and robustness claims: Medium-Low (complex graph scenarios)

## Next Checks
1. Test FairMIB on heterogeneous graphs with multiple edge types and node attributes to assess robustness beyond homogeneous datasets
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of multi-view disentanglement versus conditional information bottleneck components
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and memory requirements on graphs with 100K+ nodes to establish practical scalability limits
