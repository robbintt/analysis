# Position: Human-Centric AI Requires a Minimum Viable Level of Human Understanding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.00854
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00854
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** Introduces Cognitive Integrity Threshold (CIT) framework to ensure meaningful human oversight in AI-assisted reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of cognitive erosion in human-AI interaction, where increasing AI autonomy undermines users' capacity to maintain meaningful oversight. The authors introduce the Cognitive Integrity Threshold (CIT) as a conceptual framework defining the minimum comprehension level required for humans to effectively verify, reconstruct, and intervene in AI outputs. Rather than treating human oversight as a binary presence/absence issue, CIT operationalizes it through three dimensions: verification capacity, comprehension-preserving interaction, and institutional governance. The framework reframes human-AI interaction from performance optimization to cognitive alignment, ensuring accountability remains viable under sustained automation in responsibility-critical settings.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual framework that identifies cognitive erosion as the core challenge in AI oversight. Through theoretical analysis, the authors argue that current transparency and control paradigms fail to preserve the cognitive capacities necessary for meaningful human oversight. They operationalize CIT through three dimensions: verification capacity (the ability to check AI outputs), comprehension-preserving interaction (interfaces that maintain understanding), and institutional governance (organizational structures supporting cognitive integrity). The framework is developed through synthesis of existing literature on human-AI interaction, cognitive science, and accountability mechanisms, proposing a design agenda focused on maintaining cognitive sustainability in critical domains.

## Key Results
- Introduces Cognitive Integrity Threshold (CIT) as minimum comprehension level required for meaningful human oversight of AI systems
- Proposes three operational dimensions: verification capacity, comprehension-preserving interaction, and institutional governance
- Reframes human-AI interaction from performance optimization to cognitive alignment challenge
- Addresses erosion of user understanding as AI systems become increasingly autonomous

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CIT framework works by establishing a cognitive floor that prevents complete user disengagement from AI reasoning processes. By defining minimum comprehension requirements, it ensures humans retain the capacity to detect errors, reconstruct reasoning chains, and intervene when necessary. The mechanism operates through active preservation of cognitive engagement rather than passive transparency, creating interfaces and workflows that maintain user understanding even as AI complexity increases. This approach recognizes that traditional accountability mechanisms (logging, explanations, manual overrides) become ineffective when users lack the cognitive capacity to utilize them meaningfully.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cognitive erosion concept** - Why needed: Understanding how automation degrades human oversight capabilities; Quick check: Can you explain why increasing AI autonomy can reduce human accountability?
- **Meaningful comprehension threshold** - Why needed: Defining what level of understanding is sufficient for effective oversight; Quick check: What distinguishes meaningful comprehension from superficial awareness?
- **Verification capacity** - Why needed: Identifying the specific cognitive abilities required to validate AI outputs; Quick check: Can you list three verification tasks humans must retain capability for?
- **Comprehension-preserving interaction** - Why needed: Designing interfaces that maintain understanding rather than erode it; Quick check: How would you design an interface that prevents cognitive erosion?
- **Institutional governance dimension** - Why needed: Understanding organizational structures needed to support cognitive integrity; Quick check: What institutional mechanisms would enforce minimum comprehension requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Human user -> CIT-defined comprehension threshold -> AI system interaction layer -> Verification mechanisms -> Institutional governance framework

Critical path:
User comprehension → Meaningful oversight → System accountability → Cognitive sustainability

Design tradeoffs:
- Performance vs. cognitive preservation: More autonomous AI may perform better but erode human understanding
- Interface complexity vs. comprehension: Simpler interfaces may be more usable but less cognitively engaging
- Efficiency vs. verification capacity: Streamlined workflows may reduce opportunities for meaningful oversight

Failure signatures:
- Complete cognitive disengagement where users cannot reconstruct AI reasoning
- False confidence where users believe they understand but lack verification capacity
- Gradual erosion of oversight capability over time with repeated AI use
- Institutional failure to maintain cognitive integrity standards

First experiments:
1. Measure user comprehension decay across different levels of AI autonomy in medical diagnosis scenarios
2. Test prototype interfaces designed to preserve cognitive engagement during legal document analysis
3. Evaluate institutional governance mechanisms for enforcing cognitive integrity thresholds in financial auditing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges that determining specific CIT threshold values remains an open challenge, as does measuring "meaningful comprehension" across diverse applications. It also raises questions about potential conflicts between cognitive preservation and system performance, and how to balance efficiency with meaningful oversight. The universal applicability of CIT across different AI systems and domains requires further investigation, as does the development of standardized assessment frameworks.

## Limitations
- Operates primarily at conceptual level without empirical validation of CIT thresholds
- No systematic analysis of how cognitive load varies with AI complexity across domains
- Limited discussion of conflicts between cognitive preservation and system performance/efficiency
- Institutional governance dimension remains underdeveloped with few concrete implementation pathways

## Confidence

High:
- Identification of cognitive erosion as core challenge in AI oversight
- Argument that current transparency paradigms are insufficient

Medium:
- Three-dimensional operationalization of CIT (verification capacity, comprehension-preserving interaction, institutional governance)

Low:
- Specific threshold values or metrics for determining CIT
- Universal applicability across all AI systems

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies measuring user comprehension decay across different levels of AI autonomy in real-world settings
2. Develop and test prototype tools that implement CIT principles in specific domains (e.g., medical diagnosis, legal analysis)
3. Create a standardized framework for assessing whether AI systems meet minimum cognitive integrity thresholds across diverse applications
