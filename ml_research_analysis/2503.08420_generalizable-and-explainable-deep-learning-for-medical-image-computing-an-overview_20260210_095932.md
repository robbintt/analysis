## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.08420
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08420
- **Authors:** Ahmad Chaddad; Yan Hu; Yihang Wu; Binbin Wen; Reem Kateb
- **Reference count:** 40

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of explainable and generalizable deep learning techniques in medical image computing, addressing the critical need for transparency in clinical applications. The study evaluates five popular XAI methods (GradCAM++, EigenGradCAM, XGradCAM, AblationCAM, LayerCAM) combined with ResNet50 on three medical datasets (brain tumor, skin cancer, and chest X-ray). Using the ROAD metric to quantitatively assess XAI techniques, the experiments demonstrate that XGradCAM achieved the highest confidence increase (e.g., 0.12 for glioma tumor), outperforming other methods like GradCAM++ (0.09) and LayerCAM (0.08). The findings suggest that XGradCAM and AblationCAM show particular promise for clinical applications due to their superior performance in identifying relevant features and higher confidence increases, making them valuable tools for enhancing model transparency and building clinician trust in DL-based medical diagnostics.

## Method Summary
The study combines deep learning classification with explainable AI evaluation across three medical imaging datasets. ResNet50 serves as the primary backbone model, trained with SGD optimization (learning rate 1e-3, momentum 0.9) on preprocessed 224×224 images without data augmentation. Five XAI methods (GradCAM++, EigenGradCAM, XGradCAM, AblationCAM, LayerCAM) generate heatmaps highlighting important regions, which are then quantitatively evaluated using the ROAD metric. The ROAD method measures "confidence increase" by removing important features identified by XAI and observing changes in model prediction confidence. Classification performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and macro F1 scores, while statistical significance is determined through paired t-tests across cross-validation folds.

## Key Results
- ResNet50 achieved feasible accuracy and F1 scores across all datasets, with 86.31% accuracy in skin cancer classification
- XGradCAM demonstrated highest confidence increase (0.12 for glioma tumor), outperforming GradCAM++ (0.09) and LayerCAM (0.08)
- EigenGradCAM performed less effectively in specific scenarios, particularly for AKIEC and BCC classes in skin cancer dataset, showing "diffused attention"
- AblationCAM showed high explainability fidelity but with considerable computational burden compared to other methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Gradient-based attribution methods (specifically XGradCAM) may provide more reliable localization of pathological features than PCA-based methods (EigenGradCAM) in heterogeneous medical imaging datasets.
- **Mechanism:** XGradCAM utilizes axiom-based gradients to weight feature maps, whereas EigenGradCAM relies on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of spatial covariance. The paper suggests that PCA-based decomposition may struggle with the high variability (heterogeneity) found in skin lesion datasets, causing "diffused attention."
- **Core assumption:** The "confidence increase" metric calculated by the ROAD method is a valid proxy for the clinical relevance of the highlighted region.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Findings show that while certain XAI methods, such as XgradCAM, effectively highlight relevant abnormal regions... others, like EigenGradCAM, may perform less effectively in specific scenarios.
  - For skin cancer classification... EigenGradCAM... is less effective for AKIEC and BCC classes... This exhibits the potential of AblationCAM and XgradCAM.
  - General XAI surveys in the corpus corroborate the need for modality-aware evaluation but do not specifically validate the EigenGradCAM vs. XGradCAM comparison for skin cancer.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Removing high-importance features identified by XAI methods and observing the resulting prediction confidence drop (confidence increase metric) serves as a quantitative validation of model explainability.
- **Mechanism:** The Remove and Debias (ROAD) method masks image regions identified as "important" by the XAI technique. If the model's prediction confidence drops significantly (resulting in a higher "confidence increase" score), the XAI method is considered to have successfully identified critical features.
- **Core assumption:** The model's prediction confidence is directly causally linked to the specific pixels highlighted by the heatmap, and "confidence increase" correlates with human-interpretable correctness.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - We also involve a quantitative metric (confidence increase) to evaluate the usefulness of XAI techniques... XgradCAM indicates higher confidence increase (e.g., 0.12 in glioma tumor).
  - The ROAD method evaluates the predictive confidence of a model... by removing important features and observing changes in model performance.
  - Corpus signals suggest perturbation-based evaluation is a standard approach for validating feature importance.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Residual connections in ResNet50 facilitate generalization across distinct medical modalities (MRI, CT, Dermoscopy) better than shallower or unconnected architectures, provided sufficient training data exists.
- **Mechanism:** Skip connections in ResNet50 mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, allowing the model to learn robust hierarchical features necessary for diverse visual tasks (tumor segmentation, skin texture analysis).
- **Core assumption:** The superior performance noted is intrinsic to the architecture rather than hyperparameter optimization luck.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - The experimental results indicate that ResNet50 can achieve feasible accuracy and F1 score in all datasets.
  - We used ResNet50 as the main network backbone... [compared to] DenseNet121, VGG16 and EfficientNet-B0.
  - "A Comprehensive Study on Medical Image Segmentation using Deep Neural Networks" likely supports the general efficacy of CNNs in this domain.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Class Activation Mapping (CAM)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on GradCAM and its variants to produce heatmaps. Understanding that these methods weight feature maps by gradient importance to produce a coarse localization map is critical to interpreting the results.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why GradCAM uses the gradients of the final convolutional layer to generate a heatmap?

- **Concept:** **Paired t-tests for Model Comparison**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper claims "significance of the differences observed between different methods" using this test. One must understand that this checks if the mean performance difference between models is statistically robust across cross-validation folds.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is a paired t-test appropriate here instead of an unpaired test? (Hint: Same datasets used for all models).

- **Concept:** **Domain Shift / Generalization**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly aims to address "generalizable" DL. The core challenge is that a model trained on one scanner or hospital's data often fails on another's.
  - **Quick check question:** What creates the "domain shift" in medical imaging that makes generalization difficult?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (224×224 Medical Images) -> Backbone (ResNet50) -> Classifier (FC + Softmax) -> Explainer (XAI Layer) -> Evaluator (ROAD Metric Calculator)

- **Critical path:** The integration of the ROAD metric is the most critical component. The path is: Run Inference -> Generate Heatmap -> Apply Mask (Remove k% pixels) -> Run Inference Again -> Calculate Confidence Difference.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **AblationCAM vs. Speed:** AblationCAM offers high explainability fidelity but has "considerable computational burdens," making it unsuitable for real-time clinical deployment without optimization.
  - **ResNet50 vs. EfficientNet:** ResNet50 was chosen as the primary backbone for balance; EfficientNet-B0 might offer better efficiency but was not the focus of the extensive XAI comparison.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Diffused Heatmaps:** If using EigenGradCAM on skin lesions, expect "diffused attention" (low confidence increase) where the heatmap covers healthy skin rather than the lesion.
  - **Overfitting:** High training accuracy but low testing accuracy, though the paper claims "feasible" generalization.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Replication:** Train ResNet50 on the Brain Tumor dataset using the specified SGD parameters (lr=1e-3, momentum=0.9) to verify the ~86% accuracy baseline.
  2. **XAI Validation (Brain Tumor):** Apply XGradCAM to correctly classified Glioma images. Use the ROAD method to verify that removing the top 20% of important pixels causes a statistically significant drop in confidence.
  3. **XAI Stress Test (Skin Cancer):** Compare XGradCAM vs. EigenGradCAM on the "AKIEC" class in the skin cancer dataset to reproduce the failure mode where EigenGradCAM shows diffused attention and lower confidence increase (0.05).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does combining the local feature focus of LayerCAM with the class-level insights of GradCAM++ yield significantly more comprehensive and accurate explanations than individual XAI methods?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section V states, "hybrid XAI techniques may be developed, such as combining the meticulous focus of LayerCAM with the extensive class-level insights of GradCAM++."
  - **Why unresolved:** The authors evaluated five XAI techniques individually but did not experiment with hybrid architectures.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results from a combined LayerCAM-GradCAM++ model showing higher "confidence increase" scores.

- **Open Question 2:** Can lightweight XAI methods or optimization strategies be developed to reduce the computational cost of high-performance techniques like AblationCAM for use in resource-constrained clinical settings?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section V notes that "high-cost techniques such as AblationCAM need to be optimized, or lightweight XAI methods need to be explored."
  - **Why unresolved:** While the paper measures execution times, it identifies a trade-off where effective methods like AblationCAM impose "considerable computational burdens."
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified AblationCAM algorithm or new lightweight method maintaining high explainability while reducing execution time.

- **Open Question 3:** Do multidimensional visualization tools that simultaneously display feature importance, model uncertainty, and prediction confidence improve the reliability and consistency of XAI interpretations for clinical users?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section V suggests that "improving the reliability and consistency of XAI techniques requires the development of higher quality and more detailed visualization tools."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current XAI evaluation often relies on single metrics or qualitative heatmaps, lacking a unified interface.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A user study with clinicians demonstrating that unified visualization dashboards lead to higher diagnostic confidence.

## Limitations

- The study lacks detailed implementation specifications for the ROAD metric, particularly the "public GitHub code" used and exact thresholds for feature removal.
- The absence of data augmentation, while maintaining experimental purity, likely constrains the models' ability to generalize beyond the specific datasets studied.
- The fixed learning rate schedule (no learning rate decay mentioned) may not be optimal for all three datasets with varying complexity.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The comparative ranking of XAI methods (XGradCAM > GradCAM++ > LayerCAM > EigenGradCAM) across the three medical datasets.
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific numerical values for accuracy and F1 scores, as these depend on exact data splits and random initialization not specified.
- **Medium Confidence:** The architectural superiority claims for ResNet50, as the comparison with other backbones is limited to a single set of hyperparameters.

## Next Checks

1. Implement and validate the ROAD metric using the specific thresholds mentioned (four thresholds) to confirm the reported confidence increase values.
2. Conduct ablation studies testing different convolutional layers for CAM generation to verify the consistency of XGradCAM's superior performance.
3. Test the models on an external, previously unseen dataset from a different medical center to validate true generalizability claims beyond the reported datasets.
