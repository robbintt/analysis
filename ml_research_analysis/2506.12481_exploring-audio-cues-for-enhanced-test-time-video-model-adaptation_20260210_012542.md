# Exploring Audio Cues for Enhanced Test-Time Video Model Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12481
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12481
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces audio cues to enhance test-time video model adaptation, achieving up to 27% accuracy improvement on corrupted video datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of adapting video classification models at test time when visual data is corrupted. While existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods rely solely on visual information, this work proposes leveraging audio cues extracted from videos to generate robust pseudo-labels. The method uses a pre-trained audio model to classify sounds, then maps these audio predictions to video label spaces using a large language model (LLM). A dynamic adaptation cycle determines the optimal number of update iterations for each sample based on loss changes and prediction consistency. Experiments across multiple corrupted video datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art TTA methods, particularly when audio and visual content are semantically correlated.

## Method Summary
The proposed method follows a four-step process: (1) extract audio from input video and classify it using a pre-trained AST model; (2) map the top-K audio predictions to video label space through LLM prompting; (3) optimize the video model using a combined loss function (classification, consistency, and feature alignment losses) with learning rates of 5e-6 or 5e-5 depending on dataset; (4) employ a flexible adaptation cycle that continues updating the model while either the loss decreases or predictions across different views remain inconsistent. The feature alignment loss constrains the test-time feature statistics to match pre-computed training statistics, stabilizing the adaptation process.

## Key Results
- Achieved 27% accuracy improvement over ViTTA on AVMIT-C dataset with audio corruption
- Outperformed state-of-the-art TTA methods across multiple corrupted video datasets (AVMIT-C, AVE-C, UCF101-C, Kinetics-Sounds-C)
- Demonstrated effectiveness across different backbone networks with consistent improvements
- Showed that audio-visual semantic correlation significantly impacts performance (9.67% pseudo-label accuracy on UCF101-C vs. 78.44% on AVMIT-C)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Cross-modal semantic transfer enables robust pseudo-label generation when visual modality is degraded
- **Core assumption:** Audio cues remain semantically consistent with video content under visual corruption
- **Evidence anchors:** "map the audio-based predictions to video label spaces through large language models" [abstract]; PGM module leveraging LLM reasoning [Section III-C]
- **Break condition:** High audio-visual mismatch or silence in audio stream

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Dynamic adaptation cycles prevent error accumulation and model collapse
- **Core assumption:** Loss decrease correlates with effective adaptation; inconsistent predictions signal need for further optimization
- **Evidence anchors:** "determines the optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample based on changes in loss" [abstract]; $R_t$ condition using loss decline and cross-view consistency [Section III-D, Eq. 10]
- **Break condition:** Noisy pseudo-labels causing oscillating gradients

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Feature distribution alignment stabilizes the model manifold during online updates
- **Core assumption:** Corruption is covariate shift rather than concept shift
- **Evidence anchors:** Combines classification loss with alignment loss [Section III-D, Eq. 9]; cites ViTTA for feature alignment strategy
- **Break condition:** Severe domain shift making source statistics poor reference

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
  - **Why needed here:** Adapts frozen model using only test sample to handle distribution shifts
  - **Quick check question:** How does updating weights on a single batch of 1 (online TTA) differ from batch normalization adaptation?

- **Concept:** Cross-Modal Pseudo-Labeling
  - **Why needed here:** Uses weak supervision from audio "teacher" to train video "student" at inference time
  - **Quick check question:** What are the risks of using a frozen teacher model if test domain has different audio characteristics?

- **Concept:** Large Language Model (LLM) Reasoning
  - **Why needed here:** Bridges disjoint label spaces (AudioSet vs. Kinetics classes) via text prompts
  - **Quick check question:** Why use LLM instead of simple linear projection layer trained on source dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video Stream + Audio Extraction -> AST -> Top-K Labels -> LLM Prompt Generator -> Pseudo Video Label -> Video Model (Backbone) -> Feature Stats -> Loss Calculator ($L_{cls} + L_{align} + L_{cons}$) -> Controller (Checks conditions to loop or proceed)

- **Critical path:** Prompt Generation Module - if prompt fails to guide LLM to correct video label, pseudo-supervision becomes noise

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - *Latency vs. Accuracy:* LLM calls add significant latency and potential API costs
  - *Robustness vs. Drift:* Flexible adaptation cycle trades computation time for accuracy; high $\tau$ risks overfitting

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Semantic Drift: Model predicts "Music" or "Speech" for visual actions
  - API Timeout: Real-time pipeline stalls waiting for LLM response
  - Negative Transfer: Performance drops below source baseline on uncorrelated audio samples

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Mapping Validation: Measure pseudo-label accuracy against ground truth before adaptation
  2. Cycle Ablation: Compare fixed vs. flexible adaptation cycles on Fog corruption
  3. Silent Video Test: Run pipeline on videos with removed/replaced audio to verify adaptation condition rejects unhelpful samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can framework maintain robustness when audio modality undergoes simultaneous distribution shifts or corruptions?
- **Basis in paper:** Assumes audio is "relatively unaffected" by environmental factors [Page 2]
- **Why unresolved:** Method relies on pristine audio as stable supervisory signal
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments evaluating performance when both video and audio are corrupted

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How to distinguish semantically relevant action sounds from non-diegetic audio (e.g., background music)?
- **Basis in paper:** Identifies "Mismatch between audio and vision" as error source [Page 10, Figure 6]
- **Why unresolved:** Current method treats all high-confidence audio predictions as supervision
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies with filter mechanism for non-salient audio

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is it feasible to replace LLM query with lightweight embedding approach to reduce latency?
- **Basis in paper:** Relies on GPT-4/Claude-3 for every sample [Page 4]
- **Why unresolved:** LLM inference remains bottleneck for real-time processing
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative analysis using fixed semantic embedding matrices vs. LLM-based mapping

## Limitations

- Primary limitation is dependence on accurate audio-video semantic alignment; 9.67% baseline pseudo-label accuracy on UCF101-C indicates fragility for less correlated datasets
- LLM-based semantic transfer introduces black-box dependency that may not generalize across different video domains or cultural contexts
- Computational overhead of LLM inference (API calls, latency) not quantified, creating uncertainty about real-world deployment feasibility

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core mechanism of combining audio pseudo-labels with dynamic adaptation cycles is well-validated through controlled experiments
- **Medium Confidence:** Effectiveness of LLM-based semantic mapping demonstrated but not deeply analyzed; quality varies significantly across datasets
- **Low Confidence:** Practical deployment implications (latency, API costs, silent audio behavior) remain unexplored; limited sensitivity analysis for hyperparameters

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Modal Mapping Quality:** Conduct systematic ablation study measuring pseudo-label accuracy before adaptation across all datasets, comparing LLM-based mapping against simpler baselines

2. **Computational Overhead Analysis:** Measure end-to-end inference latency with and without LLM calls, including API response times, and calculate cost per video at scale

3. **Silent Video Robustness:** Test system on videos with artificially removed/corrupted audio to verify adaptation condition correctly identifies when audio cues are unhelpful without performance degradation
