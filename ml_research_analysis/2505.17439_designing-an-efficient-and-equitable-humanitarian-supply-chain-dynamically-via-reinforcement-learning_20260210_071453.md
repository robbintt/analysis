# Designing an efficient and equitable humanitarian supply chain dynamically via reinforcement learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.17439
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17439
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: PPO outperforms traditional heuristics (NSGA-II, PSO) in humanitarian supply chain efficiency and satisfaction rate across multiple stochastic demand scenarios.

## Executive Summary
This study applies Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to dynamically design an efficient and equitable humanitarian supply chain, addressing the need for real-time resource allocation under fluctuating demands. A cost-efficiency framework is embedded in the reward function, guiding the agent to maximize distribution efficiency while minimizing costs. PPO's hybrid binary and discrete action space controls the activation of collection centers and warehouses, and its adaptive learning optimizes satisfaction rate, efficiency, and inventory management over time. Across various stochastic demand simulations (GBM, Poisson, Merton), PPO consistently improved average satisfaction rate and efficiency, outperforming traditional heuristic algorithms like NSGA-II and PSO. Sensitivity tests confirmed PPO's robustness under diverse operational parameters. The model prioritizes equitable resource distribution, achieving higher satisfaction rates even at higher costs, demonstrating PPO's superior adaptability and decision-making in dynamic humanitarian logistics.

## Method Summary
The study employs PPO to optimize a humanitarian supply chain by dynamically deciding which collection centers and warehouses to activate and how to allocate resources to demand points. The state includes current demand, warehouse inventory, and previous allocations. Actions are binary decisions on facility activation and distribution allocations. The reward function balances efficiency and cost using logarithmic transformations. Demand is simulated using GBM, Poisson, and Merton processes. PPO is trained for 20,000 steps with a batch size of 64 and learning rate of 0.0001. The model is compared against NSGA-II and PSO across multiple runs and scenarios.

## Key Results
- PPO achieved higher average satisfaction rates than NSGA-II and PSO across all demand scenarios.
- PPO demonstrated superior cost-efficiency by balancing higher satisfaction with controlled costs.
- Sensitivity analysis showed PPO's robustness to parameter variations in demand generation and facility costs.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PPO's clipped objective function prevents large policy updates, ensuring stable learning in the dynamic humanitarian supply chain environment. The hybrid action space (binary for facility activation, discrete for resource allocation) allows the agent to make both strategic (facility selection) and tactical (distribution) decisions. The logarithmic reward function prevents reward explosion and encourages balanced trade-offs between efficiency and cost. PPO's advantage over heuristics stems from its ability to learn adaptive policies that respond to temporal demand patterns rather than relying on static optimization criteria.

## Foundational Learning
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Why needed - Stable policy updates in dynamic environments; Quick check - Verify clipping parameter ε=0.2 prevents large policy updates.
- **Logarithmic reward transformation**: Why needed - Prevents reward explosion in efficiency-cost trade-off; Quick check - Monitor reward stability during training.
- **Hybrid action space**: Why needed - Enables both strategic facility decisions and tactical resource allocation; Quick check - Verify binary actions correctly control facility activation.
- **Dirichlet distribution for allocation**: Why needed - Ensures valid probability distributions for resource splitting; Quick check - Confirm allocation vectors sum to 1.
- **Stochastic demand simulation**: Why needed - Tests robustness across different crisis patterns; Quick check - Validate demand generation parameters match specifications.
- **Multi-objective optimization baselines**: Why needed - Provides performance benchmarks; Quick check - Ensure NSGA-II and PSO use identical demand seeds.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Demand Generators -> Environment -> PPO Agent -> Reward Function -> Facility Activation & Distribution

**Critical Path**: State observation → Policy network → Binary action sampling → Environment step → Reward calculation → Value update

**Design Tradeoffs**: PPO vs. DQN - PPO chosen for stable continuous learning vs. DQN's sample inefficiency. Binary vs. continuous actions - Binary enables clear facility control but complicates gradient propagation. Log vs. linear reward - Log prevents explosion but may slow learning near zero.

**Failure Signatures**: Reward instability indicates log-transform issues or constraint violations. Low satisfaction suggests allocation logic errors in equations 16-20. Agent ignoring switching costs implies penalty weights too low.

**First Experiments**: 1) Train PPO with zero switching penalties to verify baseline performance. 2) Run ablation comparing PPO with different ε clipping values. 3) Validate constraint enforcement by checking inventory bounds after each step.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can the PPO-based model maintain its performance advantage over heuristics when trained and evaluated on real-world historical time-series demand data rather than simulated stochastic processes? The study relies on GBM, Poisson, and Merton simulations, leaving real-world efficacy unproven.

**Open Question 2**: How does the introduction of transportation lead times and delivery delays affect the agent's dynamic decision-making and the stability of the satisfaction rates? The current model assumes instant delivery, which oversimplifies real-world logistics.

**Open Question 3**: How does PPO compare to other advanced reinforcement learning architectures, such as multi-agent systems or value-based methods, in this specific humanitarian context? The study only compares against traditional heuristics, not other RL algorithms.

**Open Question 4**: Can the model effectively integrate with remote sensing technologies to process real-time environmental data for immediate crisis response? The current model uses pre-processed demand vectors, requiring architectural changes for raw sensory data integration.

## Limitations
- Unspecified PPO hyperparameters (network architecture, GAE parameters) limit reproducibility.
- Unproven performance on real-world historical demand data versus simulated scenarios.
- No comparison with other advanced reinforcement learning methods like DQN or multi-agent systems.
- Instant delivery assumption ignores real-world transportation delays and lead times.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: PPO's superior performance across multiple demand scenarios with clearly specified comparison methodology.
- **Medium confidence**: Reward function design and state representation are well-defined, though network architecture details remain unclear.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about PPO's robustness to parameter variations lack full methodological transparency.

## Next Checks
1. Implement PPO with standard architecture (2-layer MLP, 128 units) and verify reward stability with ε=0.2 clipping and λ=0.95 GAE.
2. Run ablation studies comparing PPO with and without switching penalties to confirm cost-sensitive behavior.
3. Replicate NSGA-II and PSO baselines using identical demand seeds and evaluate Pareto front quality against PPO's single-objective performance.
