# REGen: Multimodal Retrieval-Embedded Generation for Long-to-Short Video Editing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.18880
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18880
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms abstractive and extractive baselines in documentary teaser generation with coherent narratives and embedded video clips.

## Executive Summary
REGen introduces a retrieval-embedded generation framework for long-to-short video editing that generates coherent narratives with embedded video clips. The method uses a two-stage approach: first, a fine-tuned large language model generates a script with quote placeholders, then a retrieval model selects the best matching video clips from the input. The system was evaluated on documentary teaser generation, where it outperformed abstractive and extractive baselines in coherence, alignment, and realism. Objective metrics show high ROUGE scores and effective retrieval performance, while subjective surveys confirm improved narrative flow and factual grounding. The approach enables multimodal LLMs to quote external video content while maintaining story coherence.

## Method Summary
REGen is a two-stage pipeline for documentary teaser generation that combines script generation with embedded video quotations. First, a fine-tuned LLaMA model generates teaser scripts with special quote placeholders (`<SOQ>/<EOQ>` for direct quotes or `<QUOTE>` for indirect quotes) based on 10-sentence chunk summaries from the input video. Second, a fine-tuned BART model performs quote retrieval by predicting the expected quote content from surrounding narration context and retrieving the best-matching video clips using multimodal embeddings. The system uses WhisperX for ASR and speaker diarization to identify narrator vs. interview segments, and incorporates visual features through CLIP embeddings for multimodal retrieval. The final output combines generated narration, retrieved video quotations, and matched visuals using the TeaserGen pipeline.

## Key Results
- Outperforms abstractive and extractive baselines in documentary teaser generation
- High ROUGE scores and effective retrieval performance (Recall@1=5%)
- Improved narrative flow and factual grounding in subjective surveys
- Quote coverage rate and density index values closest to ground truth

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fine-Tuned LLaMA for Quote-Aware Script Generation
Fine-tuning an LLM with explicit quote placeholders enables it to learn where narrative quotations should occur, producing scripts with realistic quote distributions. The model is trained on transcripts where quotable segments (interviews) are marked with special tokens, creating a learned prior over where evidence insertions belong in a narrative structure.

### Mechanism 2: Joint Training of Quote Infilling and Retrieval via Multitask Learning
Training an encoder-decoder model to simultaneously fill quote placeholders and produce a retrieval embedding improves clip selection over sequential approaches. BART is fine-tuned with combined loss `L = L_gen + αL_ret`, where the decoder generates the expected quote content while the final hidden state of a special `<SUM>` token serves as the query vector for clip retrieval via cosine similarity.

### Mechanism 3: Multimodal Fusion for Clip Fitness Scoring
Combining text embeddings (ASR transcripts) and visual embeddings (randomly sampled frames) via a learned MLP improves retrieval of narratively supportive clips over text-only approaches. Clip fitness is calculated as the cosine similarity between the narration context embedding and the multimodal clip embedding, where visual and textual signals are weighted based on training data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: REGen extends RAG from text-only retrieval to multimodal "quotation" where retrieved video clips are embedded directly in outputs.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why standard RAG (retrieve-then-generate) cannot produce exact video quotations in outputs?

- **Concept: Multitask Learning with Contrastive Loss**
  - Why needed here: The quote retriever jointly optimizes generation (cross-entropy) and retrieval (contrastive) losses to learn embeddings that serve both tasks.
  - Quick check question: What happens to retrieval performance if α=0 in `L = L_gen + αL_ret`? (See Table 10: Recall@1 drops to 0%)

- **Concept: Speaker Diarization and ASR**
  - Why needed here: The pipeline relies on WhisperX to segment long videos into narrator vs. interview segments, defining the candidate pool for quotation.
  - Quick check question: How would the system fail if diarization mislabels an interview as narration?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** ASR/Diarization (WhisperX) -> Chunk Summary (GPT-4o) -> Script with Placeholders (Fine-tuned LLaMA) -> Quote Retrieval (Fine-tuned BART + MLP fusion) -> Narration-Visual Matching (UniVTG) -> TTS Module (TeaserGen pipeline)

- **Critical path:** ASR → Chunk Summary → Script with Placeholders → Quote Retrieval → Visual Matching → Final Video Assembly. The quote retriever is the bottleneck; its Recall@1 is only 5%, meaning most quotes are approximate matches.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - REGen-DQ (direct quotes) vs. REGen-IDQ (indirect placeholders): DQ achieves higher ROUGE; IDQ achieves higher coherence (G-Eval). Choose DQ for factual precision, IDQ for narrative smoothness.
  - Text-only vs. multimodal retrieval: QuoteRetriever-TV adds visual features but shows marginal improvement over QuoteRetriever-T (Table 3). Visual fusion adds complexity with uncertain gain.
  - Context window (128 vs. 256 tokens): Ablation shows no significant difference (Table 9), but longer context increases compute.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Low quote coverage**: If script generation produces no `<QUOTE>` tokens, the output is fully abstractive with no grounding. Check QCR metric.
  - **Repetitive clips**: If retrieval selects duplicate segments, check sliding window enforcement (Section C.3).
  - **Misaligned narration-visual**: If CLIPS-N scores are low, UniVTG matching may be failing.
  - **Domain shift**: Paper notes worse performance on lecture videos (62% preference for TeaserGen vs. 38% for REGen in Appendix H.5).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate ASR/diarization quality** on a sample of your target videos. If narrator F1 < 70%, candidate clip pool will be noisy. Paper reports 71.6% F1 on teasers, 88.7% on main documentaries (Appendix B).
  2. **Run script generation with both REGen-DQ and REGen-IDQ** on a held-out set. Compare QDI and QCR to ground-truth distribution. If DQ overlap ratio < 0.05 (Table 6), fine-tuning data may be insufficient.
  3. **Test retrieval on synthetic placeholders**: Insert `<QUOTE>` tokens at known ground-truth positions and measure Recall@1/5/10. If below paper benchmarks (5%/17.5%/30%), check embedding quality or negative sampling strategy (GroupSampler in Appendix C.4).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the framework be generalized to quote other modalities, such as audio or images, using the proposed fitness measures?
- Basis in paper: The authors state, "We plan to investigate quoting audio and images towards a more capable video editing model."
- Why unresolved: The current system is validated only on video clips, relying on specific fitness measures for audiovisual alignment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating the Quote Retriever's ability to select and insert relevant audio or image segments that support the narrative context.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does grounding the script generation model with information about all quotable materials improve narrative cohesion?
- Basis in paper: The authors hypothesize that misplacement risks "may be alleviated by grounding the first-stage script generation model with information about all the quotable materials."
- Why unresolved: Providing all quote candidates as context is currently "technically challenging for LLaMA-based models due to their limited context-window."
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using models with larger context windows or RAG techniques during the script generation phase to assess narrative improvement.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the method be adapted for domains where speaker diarization is ineffective, such as lecture recordings?
- Basis in paper: The authors note the method "relies on successful segmentation... through speaker diarization that might not be applicable to other domains such as lecture recordings."
- Why unresolved: The system currently assumes a distinct separation between narrator and interviewees, which may not exist in single-speaker or continuous-lecture environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validating the framework on educational datasets using segmentation techniques that do not rely on speaker diarization.

## Limitations

- Domain transferability is uncertain as the method relies on documentary-specific quote distributions learned from the DocumentaryNet corpus.
- Multimodal fusion efficacy is questionable since text+visual retrieval shows only marginal improvement over text-only retrieval.
- Temporal coherence beyond quotes is not explicitly modeled, potentially causing abrupt cuts or chronological inconsistencies.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Script generation with quote placeholders; multimodal fusion architecture; overall teaser coherence
- **Medium Confidence**: Quote retrieval performance; domain generalization; narrative alignment metrics
- **Low Confidence**: Visual-text embedding complementarity; TTS/narration-visual matching; computational efficiency claims

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Generalization Test**: Apply REGen to non-documentary content (e.g., lecture videos, product reviews) and compare performance to TeaserGen baseline. Measure quote coverage, coherence, and factual alignment.

2. **Ablation of Multimodal Fusion**: Train QuoteRetriever-T (text-only) on the same data and compare retrieval performance. If visual features add <2% Recall@1, simplify the pipeline.

3. **Temporal Consistency Evaluation**: Analyze assembled teasers for chronological errors or abrupt transitions. If >20% of clips violate temporal flow, incorporate explicit temporal ordering constraints in retrieval.
