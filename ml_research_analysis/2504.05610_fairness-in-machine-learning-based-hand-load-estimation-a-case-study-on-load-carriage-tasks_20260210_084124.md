# Fairness in Machine Learning-based Hand Load Estimation: A Case Study on Load Carriage Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.05610
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05610
- Reference count: 10
- Conventional ML models exhibited significant sex-based prediction disparities when trained on imbalanced datasets

## Executive Summary
This study addresses algorithmic bias in machine learning models used to predict hand-carried box weights from gait patterns captured by inertial sensors. Conventional ML models (k-NN, SVM, Random Forest) exhibited significant sex-based prediction disparities when trained on imbalanced datasets, particularly underestimating loads carried by males. To mitigate this bias, the authors developed a Debiasing VAE (DVAE) that separates sex-agnostic and sex-specific latent features in motion data, enabling fair predictions across sexes.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a Debiasing VAE (DVAE) framework to address sex-based prediction disparities in hand load estimation from gait patterns. The DVAE architecture separates motion data into sex-agnostic and sex-specific latent features, enabling fair predictions across sexes. The model was trained and evaluated on gait data from 30 participants (15 male, 15 female) carrying boxes of varying weights, with performance compared against conventional ML models including k-NN, SVM, and Random Forest. Fairness metrics (SP, PRD, NRD) were used alongside MAE to assess both prediction accuracy and bias mitigation.

## Key Results
- DVAE achieved superior performance with MAE of 3.42, outperforming k-NN (MAE = 6.13) and Random Forest (MAE = 4.89)
- DVAE maintained fairness metrics (SP, PRD, NRD) closest to ideal values across varying training ratios
- Conventional models exhibited significant sex-based prediction disparities, particularly underestimating loads carried by males

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The DVAE approach works by explicitly separating sex-agnostic features from sex-specific variations in the latent space representation. This architectural design allows the model to learn weight estimation patterns that are independent of demographic attributes while still preserving useful information for accurate predictions. By disentangling these components, the model avoids the confounding effects that lead to biased predictions when sex imbalance exists in training data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Latent space separation**: Why needed - To decouple demographic-sensitive features from task-relevant features; Quick check - Verify that separated latent representations maintain predictive power while reducing demographic correlation
- **Fairness metrics (SP, PRD, NRD)**: Why needed - To quantify and monitor algorithmic bias beyond traditional accuracy measures; Quick check - Compare metric values against established fairness benchmarks
- **VAE architecture**: Why needed - To learn probabilistic latent representations that can be manipulated for debiasing; Quick check - Ensure reconstruction quality remains acceptable after modification

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Inertial sensors -> Data preprocessing -> DVAE encoder -> Latent space separation -> DVAE decoder -> Weight prediction
- **Critical path**: Sensor data capture → Feature extraction → DVAE processing → Weight estimation → Fairness evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: The separation of latent features trades some model complexity for improved fairness, requiring careful balance between maintaining predictive accuracy and achieving bias mitigation
- **Failure signatures**: Degraded performance on minority groups, increased MAE during domain shifts, latent space entanglement re-emerging over time
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Test prediction accuracy on held-out sex-balanced test sets, 2) Evaluate fairness metrics across different training ratios, 3) Compare latent space disentanglement quality using mutual information metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to other demographic variables beyond sex remains uncertain
- Performance on diverse gait patterns and load carriage conditions not represented in study dataset is unknown
- Small sample size and controlled laboratory conditions limit external validity to real-world occupational settings

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the comparative performance improvements of DVAE over baseline models for the specific task and dataset used
- **Medium confidence** in the broader applicability of the fairness framework to other biomechanical estimation tasks
- **Low confidence** in long-term stability of bias mitigation across extended use periods and varying environmental conditions

## Next Checks
1. Test DVAE performance on independent datasets with different demographic compositions and task variations
2. Evaluate model robustness to sensor noise and environmental factors common in workplace settings
3. Assess temporal stability of fairness metrics over extended deployment periods with repeated measurements
