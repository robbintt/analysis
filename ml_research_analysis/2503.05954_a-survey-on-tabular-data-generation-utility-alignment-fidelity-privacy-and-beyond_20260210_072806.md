# A Survey on Tabular Data Generation: Utility, Alignment, Fidelity, Privacy, and Beyond

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.05954
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05954
- **Reference count:** 7
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive survey of deep generative models for tabular data synthesis focusing on four key requirements

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of deep generative models for tabular data synthesis, focusing on four key requirements: utility (predictive performance on downstream tasks), alignment (adherence to domain-specific constraints), fidelity (statistical similarity to real data), and privacy (protection against re-identification and disclosure). The authors categorize existing methods by the primary requirement they address and the underlying model architecture (e.g., GANs, diffusion models, LLMs). They also summarize relevant evaluation metrics for each requirement and discuss future directions, highlighting the need for models that balance multiple competing objectives. The survey serves as a user guide for selecting appropriate models and evaluation methods based on specific needs.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews and categorizes existing tabular data generation methods based on their primary focus (utility, alignment, fidelity, or privacy) and underlying architecture (GANs, diffusion models, LLMs). For each category, the authors summarize key approaches, evaluation metrics, and trade-offs. They also discuss emerging trends and future directions, emphasizing the need for models that can simultaneously address multiple requirements. The survey is structured as a practical guide for practitioners to select appropriate methods based on their specific needs.

## Key Results
- Categorization of tabular data generation methods by primary requirement (utility, alignment, fidelity, privacy) and architecture (GANs, diffusion models, LLMs)
- Identification of alignment as a critical emerging requirement in tabular data generation
- Recognition of the gap in models that simultaneously satisfy all four requirements
- Summary of evaluation metrics for each requirement
- Discussion of future directions and opportunities for improving evaluation methods and developing more versatile models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
This survey works by providing a structured framework for understanding and comparing different tabular data generation approaches. By categorizing methods based on their primary focus and architecture, it helps practitioners identify the most suitable techniques for their specific needs. The emphasis on four key requirements (utility, alignment, fidelity, privacy) reflects the complex trade-offs inherent in synthetic data generation. The survey's practical orientation, including guidance on evaluation metrics and model selection, makes it a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners in the field.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tabular data characteristics**: Why needed - Understanding the unique challenges of generating synthetic tabular data (mixed data types, correlations, constraints); Quick check - Can you explain the difference between numerical and categorical data in tabular format?
- **Generative adversarial networks (GANs)**: Why needed - GANs are a fundamental architecture for many tabular data generation methods; Quick check - Describe the basic GAN architecture and its components
- **Diffusion models**: Why needed - Diffusion models represent a newer approach to data generation with unique properties; Quick check - Explain the basic principle of diffusion models and how they differ from GANs
- **Privacy-preserving data generation**: Why needed - Ensuring privacy is crucial for real-world applications of synthetic data; Quick check - What are the key privacy risks in tabular data generation and how can they be mitigated?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Preprocessing -> Model Architecture Selection -> Training -> Evaluation -> Post-processing

**Critical Path**: Data Preprocessing -> Model Architecture Selection -> Training -> Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Utility vs. Privacy (improving utility may reduce privacy), Fidelity vs. Alignment (perfect fidelity may violate domain constraints), Model complexity vs. Training efficiency

**Failure Signatures**: Poor utility (low predictive performance on downstream tasks), Privacy breaches (re-identification of synthetic records), Alignment violations (generated data violates domain constraints), Low fidelity (synthetic data statistically differs from real data)

**First Experiments**:
1. Generate synthetic data using a basic GAN architecture and evaluate its utility on a simple classification task
2. Apply alignment constraints to synthetic data and measure the impact on fidelity and utility
3. Implement a privacy evaluation metric and assess the privacy-preserving capabilities of different generation methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The rapidly evolving nature of this field means some recent advances may not be fully captured
- The survey primarily focuses on deep learning-based approaches, potentially overlooking techniques from other domains
- The discussion of privacy requirements may not fully account for emerging privacy regulations and their implications

## Confidence
- High confidence in the categorization of existing methods by their primary focus and underlying architecture
- Medium confidence in the evaluation of trade-offs between different requirements due to lack of standardized benchmarks
- Medium confidence in identified future directions given the fast-paced nature of developments in this area

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic literature review to identify and incorporate any significant advancements in tabular data generation techniques published within the last 6 months
2. Perform a comparative analysis using a standardized benchmark suite to evaluate the performance of selected models across all four requirements (utility, alignment, fidelity, privacy) simultaneously
3. Survey practitioners and domain experts to validate the practical relevance and applicability of the identified requirements and their relative importance in real-world scenarios
