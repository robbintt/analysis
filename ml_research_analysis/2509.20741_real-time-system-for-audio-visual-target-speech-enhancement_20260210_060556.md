## Executive Summary
This paper presents RAVEN, the first publicly available real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system that runs entirely on CPU hardware. The system addresses the challenge of extracting clean speech from complex acoustic environments with environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and singing voices. RAVEN uses a mask-based late-fusion architecture that combines visual embeddings from a pretrained visual speech recognition model (VSRiW) with audio features through a CNN-LSTM network to generate magnitude masks for speech enhancement.

## Method Summary
RAVEN employs a mask-based late-fusion architecture that processes audio and visual inputs separately before combining them. The audio stream computes magnitude spectrograms from microphone input, processes them through a 15-layer CNN, and concatenates the resulting features with visual embeddings. The visual stream crops the mouth region from webcam video, passes it through a frozen pretrained visual encoder (VSRiW), and upsamples the 512-dimensional embeddings to match the audio stream's temporal resolution. These concatenated features feed into a uni-directional LSTM followed by fully connected layers to generate a magnitude mask, which is applied element-wise to the mixture spectrogram. The enhanced magnitude is combined with the original mixture phase for reconstruction via ISTFT.

## Key Results
- First real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system available for public demonstration
- Operates with 120ms algorithmic latency (3 frames at 25 fps)
- Runs entirely on CPU hardware using Python with PyAudio and OpenCV
- Enables live audio-visual speech enhancement through microphone and webcam setup

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Visual lip embeddings disambiguate target speaker from interfering speakers
- Mechanism: The pretrained visual encoder (VSRiW) compresses lip movement dynamics into 512-dimensional embeddings that correlate with phoneme production. When concatenated with audio features before the LSTM, these embeddings provide a speaker-anchoring signal that helps the mask predictor assign higher weights to time-frequency bins belonging to the visually-identified speaker.
- Core assumption: Lip movements of the target speaker are consistently extractable and temporally aligned with their speech acoustics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "uses pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition model to encode lip movement information"
  - [section 2.1] "the visual stream first crops the mouth region from the input video and passes it through a pretrained visual encoder to extract lip movement embeddings"
  - [corpus] Related work (RT-LA-VoCE, arXiv:2509.20741 references) shows similar visual-audio fusion benefits, though direct comparison data not provided in this demo paper
- Break condition: If mouth region is occluded, poorly lit, or speaker is off-angle, visual embeddings degrade and the system reverts toward audio-only performance levels.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Late fusion after separate modality-specific encoding preserves specialized representations
- Mechanism: Audio passes through a 15-layer CNN operating on STFT magnitude spectrograms (257 frequency bins × 500 frames), while visual embeddings are extracted independently. Upsampling visual embeddings from 25 fps to 100 fps aligns temporal resolution before concatenation. This allows the CNN to learn audio-specific spectral patterns while the pretrained visual encoder remains frozen with its learned lip-reading representations.
- Core assumption: The pretrained visual encoder generalizes sufficiently from its training distribution (GRID corpus) to the demo conditions without fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] "The concatenated audio-visual features are subsequently fed into a uni-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network"
  - [section 2.1] "To align the audio and visual streams, the visual embeddings are upsampled to 100 fps before they are concatenated"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence for late vs. early fusion comparison in this specific architecture
- Break condition: If temporal alignment between audio and video drifts (e.g., webcam/audio interface clock skew), fusion quality degrades.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mask-based spectrogram estimation with mixture phase reuse enables computationally tractable real-time operation
- Mechanism: Rather than predicting complex spectrograms directly (which would require phase estimation), the model predicts a magnitude mask (sigmoid-bounded 0-1) applied element-wise to the mixture magnitude. The original mixture phase is reused for reconstruction via ISTFT. This reduces output dimensionality and computational load, enabling CPU-only real-time inference.
- Core assumption: Phase distortions from using mixture phase are perceptually tolerable for the target use cases (video calls, hearing aids).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] "This mask is applied element-wise to the magnitude spectrogram of the noisy input mixture"
  - [section 2.1] "To reconstruct the enhanced speech waveform, the estimated clean magnitude spectrogram is combined with the phase of the original noisy mixture"
  - [corpus] DeepFilterGAN (arXiv:2505.23515) suggests alternative approaches address phase more explicitly, but increase complexity
- Break condition: In highly reverberant environments, phase errors become more audible; mask-based approaches may produce artifacts.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and spectrograms
  - Why needed here: The entire audio processing pipeline operates on time-frequency representations. Understanding windowing (Hann), hop size, and frequency bins is essential for debugging latency and spectral artifacts.
  - Quick check question: Given a 16 kHz sample rate, 400-sample Hann window, and 160-sample hop, what is the time resolution in milliseconds per STFT frame?

- Concept: LSTM temporal modeling and causality
  - Why needed here: The uni-directional LSTM processes sequential features while respecting real-time constraints. Understanding hidden state propagation is critical for modifying the architecture or debugging temporal inconsistencies.
  - Quick check question: Why would a bidirectional LSTM violate the 120ms latency constraint even if inference were faster?

- Concept: Transfer learning with frozen pretrained encoders
  - Why needed here: The VSRiW visual encoder is used "off-the-shelf" without fine-tuning. Understanding what features transfer and what domain gaps exist informs deployment expectations.
  - Quick check question: If the target speaker's face is partially occluded (e.g., wearing a mask), would you expect the pretrained encoder to still produce useful embeddings? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
Webcam → Mouth Crop → VSRiW Encoder (frozen) → 512-dim embeddings → Upsample 25→100 fps
Microphone → STFT → Magnitude Spectrogram → 15-layer CNN → Audio features → Concatenate
Concatenated features → Uni-directional LSTM → 3 FC layers → Sigmoid → Magnitude Mask
Mixture Magnitude ← element-wise multiply ← Magnitude Mask → Estimated Clean Magnitude
Mixture Phase ← combine ← Estimated Clean Magnitude → Complex Spectrogram → ISTFT → Enhanced Audio Output

- Critical path: The 5-frame visual buffer (200ms of video) with 2-frame lookahead determines minimum algorithmic latency of 120ms. The visual encoder's receptive field is the bottleneck—reducing it would require retraining or a different pretrained model.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Late fusion vs. early fusion: Late fusion allows using frozen pretrained visual encoders but may miss low-level audio-visual correlations.
  - Mask-based vs. waveform synthesis: Mask-based is computationally lighter (CPU-friendly) but inherits mixture phase errors.
  - 25 fps video vs. higher frame rates: Lower fps reduces computation but limits temporal precision of lip movement tracking.

- Failure signatures:
  - Silent output or muffled speech: Check magnitude mask values (may be too aggressive near zero).
  - Wrong speaker enhanced: Visual crop may be tracking wrong face; verify mouth region detection.
  - Latency spikes >40ms: Check if processing is blocking; audio buffer may be accumulating.
  - Static noise after enhancement: CNN may not have learned noise-specific masks; verify training data included similar noise types.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablate visual input (replace embeddings with zeros) and measure degradation in multi-speaker scenarios to quantify visual contribution.
  2. Profile per-component latency (STFT, CNN, visual encoder, LSTM, ISTFT) to identify optimization targets.
  3. Test with varying SNR levels (-10 dB to +10 dB) and log mask statistics to understand dynamic range usage.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would incorporating explicit phase estimation or complex spectral masking improve enhancement quality compared to the current magnitude-only mask approach?
- Basis: [explicit] The paper states the "estimated clean magnitude spectrogram is combined with the phase of the original noisy mixture" and uses PSA loss to "mitigate for the loss of phase information during training."
- Why unresolved: Mask-based approaches typically avoid phase estimation due to its difficulty; the paper acknowledges this as a limitation addressed only partially through loss design.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation using PESQ, SI-SNR, and perceptual metrics between magnitude-only and complex masking variants on standardized benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the visual encoder's pretraining on GRID (a controlled laboratory dataset) limit its effectiveness for speech enhancement in unconstrained real-world conditions?
- Basis: [inferred] The paper uses a visual encoder "trained on GRID" (controlled setting) but deploys it on VoxCeleb2 and claims generalization to diverse real-world noise; GRID's controlled nature may not transfer optimally to wild conditions.
- Why unresolved: Domain transfer from visual speech recognition pretraining to speech enhancement fine-tuning, and from controlled to unconstrained environments, remains understudied.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing visual encoders pretrained on different datasets (GRID vs. VoxCeleb2 vs. AV-specific data) on out-of-domain test sets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the 2-frame (80ms) visual lookahead be reduced while maintaining enhancement performance?
- Basis: [explicit] The system has "a receptive field of 5, which includes a 2-frame lookahead" contributing to 120ms total algorithmic latency, but the tradeoff between lookahead and performance is not analyzed.
- Why unresolved: The lookahead requirement is inherited from the pretrained VSRiW model architecture; causal visual encoders with comparable representation quality have not been explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of visual encoders with varying receptive fields (1, 2, 3, 5 frames) showing SI-SNR and perceptual quality curves against latency.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How robust is the system to visual domain challenges such as partial face occlusion, extreme head poses, or poor lighting conditions?
- Basis: [inferred] The system relies on mouth region cropping but the paper does not address failure modes when visual input is degraded or unreliable.
- Why unresolved: Audio-visual systems often assume clean visual input; robustness to visual degradation is critical for real-world deployment (smart glasses, hearing aids) but unexamined here.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on synthetic and real datasets with controlled visual degradations (occlusion masks, pose variations, lighting changes) with audio-only fallback comparisons.

## Limitations
- Performance in scenarios with severe visual occlusion, extreme lighting conditions, or significant camera angles remains untested
- Reliance on frozen pretrained visual encoder trained on GRID corpus may limit generalization to diverse speaker populations
- Mask-based approach inherits phase errors from mixture signal, potentially problematic in highly reverberant environments
- Does not address multi-face scenarios where visual encoder might track wrong speaker

## Confidence
- High confidence in computational architecture and real-time feasibility claims (120ms algorithmic latency, 40ms processing latency, 16ms frame duration)
- Medium confidence in effectiveness of visual embeddings for speaker disambiguation (lacking quantitative ablation studies or comparative performance metrics)
- Medium confidence in generalizability of pretrained VSRiW encoder (assumes transfer learning success without validation on diverse conditions)

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study validation**: Systematically disable the visual stream (replace embeddings with zeros) and measure performance degradation across multiple interference conditions including single speaker with noise, two speakers, and speech with singing or clapping. Compare PESQ and STOI metrics to quantify the contribution of visual information.

2. **Visual robustness testing**: Evaluate system performance with controlled visual degradations including 50% mouth occlusion, varying lighting conditions (0-500 lux), and speaker off-axis angles (0-45 degrees). Measure mask prediction accuracy and output audio quality to establish operational boundaries.

3. **Phase error characterization**: Conduct listening tests comparing the current mask-based approach with a complex spectrogram prediction baseline (if computationally feasible) or analyze phase coherence metrics across different reverberation times (T60 = 0.2s to 0.8s). Identify specific acoustic scenarios where phase reuse introduces unacceptable artifacts.
