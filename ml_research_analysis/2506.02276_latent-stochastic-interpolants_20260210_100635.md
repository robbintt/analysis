# Latent Stochastic Interpolants

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.02276
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02276
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces LSI, a framework for joint training of encoder, decoder, and latent generative models using a continuous-time ELBO, achieving FID scores comparable to observation-space models with up to 73.6% reduction in sampling FLOPs on ImageNet.

## Executive Summary
Latent Stochastic Interpolants (LSI) extends Stochastic Interpolants to enable joint training of encoder, decoder, and generative models in a latent space. By deriving an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) in continuous time, LSI allows scalable end-to-end optimization while preserving the flexibility and likelihood control of the original SI framework. The method constructs a diffusion bridge between a prior and an encoder-defined posterior, enabling simulation-free training. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that LSI achieves generation quality comparable to observation-space diffusion models but with significantly lower computational cost during sampling.

## Method Summary
LSI introduces a continuous-time ELBO objective for joint training of three components: an encoder mapping observations to latents, a decoder mapping latents back to observations, and a latent Stochastic Interpolant (SI) model governing the evolution of latents over continuous time. The generative process is formulated as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) in latent space. A key innovation is the construction of a tractable variational posterior via a diffusion bridge, which allows direct sampling of latents at any time without simulating an SDE. This enables simulation-free training with an ELBO combining reconstruction and dynamics-matching terms. The method supports flexible priors, classifier-free guidance, and controllable diversity during sampling.

## Key Results
- LSI achieves FID scores comparable to observation-space diffusion models (e.g., 3.76 FID at 128×128 resolution on ImageNet).
- Sampling requires up to 73.6% fewer FLOPs compared to observation-space models, primarily due to cheaper latent-space operations.
- Joint training with appropriate loss weighting (β) improves performance by approximately 17% compared to independently trained components.
- The framework supports flexible sampling strategies, including deterministic ODE sampling and stochastic sampling with controllable diversity.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** An ELBO objective can be derived in continuous-time for joint training of encoder, decoder, and latent SI models without requiring direct sample access from both prior and target distributions.
- **Mechanism:** LSI formulates the generative process as an SDE in latent space (Eq. 1). It uses a diffusion bridge (conditioned on the encoded observation z₁ at t=1 and a prior sample z₀ at t=0) to construct a tractable variational posterior that allows direct sampling of zₜ at any time without simulating an SDE. This enables the derivation of a scalable ELBO (Eq. 3, 16), which combines a reconstruction term with a dynamics-matching regularization term.
- **Core assumption:** The variational posterior's drift and dispersion are simplified to a linear form (Eq. 6: h(zₜ, t) ≡ hₜzₜ, σ(zₜ, t) ≡ σₜ). This ensures Gaussian transition densities, which are necessary for the closed-form conditional density p(zₜ|z₁, z₀) and simulation-free sampling.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We achieve this by developing a principled Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective derived directly in continuous time."
  - [section 3] "Instead, we explicitly construct the drift h in eq. (2) such that zₜ can be sampled directly without simulation for any time t."
  - [corpus] The core ELBO derivation appears novel; related corpus work focuses on finite-time convergence or physics applications, not this specific variational formulation in latent space.
- **Break condition:** If the true posterior dynamics are highly non-linear or multi-modal such that the linear diffusion bridge cannot approximate them well, the variational approximation becomes poor, leading to a loose ELBO and suboptimal joint training.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Operating in a learned latent space significantly reduces computational cost for sampling.
- **Mechanism:** In LSI, the computationally intensive encoder is used only during training. During sampling, the process involves only the decoder (once, at the end) and the latent SI model (for each sampling step). Since the latent space is lower-dimensional and the latent model requires fewer FLOPs per forward pass, total sampling FLOPs are dramatically reduced.
- **Core assumption:** The joint training process successfully learns a latent space where the generative process is simpler and more efficient than in observation space, without sacrificing output quality.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Experiments on ImageNet show that LSI achieves FID scores comparable to observation-space models... while requiring significantly fewer FLOPs for sampling—up to 73.6% reduction."
  - [table 1] Shows a clear breakdown of FLOPs, demonstrating the latent model is the cheapest component during sampling.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers contradict this; efficiency gains from latent-space modeling are a known principle.
- **Break condition:** If the encoder/decoder pair requires excessive capacity to maintain reconstruction quality, the overall efficiency gains from the cheaper latent model may be diminished.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Joint end-to-end optimization of all three components improves final generation performance compared to a staged or independently trained approach.
- **Mechanism:** The single ELBO objective (Eq. 16) provides a unified loss. The weighting parameter β allows the encoder to adapt its representations to be not just good for reconstruction (term 1) but also well-aligned with the dynamics required by the latent SI model (term 2). This joint optimization shapes the latent space to be more amenable to the generative process.
- **Core assumption:** There is a beneficial trade-off between reconstruction quality and the regularity of the latent space for generative modeling. Forcing the encoder to adapt (via β > 0) creates a latent distribution that is easier to transform from the prior, even if it slightly hurts pure reconstruction.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Joint training with appropriate loss weighting improves performance by approximately 17%."
  - [figure 1] "FID improves as β increases, going from 4.53 (for β → 0) to 3.75... for β = 0.0001."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; the role of β is a specific finding of this paper.
- **Break condition:** If β is too high, the encoder creates a representation that satisfies the generative process at the expense of reconstruction quality, leading to blurry or inaccurate images and increasing FID.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) for Generative Modeling**
  - **Why needed here:** LSI's core contribution is formulating the latent generative process as an SDE (Eq. 1). Without understanding how SDEs model data evolution over continuous time, the paper's central mechanism is opaque.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain, in simple terms, how a model that describes the random evolution of a particle over time can be used to generate data samples?

- **Concept: Variational Inference and the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire training objective is framed as maximizing an ELBO (Eq. 3). This concept provides the theoretical justification for the loss function and connects LSI to broader frameworks like VAEs.
  - **Quick check question:** Why do we optimize a lower bound on the log-likelihood instead of the log-likelihood itself?

- **Concept: Diffusion Models and Latent Variable Models**
  - **Why needed here:** LSI is presented as a synthesis of diffusion models and latent variable models (like VAEs). Familiarity with both (e.g., how LDMs work) is critical to understanding LSI's place in the landscape and its advantages.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key limitations of operating diffusion models directly in pixel space that latent variable models aim to address?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Image → **Encoder** → z₁ → **Latent SI Model** (with prior z₀ and time t) → z₁ → **Decoder** → Generated Image

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Training:** Image → **Encoder** → z₁. Sample z₀ from prior and zₜ via bridge. Feed zₜ, t, class label → **Latent SI Model** → drift prediction. Compute ELBO loss (Eq. 16). Backpropagate to update all three components.
  2. **Sampling:** Sample z₀ from prior. Run SDE solver (Eq. 18) using **Latent SI Model** to get z₁. Feed z₁ → **Decoder** → Generated Image.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **β weighting:** High β prioritizes generative smoothness (lower FID) at the cost of reconstruction quality (lower PSNR). Low β (or β→0) decouples training, acting like a pre-trained autoencoder but with suboptimal generation.
  - **Encoder stochasticity (c):** A deterministic encoder (c=0) performs poorly. Increased noise (higher c) helps, but too much degrades performance.
  - **Interpolant Parameterization:** The paper empirically finds `InterpFlow` (Eq. 17) is more stable and performant than `OrigFlow`, `NoisePred`, or `Denoising` alternatives.
  - **Model capacity split:** Parameters can be moved between the Latent SI Model and the Encoder/Decoder. Joint training (β > 0) allows the model to maintain performance even if the Latent SI Model is made smaller, reducing sampling FLOPs.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High gradient variance / NaNs during training:** Likely using the `OrigFlow` parameterization or other unstable forms. Switch to `InterpFlow`.
  - **Good reconstruction, poor FID:** The β weighting is too low, failing to align the latent space with the generative process.
  - **Poor FID with deterministic encoder:** The encoder is deterministic (c=0). Introduce stochasticity.
  - **Poor FID with high β:** The encoder is over-regularized, degrading reconstruction quality too much.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce key FID/efficiency tradeoff:** Train an LSI model and an observation-space SI model with comparable parameters on a subset of ImageNet. Verify that LSI achieves similar FID with a reported reduction in sampling FLOPs.
  2. **Ablate β:** Train models with β=0 (independent training) and β=0.0001 (from paper's optimal range). Plot FID and reconstruction PSNR to confirm the trade-off curve shown in Fig. 1.
  3. **Test sampling flexibility:** Using a trained LSI model, qualitatively demonstrate the supported sampling strategies: (a) deterministic sampling via the probability flow ODE, (b) stochastic sampling with different γ values, and (c) classifier-free guidance with different λ values.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the variational posterior approximation in LSI be generalized to support non-linear drift terms (h_φ) or non-Gaussian transitions without necessitating expensive SDE simulation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Conclusion notes that to achieve scalable training, the method makes "simplifying assumptions for the variational posterior approximation" (specifically linear drift), which the authors describe as restrictive despite good empirical performance.
- Why unresolved: The current derivation relies on linearity to ensure Gaussian transition densities for simulation-free training; relaxing this likely requires new theoretical bounds or numerical integrators.
- What evidence would resolve it: A derivation of a simulation-free ELBO for a non-linear posterior or a demonstration of improved sample quality/diversity using a more flexible variational family without significantly increased training cost.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why do models with learned encoder variances (Σ_θ(x)) underperform compared to models with fixed noise scalars, and can this be remedied?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 6, the authors observe regarding the encoder noise scale: "While learned Σ_θ(x) (dashed line) performs well, fixed c models achieved higher FID."
- Why unresolved: The paper reports the empirical result but does not analyze the optimization dynamics or representational issues causing the learned variance to be less effective than a simple scalar hyperparameter.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of the gradient variance or latent space geometry for learned variance encoders, or a modified training objective that allows learned variance to match or exceed fixed variance performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does extending the LSI framework to hierarchical latent structures yield improvements in log-likelihood or compression efficiency compared to the single-layer model tested?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] In Related Work, the authors cite NVAE for its "deep hierarchical latent representations" but implement LSI using a single latent space (e.g., 32x32x16), leaving this architectural dimension unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on establishing the foundational continuous-time ELBO for a single latent layer; combining continuous-time dynamics with hierarchical dependencies adds significant complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing a hierarchical LSI implementation against the single-layer baseline on metrics like FID and bits-per-dimension (BPD).

## Limitations
- The variational posterior approximation relies on simplifying assumptions (linear drift) that may not capture complex data distributions well.
- The optimal β weighting and encoder noise scale (c) require empirical tuning and may not generalize across datasets.
- The framework has not been tested with hierarchical latent structures, leaving potential performance gains unexplored.

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the mechanism of deriving a tractable ELBO for joint training in continuous time, supported by explicit derivations and clear empirical validation.
- **Medium confidence** in the claimed computational efficiency gains, as FLOPs reduction depends heavily on latent dimensionality and encoder/decoder complexity, which vary with architecture choices.
- **Medium confidence** in the performance improvement from joint optimization, as the β-weighting effect is demonstrated but the ablation study is limited to a single dataset and model scale.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the β-ablation study on a different dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) to test whether the joint training benefit holds across domains.
2. Perform an ablation of the SDE dispersion coefficient σ to determine its sensitivity and impact on both training stability and final FID scores.
3. Benchmark LSI against other latent-space generative models (e.g., Latent Diffusion Models) under identical computational budgets to isolate efficiency claims.
