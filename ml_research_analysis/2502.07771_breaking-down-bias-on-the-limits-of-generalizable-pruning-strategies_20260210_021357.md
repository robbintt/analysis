# Breaking Down Bias: On The Limits of Generalizable Pruning Strategies

## Quick Facts

- This paper examines how pruning can reduce racial bias in LLMs and whether such mitigation strategies generalize across contexts.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the effectiveness of pruning strategies for reducing racial bias in large language models and examines whether these strategies generalize across different contexts. The authors find that neuron-level pruning is more effective than attention-head pruning for bias reduction, with inlier ratio ≥ 0.98 across all pruning strategies, indicating preserved model functionality. However, pruning effectiveness sharply declines when training and test contexts differ, with strategies trained on financial bias reducing commercial transaction bias by only 40%. The analysis reveals that biased neurons are concentrated in later layers, particularly in MLP subcomponents, with limited overlap (12-16%) across different bias scenarios.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a systematic evaluation of pruning strategies for bias mitigation in large language models. The authors conduct experiments using LLaMA models, applying both neuron-level and attention-head pruning to reduce racial bias. They evaluate pruning effectiveness using the CrowS-Pairs bias detection framework across multiple contexts including financial and commercial transactions. The study measures both bias reduction and model functionality preservation through inlier ratios, which must exceed 0.98 to ensure minimal performance degradation. The analysis examines the distribution of biased neurons across model layers and subcomponents, and investigates the overlap of biased neurons between different bias scenarios to assess generalizability.

## Key Results
- Neuron-level pruning outperforms attention-head pruning for bias reduction with inlier ratio ≥ 0.98 across all pruning strategies
- Pruning effectiveness drops significantly when training and test contexts differ, with 40% reduction in commercial transaction bias when using financial bias training
- Biased neurons show limited overlap (12-16%) across different bias scenarios and concentrate in later layers, particularly MLP subcomponents

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of neuron-level pruning over attention-head pruning stems from the localized nature of bias representation in LLMs. Bias appears to be encoded at the neuron level rather than distributed across attention mechanisms, making direct neuron removal more targeted and effective. The concentration of biased neurons in later MLP layers suggests that bias emerges from the model's final transformation stages where contextual understanding is refined. However, the limited overlap between bias scenarios indicates that racial bias is not uniformly represented across contexts but rather manifests through context-specific neural pathways, explaining why generalizable pruning strategies show reduced effectiveness when applied across different domains.

## Foundational Learning
- Pruning strategies: Selective removal of model components to reduce bias while preserving functionality
- Inlier ratio: Metric measuring model performance preservation (≥0.98 indicates minimal degradation)
- CrowS-Pairs framework: Bias detection method used to evaluate pruning effectiveness
- MLP subcomponents: Multi-layer perceptron layers where biased neurons concentrate
- Attention-head pruning: Removal of attention heads versus neuron-level pruning
- Context-specific bias: Finding that racial bias varies across domains rather than being uniformly represented
- Neuron-level bias encoding: Bias manifests at individual neuron level rather than through attention mechanisms

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input -> Token Embeddings -> Encoder Layers (Attention + MLP) -> Output
Critical path: Token embeddings flow through attention and MLP subcomponents in each layer
Design tradeoffs: Neuron-level pruning preserves more functionality but may be computationally expensive; attention-head pruning is simpler but less effective
Failure signatures: Significant performance degradation (inlier ratio < 0.98) or ineffective bias reduction
First experiments:
1. Baseline bias measurement using CrowS-Pairs across financial and commercial contexts
2. Apply neuron-level pruning to financial bias and measure effectiveness on commercial bias
3. Analyze neuron overlap between different bias scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several key open questions: How can pruning strategies be adapted to handle domain-specific variations in bias representation? What architectural modifications could enable more generalizable bias mitigation across contexts? Can the concentration of biased neurons in later layers inform more targeted intervention strategies? How do different model scales and architectures affect the distribution and generalizability of bias?

## Limitations
- Results based on limited financial and commercial contexts; generalizability to other domains uncertain
- No statistical significance tests reported for differences in pruning effectiveness
- Analysis based on single model architecture (LLaMA) without testing across different architectures
- Limited evaluation of long-term effects of pruning on model capabilities beyond immediate functionality metrics
- Focus on racial bias without examining intersectional biases or other forms of discrimination

## Confidence
- High confidence: neuron-level pruning outperforms attention-head pruning for bias reduction; inlier ratios indicate preserved model functionality
- Medium confidence: biased neurons concentrate in later layers and MLP subcomponents; limited overlap between bias scenarios
- Low confidence: racial bias is partially domain-specific; generalizable mitigation strategies have limited effectiveness

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the pruning experiments across multiple model architectures (GPT, Mistral, Claude) and bias detection frameworks to test robustness of findings
2. Conduct statistical significance testing on pruning effectiveness differences between training and test contexts with confidence intervals
3. Perform ablation studies to determine whether layer concentration findings hold when controlling for model depth, parameter count, and training methodology
4. Investigate whether alternative bias mitigation approaches like fine-tuning or adversarial training could address domain-specific bias more effectively than pruning
