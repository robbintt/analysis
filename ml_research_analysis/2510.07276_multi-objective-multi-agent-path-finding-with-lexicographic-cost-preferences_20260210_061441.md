# Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding with Lexicographic Cost Preferences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07276
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07276
- Authors: Pulkit Rustagi; Kyle Hollins Wray; Sandhya Saisubramanian
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Introduces Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search (LCBS) for MO-MAPF with lexicographic preferences, achieving higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines, especially with multiple objectives.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-objective multi-agent path finding (MO-MAPF) where multiple agents must navigate while optimizing several competing objectives simultaneously. The authors propose a lexicographic framework that allows users to specify preference orderings over objectives, replacing the traditional Pareto-optimal approach with a more practical solution method. They introduce Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search (LCBS), an algorithm that combines conflict-based search with lexicographic A* to directly compute solutions aligned with user-defined preferences without constructing full Pareto frontiers.

## Method Summary
The authors present LCBS, which modifies the classical Conflict-Based Search (CBS) framework by replacing its low-level search with a lexicographic A* planner. This planner optimizes objectives sequentially by priority, ensuring that higher-priority objectives are optimized before considering lower-priority ones. The algorithm maintains lexicographic optimality by carefully handling conflicts through constraint propagation that respects the user-defined objective preferences. The approach scales linearly with the number of objectives, making it particularly effective for problems with many competing goals.

## Key Results
- LCBS successfully solves MO-MAPF instances with up to ten objectives, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines
- The algorithm achieves higher success rates than existing methods, particularly as the number of objectives increases
- Solutions produced by LCBS are lexicographically optimal, directly aligned with user-defined preference orderings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LCBS works by decomposing the multi-objective problem into a sequence of single-objective optimizations ordered by user preferences. By using lexicographic A* at the low level instead of standard A*, the algorithm ensures that each agent's path is optimal with respect to the priority ordering of objectives. When conflicts arise, the high-level CBS framework systematically explores different constraint assignments while maintaining the lexicographic optimality guarantees. This approach avoids the exponential explosion of the Pareto frontier while still providing meaningful trade-off solutions aligned with user preferences.

## Foundational Learning

**Lexicographic Ordering**
- Why needed: Provides a principled way to compare solutions when multiple objectives compete
- Quick check: Verify that for any two solutions, there exists a priority order where one is strictly preferred

**Conflict-Based Search (CBS)**
- Why needed: Efficiently handles multi-agent path finding by separating high-level constraint reasoning from low-level path planning
- Quick check: Ensure the low-level planner respects all constraints imposed by the high-level tree

**Lexicographic A***
- Why needed: Extends A* to handle multiple objectives in priority order rather than attempting to optimize them simultaneously
- Quick check: Confirm that paths are optimal for higher-priority objectives before considering lower-priority ones

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
High-Level CBS Tree -> Lexicographic A* Low-Level Planner -> Constraint Propagation -> Solution Verification

**Critical Path**
1. Initialize high-level tree with empty constraints
2. Select leaf node for expansion
3. Detect conflicts between agents
4. Generate child nodes with new constraints
5. Run lexicographic A* for each agent under constraints
6. Check for solution or continue expansion

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Memory vs. Completeness: CBS maintains full search tree for completeness but requires significant memory
- Priority vs. Pareto: Lexicographic approach trades complete Pareto coverage for computational efficiency and preference alignment
- Sequential vs. Joint Optimization: Optimizing objectives one at a time simplifies the problem but may miss non-dominated solutions outside the lexicographic order

**Failure Signatures**
- High memory usage indicates need for tree pruning or alternative search strategies
- Frequent constraint conflicts suggest overly restrictive preferences or poorly designed objective functions
- Inconsistent low-level solutions point to issues with the lexicographic A* implementation

**First Experiments**
1. Run LCBS on a simple 2-agent, 2-objective problem with known optimal solution to verify correctness
2. Compare LCBS runtime against standard CBS on identical instances to measure overhead
3. Test LCBS with different objective priority orderings on the same problem to confirm sensitivity to preferences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- The evaluation focuses primarily on success rates and scalability, lacking extensive analysis of solution quality metrics beyond lexicographic optimality
- Computational efficiency claims are supported empirically but lack rigorous theoretical bounds on time and space complexity
- Performance comparisons against baselines may vary under different problem distributions or constraints not covered in the evaluation

## Confidence

- Lexicographic Optimality Claims: High
- Scalability with Number of Objectives: Medium
- Computational Efficiency Claims: Medium
- Success Rate Improvements: High

## Next Checks

1. Conduct stress tests on LCBS with varying map topologies and obstacle densities to verify robustness beyond the tested scenarios
2. Perform runtime complexity analysis with formal proofs to complement the empirical scalability claims
3. Compare solution quality metrics (e.g., total cost, makespan) against alternative multi-objective approaches on overlapping instances to quantify trade-offs
