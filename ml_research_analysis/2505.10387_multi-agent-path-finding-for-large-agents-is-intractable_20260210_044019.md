# Multi-Agent Path Finding For Large Agents Is Intractable

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.10387
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10387
- **Reference count:** 16
- **Primary result:** LA-MAPF is NP-hard via reduction from 3-SAT

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes that multi-agent path finding (MAPF) for large agents (LA-MAPF) is computationally intractable. The authors prove NP-hardness by constructing a polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to LA-MAPF, where agent movements correspond to variable assignments and conflicts represent unsatisfied clauses. This result contrasts sharply with classical MAPF on undirected graphs, which can be solved in polynomial time. The reduction uses specialized graph gadgets (variable, clause, and blocking mechanisms) to encode logical constraints as geometric conflicts between disk-shaped agents.

## Method Summary
The authors prove LA-MAPF is NP-hard through a reduction from 3-SAT. They construct a graph with three types of gadgets: Variable gadgets with vertices A_i, B_i, C_i that allow two possible paths representing true/false assignments; Clause gadgets with vertices D_j through I_j where clause satisfaction is enforced through blocking mechanisms; and Blocking gadgets with vertices J_i, K, L_i that prevent conflicting assignments. Agents are modeled as disks with radius r=m (number of clauses). The reduction ensures a conflict-free path exists if and only if the original 3-SAT formula is satisfiable. A constructive algorithm converts satisfying assignments into valid move sequences.

## Key Results
- LA-MAPF is NP-hard, establishing no polynomial-time algorithm exists unless P=NP
- The reduction is correct and complete, with an explicit algorithm to convert between 3-SAT solutions and LA-MAPF solutions
- Geometric conflict detection (vertex and edge conflicts) can encode arbitrary logical constraints
- The result highlights fundamental differences between large and point agents in MAPF

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The reduction works by encoding 3-SAT constraints as geometric conflicts. Variable gadgets allow agents to choose between two paths (representing true/false), clause gadgets ensure at least one literal is satisfied through blocking mechanisms, and the geometry of disk agents creates conflicts that mirror logical inconsistencies. The key insight is that non-negligible agent size creates spatial dependencies that can represent complex logical relationships, making the problem intractable even on simple grid-like structures.

## Foundational Learning
- **NP-hardness reduction:** Mapping logical constraints to geometric conflicts - needed to prove computational intractability, quick check: verify the "if and only if" relationship holds
- **Geometric conflict detection:** Vertex conflicts (center-to-center distance) and edge conflicts (point-to-segment distance) - needed to model agent interactions, quick check: implement distance calculations for disk agents
- **Gadget-based constructions:** Variable, clause, and blocking gadgets as building blocks - needed to encode complex logical formulas, quick check: verify gadget behaviors in isolation
- **Coordinate generation:** Polynomial formulas for vertex placement - needed to create the reduction graph, quick check: implement coordinate generator for small instances
- **Constructive proof:** Algorithm to convert between solutions - needed to show the reduction is complete, quick check: test with known satisfiable instances

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** 3-SAT formula -> Gadget generator (Variable/Clause/Blocking) -> Graph with vertex coordinates -> Agent collision checker -> Algorithm 1 (solution converter)

**Critical Path:** The correctness proof depends on the reduction being both sound (no false positives) and complete (no false negatives). The critical verification steps are: (1) Gadget correctness, ensuring each gadget behaves as intended; (2) Conflict encoding, verifying that logical conflicts map to geometric conflicts; and (3) Solution conversion, confirming the algorithm correctly translates between 3-SAT and LA-MAPF solutions.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The reduction prioritizes correctness over efficiency, producing graphs with O(n·m) vertices and O(n²·m) edges. The use of disk agents with radius r=m creates strong spatial dependencies but requires high-precision arithmetic. The sequential movement model simplifies the proof but limits practical applicability.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failure modes include incorrect gadget placement (causing spurious conflicts), numerical precision errors in coordinate calculations, and misinterpretation of edge conflict geometry. Diagnostics involve visualizing small instances and verifying collision detection accuracy.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Implement the coordinate generator for n=3, m=1 and verify gadget placements match Fig. 4
2. Test the collision checker on known conflict and non-conflict configurations
3. Run Algorithm 1 on a known satisfiable 3-SAT instance and verify zero conflicts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The reduction produces impractical graph sizes with O(n²·m) edges for large instances
- High-precision arithmetic is required due to coordinate formulas involving terms up to O(m²·n)
- The sequential movement model assumption limits relevance to practical MAPF applications
- No insights into average-case performance or effective heuristics for specific problem subclasses

## Confidence
**High confidence** in the NP-hardness proof based on explicit reduction construction and rigorous verification steps. However, practical applicability is limited by geometric complexity and movement model restrictions.

## Next Checks
1. Implement the coordinate generator and collision checker to verify gadget constructions produce claimed conflict patterns for small test instances (n≤3, m≤2)
2. Execute Algorithm 1 on a known satisfiable 3-SAT instance and verify resulting move sequence produces zero conflicts
3. Test the reduction with an unsatisfiable 3-SAT instance to confirm no conflict-free path exists
