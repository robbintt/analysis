## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an unsupervised text style transfer (UTST) paradigm for controllable intensity that leverages a SFT-then-PPO approach. The method generates pseudo-parallel corpora using an LLM, fine-tunes the model via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and refines it through reinforcement learning with hierarchical rewards. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over GPT-4o-mini baselines, achieving substantial gains in readability and human evaluation scores while preserving content across fine-grained intensity levels.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework consists of three main stages: first, an LLM generates pseudo-parallel corpora to establish style-intensity mappings; second, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) adapts the model to these mappings; and third, reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization (PPO) refines the model using hierarchical rewards at both sentence and lexicon levels. This approach enables controllable intensity transfer without requiring parallel corpora, addressing a key limitation in traditional UTST methods. The hierarchical reward structure balances content preservation with style intensity control during the fine-tuning process.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 64.05% better FRE∆ (readability improvement) compared to GPT-4o-mini baselines
- Obtained 40.74% higher H-Re scores (human evaluation) in style transfer quality
- Demonstrated effective style transfer across fine-grained intensity levels while preserving content on CNN/DM and YELP datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach succeeds by combining the strengths of pseudo-parallel corpus generation with iterative fine-tuning stages. The LLM-generated pseudo-parallel data provides a foundation for style-intensity relationships, while SFT establishes basic mapping capabilities. The PPO stage with hierarchical rewards then refines these capabilities by optimizing both sentence-level coherence and lexicon-level stylistic control. This progressive refinement allows the model to learn nuanced intensity variations while maintaining content fidelity, overcoming the typical challenges of unsupervised style transfer where parallel examples are unavailable.

## Foundational Learning

**Pseudo-parallel corpora generation**
- Why needed: Provides labeled examples for style transfer without requiring human-annotated parallel datasets
- Quick check: Verify that generated pairs maintain semantic equivalence while exhibiting controlled intensity differences

**Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
- Why needed: Establishes baseline mapping between source and target styles using pseudo-parallel data
- Quick check: Ensure model learns basic style transfer patterns before reinforcement learning stage

**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
- Why needed: Refines style transfer quality through reinforcement learning while preventing catastrophic forgetting
- Quick check: Monitor reward stability during training to detect potential policy collapse

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** LLM Generation -> SFT Fine-tuning -> PPO Reinforcement Learning

**Critical path:** The PPO stage with hierarchical rewards is critical, as it directly determines the quality of intensity control and content preservation in the final outputs.

**Design tradeoffs:** The approach trades computational efficiency (multiple training stages) for higher quality style transfer without requiring parallel corpora. The hierarchical reward structure balances between sentence coherence and fine-grained lexical control.

**Failure signatures:** 
- Reward collapse during PPO indicates poor reward design or weight configuration
- Content drift suggests insufficient content preservation penalty in reward function
- Style intensity plateaus suggest inadequate pseudo-parallel corpus diversity

**First experiments:**
1. Ablation test: Remove PPO stage to measure impact of reinforcement learning refinement
2. Reward ablation: Test different weight combinations for sentence-level vs lexicon-level rewards
3. Corpus quality test: Compare performance using different LLM generations of pseudo-parallel data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on pseudo-parallel corpora generated by LLMs may introduce noise or bias
- Evaluation depends heavily on automated readability and human evaluation scores that may not capture all aspects of quality
- Hierarchical reward structure requires careful tuning of weights, potentially dataset-specific
- Focus on two specific datasets limits generalizability to other style transfer domains

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The SFT-then-PPO methodology is effective in improving style transfer performance compared to GPT-4o-mini baselines

**Medium confidence:** The approach scales and remains robust across diverse text domains beyond the tested datasets

**Low confidence:** Long-term stability of reinforcement learning fine-tuning, particularly regarding potential overfitting to pseudo-parallel corpora

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional datasets with different style transfer tasks (e.g., formality, humor, or technical-to-layman style) to assess cross-domain applicability and robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of each component (pseudo-parallel corpus generation, SFT, PPO) on final performance, and explore alternative reward structures or weighting schemes
3. Perform detailed error analysis on generated outputs, focusing on cases where content preservation fails or unintended stylistic artifacts are introduced, to identify potential weaknesses in the model or training pipeline
