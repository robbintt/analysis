# Deep Reactive Policy: Learning Reactive Manipulator Motion Planning for Dynamic Environments

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.06953
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06953
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** DRP achieves strong generalization for reactive collision-free goal reaching in dynamic, partially observable environments, outperforming classical planners and prior neural methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural motion policy for reactive collision-free goal reaching in dynamic, partially observable environments. The core innovation is IMPACT, a transformer-based policy pretrained on 10M expert trajectories from a GPU-accelerated planner (cuRobo) and refined via iterative student-teacher distillation with a locally reactive controller (Geometric Fabrics). During inference, DRP enhances dynamic obstacle avoidance using DCP-RMP, a point-cloud-based Riemannian Motion Policy. The system operates directly on point clouds and achieves strong generalization across diverse simulation and real-world tasks.

## Method Summary
DRP combines a pretrained transformer policy (IMPACT) with a learned Riemannian Motion Policy (DCP-RMP) for reactive motion planning. IMPACT is trained on synthetic expert trajectories generated by cuRobo, then refined through iterative distillation with a reactive controller. DCP-RMP is trained to predict corrective actions from point cloud observations. The policy operates directly on multi-camera point clouds and uses latent planning via a learned policy, while DCP-RMP handles local dynamic obstacle avoidance during execution.

## Key Results
- DRP achieves high success rates in dynamic environments, outperforming classical planners and prior neural methods.
- The policy demonstrates strong generalization across diverse simulation and real-world tasks.
- Iterative student-teacher distillation with Geometric Fabrics improves performance on dynamic obstacle avoidance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DRP works by combining global planning through IMPACT with local reactive control via DCP-RMP. The pretraining on synthetic expert trajectories provides a strong initialization, while distillation with a reactive controller adapts the policy to dynamic scenarios. The modular architecture allows separating long-term planning from short-term reactivity, enabling efficient handling of both static and dynamic obstacles.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transformer-based visuo-motor policies:** Needed to process point cloud observations and output continuous control actions. Quick check: Verify the policy can encode spatial relationships in point clouds.
- **Student-teacher distillation:** Required to transfer reactive behaviors from a local controller to the global policy. Quick check: Compare performance before and after distillation.
- **Riemannian Motion Policies:** Essential for defining local reactive behaviors in configuration space. Quick check: Test DCP-RMP's ability to generate collision-free motions in dynamic scenarios.
- **GPU-accelerated motion planning:** Necessary to generate large-scale expert trajectory datasets. Quick check: Validate cuRobo's planning quality against ground truth.
- **Multi-camera point cloud fusion:** Required to handle occlusions and provide rich environmental observations. Quick check: Test performance in narrow or occluded environments.
- **Iterative refinement:** Needed to progressively improve the policy through repeated distillation cycles. Quick check: Measure performance improvement across distillation iterations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
cuRobo Planner -> IMPACT (Transformer) -> DCP-RMP (RMP) -> Robot Controller

**Critical path:**
1. Multi-camera point clouds captured
2. IMPACT processes observations and outputs latent action
3. DCP-RMP predicts corrective RMP from point clouds
4. Combined action executed on robot

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Separate planning and reactivity modules vs. end-to-end learning
- Pretraining on synthetic data vs. pure RL
- Point cloud inputs vs. RGB-D or semantic representations

**Failure signatures:**
- Poor generalization to novel obstacle configurations
- Failure to handle severe occlusions
- Suboptimal performance on highly dynamic scenarios

**First experiments:**
1. Evaluate IMPACT alone on static environments
2. Test DCP-RMP's reactive capabilities with fixed planning
3. Compare DRP against classical planners on simple dynamic tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a single DRP policy generalize across diverse robot embodiments without requiring separate planners?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list this as a limitation, stating, "In future work, we aim to address this by... training a single DRP policy that generalizes across embodiments."
- Why unresolved: The current training pipeline is restricted to the Franka Panda; it is unknown if the architecture can encode varying kinematics and dynamics simultaneously.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful training of a unified model on a multi-robot dataset that maintains comparable success rates on unseen hardware platforms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would integrating RGB-D inputs improve performance in narrow environments with frequent occlusions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that their multi-camera point cloud setup "may not suffice for tasks in narrow environments" and suggest "Leveraging RGB or RGB-D inputs could improve performance."
- Why unresolved: Point clouds alone may lose semantic cues necessary for navigating highly unstructured or visually occluded spaces where depth data is noisy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study where DRP is trained with RGB-D encoders and evaluated on specifically designed, highly occluded narrow navigation tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can a pure neural policy learn dynamic reactivity without the non-learned DCP-RMP module?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors introduce DCP-RMP because generating dynamic expert trajectories is "computationally infeasible," leaving the upper bound of a purely learned reactive policy unknown.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the lower performance of IMPACT alone on dynamic tasks is a fundamental architectural limitation or simply a result of missing dynamic training data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Generating dynamic expert data (e.g., via reinforcement learning) to train IMPACT end-to-end and comparing its success rates on Floating Dynamic Obstacles against the hybrid DRP.

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on synthetic training data from cuRobo, raising questions about real-world generalization
- The fusion of pre-trained IMPACT and DCP-RMP modules is not end-to-end optimized
- Real-world test scenarios are relatively simple and don't fully stress-test severe occlusions or multi-obstacle dynamics

## Confidence
- Claims about superior performance in dynamic environments: **High** (simulation), **Medium** (real-world)
- Claims about training efficiency and safety through student-teacher distillation: **Medium**
- Claims about scalability to complex manipulation tasks: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of IMPACT and DCP-RMP to overall performance.
2. Test the policy on more complex real-world scenarios with multiple moving obstacles and severe occlusions.
3. Evaluate the system's ability to handle dynamic objects with varying shapes and trajectories not seen during training.
