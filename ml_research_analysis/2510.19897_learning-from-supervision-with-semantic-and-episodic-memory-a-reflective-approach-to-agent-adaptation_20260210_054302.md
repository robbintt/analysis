# Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19897
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Memory-augmented learning with episodic and semantic memory improves LLM accuracy by up to 24.8% over label-only baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how large language model agents can learn from supervised signals without parameter updates by leveraging memory-augmented frameworks. The authors propose combining episodic memory (storing instance-level critiques) with semantic memory (distilling critiques into reusable task-level guidance) to enable reflective learning. Across seven diverse datasets, incorporating critiques yields substantial accuracy improvements over retrieval-based baselines that rely only on labels. The framework introduces "suggestibility" as a novel metric to explain how models respond to different representations of supervision encoded in memory.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a memory-augmented framework for LLM agents that learns from supervised feedback without parameter updates. The approach combines episodic memory for storing instance-level critiques with semantic memory for distilling these critiques into reusable task-level guidance. The framework processes supervised signals by encoding them into memory systems that the LLM can retrieve and apply during task execution. The key innovation is enabling agents to learn from critiques and feedback rather than just labels, creating a more adaptive and interpretable learning mechanism.

## Key Results
- Incorporating critiques yields up to 24.8% accuracy improvement over retrieval-based baselines
- Episodic memory with critiques generally outperforms semantic memory alone
- Combining both memory types offers additional benefits in certain scenarios
- OpenAI models benefit more from critiques on preference data, while open-source models show improvements on fact-oriented data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism leverages the LLM's ability to reason about feedback and apply learned patterns from past experiences. By encoding critiques into memory systems, the model can retrieve relevant feedback during similar tasks and adjust its behavior accordingly. Episodic memory provides specific instance-level guidance, while semantic memory offers distilled, reusable patterns. The "suggestibility" metric captures how different models respond to these feedback representations, explaining why certain architectures benefit more from specific types of supervision.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Episodic Memory Systems** - why needed: Stores specific instance-level critiques for contextual learning; quick check: Verify individual feedback instances are correctly encoded and retrievable
2. **Semantic Memory Distillation** - why needed: Extracts reusable patterns from critiques for broader application; quick check: Ensure distilled guidance maintains task relevance
3. **Memory Retrieval Mechanisms** - why needed: Enables efficient access to relevant feedback during task execution; quick check: Test retrieval accuracy across different memory types
4. **Suggestibility Metrics** - why needed: Quantifies model responsiveness to different feedback representations; quick check: Validate metric consistency across model families
5. **Critique Processing** - why needed: Transforms raw feedback into actionable guidance; quick check: Assess critique-to-guidance conversion quality
6. **Parameter-Efficient Learning** - why needed: Enables adaptation without model updates; quick check: Confirm no parameter changes occur during learning

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
User Input -> Memory Retrieval -> LLM Processing -> Output Generation

**Critical Path**
User Query → Memory Search → Feedback Retrieval → Contextual Integration → Response Generation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Episodic vs. semantic memory: specificity vs. reusability
- Memory size vs. retrieval efficiency
- Feedback richness vs. processing overhead
- Model compatibility vs. generalization

**Failure Signatures**
- Retrieval misses leading to no feedback application
- Irrelevant feedback causing performance degradation
- Memory corruption affecting stored critiques
- Model-specific resistance to certain feedback types

**First Experiments**
1. Baseline accuracy comparison with and without memory augmentation
2. Retrieval accuracy testing across different memory types
3. Suggestibility measurement across model families

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit areas for further research include the scalability of memory systems for long-term deployment, the generalizability of suggestibility metrics across broader model families, and the optimal balance between episodic and semantic memory for different task types.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to static datasets rather than dynamic environments
- Suggestibility metric requires further validation across broader model families
- Distinction between memory types may be task-dependent without universal rules
- Memory decay, retrieval efficiency, and computational overhead not addressed

## Confidence
- Memory-augmented learning benefits: High
- Episodic vs. semantic memory performance: Medium
- Suggestibility metric validity: Medium
- Cross-architecture differences: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test memory-augmented learning in continuous, multi-turn interactive environments with real-time feedback
2. Evaluate memory system performance under memory constraints, including decay mechanisms and retrieval efficiency as memory scales
3. Conduct cross-architecture studies with additional model families and larger samples to validate observed differences in suggestibility
