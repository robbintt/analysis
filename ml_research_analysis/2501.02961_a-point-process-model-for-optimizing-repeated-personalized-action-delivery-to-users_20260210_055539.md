# A Point Process Model for Optimizing Repeated Personalized Action Delivery to Users

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.02961
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02961
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Bayesian framework using RNN-based temporal point processes with heavy-tailed distributions for optimizing personalized action delivery policies in interactive systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a Bayesian decision-theoretic framework for optimizing personalized action delivery in interactive systems like advertising platforms. The authors model user interactions as temporal marked point processes, where observations and intervention opportunities occur asynchronously. They propose using recurrent neural networks to parameterize event distributions given their history, implementing a likelihood-based learning approach. The key innovation is a three-parameter heavy-tailed distribution family for event timing that enables efficient computation and sampling. The approach assumes no unobserved confounding and avoids traditional causal inference methods, instead relying on Bayesian decision theory for policy optimization.

## Method Summary
The framework models user interactions as temporal marked point processes where observations and opportunities to act occur asynchronously. An RNN processes the sequence of augmented events, outputting parameters for the distribution of the next event. The time delay uses a three-parameter heavy-tailed distribution, while the event type uses a multinomial distribution. The model is trained to maximize likelihood of logged data using Algorithm 2, then a policy is optimized via stochastic gradient ascent (Algorithm 5) to maximize expected utility. The approach requires no unobserved confounding and avoids propensity scores, relying instead on Bayesian decision theory applied to the specific causal problem.

## Key Results
- Framework enables Bayesian decision-theoretic policy optimization for personalized action delivery
- RNN-based temporal point processes allow tractable likelihood computation and efficient sampling
- Three-parameter heavy-tailed distribution family provides power-law decay for realistic event timing modeling
- Algorithms provided for both likelihood computation (Algorithm 2) and policy optimization (Algorithm 5)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Bayesian Decision-Theoretic Policy Optimization
- Claim: Framing personalized action delivery as Bayesian decision theory enables principled policy optimization under uncertainty.
- Mechanism: The system maintains a posterior distribution P(θ|D) over user behavior parameters, then optimizes policy πξ to maximize expected utility by sampling trajectories from the posterior and updating policy parameters via gradient ascent on utility.
- Core assumption: Stationarity of user behavior distributions and no unobserved confounding (actions depend only on logged history).

### Mechanism 2: Neural Temporal Point Processes for Tractable Likelihood and Sampling
- Claim: RNN-based marked temporal point processes enable both tractable likelihood computation for model fitting and efficient sampling for policy optimization.
- Mechanism: An RNN processes the sequence of augmented events (timestamp, mark, action), outputting parameters φj for the distribution of the next event. This sequential conditioning captures dependencies while maintaining computational tractability through factorization into P(τ|m,φ)Q(m|φ).

### Mechanism 3: Heavy-Tailed Inter-Event Time Distribution
- Claim: Modeling inter-event times with heavy-tailed distributions (power-law decay) captures realistic user behavior better than exponential-tailed alternatives.
- Mechanism: The paper proposes a three-parameter family (Eq. 10-11) with power-law decay toward both 0 (parameter α) and ∞ (parameter β>1), enabling closed-form CDF and inverse CDF for efficient sampling.

## Foundational Learning

- **Temporal Point Processes**: Core mathematical framework for modeling asynchronous, time-stamped events with marks; understanding intensity functions and conditional distributions is essential. Quick check: Can you explain why the likelihood of a point process over [0, T] includes a term for "no event after the last observation"?

- **Policy Gradient Methods (REINFORCE)**: Algorithm 1 and 5 use the log-derivative trick ∇ξ log πξ for stochastic gradient ascent on expected utility. Quick check: Why does REINFORCE require sampling trajectories from the current policy rather than using logged data directly?

- **SUTVA and No Unobserved Confounding**: These assumptions justify avoiding propensity scores and do-calculus; understanding when they hold is critical for valid causal claims. Quick check: Would user features available to one model but not another violate the no-unobserved-confounding assumption?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: RNN Module (Rθ) -> Event Distribution Family (Φ) -> Policy Network (πξ) -> Utility Function U
- **Critical path**: 1) Define observation window tmax and event types including "request for action" 2) Train RNN to maximize likelihood of logged data (Algorithm 2) 3) Initialize policy πξ 4) Sample trajectories using trained RNN + current policy (Algorithm 4) 5) Update policy via gradient step on utility (Algorithm 5)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Distribution family complexity (simple vs. heavy-tailed mixture), RNN architecture (LSTM/GRU vs. Transformer), Utility horizon (fixed sequence length vs. session-based)
- **Failure signatures**: Likelihood not improving during RNN training, Policy gradient variance too high, Sampling produces unrealistic event sequences
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Synthetic data validation: Generate data from a known point process, verify RNN can recover parameters and policy optimization converges to optimal actions 2) Distribution family ablation: Compare log-normal vs. gamma vs. proposed heavy-tailed distribution on held-out likelihood and inter-event time statistics 3) Policy gradient sanity check: On a toy problem with known optimal policy, verify gradient direction improves utility and converges

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the proposed non-standard 3-parameter heavy-tailed distribution for inter-event times yield better likelihood and policy performance than standard light-tailed distributions (e.g., log-normal)?
- Basis in paper: The authors note on page 7 that "real world the delay times are heavy-tailed" and propose a specific family of distributions (Eq. 8) to address this, but provide no experimental validation.
- Why unresolved: The paper conjectures the improvement but focuses on the mathematical tractability of the density and CDF rather than comparative empirical analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the proposed distribution against standard mixtures on real-world advertising datasets to compare held-out likelihoods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the proposed stochastic gradient ascent algorithm (Algorithm 5) successfully converge to a policy that maximizes expected utility in complex, high-dimensional action spaces?
- Basis in paper: The paper provides a theoretical framework and algorithmic outline for policy optimization but does not include quantitative results, convergence plots, or comparisons to baseline policies.
- Why unresolved: While the algorithm is derived from Bayesian decision theory, its practical convergence behavior and utility gains are not demonstrated in the text.
- What evidence would resolve it: A simulation study or live experiment showing the optimized policy achieving higher cumulative utility than a random or heuristic policy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the proposed framework to violations of the stationarity assumption, given that user behavior in online systems often exhibits temporal drift?
- Basis in paper: On page 2, the authors list stationarity as a primary assumption ("produced by I independent stationary random processes").
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss mechanisms to handle non-stationary environments where the underlying parameters θ change over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the model's performance degradation when applied to datasets with known temporal covariate shift or concept drift.

## Limitations

- Heavy-tailed distribution family lacks empirical validation against real user behavior data
- No unobserved confounding assumption is limiting for practical deployment in real-world systems
- RNN-based approach may struggle with very long sequences where important dependencies fall outside memory horizon

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Bayesian decision-theoretic framework and policy optimization methodology are well-established and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Neural point process architecture and likelihood computation methods are technically correct, though practical performance depends on implementation details
- **Low confidence**: Proposed heavy-tailed distribution's superiority over alternatives is claimed but not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Distribution Validation**: Apply the proposed heavy-tailed distribution to real-world event log data and compare log-likelihoods against log-normal and gamma mixture baselines across multiple datasets.

2. **Unobserved Confounding Stress Test**: Simulate scenarios with measured and unmeasured confounders, comparing policy performance when using the proposed Bayesian approach versus propensity score methods.

3. **Sequence Length Robustness**: Evaluate RNN performance on synthetic data with varying sequence lengths and temporal dependencies, testing whether the approach maintains accuracy as history length increases beyond typical memory limits.
