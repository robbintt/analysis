# Asking a Language Model for Diverse Responses

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.17570
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17570
- Reference count: 15
- Explores strategies for generating diverse responses from language models, focusing on math problem solving

## Executive Summary
This work investigates strategies for generating diverse responses from language models, specifically in the context of math problem solving. The authors compare three sampling approaches: parallel (independent sampling), enumeration (prompting the model to generate multiple responses in one pass), and iterative (sequentially generating responses conditioned on previously generated ones). Using the GSM8K math benchmark, they find that enumeration and iterative sampling produce higher lexical and computational flow diversity compared to parallel sampling while maintaining comparable quality. The enumeration strategy is particularly efficient as it requires only a single model call.

## Method Summary
The study compares three sampling strategies for generating diverse responses from language models: parallel sampling (generating multiple independent responses), enumeration sampling (prompting the model to generate multiple responses in a single pass), and iterative sampling (sequentially generating responses conditioned on previously generated ones). These strategies were evaluated on the GSM8K math benchmark, measuring lexical and computational flow diversity as well as response quality. The enumeration approach involves prompting the model with instructions to generate multiple responses in one generation pass, while iterative sampling conditions each new response on all previously generated responses.

## Key Results
- Enumeration and iterative sampling produce higher lexical and computational flow diversity compared to parallel sampling
- Quality metrics remain comparable across all three sampling strategies
- Enumeration sampling is particularly efficient, requiring only a single model call
- The findings are demonstrated on the GSM8K math benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The enumeration and iterative sampling strategies work by introducing dependency structures between generated responses. In enumeration, the model is prompted to generate multiple responses in a single pass, which likely encourages the model to explore different solution paths or phrasings. The iterative approach conditions each new response on previously generated ones, creating a chain of diversity exploration where each subsequent response must differ from or build upon previous attempts. This contrasts with parallel sampling where each response is generated independently without knowledge of other responses, limiting the exploration of the solution space.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Parallel sampling** - Generating multiple independent responses simultaneously
   - Why needed: Baseline comparison for diversity evaluation
   - Quick check: Responses show no correlation in content or structure

2. **Enumeration sampling** - Prompting model to generate multiple responses in one pass
   - Why needed: Single-call efficiency with built-in diversity
   - Quick check: Single API call produces multiple distinct solutions

3. **Iterative sampling** - Sequential generation conditioned on previous responses
   - Why needed: Progressive exploration of solution space
   - Quick check: Each response builds upon or differs from previous ones

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Prompt Generator -> Language Model -> Response Analyzer -> Diversity Evaluator -> Quality Checker

**Critical Path:** Prompt Generator -> Language Model -> Diversity Evaluator

**Design Tradeoffs:** Single-call efficiency (enumeration) vs. progressive exploration (iterative) vs. computational independence (parallel)

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Enumeration: Responses may show less coherence due to multi-response generation in single pass
- Iterative: Potential for compounding errors or bias as responses build on each other
- Parallel: Limited diversity due to independent generation

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare diversity metrics across sampling strategies on GSM8K
2. Measure quality retention across different sampling approaches
3. Evaluate computational efficiency of enumeration vs parallel strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings primarily based on single benchmark (GSM8K) in constrained math domain
- Evaluation focuses on lexical and computational flow diversity, not semantic diversity
- Potential coherence issues in multi-response generation not fully addressed
- Computational efficiency gains not quantified in wall-clock time or resource utilization

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Enumeration and iterative sampling produce higher lexical and computational flow diversity compared to parallel sampling
- **Medium Confidence**: Enumeration is "particularly efficient as it requires only a single model call" (may oversimplify practical implications)
- **Medium Confidence**: Strategies maintain "comparable quality" (may not translate to other domains or quality dimensions)

## Next Checks
1. Test sampling strategies on non-mathematical tasks (creative writing, code generation) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess perceived usefulness of diverse responses
3. Measure actual wall-clock time, memory usage, and cost implications of enumeration vs parallel sampling across different model sizes
