# When Teams Embrace AI: Human Collaboration Strategies in Generative Prompting in a Creative Design Task

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21731
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21731
- Reference count: 40
- Teams use collaborative workflows with GenAI, preferring human input over AI suggestions

## Executive Summary
This study examines how design and performance students collaborate when using generative AI tools for creative stage design. Pairs of participants worked together using ChatGPT and Midjourney to generate stage designs based on a poem. The research identifies two distinct collaborative workflows - narrative-first and imagery-first approaches - and reveals that teams frequently seek each other's opinions on prompts and outputs to refine ideas and reach consensus. While participants found co-prompting enhanced teamwork, they also reported that adjusting prompts introduced cognitive challenges. The findings suggest that teams view GenAI primarily as a supportive tool rather than a true collaborator, preferring to prioritize human creativity while using AI to handle laborious tasks.

## Method Summary
Pairs of participants with design or performance backgrounds collaborated on creating stage designs for a poem using ChatGPT and Midjourney. The study observed two distinct collaborative workflows: some teams started by building a detailed narrative, while others began with conceptual imagery. Researchers documented team interactions, noting frequent peer consultation during prompt generation and refinement. The artificial task setting involved professional-level creative tools but may not reflect real-world creative workflows.

## Key Results
- Teams developed two distinct collaborative workflows: narrative-first versus imagery-first approaches
- Participants consistently sought peer opinions on prompts and outputs to refine ideas and reach consensus
- Participants viewed GenAI as a supportive tool rather than a true collaborator, preferring human creativity over AI suggestions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Teams leverage their human partner's creativity while using AI to handle technical execution of creative concepts. The collaborative nature of co-prompting allows teams to pool creative ideas and reach consensus through discussion, while the AI serves as an execution tool rather than a creative partner. The peer consultation process helps teams navigate the cognitive challenges of prompt refinement by distributing the cognitive load.

## Foundational Learning
- **Co-prompting workflows**: Two approaches emerged (narrative-first vs imagery-first), reflecting different creative processes. Understanding these patterns helps predict team behavior.
- **Peer consultation dynamics**: Teams frequently seek each other's opinions during prompting, suggesting collaboration is enhanced through shared decision-making. This indicates AI tools should support rather than replace human interaction.
- **Cognitive load management**: Prompt refinement creates cognitive challenges that teams navigate through collaboration. Tools should be designed to minimize friction during this process.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Human teams <-> Co-prompting process <-> Generative AI tools (ChatGPT/Midjourney)
- **Critical path**: Creative discussion -> Prompt formulation -> AI generation -> Peer review -> Refinement
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing AI assistance with human creativity, managing cognitive load during prompt refinement
- **Failure signatures**: When AI outputs don't align with team vision, teams revert to human-only ideation
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test different prompt templates to reduce cognitive load
  2. Compare synchronous vs asynchronous co-prompting workflows
  3. Measure impact of AI suggestion frequency on team creativity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Major uncertainties remain around whether the observed collaborative patterns are stable across different creative domains or AI tools. The sample size (n=24) and homogeneous participant pool (design/performance students) limit generalizability. The study's artificial task setting may not reflect real-world creative workflows. The distinction between narrative-first and imagery-first approaches needs validation in more diverse design contexts.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=24) with homogeneous design/performance student participants
- Artificial task setting may not reflect real-world creative workflows
- Limited generalizability across different creative domains or professional contexts

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in findings about participants seeking peer opinions during co-prompting, as this behavior was consistently observed across teams
- **Medium** confidence in the characterization of GenAI as a supportive tool rather than collaborator, though this reflects stated preferences rather than behavioral evidence
- **Medium** confidence in reported cognitive load challenges during prompt refinement, as this was based on self-report rather than objective measures

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with professional designers working on real client projects to assess ecological validity
2. Test the narrative-first versus imagery-first workflows across different creative domains (product design, architecture, advertising)
3. Measure objective cognitive load using eye-tracking or task completion metrics rather than relying solely on self-report
