# Convergence Theorems for Entropy-Regularized and Distributional Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08526
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08526
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: A temperature decoupling approach enables convergence to a diversity-preserving optimal policy and reference-optimal return distributions in entropy-regularized RL.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of convergence in entropy-regularized reinforcement learning as the regularization temperature approaches zero. Standard ERL approaches can collapse to suboptimal deterministic policies when optimal actions have equal value, losing the diversity preservation that entropy regularization typically provides. The authors introduce a "temperature decoupling gambit" that separates the policy used for action selection from the policy used for value estimation, enabling convergence to an interpretable optimal policy that uniformly samples all optimal actions. This framework also extends to distributional RL, providing the first algorithm for accurately estimating reference-optimal return distributions.

## Method Summary
The temperature decoupling gambit estimates action-values at a target temperature τ while playing policies with an amplified temperature σ(τ), where σ/τ → 0 as τ → 0. This enables convergence to a diversity-preserving optimal policy π_ref,★ that samples all optimal actions uniformly. For distributional RL, the authors apply a two-phase algorithm: first using amplified temperature σ to find a soft-optimal Q-function, then using target temperature τ with the resulting policy to evaluate the return distribution. The method uses categorical distribution representations with MMD projection and energy distance kernels. The approach guarantees convergence of policy-derived objects including value functions and return distributions to their entropy-regularized optimal counterparts.

## Key Results
- The temperature decoupling gambit prevents standard ERL collapse, maintaining uniform action selection among optimal actions as τ → 0
- Theoretical convergence guarantees established for both policy optimization and return distribution estimation
- First algorithm demonstrated for accurately estimating reference-optimal return distributions
- Experiments show stable convergence and preserved state-wise action diversity compared to standard ERL

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The temperature decoupling gambit works by maintaining sufficient exploration (via amplified temperature σ) during the learning process while still converging to the correct optimal policy (at target temperature τ). By decoupling these temperatures with σ/τ → 0, the method avoids the collapse to deterministic policies that occurs in standard ERL while still approaching the true optimal policy as regularization vanishes. For distributional RL, the two-phase approach first finds a soft-optimal Q-function using amplified temperature, then evaluates the return distribution at the target temperature using the derived policy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Entropy-regularized RL**: Why needed - Provides theoretical foundation for temperature-based regularization; Quick check - Verify understanding of soft value functions and their relationship to temperature
- **Temperature scaling in RL**: Why needed - Central to the decoupling mechanism; Quick check - Confirm that σ/τ → 0 ensures convergence properties
- **Distributional RL concepts**: Why needed - Framework for return distribution estimation; Quick check - Understand categorical representations and Bellman operators
- **Fixed-point theorems**: Why needed - Underpin convergence proofs; Quick check - Verify conditions for operator convergence
- **MMD projection**: Why needed - Method for projecting distributions in Wasserstein distance; Quick check - Confirm energy distance kernel implementation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Tristate MDP → Soft Q-learning (standard vs decoupled) → Policy evaluation → Return distribution estimation

**Critical path**: Temperature specification → Policy learning (decoupled) → Q-value extraction → Return distribution evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: Amplification factor σ/τ vs convergence speed and stability; categorical vs other distribution representations; MMD projection vs alternative methods

**Failure signatures**: Standard ERL policies collapse to single optimal action; numerical instability in log-sum-exp at low temperatures; slow convergence in control phase

**First experiments**:
1. Implement tristate MDP and compare standard ERL vs decoupled policy convergence as τ → 0
2. Test different amplification factors (τ² vs τ³) on convergence stability
3. Validate categorical distribution implementation with MMD projection on simple return distribution estimation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
Can precise convergence rates be derived for the return distribution estimates in Theorem 3.10? The authors currently lack a formula to determine the specific temperatures required for ζ_τ,σ to be an ε-approximation of the target distribution.

### Open Question 2
Can the temperature decoupling gambit be effectively integrated into standard deep RL algorithms? The paper provides theoretical convergence theorems and tabular demonstrations but does not propose or validate a general-purpose deep learning implementation.

### Open Question 3
Can the framework guarantee convergence in continuous action spaces without strict assumptions on the reference policy? Ensuring sufficient probability mass around optimal actions is straightforward in discrete domains but non-trivial for continuous densities.

## Limitations
- Exact transition dynamics and rewards for tristate MDP are partially unspecified
- Number of iterations for distributional algorithm underspecified (qualitative convergence criteria)
- Limited experimental scope (tabular MDPs only, no deep RL validation)
- Theoretical framework requires discrete action spaces for full guarantees

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical framework and convergence guarantees are well-established
- **Medium confidence**: Experimental validation is sound but limited in scope
- **Low confidence**: Implementation details for distributional RL algorithm are insufficient for exact reproduction

## Next Checks
1. Implement tristate MDP with multiple interpretations of unspecified dynamics and verify consistent convergence to uniform optimal action selection
2. Conduct ablation studies varying amplification factor σ/τ to quantify impact on convergence stability
3. Extend experiments to larger MDPs with multiple states to test scalability and identify potential limitations
