# From Segments to Concepts: Interpretable Image Classification via Concept-Guided Segmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04180
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04180
- Authors: Ran Eisenberg; Amit Rozner; Ethan Fetaya; Ofir Lindenbaum
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Improves worst-group accuracy by over 30% on benchmarks with spurious correlations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SEG-MIL-CBM, a framework that enhances both interpretability and robustness in image classification by integrating concept-guided segmentation with attention-based multiple instance learning. The model segments images into semantically meaningful regions aligned with human-interpretable concepts, treats each as an instance, and learns to aggregate evidence using attention, enabling spatially grounded explanations without concept annotations. On benchmarks with spurious correlations (Waterbirds, Pawrious), SEG-MIL-CBM achieves worst-group accuracy gains of over 30% and competitive average accuracy, while maintaining strong performance on large-scale datasets like CIFAR-100 (85.3%). It also shows enhanced resilience to input corruptions in CIFAR-10-C. The approach effectively suppresses irrelevant features and provides transparent, concept-level reasoning.

## Method Summary
SEG-MIL-CBM segments images into semantically meaningful regions aligned with human-interpretable concepts, then treats each region as an instance in a multiple instance learning framework. The model first selects top-K concepts using CLIP, then generates segmentation masks using GroundingDINO and SAM. Each segmented region becomes an instance in a bag, and an attention mechanism learns to weight the importance of each instance for classification. The framework is trained with a joint loss combining classification accuracy and concept alignment to CLIP concept vectors. This approach enables spatially grounded explanations without requiring concept annotations during training.

## Key Results
- Achieves worst-group accuracy gains of over 30% on Waterbirds and Pawrious datasets with spurious correlations
- Maintains competitive average accuracy (85.3% on CIFAR-100) while improving robustness
- Shows enhanced resilience to input corruptions in CIFAR-10-C benchmark
- Effectively suppresses irrelevant features through concept-guided segmentation and attention aggregation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages concept-guided segmentation to break images into semantically meaningful regions that correspond to human-interpretable concepts. By treating each region as an instance in a multiple instance learning framework, the model can learn which specific regions contain the most relevant information for classification. The attention mechanism then weights the importance of each instance, allowing the model to focus on relevant regions while suppressing spurious correlations. The joint training with concept alignment ensures that the learned representations correspond to meaningful semantic concepts, providing interpretable explanations for classification decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multiple Instance Learning (MIL):** Treats sets of instances (segments) as bags, where only bag-level labels are available during training
  - Why needed: Enables learning from segmented regions without requiring per-segment labels
  - Quick check: Verify bag-level classification performance

- **Concept-guided segmentation:** Uses foundation models to identify and segment regions corresponding to human-interpretable concepts
  - Why needed: Creates semantically meaningful instances that serve as building blocks for interpretation
  - Quick check: Visualize segmentation masks to confirm semantic relevance

- **Attention-based instance weighting:** Learns to assign importance weights to each segmented region based on its relevance to the classification task
  - Why needed: Enables the model to focus on relevant regions while suppressing spurious features
  - Quick check: Monitor attention weight distributions for uniformity vs. focus

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Image -> CLIP Concept Scoring -> GroundingDINO + SAM Segmentation -> Instance Bag Creation -> Concept Projection Layer -> Attention MLP -> Aggregation Layer -> Classification

**Critical Path:** Image segmentation (GroundingDINO + SAM) → Concept projection (W_c) → Attention weighting → Instance aggregation → Classification

**Design Tradeoffs:** Uses frozen foundation models for segmentation to leverage existing capabilities, but this prevents end-to-end optimization and may fail in complex scenes with occlusion

**Failure Signatures:** Segmentation quality collapse (noise in bags), attention saturation (uniform or one-hot attention weights), concept misalignment (poor correlation with CLIP vectors)

**First Experiments:** 1) Visualize segmentation masks to verify semantic relevance, 2) Monitor attention weight distributions for proper weighting behavior, 3) Check concept embedding alignment with CLIP concept vectors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can temporal consistency constraints in video data further stabilize the concept grounding and segmentation quality of SEG-MIL-CBM?
- How does SEG-MIL-CBM perform under broader domain generalization shifts beyond the specific spurious correlations and corruptions currently tested?
- Can the segmentation and attention modules be jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner to improve robustness in open-world scenes with heavy occlusion or tiny objects?

## Limitations
- Critical architectural ambiguities in concept vocabulary size and top-K concept selection parameters
- Missing training procedure details for backbone warm-up phase duration and learning rate
- Mask filtering thresholds unspecified, potentially affecting instance bag quality
- Reliance on frozen foundation models prevents end-to-end optimization for complex scenes

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** 30%+ worst-group accuracy improvement on Waterbirds and Pawrious datasets
- **Medium confidence:** Enhanced robustness to input corruptions in CIFAR-10-C benchmark
- **Low confidence:** Competitive average accuracy claims on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet without full specification of concept parameters

## Next Checks
1. Determine exact concept vocabulary size and top-K selection parameters to correctly dimension the concept projection layer
2. Clarify backbone warm-up procedure including epochs and learning rate schedule
3. Specify mask filtering thresholds (minimum pixel count and IoU) for segment quality control
