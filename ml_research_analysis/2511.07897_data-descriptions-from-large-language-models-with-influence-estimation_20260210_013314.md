## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to understand data in deep learning via textual descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs). The method proposes a pipeline to generate class-specific descriptions using Wikipedia and external knowledge, then employs influence estimation and CLIP scores to identify the most informative "proponent texts" for model training. The approach introduces a novel benchmark task, cross-modal transfer classification, to evaluate textual description effectiveness. Experiments across nine image classification datasets show that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in both zero-shot and cross-modal transfer settings, demonstrating improved model performance and interpretability through human-readable language.

## Method Summary
The proposed method generates class-specific textual descriptions by leveraging Wikipedia articles and external knowledge sources, which are then processed through LLMs to create detailed, context-rich descriptions for each class. Influence estimation techniques are applied to identify "proponent texts" - the most informative textual descriptions that positively impact model performance. The method uses CLIP embeddings to bridge the visual and textual modalities, enabling the system to match images with their most relevant descriptions. A novel cross-modal transfer classification task is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of textual descriptions in improving model generalization and interpretability.

## Key Results
- Proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in zero-shot classification across nine image datasets
- Cross-modal transfer classification results show improved model performance with LLM-generated descriptions
- Influence estimation successfully identifies the most informative textual descriptions for model training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages the complementary strengths of LLMs and influence estimation to create semantically rich textual representations that capture both visual and conceptual aspects of data classes. By using Wikipedia and external knowledge, the method grounds descriptions in real-world context, while CLIP embeddings provide a shared semantic space between images and text. The influence estimation component acts as a filtering mechanism to identify the most educationally valuable descriptions, focusing model training on the most informative content rather than all available text.

## Foundational Learning
- **CLIP embeddings**: Required for bridging visual and textual modalities in a shared semantic space; quick check: verify embedding dimensions match between image and text encoders
- **Influence estimation**: Needed to identify which textual descriptions most impact model performance; quick check: validate influence scores correlate with performance improvements
- **Zero-shot learning**: Essential for evaluating model generalization without task-specific training; quick check: confirm all test classes were unseen during training
- **Cross-modal transfer**: Novel benchmark task that tests model ability to transfer knowledge between modalities; quick check: verify training and test modalities are appropriately separated

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Wikipedia knowledge extraction -> LLM description generation -> CLIP embedding creation -> Influence estimation -> Proponent text selection -> Model training

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from knowledge extraction through LLM generation to influence estimation, as the quality of initial descriptions directly impacts which texts are selected as proponents. CLIP embeddings are created in parallel with this process and serve as the bridge between modalities during both training and evaluation.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The method trades computational overhead (multiple LLM calls and influence calculations) for improved interpretability and potentially better generalization. Using Wikipedia introduces dependency on external knowledge availability but provides grounding in real-world context. The approach prioritizes human-readable descriptions over purely statistical representations.

**Failure Signatures**
Performance degradation may occur when Wikipedia coverage is sparse or when LLM-generated descriptions lack domain specificity. Poor CLIP embedding quality or domain shift between pretraining and target data can break the visual-textual alignment. Over-reliance on influence estimation might filter out useful but initially less influential descriptions.

**First Experiments**
1. Validate CLIP embedding quality on target dataset before proceeding with full pipeline
2. Test influence estimation on a small subset to verify proponent text selection makes sense
3. Compare zero-shot performance with and without Wikipedia integration to isolate knowledge source contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on Wikipedia availability may limit applicability to niche or emerging categories
- Quality of LLM-generated descriptions may vary significantly across different domains
- Cross-modal transfer classification represents an artificial scenario that may not capture real-world deployment challenges

## Confidence
- Experimental results across multiple datasets: Medium
- Methodology for identifying proponent texts: Medium
- Claims about improved interpretability: Low
- Impact of CLIP embeddings on results: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the Wikipedia integration step to isolate the contribution of external knowledge versus LLM generation capabilities
2. Test the approach on datasets with limited or no Wikipedia coverage to evaluate robustness in information-scarce scenarios
3. Implement a human evaluation study comparing the quality and usefulness of generated descriptions against baseline methods, measuring both accuracy and interpretability
