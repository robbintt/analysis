# A Unification of Discrete, Gaussian, and Simplicial Diffusion

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.15923
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15923
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Unified framework showing discrete, Gaussian, and simplicial diffusion as different parameterizations of Wright-Fisher population genetics, enabling stable cross-domain likelihood comparison and unified model training

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a theoretical and practical unification of three major discrete diffusion methods—discrete, Gaussian, and simplicial diffusion—under a single framework based on the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. The authors formally prove that all three methods are instances of Wright-Fisher diffusion with different parameterizations, specifically showing that discrete diffusion corresponds to population size ζ=1, while Gaussian and simplicial diffusion arise as large-population limits with and without reproduction. They leverage this connection to address key challenges in the field: enabling formal comparison of likelihoods across domains, solving numerical instabilities in simplicial diffusion by applying mathematical genetics literature, and demonstrating that a single neural network trained with a "sufficient statistic parameterization" can perform competitive diffusion across all three domains at test time. Empirically, their stable simplicial diffusion outperforms previous models on conditional DNA generation, and unified models trained on proteins and language achieve performance competitive with individually trained domain-specific models while eliminating the need for practitioners to choose a particular model before training.

## Method Summary
The method unifies discrete, Gaussian, and simplicial diffusion through the Wright-Fisher population genetics model, where each token is represented as a population of ζ copies undergoing mutation (rate matrix L) and optionally reproduction. Three regimes emerge: ζ=1 yields discrete diffusion; ζ→∞ with zero reproduction yields Gaussian diffusion in the first eigenspace of L; ζ→∞ with reproduction yields simplicial diffusion on the simplex. The authors introduce a "sufficient statistic parameterization" (SSP) that transforms observations into statistics containing all relevant diffusion information, enabling a single neural network to operate across all modalities. They address numerical instabilities in simplicial diffusion using exact Dirichlet sampling via the ancestral process and Griffiths approximation for low-t values. The "hollow parameterization" weights network output by forward process evidence to remove Gaussian ELBO singularities and enable cross-domain likelihood comparison.

## Key Results
- Formally proved that discrete, Gaussian, and simplicial diffusion are unified as different parameterizations of Wright-Fisher diffusion
- Demonstrated stable simplicial diffusion outperforms previous models on conditional DNA generation tasks
- Showed unified models trained on proteins and language achieve competitive performance with individually trained domain-specific models
- Solved numerical instabilities in simplicial diffusion using exact sampling and Griffiths approximation from mathematical genetics literature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: All three diffusion paradigms are mathematically unified as different parameterizations of the Wright-Fisher population genetics model.
- Mechanism: By representing each token as a "population" of ζ copies undergoing mutation (rate matrix L) and optionally reproduction, three regimes emerge: ζ=1 yields discrete diffusion; ζ→∞ with zero reproduction yields Gaussian diffusion in the first eigenspace of L; ζ→∞ with reproduction yields simplicial diffusion on the simplex. The central limit theorem drives Gaussian convergence; reproduction keeps the process on the simplex.
- Core assumption: The mutation rate matrix L has well-separated eigenvalues with a dominant eigenspace capturing meaningful signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "specifically showing that discrete diffusion corresponds to population size ζ=1, while Gaussian and simplicial diffusion arise as large-population limits with and without reproduction"
  - [Theorem 4.1, Page 6]: Formal proof with embedding Q₁ derived from first eigenspace projection
  - [corpus]: "Foundations of Diffusion Models in General State Spaces" discusses unification of continuous and discrete domains
- Break condition: Fails if L has degenerate eigenvalues or the dominant eigenspace is not well-separated.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The "hollow parameterization" removes the Gaussian ELBO singularity, enabling cross-domain likelihood comparison.
- Mechanism: Standard parameterization creates singularity because at initialization x₀ is "never obvious" to qθ, causing mismatches with deterministic paths near t=0. Hollow parameterization qθ(x₀|xₜ,t) ∝ p(xₜ|x₀,t)qθ(x₀) automatically focuses prediction when x₀ becomes identifiable from xₜ.
- Core assumption: Embedding function is injective; tokens are distinguishable in embedding space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 6-7]: "The practical solution is simple – weight the output of the neural network by the evidence for each x₀"
  - [Appendix E.3, Pages 28-30]: Formal proof that hollow parameterization yields bounded ELBO
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; related works do not address this comparison problem
- Break condition: Fails if embeddings are equidistant or minimum embedding distance approaches zero.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A single neural network can perform diffusion across all three domains by operating on sufficient statistics rather than raw observations.
- Mechanism: The vectors φ⃗(xₜᵈ,t) ∝ p(xₜᵈ|t,x₀ᵈ=b) are sufficient statistics containing all relevant diffusion information. The prediction function Fᵈ is independent of diffusion modality and time, enabling one network to learn the universal mapping.
- Core assumption: Target distribution p(x₀) is invariant across diffusion modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 9]: "Some algebra shows that φ⃗'s are sufficient statistics, that is, they contain all relevant information about the diffusion process and t"
  - [Proposition 6.1, Pages 9-10, 38]: Formal proof via expectation decomposition
  - [Figure 7, Page 10]: Unified models competitive with specialized models on proteins and language
  - [corpus]: "Test-Time Anchoring for Discrete Diffusion Posterior Sampling" addresses test-time flexibility
- Break condition: Fails if training is heavily imbalanced toward one modality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Wright-Fisher diffusion in population genetics
  - Why needed here: This classical model is the theoretical foundation; understanding allele frequency dynamics under drift and mutation is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why does adding reproduction change the limit from Gaussian (concentrated near equilibrium) to simplex-wide diffusion?

- Concept: Sufficient statistics in statistical inference
  - Why needed here: The SSP mechanism relies on statistics that capture all parameter-relevant information.
  - Quick check question: If two diffusion processes share the same sufficient statistics, would the optimal denoising function F differ?

- Concept: ELBO and likelihood comparison
  - Why needed here: Understanding when ELBOs diverge and how parameterization choices affect comparability.
  - Quick check question: Why does standard Gaussian ELBO diverge as t→0, and how does hollow parameterization prevent this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Forward process: Wright-Fisher mutation (rate matrix L) ± reproduction
  - Sampling module: Exact Dirichlet sampling via ancestral process A(ψ,τₜ); Griffiths approximation when τₜ<0.05
  - Sufficient statistics encoder: Transforms xₜ → φ⃗(xₜ,t)
  - Shared backbone: Network Fθ operating on sufficient statistics
  - Loss: Domain-specific ELBO with score matching metric

- Critical path:
  1. Implement exact sampling (Algorithm 5-6) with low-t fallback
  2. Build sufficient statistics transformation per modality
  3. Train unified model with alternating domain batches

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Precision vs speed: mpmath at low t slows training
  - Unified vs specialized: Flexibility trades maximum performance
  - Condition threshold: Higher values reduce precision compute but risk error

- Failure signatures:
  - NaN losses at low t → missing Griffiths switch
  - Poor modality performance → insufficient domain data
  - Divergent Gaussian ELBO → not using hollow parameterization
  - Series cancellation errors → condition threshold too high

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate exact sampling vs SDE simulation on 3-token system at τₜ<0.1
  2. Compare discrete and Gaussian ELBOs with hollow parameterization
  3. Benchmark unified SSP model against individually trained baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the sufficient statistic parameterization (SSP) enable zero-shot transfer of a trained diffusion model to a modality it was never trained on?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion: "In principle, the SSP can even be used to transfer a model to a modality it was not trained on," but this capability is never empirically tested.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates SSP enables training a single model across all three modalities simultaneously, but does not investigate whether a model trained on only one or two modalities can generalize to an unseen modality at test time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training SSP models on subsets of modalities (e.g., only discrete and Gaussian) and evaluating performance on held-out modalities (e.g., simplicial) without any training data from that modality.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the practical benefits of diffusion models with population sizes ζ between 1 and ∞ (i.e., "intermediate" models between discrete and Gaussian/simplicial diffusion)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "Our framework suggests new types of diffusion models 'between' the three existing streams of diffusion which we only use as a lens for understanding existing models. Implementing these intermediate models may be of independent practical interest."
- Why unresolved: The theoretical framework establishes finite ζ as interpolating between discrete (ζ=1) and continuous (ζ→∞) diffusion, but these intermediate models are never implemented or evaluated as generative models in their own right.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of models trained with finite ζ values (e.g., ζ=10, 100, 1000) on sequence generation tasks, measuring tradeoffs in sample quality, computational cost, and likelihood.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the SSP framework unify models across hyperparameter settings within a single modality, enabling hyperparameter optimization without retraining?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "The SSP can be used to unify models beyond the three modalities. For instance it can be used to train models across hyperparameter settings, or optimize hyperparameters without retraining."
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows SSP unifies across modalities, it does not demonstrate this within-modality application that could allow practitioners to switch between, e.g., different noise schedules or mutation rates at test time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training a single SSP model across multiple forward process hyperparameters (different L matrices or τ schedules) and showing it can perform well when evaluated with any of those hyperparameters at inference time.

## Limitations

- The theoretical framework establishes finite ζ as interpolating between discrete and continuous diffusion, but these intermediate models are never implemented or evaluated as generative models
- While SSP unifies across modalities, the paper does not demonstrate within-modality applications such as unifying across different noise schedules or mutation rates without retraining
- The framework's practical benefits for zero-shot transfer to unseen modalities are discussed but not empirically validated

## Confidence

- **High:** The mathematical unification of discrete, Gaussian, and simplicial diffusion under Wright-Fisher is formally proven and well-supported by population genetics literature
- **High:** The numerical stability solutions for simplicial diffusion (exact sampling, Griffiths approximation, high-precision fallback) are directly derived from mathematical genetics literature
- **Medium:** Empirical results showing unified models competitive with specialized models, though the unified approach sacrifices some performance
- **Medium:** Claims about SSP enabling zero-shot transfer and hyperparameter unification are discussed but not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. Verify the exact sampling implementation (Algorithm 5) produces identical results to SDE simulation for τₜ<0.1 on a simple 3-token system
2. Confirm the hollow parameterization successfully removes ELBO singularities by comparing standard vs hollow Gaussian ELBOs as t→0
3. Test whether a unified SSP model trained on proteins and language achieves competitive performance with individually trained baselines on both domains using the same architecture and training procedure
