# StructSynth: Leveraging LLMs for Structure-Aware Tabular Data Synthesis in Low-Data Regimes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.02601
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02601
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** StructSynth outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downstream model performance (e.g., AUC up to 85.55%) in low-data regimes

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing high-quality tabular data in low-data regimes, where traditional generative models and LLMs often fail to capture complex dependencies and produce low-fidelity synthetics. To resolve this, the authors propose StructSynth, a two-stage framework that first discovers the underlying dependency structure of the data using an LLM-guided approach, and then leverages this structure as a blueprint to guide the LLM's generation process, ensuring adherence to feature dependencies by design. Experiments on six real-world datasets show that StructSynth outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downstream model performance (e.g., AUC up to 85.55%), achieves superior statistical fidelity, and better preserves privacy, especially in low-data settings.

## Method Summary
The authors propose StructSynth, a two-stage framework for synthesizing tabular data in low-data regimes. The first stage discovers the underlying dependency structure of the data using an LLM-guided approach. The second stage leverages this structure as a blueprint to guide the LLM's generation process, ensuring adherence to feature dependencies by design. This structure-aware approach addresses the common failure modes of traditional generative models and LLMs in capturing complex dependencies and producing low-fidelity synthetics when training data is limited.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downstream model performance (AUC up to 85.55%)
- Achieves superior statistical fidelity compared to baseline approaches
- Better preserves privacy, especially in low-data settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage framework works by first identifying the dependency structure of the data using LLM guidance, then using this structure as a blueprint for generation. This ensures that the synthetic data maintains the complex interdependencies present in the original data, which is critical for preserving downstream task performance and statistical properties.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Tabular Data Synthesis**: Why needed - To generate synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties and dependencies; Quick check - Can the synthetic data maintain similar distribution characteristics to the original data?
2. **LLM-Guided Structure Discovery**: Why needed - To identify complex feature dependencies that traditional methods might miss; Quick check - Does the discovered structure improve generation quality?
3. **Low-Data Regime Challenges**: Why needed - Traditional models struggle when training data is limited; Quick check - Does performance degrade gracefully as data availability decreases?
4. **Downstream Model Performance Metrics**: Why needed - To evaluate the practical utility of synthetic data; Quick check - Does synthetic data enable similar model performance as real data?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Data Input -> Structure Discovery (LLM) -> Structure-Aware Generation (LLM) -> Synthetic Output
- **Critical Path:** The two-stage process is sequential - structure discovery must complete before generation can begin
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Uses LLM guidance for structure discovery vs. traditional statistical methods; prioritizes structure preservation over pure diversity
- **Failure Signatures:** Poor structure discovery leads to low-fidelity synthetics; insufficient data in early stage degrades structure discovery quality
- **First 3 Experiments:**
  1. Validate structure discovery accuracy on known dependency structures
  2. Test generation quality with synthetic structure as ground truth
  3. Compare downstream model performance using StructSynth vs. baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to six real-world tabular datasets, constraining generalizability
- Performance comparisons focus on AUC metrics without extensive analysis of other downstream use cases
- No ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of structure discovery and generation components
- Privacy claims based on differential privacy assumptions without empirical privacy leakage analysis

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the framework's ability to improve downstream model performance in tested low-data scenarios
- **Medium confidence** in claimed superiority over baselines due to limited dataset diversity
- **Medium confidence** in statistical fidelity improvements, pending broader distributional validation
- **Low confidence** in absolute privacy preservation claims without empirical attack-based validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to isolate and quantify the contributions of the structure discovery stage versus the LLM-guided generation stage on performance metrics.

2. Perform empirical privacy analysis including membership inference attacks and attribute inference tests to validate the claimed privacy preservation beyond theoretical differential privacy guarantees.

3. Evaluate the framework on a broader and more diverse set of tabular datasets, including high-dimensional feature spaces (1000+ features) and different data types (time-series, regression targets) to test scalability and generalizability.
