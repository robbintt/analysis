# LINA: Learning INterventions Adaptively for Physical Alignment and Generalization in Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.13290
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13290
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves state-of-the-art physical alignment in diffusion models without retraining, improving Winoground success from 54.4% to 79.5%.

## Executive Summary
LINA addresses physical misalignment and out-of-distribution (OOD) instruction-following failures in diffusion models by learning prompt-specific interventions. The core innovation is an Adaptive Intervention Module (AIM) that predicts optimal intervention strengths for both prompt embeddings and visual latents. By combining token-level and visual contrastive guidance with a causality-aware denoising schedule, LINA significantly improves performance on challenging causal generation tasks while avoiding the need for external multimodal LLMs during inference.

## Method Summary
LINA introduces an Adaptive Intervention Module (AIM) that learns to predict optimal intervention strengths for prompt embeddings and visual latents. The method employs targeted guidance in both spaces, using relation token identification via spaCy to modulate embeddings and contrastive guidance for latent noise predictions. A reallocated, causality-aware denoising schedule prioritizes early structure formation by amplifying the time-shift parameter. The AIM is trained offline on "hard cases" identified from baseline failures using MLLM feedback and coordinate descent search to find optimal intervention parameters.

## Key Results
- Achieves 79.5% success rate on Winoground (vs 54.4% baseline)
- Improves PAP-OOD subset performance from 69.3% to 84.3%
- Outperforms baseline diffusion models without requiring external multimodal LLMs during inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by learning to predict optimal intervention strengths that correct physical misalignments in diffusion model outputs. By targeting both the semantic (prompt embedding) and visual (latent) spaces with prompt-specific guidance, LINA addresses failures at multiple levels of the generation process. The causality-aware schedule ensures early steps focus on establishing correct physical relationships, while later steps refine details. The AIM learns from hard cases where baseline models fail, allowing the system to adaptively correct specific types of misalignments rather than applying uniform corrections.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Model Denoising Process:** Understanding how diffusion models progressively remove noise to generate images is crucial for appreciating why the causality-aware schedule matters. Quick check: Verify that earlier denoising steps have more influence on final image structure.
- **Spatial Relation Parsing:** The method relies on accurately identifying spatial prepositions and verbs in prompts to determine which tokens need intervention. Quick check: Test spaCy parser accuracy on diverse spatial relation prompts.
- **Contrastive Learning:** Visual intervention uses contrastive guidance between target and neutral prompts. Quick check: Confirm that contrastive guidance effectively pulls predictions toward desired physical arrangements.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Text prompt -> SpaCy Parser -> Relation Token Mask -> AIM Prediction -> Token Intervention + Visual Intervention -> Modified Diffusion Sampling

**Critical Path:** The most critical sequence is: prompt parsing → AIM prediction → both intervention modules → modified denoising schedule. Any failure in identifying relation tokens or predicting intervention strengths will cascade through the entire generation process.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades computational overhead during inference (additional AIM prediction and intervention steps) for improved alignment without retraining. This is preferable to full model retraining which is expensive and model-specific.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failures include incorrect relation token identification leading to wrong embeddings being modified, suboptimal AIM predictions causing over/under-correction, and schedule miscalibration resulting in poor early structure formation.

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify MLLM evaluator accuracy on a small held-out prompt set to establish baseline failure identification reliability
2. Test AIM predictions on known hard cases to validate the regression model
3. Implement and test individual intervention modules (token-only and visual-only) before combining them

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Missing specific amplification factor for the time-shift parameter in the causality-aware schedule
- AIM architecture details (hidden dimensions, layers) not fully specified
- Coordinate Descent search range and step size not provided
- Potential instability from relying on MLLM evaluator for training labels

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Overall conceptual framework and logical soundness of combining token + visual interventions with modified schedule
- **Medium Confidence:** Implementation details for interventions and dataset construction are sufficient but require careful alignment with MLLM evaluator
- **Low Confidence:** Achieving exact performance numbers uncertain without missing hyperparameters and given potential MLLM labeling instability

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test MLLM evaluator (Qwen2.5-VL) on held-out Winoground prompts to measure inter-evaluator agreement and identify potential hallucination errors
2. Conduct ablation study on time-shift parameter s in denoising schedule with values 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 to determine optimal amplification factor
3. Perform sensitivity analysis on AIM architecture by training models with different MLP sizes and evaluating on Winoground dataset to find most robust configuration
