# OASIS: Open-world Adaptive Self-supervised and Imbalanced-aware System

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.16656
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16656
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: OASIS achieves 13.74% average relative improvement in open-world settings and 12.18% under label shift scenarios compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenging problem of open-world learning where label shift, covariate shift, and unknown classes emerge simultaneously in dynamic environments, particularly when initial pre-training is conducted on class-imbalanced datasets. The authors propose OASIS, a framework that combines imbalance-aware contrastive pre-training with borderline sample refinement followed by self-supervised post-training with pseudo-labeling. The method demonstrates significant performance gains over existing adaptation techniques, particularly for minority classes in long-tailed distributions.

## Method Summary
OASIS operates in two phases: pre-training and post-training. During pre-training, the system employs imbalance-aware contrastive learning that inversely samples majority and minority classes, combined with a novel borderline sample refinement step that sharpens decision boundaries for minority classes using Mahalanobis distance. The post-training phase generates reliable pseudo-labels and adapts to open-world challenges through a conditional mechanism that triggers updates based on entropy and similarity thresholds. The backbone is frozen during post-training to maintain the geometric structure of the latent space learned during pre-training.

## Key Results
- Achieves 13.74% average relative improvement in open-world settings compared to best-performing baselines
- Demonstrates 12.18% relative improvement under label shift scenarios
- Successfully handles simultaneous label shift, covariate shift, and unknown class emergence
- Shows particular effectiveness for minority classes in long-tailed distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Borderline Sample Refinement for Decision Boundary Sharpening
The system identifies "borderline" samples using Mahalanobis distance in the latent space and pulls them toward class cores during pre-training. This creates tighter clusters and improves pseudo-label reliability for minority classes during post-training. The core assumption is that moving borderline samples inward does not excessively collapse intra-class variance while benefiting the decision boundary.

### Mechanism 2: Inverse-Distribution Contrastive Pairing
During contrastive learning, majority class samples are aggressively paired with minority class samples by inverting the sampling probability. This forces the model to prioritize distinguishing features of rare classes, assuming the feature extractor has sufficient capacity to learn distinct features without overfitting to limited samples.

### Mechanism 3: Geometry-Aware Pseudo-Labeling with Confidence Gating
The system uses the geometric structure of the latent space (distances between centroids) for robust pseudo-labeling even when classifier confidence is low. It assigns pseudo-labels only if samples are close to one centroid and significantly distant from others, assuming the pre-training phase has successfully organized the latent space such that unknown classes are distinct from known classes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Mahalanobis Distance (MD)**
  - Why needed: Core metric for identifying "borderline" samples and assigning pseudo-labels, accounting for class covariance in imbalanced data
  - Quick check: If a class has high variance, should a sample 5 units away from centroid be "borderline" or "typical"? (MD likely marks it "typical")

- **Concept: Entropy as Uncertainty Proxy**
  - Why needed: System uses entropy to trigger the adaptation mechanism when model is "confused" by distribution shift or new class
  - Quick check: In a 10-class problem, if model outputs uniform distribution (10% each), what is entropy? (Maximum/High)

- **Concept: Label Shift vs. Covariate Shift**
  - Why needed: OASIS handles both simultaneously - label shift changes class probability, covariate shift changes feature distribution
  - Quick check: If training has 99% cats/1% dogs but test has 50%/50%, is this label or covariate shift? (Label shift)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Backbone (ResNet-18) -> Classifier Head -> Borderline Detector (MD calculations) -> Conditional Adapter (entropy/similarity) -> Pseudo-Labeler (MD logic)
- **Critical path**: Pre-train (imbalance-aware contrastive + borderline refinement) → Freeze backbone → Deploy (stream data → check entropy/similarity → generate pseudo-labels → update head)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Freezing backbone maintains MD geometry but prevents deep feature learning for new domains; selective activation saves compute but might miss subtle drifts
- **Failure signatures**: Cyclical failure (forgetting previous states), MD collapse (noise pseudo-labeling), error accumulation in classifier head
- **First 3 experiments**: Visualize latent space before/after refinement with t-SNE; ablate sampling strategy comparing minority class accuracy; stress test unknown detector with completely disjoint dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does OASIS performance vary when unknown classes appear with different frequencies than the "minor classes" assumption used in experiments?
- Basis: Section 6.2 states unseen classes are included in proportion to minor classes
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation ties unknown class frequency to specific relationship with known minority classes
- What evidence would resolve: Results varying unknown class prevalence independently of initial imbalance

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the method sensitive to threshold hyperparameter selection in truly unknown domains without dataset-specific tuning?
- Basis: Tables 7 and 8 show different thresholds required for different datasets
- Why unresolved: Reliance on hand-tuned thresholds suggests potential fragility
- What evidence would resolve: Analysis of performance with fixed universal thresholds across all datasets

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does borderline sample refinement remain effective under extreme class imbalance factors (e.g., ρ=100 or 200)?
- Basis: Section 6.1 notes imbalance factor of 10 used in experiments
- Why unresolved: Moderate imbalance factor; minority class sample size may degrade MD effectiveness
- What evidence would resolve: Experimental results on datasets with higher imbalance factors

## Limitations
- Missing specific hyperparameter values (φ_border threshold and corruption severity level) prevent exact reproduction
- Implementation details for representation extraction layer and anchor selection are underspecified
- Claims of "state-of-the-art" performance lack head-to-head comparison on identical problem settings

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Overall framework design and core principles are logically sound and well-explained
- **Medium Confidence**: Borderline sample refinement implementation described but lacks corpus validation and missing threshold value
- **Low Confidence**: "State-of-the-art" claims supported by benchmarks but lack direct comparison on identical settings

## Next Checks
1. Visualize latent space refinement using t-SNE to confirm minority class cluster tightening
2. Ablate sampling strategy to isolate the 13.74% gain source by comparing minority class accuracy
3. Stress test unknown detection by evaluating entropy/MD thresholds on completely disjoint dataset (e.g., CIFAR→SVHN)
