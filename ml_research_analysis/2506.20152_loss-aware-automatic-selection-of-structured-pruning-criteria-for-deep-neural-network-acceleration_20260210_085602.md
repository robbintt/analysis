# Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria for Deep Neural Network Acceleration

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.20152
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20152
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LAASP achieves state-of-the-art performance by reducing FLOPs by 52% for ResNet on CIFAR-10 while improving accuracy, and reducing FLOPs by 42% for ResNet50 on ImageNet with only 0.33% drop in top-5 accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices by proposing a novel structured pruning method. The authors introduce LAASP (Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria), which automatically selects between magnitude and similarity-based filter pruning criteria during the training process. Unlike existing methods that require pre-trained networks and manual pruning rate allocation, LAASP eliminates these requirements through an automated approach. The method demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets using VGGNet and ResNet architectures, achieving significant computational reductions with minimal accuracy loss.

## Method Summary
LAASP introduces a novel approach to structured pruning that automatically selects between magnitude-based and similarity-based pruning criteria during training. The method employs a loss-aware mechanism that evaluates the impact of pruning on network performance in real-time, allowing for dynamic adjustment of pruning strategies. By integrating the pruning decision process directly into the training loop, LAASP eliminates the need for separate pre-training phases and manual hyperparameter tuning. The method uses a combination of filter importance metrics and structural similarity measures to determine which pruning criterion to apply at each layer and iteration, optimizing for both computational efficiency and model accuracy simultaneously.

## Key Results
- Achieved 52% reduction in FLOPs for ResNet models on CIFAR-10 while improving top-1 accuracy
- Reduced FLOPs by 42% for ResNet50 on ImageNet with only 0.33% drop in top-5 accuracy
- Eliminated need for pre-trained networks and manual pruning rate allocation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LAASP method works by dynamically selecting the most appropriate pruning criterion based on real-time loss feedback during training. The loss-aware mechanism continuously evaluates the impact of different pruning strategies on network performance, allowing the method to adapt to the specific characteristics of each layer and iteration. This adaptive approach is more effective than static pruning methods because it can respond to the changing importance of filters throughout training. The combination of magnitude and similarity-based criteria provides complementary pruning signals - magnitude captures absolute importance while similarity identifies redundant filters that can be removed without significant information loss.

## Foundational Learning

**Structured Pruning**: Removing entire filters or channels rather than individual weights to achieve acceleration while maintaining computational efficiency. Needed to reduce FLOPs and memory requirements for edge deployment. Quick check: Verify that pruned models maintain regular tensor shapes for hardware acceleration.

**Filter Importance Metrics**: Quantitative measures (like magnitude or gradient-based scores) that indicate which filters contribute most to network performance. Needed to guide pruning decisions toward less critical components. Quick check: Ensure metrics correlate with actual impact on validation loss when filters are removed.

**Similarity-Based Pruning**: Identifying and removing structurally similar filters that encode redundant information. Needed to eliminate model redundancy beyond what magnitude-based pruning can capture. Quick check: Validate that similarity measures detect functionally equivalent filters across different layers.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Training loop -> Loss evaluation -> Pruning criterion selection -> Filter removal -> Fine-tuning -> Next iteration

**Critical Path:** The core loop consists of forward pass, loss computation, pruning criterion selection based on loss sensitivity, filter removal, and parameter update. The selection mechanism operates at each training iteration, making it the critical path component.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational overhead during training (for criterion selection) against reduced inference cost and improved accuracy. It eliminates the need for separate pre-training but adds complexity to the training process itself.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor pruning criterion selection leading to accuracy degradation, excessive computational overhead during training, or failure to converge due to aggressive pruning in early training stages.

**Three First Experiments:** (1) Ablation study comparing LAASP with only magnitude-based or only similarity-based pruning on CIFAR-10; (2) Sensitivity analysis of pruning rates on ImageNet performance; (3) Comparison of training time overhead versus inference speedup across different network depths.
