# Accelerated Volumetric Compression without Hierarchies: A Fourier Feature Based Implicit Neural Representation Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08937
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08937
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Structure-free neural compression of volumetric data using Fourier-feature encoding and selective voxel sampling, achieving 14× compression with 63.7% training time reduction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a structure-free neural compression method for large volumetric datasets using Fourier-feature encoding and selective voxel sampling. The approach combines Fourier feature mapping with morphological dilation to prioritize active regions, reducing redundant computation without hierarchical metadata. In experiments, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7% (from 30 to 11 minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB and SSIM by 0.008. The resulting neural representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead.

## Method Summary
The method uses Fourier feature encoding to map 3D coordinates to a higher-dimensional sinusoidal space, enabling the network to capture high-frequency details that standard MLPs struggle with. An Active Voxel Mask (AVM) identifies non-zero voxels, and morphological dilation expands this mask to include boundary context. The network trains only on these voxels, skipping background regions. The compressed representation is purely the MLP parameters, eliminating hierarchical metadata overhead. During inference, the model queries any (x, y, z) coordinate to retrieve the predicted value, achieving structure-free compression with a theoretical compression factor of 14.

## Key Results
- Sparse training with morphological dilation reduced training time by 63.7% (30 to 11 minutes)
- Quality degradation was minimal: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (32.60 to 32.01), SSIM by 0.008 (0.948 to 0.940)
- Compression rate of 14 achieved by storing only network weights, eliminating traditional data-loading overhead
- Training on AVM with ℓ=5 dilation achieved comparable quality to full-volume training while significantly reducing computation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fourier Feature Encoding
- Mapping coordinates to higher-dimensional sinusoidal feature space enables the network to capture high-frequency details that standard MLPs struggle with
- Core assumption: Standard MLPs exhibit spectral bias toward low-frequency functions, limiting their ability to represent fine-grained volumetric details without this encoding
- Evidence anchors: Fourier mapping allows learning both low and high-frequency components more effectively; spectral bias limitation addressed in corpus literature
- Break condition: If frequency band coverage is mismatched to data's spectral content, reconstruction will blur high-frequency features

### Mechanism 2: Morphological Dilation for Selective Training
- Training only on active voxels plus dilated boundary halo achieves comparable quality to full-volume training while reducing training time by ~64%
- Core assumption: Background voxels contribute minimally to reconstruction quality but consume proportional training compute
- Evidence anchors: Sparse training achieved PSNR 32.01 vs. BBX 32.60 with 63.7% time reduction; dilation creates context buffer around active regions
- Break condition: If dataset has irregular activity patterns or sharp discontinuities, minimal dilation produces visible edge artifacts

### Mechanism 3: Structure-Free Weight-Based Storage
- Storing only learned network weights eliminates hierarchical metadata overhead and achieves compression factor ~14
- Core assumption: Number of learnable parameters is substantially smaller than total voxel count, and function can be well-approximated by MLP capacity
- Evidence anchors: Compression rate of 14 achieved; stored solely as network weights eliminates data-loading overhead
- Break condition: If volumetric data has highly irregular patterns across all frequency bands, required network capacity may approach or exceed original data size

## Foundational Learning

- **Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)**: The entire method is built on representing volumetric data as continuous function f(x, y, z) → value, learned by an MLP, rather than discrete voxel storage
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why querying an INR at arbitrary sub-voxel coordinates yields continuous values?

- **Fourier Feature / Positional Encoding**: Without this, MLPs cannot efficiently learn high-frequency spatial variations (spectral bias). The Fourier mapping is key to reconstruction quality
  - Quick check question: What happens to reconstruction detail if you reduce Fourier feature count k from 1280 to 128?

- **Morphological Dilation**: The selective training strategy relies on expanding a binary mask to include boundary context. Understanding ℓ parameter's effect on tradeoff between speed and quality is essential
  - Quick check question: If you dilate a mask by ℓ=10, what fraction of original bounding box voxels are now included in training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  ```
  Input (x, y, z) → Fourier Feature Encoder (k=1280 features) → MLP (8 hidden layers, 512 neurons each) → Scalar output (value)
  Training data variants: BBX (all voxels), AVM (active voxels only), AVM_dilated(ℓ) (AVM + ℓ-neighbor halo)
  ```

- **Critical path**:
  1. Preprocess: Normalize per-grid values; generate AVM and dilated variants
  2. Train: Coordinate-to-value regression using MSE loss, Adam optimizer (lr=0.0003)
  3. Store: Serialize only model weights (no spatial metadata)
  4. Inference: Query full bounding box coordinates; compute PSNR/SSIM/NRMSE

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - ℓ (dilation amount): Higher ℓ → better quality, slower training. ℓ=5 achieves ~0.59 dB PSNR loss for 63.7% time reduction
  - k (Fourier features): More features capture finer detail but increase memory/compute. Paper uses k=1280 after grid search
  - Network depth/width: 8 layers × 512 neurons provides sufficient capacity for test volume; larger volumes may require tuning
  - Structure vs. structure-free: No hierarchical metadata simplifies implementation and eliminates data-loading overhead, but sacrifices spatial indexing for partial queries

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Hallucinated regions: Training on AVM only (ℓ=0) causes network to invent content in absent regions
  - Edge artifacts at sharp boundaries: ℓ=1 may be insufficient for datasets with discontinuous activity patterns
  - Spectral blur: If gauss multiplier or k is too low, high-frequency details are lost

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline reproduction: Train on BBX with hyperparameters from Table 1; verify PSNR ≈ 32.60 and training time ≈ 30 min on your hardware
  2. Dilation sweep: Train with ℓ ∈ {1, 2, 5, 10} on same volume; plot PSNR and training time vs. ℓ to identify optimal tradeoff point for your data characteristics
  3. Generalization test: Apply same hyperparameters to different volumetric dataset (different size/structure); measure if compression rate and quality hold, or if hyperparameter re-tuning is required

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can an adaptive mechanism be developed to automatically determine the optimal dilation parameter (ℓ) for diverse volumetric datasets?
  - Basis: Authors note optimal size remains dataset-dependent
  - Why unresolved: Currently manually tuned; incorrect values cause hallucinations or artifacts
  - What evidence would resolve it: Automated algorithm that sets ℓ based on local geometry, maintaining high PSNR across varied datasets

- **Open Question 2**: To what extent can network pruning strategies compound training acceleration achieved by selective voxel sampling?
  - Basis: Paper lists pruning strategies for faster training as specific avenue for future work
  - Why unresolved: Unknown if weight pruning interacts positively with current data-sparse training regime
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks showing reduced training time or model size with equivalent reconstruction quality when pruning is applied to dilated training set

- **Open Question 3**: Are non-MLP architectures more effective than current Fourier-feature-based MLP for structure-free volumetric compression?
  - Basis: Conclusion suggests exploring non-MLP architectures to refine balance of compression and quality
  - Why unresolved: Reliance on 8-layer MLP limits theoretical compression limit; different architectures might represent high-frequency details more efficiently
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of alternative architectures (e.g., SIRENs) demonstrating higher compression rates or faster convergence while maintaining SSIM > 0.94

## Limitations

- Fourier feature hyperparameter k=1280 was not justified by ablation; unclear if optimal or dataset-specific
- Compression ratio of 14 assumes network capacity matches data complexity; highly irregular data may require larger networks, reducing compression gains
- No validation on diverse volumetric data types (medical, entertainment) beyond single CFD dataset; generalization is assumed but untested

## Confidence

- **High**: Fourier feature encoding improves high-frequency reconstruction (supported by spectral bias literature and visible quality gains in ablation)
- **Medium**: Morphological dilation with ℓ=5 achieves claimed 63.7% time reduction with acceptable quality loss (empirical but not extensively cross-validated)
- **Low**: 14× compression ratio holds for any volumetric data (only tested on one CFD dataset; scaling behavior unknown)

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Fourier Features**: Train models with k ∈ {128, 256, 512, 1280} on same dataset; plot PSNR vs. k to verify claimed benefit plateaus around k=1280

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Apply method to medical CT scan and large entertainment volume (e.g., OpenVDB sample); measure if compression ratio and quality hold or degrade

3. **Edge Artifact Analysis**: Visually inspect reconstructions near sharp boundaries for ℓ ∈ {1, 2, 5, 10}; quantify hallucination/false content in AVM-only training vs. dilated variants
