# Building Safer Sites: A Large-Scale Multi-Level Dataset for Construction Safety Research

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09203
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09203
- Reference count: 24
- Multi-level construction safety dataset with incidents, inspections, and violations from OSHA records (2013-2022)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Construction Safety Dataset (CSDataset), a large-scale, multi-level dataset combining incidents, inspections, and violations from OSHA records spanning 2013-2022. The dataset integrates structured attributes (e.g., weather, job title, location) with unstructured narratives, enabling both traditional ML and LLM-based safety analyses. Experiments demonstrate that LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen2.5-7B) outperform traditional ML models in injury severity prediction (F1-scores up to 0.820), while cross-level analysis reveals that complaint-driven inspections reduce subsequent incident likelihood by 17.3%.

## Method Summary
The researchers constructed CSDataset by integrating multiple levels of construction safety data from OSHA records spanning 2013-2022. They combined incident reports, inspection records, and violation data while enriching the dataset with structured attributes like weather conditions, job titles, and location information alongside unstructured narrative descriptions. The dataset enables both traditional machine learning approaches and large language model-based analyses. Experimental validation involved training both traditional ML models and LLMs on the dataset, with comprehensive evaluation across prediction tasks including injury severity classification.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieved superior performance in injury severity prediction with F1-scores up to 0.820
- Complaint-driven inspections showed 17.3% reduction in subsequent incident likelihood
- Dataset supports both causal modeling and benchmarking across construction safety research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its multi-level structure that captures the complex relationships between incidents, inspections, and violations while integrating both structured and unstructured data. This comprehensive approach enables more nuanced safety analytics by providing rich contextual information (weather, location, job roles) alongside narrative descriptions that traditional datasets often lack.

## Foundational Learning
1. OSHA data integration methodology - Needed for understanding how different safety data sources can be combined; Quick check: Verify data preprocessing steps and normalization across different data sources
2. Multi-level safety analytics framework - Needed for grasping how incidents, inspections, and violations relate; Quick check: Confirm the relational structure between different data levels
3. LLM application in safety prediction - Needed for understanding how language models improve prediction accuracy; Quick check: Review model architecture and fine-tuning procedures
4. Causal inference in safety research - Needed for interpreting inspection effectiveness findings; Quick check: Examine the statistical methods used to establish causal relationships
5. Safety data reporting biases - Needed for understanding limitations in the dataset; Quick check: Review documentation of data quality and completeness
6. Construction safety regulatory frameworks - Needed for contextualizing the dataset's scope; Quick check: Verify alignment with OSHA reporting requirements

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Data Collection -> Data Integration -> Feature Engineering -> Model Training -> Evaluation

Critical path: Data Integration -> Feature Engineering -> Model Training -> Evaluation

Design tradeoffs: The dataset prioritizes comprehensiveness over real-time updates, favoring historical depth and relational richness rather than streaming capabilities.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation may occur when applying models trained on this dataset to regions with different regulatory frameworks or construction practices not well-represented in the OSHA data.

First experiments:
1. Replicate injury severity prediction task using provided baseline models
2. Conduct cross-validation across different construction sub-sectors within the dataset
3. Test model performance on held-out inspection records to validate temporal generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Reliance on OSHA records may introduce reporting biases due to varying state and time-period practices
- Cross-level analysis cannot definitively establish causality due to potential confounding factors
- Geographic specificity to U.S. construction context limits generalizability to other countries

## Confidence
- High: Technical integration of multi-level data and superior LLM performance for injury severity prediction
- Medium: Causal inference claims regarding inspection effects requiring further validation
- Low: Extrapolation of findings beyond U.S. construction context

## Next Checks
1. Conduct external validation using independent construction safety datasets from other countries to assess generalizability
2. Perform sensitivity analysis on causal modeling assumptions, particularly regarding unmeasured confounders in inspection effectiveness estimates
3. Evaluate model performance across different construction sub-sectors to identify potential domain-specific limitations
