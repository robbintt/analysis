# Exploring the Potential of Large Multimodal Models as Effective Alternatives for Pronunciation Assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.11229
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11229
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: GPT-4o struggles with low-level pronunciation scoring but generates useful feedback when combined with traditional methods

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), specifically GPT-4o, as zero-shot alternatives for pronunciation assessment across multiple granularities. The study evaluates GPT-4o's ability to score pronunciation accuracy, fluency, prosody, and completeness using the Speechocean762 dataset, and assesses feedback quality through Large Language Models (LLMs). Results show that GPT-4o struggles with low-level granularity scoring compared to traditional models, achieving significantly lower correlation metrics (e.g., PCC and SCC), and exhibits a high failure rate (>40%) in generating complete assessments. However, it performs better at sentence-level scoring and generates useful feedback that correlates well with human-labeled scores. Integrating GPT-4o with traditional pronunciation assessment methods improves feedback quality and accuracy, highlighting the potential of combining LMMs with conventional approaches for enhanced language learning tools.

## Method Summary
The study employs zero-shot prompting with GPT-4o using the `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` API to assess pronunciation across phoneme, word, sentence, and multigranularity levels. The Speechocean762 dataset provides audio recordings, reference text, and human scores from Chinese English learners. GPT-4o generates JSON-formatted scores and feedback using "Let's think step by step" chain-of-thought prompting. Traditional pronunciation assessment baselines (GOPT, 3MH, LMMPA, Azure PA) are used for comparison. LLM evaluators (GPT-4, GPT-4o mini, Phi-4) assess feedback quality based on helpfulness and correlation metrics.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieves significantly lower correlation metrics (PCC 0.15-0.27) at phoneme and word levels compared to traditional models
- Sentence-level scoring performs better with PCC 0.66-0.67, closer to traditional methods
- GPT-4o exhibits >40% failure rate in generating complete assessments with frequent malformed JSON outputs
- Integrating GPT-4o with traditional PA models improves both feedback quality and scoring accuracy
- LLM-evaluated feedback shows good correlation with human scores despite subjective nature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Abstraction Granularity
Large Multimodal Models like GPT-4o perform better at higher-level (sentence-level) pronunciation assessment tasks than lower-level (phoneme/word) tasks in zero-shot settings. The model's pre-training on vast multimodal data allows it to grasp holistic patterns (fluency, prosody, overall accuracy) more effectively than fine-grained acoustic-phonetic details. Processing audio and text together enables semantic-level alignment that translates more readily to overall sentence quality judgments than to specific phoneme error detection, which requires specialized low-level acoustic feature extraction.

### Mechanism 2: LLM-as-Judge for Feedback Quality
Using a separate LLM as an evaluator provides a viable proxy for assessing the helpfulness of generated pronunciation feedback in the absence of human-labeled ground-truth. The evaluating LLM is prompted with a rubric similar to how a human expert would grade. It analyzes generated feedback against known human scores to determine if feedback correctly identifies issues and offers plausible solutions, bypassing costly human collection processes.

### Mechanism 3: Hybrid System Complementarity
Combining traditional align-based pronunciation assessment with an LMM yields higher quality feedback and more accurate scores than either system alone. Traditional PA models excel at low-level scoring but lack generative capabilities. LMMs generate rich, context-aware text but are less precise at low-level acoustic scoring. Feeding accurate scores from traditional models into the LMM as context grounds feedback in precise data, mitigating scoring weakness while leveraging generative strength.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Pearson & Spearman Correlation (PCC & SCC)**
- Why needed here: These are core quantitative metrics evaluating how well predicted scores align with human expert scores. PCC measures linear relationships; SCC measures rank-order correlation crucial for ordinal data like subjective scores.
- Quick check question: If a model perfectly ranks 100 pronunciations from best to worst but uses a 1-100 scale when humans used 1-10, which correlation metric would be higher?

**Concept: Zero-Shot Learning vs. Fine-Tuning**
- Why needed here: This study evaluates GPT-4o zero-shot (without training on Speechocean762), explaining the performance gap with specialized models and highlighting the difference between general-purpose capability and task-specialized performance.
- Quick check question: What is the primary reason given for GPT-4o's lower performance on low-level granularity tasks?

**Concept: Force Alignment (Align-based vs. Align-free)**
- Why needed here: The paper contrasts traditional align-based methods (using force alignment to map audio to text/phonemes) with align-free methods (like the LMM approach), critical for appreciating architectural differences and why hybrid models are proposed.
- Quick check question: Does GPT-4o in this study use force alignment to process speech for scoring?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Speechocean762 Dataset -> LMM Scoring Engine (GPT-4o) -> Traditional PA Baselines -> LLM Evaluator (GPT-4, GPT-4o mini, Phi-4)

**Critical path:** For production-grade solutions: `Audio + Reference Text` → `Traditional PA Model` (accurate word/phoneme scores) → `LMM` (takes scores + text + audio as context) → `High-Quality Feedback`

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Accuracy vs. Generality:** Specialized models offer high scoring accuracy but no generative feedback; LMMs offer generative feedback but lower scoring accuracy
- **Zero-shot vs. Fine-tuned:** Zero-shot evaluation is fast but yields lower performance; fine-tuning increases performance but adds cost and complexity
- **Cost/Reliability:** LMM API calls had >40% failure rate with format inconsistencies

**Failure signatures:**
- High failure rate (>40% empty/invalid JSON responses)
- Low granularity performance (PCC 0.15-0.27 at phoneme/word levels)
- Inconsistent results between runs (especially word-level stress scores)

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Reproduce zero-shot scoring on Speechocean762 subset with provided prompts; measure PCC/SCC at all granularity levels; verify failure rate
2. Validate LLM-as-judge by having human experts and LLM evaluator score feedback helpfulness; calculate correlation between human and LLM scores
3. Implement hybrid architecture integrating baseline PA model with GPT-4o; feed baseline scores into prompt; measure feedback quality improvement using LLM evaluator

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with domain-specific pronunciation datasets significantly improve performance on low-granularity tasks (phoneme and word-level scoring) where zero-shot models currently fail?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state in Section 6 that they "did not fine-tune the LMMs" and identify this as a limitation, noting that future work should involve "fine-tuning the LMMs with domain-specific datasets."
- Why unresolved: The study was restricted to zero-shot learning due to API constraints, leaving the potential benefits of supervised adaptation unexplored for correcting the weak correlations found at the phoneme level.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between the zero-shot GPT-4o baseline and a fine-tuned LMM on the Speechocean762 phoneme-level test set.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the helpfulness of LMM-generated pronunciation feedback correlate with human expert evaluations compared to the LLM-based automatic evaluations used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 lists the "lack of ground-truth feedback" as a primary limitation, noting that feedback is subjective and securing reliable human labels is challenging.
- Why unresolved: The paper relied on models like GPT-4 and Phi-4 to automatically grade the helpfulness of the feedback, but the validity of these "LLM-as-a-judge" scores for pronunciation feedback remains unverified against human ground truth.
- What evidence would resolve it: A human evaluation study where language teachers blindly score the helpfulness of generated feedback, followed by a correlation analysis with the automated LLM evaluation scores.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the pronunciation assessment capability of GPT-4o generalize to speakers with native languages (L1) other than Chinese?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates the model exclusively on the Speechocean762 dataset, which consists entirely of "English learners who are native Chinese speakers" (Section 4.1).
- Why unresolved: Pronunciation errors are often language-transfer errors specific to the speaker's L1. The model's high failure rate and specific scoring inaccuracies might be biased by the training data or specific to the error patterns of Chinese speakers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the model's scoring correlation and failure rate on a multi-L1 dataset (e.g., TIMIT or L2-ARCTIC) containing speakers of diverse language backgrounds.

## Limitations

- High failure rate (>40%) of GPT-4o API responses with malformed JSON creates significant reliability concerns
- Lack of ground-truth feedback limits validation of generated feedback quality
- Zero-shot evaluation without fine-tuning explains lower performance on low-level granularity tasks
- Limited human evaluation (only 30 samples) for feedback quality assessment

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Sentence-level scoring performance and overall feedback quality assessment
**Medium Confidence:** Low-level granularity scoring limitations and hybrid system benefits
**Low Confidence:** Specific numerical performance metrics due to API reliability issues

## Next Checks

1. Replicate zero-shot scoring on Speechocean762 subset to verify reported PCC/SCC values and failure rates
2. Conduct expanded human evaluation (n=100+) to validate LLM-as-judge methodology for feedback quality assessment
3. Implement and test hybrid architecture with different traditional PA models to confirm complementarity claims and optimal integration approach
