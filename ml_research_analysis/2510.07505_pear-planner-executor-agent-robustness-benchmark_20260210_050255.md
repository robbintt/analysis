# PEAR: Planner-Executor Agent Robustness Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07505
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07505
- Reference count: 36
- Introduces PEAR benchmark for evaluating MAS utility and vulnerability

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PEAR, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of planner-executor multi-agent systems (MAS). The benchmark consists of 84 user tasks across four scenarios, 120 base attack tasks targeting harmful actions, privacy leakage, and resource exhaustion, and 1,680 attacked user tasks for injection attacks. Experiments demonstrate that a weak planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak executor, and that attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective. The benchmark achieves utility levels above 65% in most configurations while attack success rates consistently exceed 70%, with higher-utility configurations showing greater vulnerability.

## Method Summary
The PEAR benchmark systematically evaluates planner-executor MAS through three attack types: harmful actions, privacy leakage, and resource exhaustion. It includes 84 clean user tasks, 120 base attack tasks, and 1,680 attacked user tasks across four scenarios. The evaluation measures both task completion rates and attack success rates under different configurations, comparing weak versus strong planners and executors, with and without memory modules.

## Key Results
- Weak planners degrade clean task performance more severely than weak executors
- Memory modules are essential for planners but not executors
- Trade-off exists between task performance and robustness
- Planner-targeted attacks are particularly effective

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its structured approach to measuring both utility and vulnerability in a controlled manner. By systematically varying planner and executor strength, and by introducing targeted attacks, it reveals the relative importance of each component in system robustness. The inclusion of memory modules in planner evaluation helps identify architectural dependencies that affect overall system performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Planner-executor architecture**: Core MAS design pattern where planner determines actions and executor implements them
  - *Why needed*: Enables separation of planning and execution for modular system design
  - *Quick check*: Verify planner and executor outputs align with task requirements

- **Attack surface analysis**: Systematic evaluation of potential vulnerabilities through targeted attacks
  - *Why needed*: Identifies weaknesses before deployment in real-world applications
  - *Quick check*: Confirm attack success rates vary predictably with system configuration

- **Robustness-utility trade-off**: Relationship between system performance and vulnerability to attacks
  - *Why needed*: Helps balance competing goals of effectiveness and security
  - *Quick check*: Plot utility vs. attack success rates across configurations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Tasks -> Planner/Executor MAS -> Attack Injection -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**: User task input → Planner decision → Executor action → Task completion/attack success evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Memory module inclusion improves planner performance but adds complexity
- Stronger executors provide better attack resistance but may not compensate for weak planners
- Higher task performance correlates with increased vulnerability

**Failure Signatures**:
- Planner weakness manifests as reduced task completion across all scenarios
- Executor weakness shows up as inconsistent task execution
- Memory absence causes planner-specific failures in complex tasks

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare clean task performance with weak vs. strong planners
2. Evaluate attack success rates when targeting planner vs. executor
3. Test memory module impact on planner performance in multi-step tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Benchmark scope limited to planner-executor MAS architectures
- Evaluation focuses on only three specific attack types
- Trade-off between task performance and robustness needs validation across diverse applications

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Relative impact of weak planners vs. weak executors on clean task performance, effectiveness of planner-targeted attacks

**Medium confidence**: Necessity of memory modules for planners, robustness-utility trade-off, attack success rates

**Low confidence**: Generalizability to other MAS architectures and attack scenarios beyond tested types

## Next Checks

1. Test benchmark across different MAS architectures (decentralized systems, hierarchical agents) to assess generalizability
2. Expand attack surface analysis to include additional attack types (prompt injection variations, model poisoning)
3. Validate planner-weakness impact on real-world applications using domain-specific task sets and production-level agents
