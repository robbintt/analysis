## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20055
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20055

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning personalized ad impact in online advertising when rewards are delayed and influenced by cumulative effects like reinforcement or fatigue. The authors model ad bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson rewards, capturing the complex dynamics of customer responses over time. They introduce a two-stage maximum likelihood estimator (TS-MLE) combined with data-splitting strategies to efficiently estimate delayed effects while controlling estimation error. Based on this estimator, they design a reinforcement learning algorithm that achieves a near-optimal regret bound of Õ(dH²√T), where d is the contextual dimension, H is the number of rounds, and T is the number of customers.

## Method Summary
The authors tackle the problem of learning personalized ad impact in online advertising under delayed rewards by modeling ad bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson rewards. They introduce a novel two-stage maximum likelihood estimator (TS-MLE) combined with data-splitting strategies to efficiently estimate delayed effects while controlling estimation error. The algorithm leverages this estimator to achieve a near-optimal regret bound of Õ(dH²√T), where d is the contextual dimension, H is the number of rounds, and T is the number of customers.

## Key Results
- Achieves a near-optimal regret bound of Õ(dH²√T) for personalized ad bidding with delayed rewards
- Introduces a two-stage maximum likelihood estimator (TS-MLE) to efficiently estimate delayed effects
- Simulation experiments validate the algorithm's effectiveness compared to baseline policies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by decomposing the complex delayed reward problem into manageable components through the TS-MLE framework. By using data-splitting strategies, the algorithm can separately learn the delayed reward structure and the underlying CMDP dynamics, reducing estimation bias and variance. The Poisson assumption on delayed rewards allows for tractable maximum likelihood estimation while still capturing the key temporal dependencies in ad response patterns.

## Foundational Learning

**Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP)**: A reinforcement learning framework where states are augmented with contextual information, enabling personalization. Needed to model customer heterogeneity in ad responses. Quick check: Verify that the CMDP formulation correctly captures the delayed reward structure.

**Delayed Poisson Rewards**: Assumes rewards follow a Poisson distribution with potential delays. Provides a tractable model for cumulative ad effects. Quick check: Validate Poisson assumption against real ad response data.

**Two-Stage Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: A statistical technique that separates parameter estimation into sequential stages to reduce bias. Critical for accurate delayed effect estimation. Quick check: Confirm that the two-stage approach improves estimation accuracy compared to single-stage methods.

**Data-Splitting Strategies**: Partitioning data into separate sets for different estimation purposes. Controls estimation error by preventing overfitting. Quick check: Test sensitivity to different data-splitting ratios.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Context features → CMDP state → Action selection → Delayed reward observation → TS-MLE estimation → Policy update

**Critical Path**: Context → State representation → Action → Reward → Estimation → Policy improvement

**Design Tradeoffs**: The Poisson reward assumption simplifies estimation but may not capture all real-world patterns. The data-splitting requirement ensures estimation accuracy but demands sufficient sample size.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance indicates either violation of Poisson assumptions, insufficient data for splitting, or incorrect CMDP modeling of customer dynamics.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test regret bound scaling with increasing T values
2. Validate TS-MLE accuracy against ground truth delayed effects
3. Compare performance against non-personalized baseline policies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework assumes Poisson-distributed delayed rewards, which may not fully capture real-world ad response patterns
- The data-splitting strategy requires sufficient sample size to maintain estimation accuracy
- The regret bound assumes stationary environment conditions and known model parameters

## Confidence
- Confidence in theoretical claims: **High**
- Confidence in simulation results: **Medium**
- Confidence in real-world applicability: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct A/B testing with live ad campaigns to evaluate performance against the stated regret bound in real-world conditions
2. Test algorithm robustness under non-Poisson reward distributions and time-varying environmental conditions
3. Validate scalability and performance with smaller sample sizes to assess practical data requirements
