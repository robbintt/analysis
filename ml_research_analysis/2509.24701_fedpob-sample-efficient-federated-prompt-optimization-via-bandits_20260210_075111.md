# FedPOB: Sample-Efficient Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24701
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24701
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces FedPOB, a sample-efficient federated prompt optimization framework using multi-armed bandits that outperforms existing baselines through parameter sharing rather than raw data exchange.

## Executive Summary
FedPOB addresses the challenge of prompt optimization for proprietary LLMs in federated settings where users need to collaboratively improve prompts while preserving privacy. The framework employs federated Linear UCB algorithms where agents share model parameters instead of raw data, significantly reducing communication costs and protecting user privacy. FedPOB-Pref extends this approach to handle preference-based feedback through federated dueling bandits, making it practical for real-world scenarios where users provide preference rather than numerical ratings.

The approach demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing methods, with the key insight that collaborative learning becomes more effective as more agents participate. This sample-efficient method is particularly valuable given the high cost of LLM queries and the black-box nature of proprietary models. The framework enables multiple users to optimize prompts collaboratively without sharing sensitive data, addressing both privacy concerns and the need for efficient exploration in the vast prompt space.

## Method Summary
FedPOB introduces a federated bandit framework for prompt optimization where each agent independently explores the prompt space using Linear UCB algorithms while periodically synchronizing model parameters with a central server. The framework assumes a linear reward structure where the quality of a prompt can be predicted from its parameters, enabling efficient exploration-exploitation trade-offs. In the federated setting, agents share their learned model parameters rather than raw prompt-reward pairs, preserving privacy while accelerating convergence.

The FedPOB-Pref extension handles preference-based feedback, which is more practical in real-world scenarios where users provide pairwise comparisons rather than numerical ratings. This is achieved through federated dueling bandits, where agents compare pairs of prompts and share preference information through a similar parameter-sharing mechanism. The framework includes careful handling of communication efficiency, ensuring that the benefits of collaboration outweigh the costs of parameter synchronization across multiple agents.

## Key Results
- FedPOB significantly outperforms existing baselines in prompt optimization tasks, with performance gains increasing as more agents participate in the federated learning process.
- FedPOB-Pref achieves superior performance-to-communication trade-off in preference-based feedback settings, making it more practical for real-world deployment.
- The federated approach demonstrates substantial sample efficiency compared to non-collaborative methods, reducing the number of LLM queries needed to find high-quality prompts.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the structure of the prompt space and reward functions through linear approximations, enabling efficient exploration via bandit algorithms. By sharing model parameters rather than raw data, agents can benefit from each other's exploration while maintaining privacy. The linear assumption allows the framework to generalize from limited observations, making it sample-efficient despite the high cost of LLM queries.

## Foundational Learning

Linear Bandits Theory
- Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for efficient exploration-exploitation trade-offs in high-dimensional prompt spaces
- Quick check: Verify that reward functions are approximately linear in prompt parameters through regression analysis

Federated Learning Principles
- Why needed: Enables collaborative learning while preserving data privacy through parameter sharing instead of raw data exchange
- Quick check: Ensure communication overhead is minimized through efficient parameter compression techniques

Preference-Based Learning
- Why needed: Handles practical scenarios where users provide pairwise comparisons rather than numerical ratings
- Quick check: Validate that preference feedback can be effectively modeled through dueling bandit algorithms

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Agents -> Parameter Server -> Linear UCB Model
Critical Path: Prompt Generation -> LLM Query -> Reward Observation -> Parameter Update -> Synchronization
Design Tradeoffs: Privacy vs. Performance (parameter sharing balances both), Communication Cost vs. Convergence Speed
Failure Signatures: Poor performance may indicate non-linear reward structure, insufficient agent diversity, or communication bottlenecks
First Experiments:
1. Test FedPOB with 2-3 agents on a simple prompt optimization task to verify basic functionality
2. Compare convergence rates between federated and non-federated approaches
3. Evaluate communication overhead under different parameter sharing frequencies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes homogeneous agent populations with identical reward functions and prompt parameter spaces
- Linear reward structure may not capture complex non-linear interactions between prompts and LLM responses
- Limited communication overhead analysis focusing on parameter sharing rather than comprehensive bandwidth considerations

## Confidence

High confidence in mathematical formulation and theoretical guarantees of federated linear UCB algorithm
Medium confidence in experimental results based on synthetic and limited real-world datasets
Medium confidence in practical applicability across diverse real-world scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate FedPOB with heterogeneous agent populations where reward functions and prompt spaces differ across agents to assess robustness in realistic federated settings.

2. Implement and test the framework with non-linear reward structures to determine the effectiveness of linear assumptions in complex prompt optimization scenarios.

3. Conduct comprehensive communication overhead analysis including network latency, bandwidth constraints, and energy consumption metrics for different federated learning scales.
