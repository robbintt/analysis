core_contribution: This paper addresses a continuous-time, continuous-space chance-constrained
  stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem where the probability of failure to satisfy
  state constraints is explicitly bounded. The authors leverage the notion of exit
  time from continuous-time stochastic calculus to formulate the chance-constrained
  SOC problem without any conservative approximation.

# Strong Duality and Dual Ascent Approach to Continuous-Time Chance-Constrained Stochastic Optimal Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.19451
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19451
- Reference count: 40
- Addresses continuous-time chance-constrained SOC without conservative approximations using exit time theory

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to continuous-time chance-constrained stochastic optimal control by leveraging exit time theory from stochastic calculus. The authors formulate the chance constraint directly without conservative approximations by transforming it into an expectation of an indicator function. A dual formulation is developed where the dual function is expressed through the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE parameterized by a dual variable. The work establishes strong duality between the primal chance-constrained problem and its dual under specific system assumptions. The proposed path integral approach enables numerical solution of the dual problem via gradient ascent using open-loop trajectory samples.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a dual ascent approach for continuous-time chance-constrained stochastic optimal control problems. They transform the chance constraint into an expectation of an indicator function, which can be incorporated into the cost function through a dual formulation. The dual function is expressed in terms of the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation parameterized by the dual variable. The Path integral approach is utilized to numerically solve the dual problem via gradient ascent using open-loop samples of system trajectories. Under certain assumptions on system dynamics and cost function, strong duality is established between the primal chance-constrained problem and its dual formulation.

## Key Results
- Strong duality holds between primal chance-constrained SOC problem and dual under specific system assumptions
- Path integral approach successfully solves dual problem via gradient ascent using trajectory samples
- Simulation studies demonstrate effectiveness on chance-constrained motion planning for mobile robot navigation
- Solution quality compared favorably with finite difference method in presented examples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging exit time theory from stochastic calculus to formulate chance constraints without conservative approximations. By transforming the chance constraint into an expectation of an indicator function, the problem can be embedded into a dual formulation. The dual function's expression through the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE creates a tractable optimization problem. The path integral formulation enables efficient numerical solution through sampling-based gradient ascent, avoiding the computational burden of solving high-dimensional PDEs directly.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Primal Problem -> Dual Formulation -> HJB PDE -> Path Integral Solver -> Gradient Ascent

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from the primal chance-constrained problem through dual transformation, HJB PDE formulation, path integral numerical solution, to gradient ascent optimization. Each stage must succeed for the final solution to be valid.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades analytical tractability for numerical sampling efficiency. While avoiding conservative approximations, it requires solving an HJB PDE and relies on sufficient trajectory samples for path integral approximation. The strong duality assumption may not hold for all system classes.

**Failure Signatures**: Convergence issues in gradient ascent indicate poor path integral approximation or violation of strong duality conditions. High variance in trajectory samples suggests insufficient sampling or numerical instability in HJB solution. Failure to satisfy chance constraints indicates either algorithmic failure or invalid strong duality assumptions.

**First Experiments**: 1) Validate HJB PDE solution accuracy for simple linear systems 2) Test path integral convergence with varying sample sizes 3) Verify strong duality conditions for benchmark nonlinear systems

## Next Checks
1. Verify strong duality conditions on systems with non-smooth dynamics and non-convex constraints to assess robustness beyond the presented assumptions
2. Benchmark computational efficiency and solution quality against finite difference methods on higher-dimensional systems (n > 5)
3. Test the path integral solver's sensitivity to trajectory sample size and noise levels to establish practical convergence criteria
