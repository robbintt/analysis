core_contribution: This paper develops non-asymptotic error bounds for nonlinear stochastic
  approximation algorithms in the Wasserstein-p distance. The main idea is to couple
  the discrete-time stochastic approximation process with a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
  process, and then analyze the convergence of this coupling to obtain explicit finite-sample
  guarantees.

# Finite-Sample Wasserstein Error Bounds and Concentration Inequalities for Nonlinear Stochastic Approximation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.02445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02445
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Non-asymptotic Wasserstein-p error bounds for nonlinear stochastic approximation with explicit convergence rates

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes finite-sample error bounds for nonlinear stochastic approximation algorithms using Wasserstein-p distance. The key innovation is coupling the discrete-time stochastic approximation process with a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to derive explicit convergence rates. The analysis provides both distributional guarantees and high-probability concentration inequalities that improve upon traditional moment-based approaches.

## Method Summary
The method couples the stochastic approximation iterates with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to leverage the convergence properties of the limiting diffusion. This coupling allows analysis of the Wasserstein distance between the discrete-time process and its Gaussian limit. The approach works under general noise conditions including martingale differences and ergodic Markov chain noise, providing explicit rates for both last iterates (γ_n^(1/6)) and Polyak-Ruppert averages (n^(-1/6)).

## Key Results
- Normalized last iterates converge to Gaussian distribution at rate γ_n^(1/6) in Wasserstein-p metric
- Polyak-Ruppert average converges at rate n^(-1/6) in Wasserstein-p metric
- Explicit high-probability concentration inequalities improving on Markov's inequality bounds
- Applications to linear stochastic approximation and stochastic gradient descent with quantified CLT convergence rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on establishing a Wasserstein-2 contraction for the coupled system of the original stochastic approximation and its Ornstein-Uhlenbeck approximation. By showing that the distance between these processes contracts over time, the authors bound how far the discrete process is from its Gaussian limit. The key insight is that the Wasserstein distance provides a natural metric for quantifying distributional convergence that directly yields concentration inequalities.

## Foundational Learning
1. Wasserstein-p distance (needed because: provides metric for distributional convergence with better concentration properties than other metrics)
   - Quick check: Verify triangle inequality and contraction properties

2. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes (needed because: serves as the limiting diffusion for stochastic approximation)
   - Quick check: Confirm stationarity and Gaussianity of the limit

3. Coupling techniques (needed because: enables comparison between discrete and continuous processes)
   - Quick check: Verify contraction of coupled processes

4. Martingale difference sequences (needed because: general noise model for stochastic approximation)
   - Quick check: Validate conditional independence properties

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Stochastic approximation iterates -> Coupling with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck -> Wasserstein distance analysis -> Convergence rates

Critical path: The core analysis follows from establishing Wasserstein contraction for the coupled system, which then directly yields both distributional convergence rates and concentration inequalities.

Design tradeoffs: The use of Wasserstein distance provides tighter concentration bounds than moment-based methods but requires more sophisticated analysis. The coupling approach trades off generality for explicit rates.

Failure signatures: Bounds may become loose if: (1) the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck approximation is poor, (2) noise conditions are violated, or (3) smoothness/boundedness assumptions fail.

First experiments:
1. Verify Wasserstein-2 contraction for a simple linear SA example
2. Compare concentration bounds from this approach vs. Markov's inequality on simulated data
3. Test convergence rate predictions for SGD on convex problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Requires smoothness conditions on f and bounded noise that may not hold in practice
- Tightness of bounds depends on quality of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck approximation
- Analysis assumes standard stochastic approximation setup which may not cover all applications

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework: High
- Practical applicability: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Numerical experiments demonstrating the tightness of Wasserstein-p bounds across different problem classes and noise distributions
2. Extension of analysis to verify bounds under weaker smoothness and boundedness assumptions
3. Empirical comparison of derived concentration inequalities with traditional moment-based approaches to validate practical improvements
