- Primary result: A unified biomedical entity linking dataset integrating nine expert-annotated corpora with UMLS normalization and hierarchical path annotations across 11 vocabularies

## Executive Summary
MedPath addresses semantic fragmentation in biomedical entity linking by integrating nine heterogeneous expert-annotated corpora spanning clinical notes, literature, social media, and drug labels. The dataset normalizes all entities to canonical UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) and maps them to 62 biomedical vocabularies, while providing full hierarchical paths in 11 vocabularies. This enables training and evaluation of interpretable, vocabulary-agnostic EL systems. The dataset includes over 500,000 mentions and 45,000 unique concepts, with hierarchical annotations for 98.7% of mentions. Experiments demonstrate that models trained on MedPath consistently outperform those trained on individual datasets or single domains.

## Method Summary
MedPath integrates nine biomedical entity linking datasets through a multi-stage pipeline: (1) data ingestion from various formats (BRAT, PubTator, XML, TSV) into a standardized JSON schema, (2) UMLS normalization using dictionary lookup with exact match and semantic containment fallbacks, (3) cross-vocabulary mapping to 62 biomedical knowledge graphs via UMLS atom information, and (4) hierarchical path extraction for 11 vocabularies using custom API-based extractors. The unified dataset enables vocabulary-agnostic EL evaluation with both flat and hierarchy-aware metrics (Ancestor@k, Descendant@k, Hierarchy@k) that reward semantically proximal predictions even when exact concept matching fails.

## Key Results
- MedPath contains 513K mentions and 44,259 unique UMLS CUIs across nine expert-annotated biomedical corpora
- Hierarchical path annotations cover 98.7% of mentions across 11 biomedical vocabularies
- Models trained on pooled MedPath data consistently outperform single-domain or single-dataset training settings
- Hierarchy-aware evaluation metrics (Hierarchy@k) capture semantic proximity that flat accuracy misses, showing ~17% additional relevant predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Vocabulary Normalization via UMLS Backbone
- Claim: Normalizing entities to canonical UMLS CUIs resolves semantic fragmentation across heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graphs.
- Mechanism: The pipeline maps native concept IDs from disparate sources (SNOMED-CT, MeSH, MedDRA) to unified UMLS CUIs using dictionary lookup first, then fallback to exact string match and semantic containment heuristics. This creates a shared semantic space where models trained across datasets share consistent label semantics.
- Core assumption: UMLS mappings accurately capture cross-vocabulary equivalence relationships and remain stable across vocabulary versions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies"
  - [section 3.2 Stage 2]: "To resolve semantic fragmentation, we normalized all concept IDs from their native BioKG to the latest Unified Medical Language System (UMLS 2025AA) release"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence on normalization quality validation; relies on inherited UMLS mappings
- Break condition: If UMLS atom-level mappings contain systematic errors for specific domain vocabulary pairs, cross-domain transfer may propagate noise rather than reduce it.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Path Enrichment for Semantic-Aware Evaluation
- Claim: Full ontological path annotations (root→leaf) enable hierarchy-aware evaluation that distinguishes semantically proximal errors from random mistakes.
- Mechanism: Custom extractors traverse each vocabulary's hierarchy iteratively from entity to root, capturing all paths including multiple inheritance. Evaluation metrics (Ancestor@k, Descendant@k, Hierarchy@k) reward predictions that land in the same taxonomic neighborhood even if exact match fails.
- Core assumption: Hierarchical proximity in biomedical ontologies correlates with clinical semantic similarity and downstream utility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "enriched with full ontological paths — i.e., from general to specific — in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies"
  - [section 4.3]: "SNOMED-CT is the most information dense and structurally complex; 84% of its mapped concepts feature multiple inheritance paths"
  - [section 6.1]: "While TF-IDF attains Acc@1=51%, its Hierarchy@1 jumps to 68.6%, indicating that an additional ~17% of mentions retrieve a concept that is semantically related"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence; no comparison to human judgments of semantic similarity
- Break condition: If ontological hierarchies encode organizational rather than semantic relationships, hierarchy-aware metrics may reward non-semantic similarities.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Domain Aggregation for Generalization Gains
- Claim: Training on pooled multi-domain data with unified labels consistently outperforms single-domain or single-dataset training.
- Mechanism: Combining diverse text genres (clinical notes, literature, social media, drug labels) with canonical CUIs allows models to learn robust surface-form-to-concept mappings by seeing more lexical variants per concept across contexts.
- Core assumption: Domain diversity transfers positively; exposure to informal social media text helps recognize concept variants in clinical notes and vice versa.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.1]: "the model trained on MedPath consistently outperforms the other two settings, and sometimes by a large margin"
  - [section 5.1]: "The unified UMLS mapping enables consistent label semantics across datasets, letting us 1) pool supervision in the overall setting"
  - [corpus]: Related work (SynCABEL, evaluation papers) addresses data scarcity but not multi-domain aggregation specifically; no direct corpus support
- Break condition: If domain-specific annotation conventions create systematic labeling inconsistencies (e.g., boundary differences), pooling may introduce conflicting supervision.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **UMLS (Unified Medical Language System)**
  - Why needed here: MedPath's entire integration strategy depends on understanding that UMLS provides a metathesaurus mapping terms from 200+ vocabularies to canonical Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). Without this, the "cross-vocabulary" claim is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given a MeSH code D013144 and a SNOMED-CT code 271782001, can you explain how MedPath determines they represent the same concept?

- Concept: **Entity Linking vs. Named Entity Recognition**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses EL and NER distinctly—NER identifies mention spans, EL maps them to KB entries. MedPath's value proposition is primarily EL-focused (linking to CUIs with hierarchical paths), not just span detection.
  - Quick check question: A model correctly identifies "bit drowsy" as a symptom span but maps it to CUI C0028754 (Disorder of consciousness) instead of C0013144 (Drowsiness). Is this an NER error, EL error, or both?

- Concept: **Hierarchical Evaluation Metrics**
  - Why needed here: Traditional EL evaluation uses flat accuracy. MedPath introduces hierarchy-aware metrics that require understanding ancestor/descendant relationships in ontologies.
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts "Myocardial infarction" (child) when the gold label is "Heart disease" (parent), which hierarchical metrics would credit this partially vs. treating it as a complete error?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Ingestion Layer: 9 dataset-specific parsers (BRAT, PubTator, XML, TSV) → standardized JSON schema
  - UMLS Mapping Layer: Dictionary lookup → exact match fallback → semantic containment fallback (flagged for optional filtering)
  - Cross-Vocabulary Mapper: CUI → parallel codes in 62 vocabularies via UMLS atom information
  - Path Extraction Layer: 11 vocabulary-specific extractors with API/download access → root-to-leaf path storage
  - EL Pipeline (experiments): TF-IDF/SapBERT retriever → SapBERT cross-encoder reranker → hierarchy-aware evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Source data access (DUAs required for MIMIC-IV, ShARe/CLEF)
  2. UMLS license and local installation (2025AA)
  3. Vocabulary API access (SNOMED-CT, MedDRA require licenses; MeSH, HPO, LOINC are free/open)
  4. Run pipeline scripts in order: parse → normalize → map → extract_paths
  5. Validate: 98.7% of mentions should have hierarchical annotations; check for unmapped CUIs

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Noise vs. coverage**: Exact match and semantic containment fallbacks add ~2.5% mentions but introduce potential noise; users can filter these with a flag
  - **Vocabulary version lock-in**: Scripts support version parameterization but paths are snapshots; outdated paths may accumulate over time without regeneration
  - **Multi-inheritance complexity**: SNOMED-CT averages 20+ paths per concept; storing all paths increases storage but enables full DAG-aware evaluation

- Failure signatures:
  - **Low Acc@1 but high Hierarchy@1**: Model lands in correct semantic neighborhood but fails fine-grained disambiguation—indicates granularity ambiguity in training data or dictionary
  - **Clinical notes underperforming** (observed in experiments): Suggests clinical vocabulary has more surface form variants or weaker cross-vocabulary mapping coverage
  - **Path extraction failures for specific vocabularies**: API rate limits, authentication errors, or vocabulary structure changes not reflected in extractors

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce baseline comparison**: Train SapBERT reranker on MedPath (overall) vs. single-domain (in-domain) vs. single-dataset splits; verify macro-averaged Acc@1 improvements reported in Figure 5
  2. **Hierarchy-aware metric sensitivity analysis**: Compare model rankings under Acc@1 vs. Hierarchy@1 vs. Ancestor@1 to determine whether metric selection changes conclusions about which retrieval method is superior
  3. **Ablation on noisy mappings**: Train with and without exact-match/semantic-containment fallback examples (flagged in data) to quantify noise impact on downstream performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- UMLS mapping process relies on inherited mappings without direct validation against human judgments of semantic equivalence across vocabularies
- Generalization gains from multi-domain aggregation may depend on specific domain combinations and dataset characteristics
- Clinical utility of hierarchy-aware evaluation metrics remains unproven; no validation against expert judgments of semantic similarity

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Cross-vocabulary normalization mechanism and dataset construction pipeline are well-specified and reproducible. The hierarchical path enrichment approach is technically sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalization gains from multi-domain aggregation are demonstrated but may depend on specific domain combinations and dataset characteristics.
- **Low Confidence**: The clinical utility of hierarchy-aware evaluation metrics remains unproven; no validation against expert judgments of semantic similarity.

## Next Checks
1. **UMLS Mapping Quality Validation**: Compare MedPath's normalized CUIs against independent manual mappings for a subset of mentions across vocabulary pairs to quantify mapping accuracy.

2. **Hierarchy Metric Validation**: Conduct human evaluation to determine whether ontology-aware metrics (Ancestor@k, Hierarchy@k) correlate with clinical semantic similarity judgments compared to flat accuracy metrics.

3. **Domain Transfer Analysis**: Perform controlled experiments isolating the contribution of lexical diversity versus semantic consistency in multi-domain training, measuring performance on held-out domains not seen during training.
