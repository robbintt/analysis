# Vision Transformer for Intracranial Hemorrhage Classification in CT Scans Using an Entropy-Aware Fuzzy Integral Strategy for Adaptive Scan-Level Decision Fusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.08609
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08609
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Achieved Ac=0.963±0.004, F1=0.943±0.004 on 5-class ICH classification from CT scans using PVT + SHAP + entropy-aware fuzzy integral fusion

## Executive Summary
This study presents a vision transformer-based framework for automated classification of five intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) subtypes in CT scans. The approach combines PVT-based feature extraction, SHAP-driven feature selection, and an entropy-aware fuzzy integral operator for scan-level decision fusion. A comprehensive dataset of 1,947 CT scans across five ICH subtypes was collected and labeled by neurosurgeons. The model significantly outperformed existing deep learning architectures, achieving higher accuracy and robustness while reducing computational costs. Key metrics include improved precision, sensitivity, and F1-score across all ICH subtypes.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a hierarchical approach: preprocessing CT scans through background removal and binary masking, followed by PVT feature extraction with patch size 4×4 across four stages. PCA reduces features to 50 components, which undergo SHAP-based selection. A boosting neural network with 10 component models generates slice-level predictions, which are aggregated to scan-level using an entropy-aware fuzzy Choquet integral operator. The system was trained using patient-level 80/20 splits with 5 independent runs, optimizing hyperparameters including learning rate (1e-3) and weight decay (0.05).

## Key Results
- Achieved macro-averaged accuracy of 0.963±0.004 and F1-score of 0.943±0.004
- Outperformed existing deep learning architectures on all evaluation metrics
- Successfully classified all five ICH subtypes with high precision and sensitivity
- Demonstrated robustness across 1,947 CT scans from 848 patients

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of PVT for efficient feature extraction with SHAP for discriminative feature selection enables the model to focus on clinically relevant patterns in ICH detection. The entropy-aware fuzzy integral operator dynamically weights slice-level predictions based on their uncertainty, improving scan-level reliability. This multi-stage approach combines the spatial attention capabilities of transformers with uncertainty-aware fusion, addressing the inherent variability in multi-slice CT scans while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for emergency diagnostics.

## Foundational Learning
- **PVT Architecture**: Pyramidal vision transformer for hierarchical feature extraction - needed for efficient multi-scale representation of CT slices; quick check: verify patch size and stage dimensions match reported values
- **SHAP Feature Selection**: Shapley additive explanations for identifying important features - needed to reduce dimensionality while preserving discriminative information; quick check: confirm >1% contribution threshold selection
- **Fuzzy Choquet Integral**: Non-linear aggregation operator accounting for interactions between inputs - needed for adaptive decision fusion considering slice-level uncertainties; quick check: validate λ optimization in (-1,0) range

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Preprocessing -> PVT Feature Extraction -> PCA + SHAP Selection -> Boosting Neural Network -> Entropy-aware Fuzzy Integral Fusion -> Scan-level Classification
- **Critical Path**: CT scan preprocessing → PVT feature extraction → SHAP selection → Boosting model → Fuzzy integral fusion → Final prediction
- **Design Tradeoffs**: PVT chosen over CNNs for better spatial attention with lower computational cost; fuzzy integral preferred over simple averaging for uncertainty-aware fusion; boosting ensemble balances model complexity with performance
- **Failure Signatures**: Data leakage from overlapping patients causes inflated metrics; class imbalance leads to poor minority class performance; incorrect λ value degrades fusion quality
- **First Experiments**: 1) Verify PVT feature extraction matches architectural specifications; 2) Test SHAP selection threshold impact on performance; 3) Validate fuzzy integral λ optimization process

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Multi-Modal Data Integration**: The authors propose investigating whether incorporating MRI or clinical patient history could enhance classification accuracy by providing complementary information, as the current study is limited to CT scan analysis without other imaging modalities or clinical metadata.
- **Multi-Center Validation**: The authors note that conducting large-scale multi-center validation would ensure generalizability across different populations and imaging protocols, as the current dataset is derived from only two medical centers in Tehran which may limit generalizability.
- **Real-Time Edge Deployment**: The authors propose developing efficient lightweight models optimized for real-time clinical deployment on edge devices, as while the current model reduces computational costs, it has not been tested for latency or throughput on mobile or edge hardware.

## Limitations
- Private dataset unavailability prevents independent validation of reported performance metrics
- Significant class imbalance (421 IPH vs 66 EDH patients) may affect minority class generalization
- Architectural specifications incomplete (exact PVT variant, λ value, batch size, total epochs not reported)

## Confidence
- Vision Transformer architecture and feature extraction pipeline: High confidence
- Dataset collection and labeling methodology: Medium confidence
- Overall classification performance metrics: Medium confidence
- Entropy-aware fuzzy integral fusion approach: Medium confidence
- Clinical deployment readiness: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the PVT-based feature extraction and SHAP selection pipeline on a publicly available ICH dataset (e.g., Qure25k or RSNA-ICH) to verify architectural claims and feature selection methodology
2. Implement the entropy-aware fuzzy Choquet integral fusion and conduct ablation studies comparing with alternative fusion methods to validate the claimed improvement in scan-level reliability
3. Perform class-balanced evaluation on the reported dataset to assess whether significant class imbalance affects performance on minority ICH subtypes, particularly EDH
