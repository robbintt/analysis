# Pay Attention to What and Where? Interpretable Feature Extractor in Vision-based Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.10071
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10071
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces Interpretable Feature Extractor (IFE) for spatially accurate attention masks in vision-based deep RL

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the spatial misalignment problem in CNN-based attention mechanisms for vision-based deep reinforcement learning, where overlapping convolutions cause attention masks to misalign with visual objects. The authors propose an Interpretable Feature Extractor (IFE) architecture that decouples spatial interpretability from learning efficiency through a two-stage encoding process. The HUE module uses non-overlapping convolutions and soft attention to generate spatially accurate attention masks, while the AFE module employs overlapping convolutions for efficient learning. The method is evaluated on 57 ATARI games, demonstrating superior interpretability without sacrificing data efficiency compared to traditional CNN baselines.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to generate interpretable attention masks in vision-based deep reinforcement learning by introducing the Interpretable Feature Extractor (IFE). The IFE consists of two modules: Human-Understandable Encoding (HUE) and Agent-Friendly Encoding (AFE). The HUE module uses non-overlapping convolutions to preserve spatial relationships, generating spatially accurate attention masks through soft attention mechanisms. The AFE module then processes these features using standard overlapping convolutions for efficient policy learning. The architecture is integrated into Fast and Data-efficient Rainbow and A3C-LSTM frameworks and evaluated on 57 ATARI games, showing clear, consistent, and highly interpretable attention masks that outperform traditional CNN and S3TA baselines in spatial preservation.

## Key Results
- IFE produces clear, consistent, and highly interpretable attention masks on 57 ATARI games
- Outperforms traditional CNN and S3TA baselines in spatial preservation and interpretability
- Maintains comparable data efficiency to CNN baselines while demonstrating versatility and partial transferability in continual learning settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The IFE architecture works by decoupling spatial interpretability from learning efficiency through a two-stage encoding process. The HUE module preserves spatial relationships using non-overlapping convolutions, ensuring that attention masks align correctly with visual objects. The soft attention mechanism in HUE generates spatially accurate masks by weighting features based on their relevance to the task. The AFE module then leverages these spatially preserved features with overlapping convolutions to enable efficient learning, combining the benefits of spatial accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Image -> HUE (Non-overlapping Conv + Soft Attention) -> AFE (Overlapping Conv) -> Policy Network

Critical Path:
Input -> HUE -> Attention Mask Generation -> AFE -> Policy Output

Design Tradeoffs:
- HUE uses non-overlapping convolutions for spatial accuracy but increases computational cost
- AFE uses standard overlapping convolutions for efficiency but sacrifices some spatial precision
- The two-stage approach adds complexity but achieves both interpretability and performance

Failure Signatures:
- Attention masks that don't align with visual objects indicate HUE malfunction
- Poor policy performance despite clear attention masks suggests AFE issues
- Computational bottlenecks in HUE module when processing high-resolution inputs

First 3 Experiments:
1. Visualize attention masks on simple synthetic images with known object locations
2. Compare feature map spatial relationships between CNN and IFE architectures
3. Evaluate policy performance on a small subset of ATARI games before full-scale testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns with HUE module for high-resolution visual inputs due to computational complexity
- Limited quantitative metrics for interpretability, relying primarily on qualitative visual assessments
- Evaluation focused on ATARI games, leaving open questions about performance in modern high-resolution visual domains

## Confidence
- High confidence in claims about spatial misalignment problem in standard CNNs
- Medium confidence in data efficiency parity claims with CNN baselines
- Low confidence in general transferability and continual learning capabilities

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate IFE on high-resolution visual inputs (256x256 or higher) from modern benchmark suites to assess scalability limits
2. Implement standardized spatial preservation metrics (object IoU between attention masks and ground truth object locations) to quantitatively compare against baselines
3. Test the architecture on non-game visual domains such as autonomous driving or robotic manipulation to verify broader applicability beyond ATARI environments
