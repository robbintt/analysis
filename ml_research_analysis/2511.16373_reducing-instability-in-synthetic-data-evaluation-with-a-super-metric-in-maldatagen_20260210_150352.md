# Reducing Instability in Synthetic Data Evaluation with a Super-Metric in MalDataGen

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.16373
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16373
- **Reference count**: 11
- **Primary result**: Integration of a Super-Metric into MalDataGen to improve stability and standardization in synthetic data evaluation for Android malware detection.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a Super-Metric into MalDataGen to address instability and lack of standardization in synthetic data evaluation for Android malware detection. The Super-Metric aggregates eight fidelity metrics across four dimensions into a single weighted score, optimizing alignment with classifier performance. Experiments with ten generative models and five balanced datasets show that the Super-Metric exhibits greater stability and consistency compared to traditional metrics, with stronger and more stable correlations to utility metrics such as recall and F1-score. This integration transforms MalDataGen into a complete ecosystem for generating, evaluating, and benchmarking synthetic data, supporting reproducible and methodologically sound experiments in cybersecurity.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a Super-Metric that combines eight fidelity metrics—derived from dimensionality, statistical similarity, classification performance, and information criteria—into a single weighted score. This metric was integrated into MalDataGen, a framework for generating and evaluating synthetic Android malware datasets. The Super-Metric was optimized to maximize correlation with classifier performance (recall and F1-score) and tested against ten generative models across five balanced datasets. By aggregating multiple metrics, the Super-Metric reduces noise and improves comparability across heterogeneous generative models, addressing the instability inherent in using individual fidelity metrics.

## Key Results
- The Super-Metric demonstrates greater stability and consistency compared to traditional individual metrics in synthetic data evaluation.
- Stronger and more stable correlations were observed between the Super-Metric and utility metrics (recall and F1-score) than with conventional metrics.
- Integration of the Super-Metric transforms MalDataGen into a complete ecosystem for generating, evaluating, and benchmarking synthetic data, supporting reproducible experiments in cybersecurity.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Super-Metric works by aggregating multiple fidelity metrics into a single weighted score, which reduces the noise and variability inherent in using individual metrics. By optimizing the weights to maximize alignment with classifier performance, the Super-Metric provides a more stable and consistent evaluation framework. This aggregation approach smooths out inconsistencies across different generative models and datasets, enabling more reliable benchmarking and comparison.

## Foundational Learning
- **Fidelity Metrics Aggregation**: Combining multiple evaluation metrics into a single score to reduce variability and improve stability. *Why needed*: Individual metrics can be unstable and inconsistent across models. *Quick check*: Verify that aggregated scores correlate better with classifier performance than individual metrics.
- **Weighted Scoring Optimization**: Assigning weights to aggregated metrics to maximize alignment with utility metrics (e.g., recall, F1-score). *Why needed*: Ensures the Super-Metric reflects real-world classifier performance. *Quick check*: Validate weight optimization using cross-validation or similar methods.
- **Synthetic Data Evaluation for Cybersecurity**: Using synthetic data to train and evaluate malware detection models. *Why needed*: Real-world malware data is often scarce or imbalanced. *Quick check*: Test synthetic data utility on real-world detection tasks.
- **MalDataGen Framework**: A tool for generating and evaluating synthetic Android malware datasets. *Why needed*: Provides a standardized environment for synthetic data experiments. *Quick check*: Ensure compatibility with diverse generative models and datasets.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: MalDataGen -> Super-Metric Integration -> Generative Models -> Utility Metrics (Recall, F1-score)
- **Critical Path**: Synthetic data generation -> Super-Metric evaluation -> Classifier performance assessment -> Benchmarking and comparison
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Aggregation reduces noise but may obscure individual metric insights; weight optimization balances fidelity and utility but requires careful tuning.
- **Failure Signatures**: High variability in individual metrics, weak correlation with classifier performance, or instability across datasets indicates Super-Metric inadequacy.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test Super-Metric stability across multiple generative models on a single dataset.
  2. Compare Super-Metric correlation with utility metrics versus individual fidelity metrics.
  3. Validate Super-Metric performance on imbalanced datasets to assess generalizability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The Super-Metric's generalizability beyond Android malware detection and other data modalities (e.g., time series, graph data) remains uncertain.
- Weight selection for the Super-Metric is heuristic, raising questions about reproducibility and optimality.
- Experimental scope is limited to ten generative models and five balanced datasets, potentially affecting robustness in more diverse or imbalanced scenarios.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The Super-Metric reduces noise and improves comparability across generative models within the tested scope.
- **Medium confidence**: Claims of methodological soundness and ecosystem completeness are supported, but experimental diversity and non-tabular data validation are lacking.
- **Low confidence**: Claims regarding optimal weight selection and generalizability to other domains require further validation.

## Next Checks
1. Validate the Super-Metric's performance on imbalanced datasets and non-tabular data types (e.g., time series, graph data) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct systematic optimization of the Super-Metric weights using cross-validation or other robust methods to ensure reproducibility and optimality.
3. Extend evaluation to additional generative models and application domains (e.g., intrusion detection, financial fraud) to test robustness and scalability.
