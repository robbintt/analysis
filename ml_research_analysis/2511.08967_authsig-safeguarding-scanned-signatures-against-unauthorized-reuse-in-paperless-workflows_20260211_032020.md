# AuthSig: Safeguarding Scanned Signatures Against Unauthorized Reuse in Paperless Workflows

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.08967
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08967
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Achieves >98% watermark extraction accuracy while preserving visual fidelity of static signatures

## Executive Summary
AuthSig introduces a watermark-based static electronic signature framework that binds authentication information to signature images, addressing the security vulnerabilities of static scanned signatures in paperless workflows. By leveraging generative models and fine-grained style modulation, AuthSig embeds watermarks into dynamic signature features to enforce a "One Signature, One Use" policy while preserving visual fidelity. A keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy enriches training data diversity without compromising structural integrity. Experimental results demonstrate over 98% watermark extraction accuracy under digital distortions, signature-specific degradations, and print-scan processes, with robustness validated across multiple office operations and cross-media scenarios. AuthSig bridges the gap between traditional signature convenience and digital authentication needs, offering a practical solution for secure electronic document workflows.

## Method Summary
AuthSig is a latent diffusion-based watermarking framework that modulates style embeddings to implicitly encode watermark bits into signature images. The method uses a pre-trained VAE fine-tuned on signature data, feature encoders for content and style extraction, and a gated residual fusion block to inject watermark information into style features. A keypoint-driven structural augmentation strategy enhances training diversity while preserving stroke connectivity. The framework employs supervised contrastive learning to extract signer-invariant content features, allowing watermark modulation without structural corruption. Training involves multiple stages: VAE fine-tuning, feature learning, and joint training of watermark embedder and extractor components.

## Key Results
- Over 98% watermark extraction accuracy under digital distortions, signature-specific degradations, and print-scan processes
- Superior performance compared to baseline watermarking schemes (HiDDeN, CIN) on sparse signature data
- Successful validation across multiple office operations and cross-media scenarios while maintaining visual fidelity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Modulating style embeddings enables implicit watermark embedding that survives distortion while remaining visually imperceptible.
- Mechanism: A gated residual fusion block injects watermark bits into style features (F'_s = F^0_s + g·Proj(w)), which then condition a latent diffusion model. The generator reconstructs the signature with watermark information distributed across dynamic stroke features rather than pixel intensities.
- Core assumption: Human visual systems tolerate minor style variations in handwriting, and signature strokes inherently vary across instances due to environmental factors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits"
  - [section: Watermark Embedding & Extraction] Equation 8 shows gated fusion; Equation 10 shows loss components including L_style with margin constraint
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for style-modulation watermarking; related work (HiDDeN, CIN) uses global high-frequency embedding which fails on sparse signatures
- Break condition: If watermark bits require amplitude exceeding natural handwriting variance, or if extraction network fails to recover F'_s under distortion.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Keypoint-driven structural augmentation creates realistic training diversity without breaking topological integrity.
- Mechanism: Skeleton extraction → RDP keypoint filtering → TPS transformation with truncated Gaussian displacement. Warps signature images while preserving stroke connectivity and overall structure.
- Core assumption: Thin Plate Spline deformation with bounded perturbation (σ=1, k-sigma truncation) models natural handwriting variation without creating anatomically impossible strokes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding"
  - [section: Keypoint-Based Structural Augmentation] Equations 1-3 define RDP filtering and clamped TPS warping
  - [corpus] No corpus papers address signature-specific augmentation; general image augmentation causes stroke discontinuities
- Break condition: If ε in RDP is too aggressive (losing stroke detail) or σ too large (creating unrealistic deformations).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Supervised contrastive learning isolates signer-invariant content features, allowing style-space watermarking without structural corruption.
- Mechanism: Content encoder E_c trained with L_SupCon (Equation 5) to maximize same-signer cohesion and cross-signer separability. Style encoder E_s jointly trained; watermark only modulates F_s, not F_c.
- Core assumption: Signature features decompose cleanly into content (stroke structure) and style (dynamic variation), and same-signer samples share content despite stylistic variation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "supervised contrastive learning to extract signer-invariant content features"
  - [section: Feature Decoupling] Table 3 shows Full-Model HWD=0.2047 vs Style-Only=1.7905, demonstrating decoupling necessity
  - [corpus] Weak corpus connection; AirSignatureDB addresses behavioral biometrics but not feature decoupling for watermarking
- Break condition: If content-style entanglement prevents isolation (Figure 7 shows VAE latent interpolation creates ghosting artifacts).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)
  - Why needed here: AuthSig performs denoising in VAE latent space (Z_t) rather than pixel space for computational efficiency, requiring understanding of forward/reverse diffusion processes and DDIM sampling.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Equation 7 optimizes ||ε - ε_θ(Z_t, t, F_s, F_c)||² rather than direct pixel reconstruction?

- **Concept**: Supervised Contrastive Learning
  - Why needed here: The content encoder must pull same-signer embeddings together while pushing different-signer embeddings apart—standard classification doesn't guarantee this geometry.
  - Quick check question: In Equation 5, what does P(k) represent and why does the denominator sum over A(k) rather than P(k)?

- **Concept**: Thin Plate Spline (TPS) Transformation
  - Why needed here: Data augmentation requires non-rigid deformation that preserves smoothness; TPS minimizes bending energy while interpolating control point displacements.
  - Quick check question: Why would affine transformation be insufficient for modeling handwriting variation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  VAE (fine-tuned) -> Content Encoder (E_c) -> Style Encoder (E_s) -> Watermark Embedder (E_W) -> UNet Denoiser -> VAE Decoder -> Watermark Extractor (D_W)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Pre-training: Fine-tune VAE on signature data (L_VAE in Equation 6)
  2. Feature learning: Train E_c with supervised contrastive loss; train E_s + UNet jointly for reconstruction
  3. Watermark training: Freeze E_c, E_s, UNet, VAE; train only E_W and D_W with L_total (Equation 10)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **48-bit capacity** vs robustness: Paper reports 98%+ extraction but doesn't explore higher payloads
  - **Style-only modulation** vs content modulation: Preserves structure but limits embedding degrees of freedom
  - **GPDS-150 (120 signers train, 30 test)**: Limited dataset scale; augmentation mitigates but doesn't replace real diversity
  - **DDIM sampling**: Faster than DDPM but may affect generation quality at low steps

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Overexposure (Brightness=2.0)**: Accuracy drops to 93.7% due to stroke loss in light signatures
  - **Content-style entanglement**: Figure 7 shows VAE latent interpolation creates ghosting; contrastive learning must prevent this
  - **High-frequency embedding**: Baselines (HiDDeN, CIN) fail on sparse signatures (14% pixel density)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **VAE reconstruction sanity check**: Compare PT-VAE vs FT-VAE on held-out signatures using PSNR/SSIM/rHWD (replicate Table 4). Target: rHWD < 0.05 after fine-tuning
  2. **Content encoder validation**: Verify same-signer embeddings cluster tightly (cosine similarity > 0.8) while cross-signer similarity < 0.3. Use t-SNE visualization on test set
  3. **Watermark robustness under distortion**: Implement distortion layer with JPEG Q=50, Gaussian blur σ=1.0, and print-scan simulation. Target: >95% extraction accuracy before proceeding to full training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the watermark capacity be increased beyond the current 48-bit limit without compromising the visual fidelity or robustness of the signature?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "Future work will target greater watermark capacity and improved visuals."
- Why unresolved: The current architecture balances capacity against the "insensitivity to subtle style variations" of the human visual system; increasing bits may require altering style embeddings in ways that become perceptible.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified AuthSig model demonstrating successful embedding and extraction of >64 bits while maintaining comparable HWD/FID scores and >98% accuracy under distortions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the style modulation required for watermark embedding interfere with the performance of independent, biometric-based offline signature verification systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The method relies on the "human visual system's insensitivity," but fine-grained style modulation alters the precise dynamic features (stroke weight, curvature) that biometric systems use to verify identity.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates visual quality and watermark extraction, but does not test if the generated signatures pass third-party writer-dependent or writer-independent verification classifiers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative results showing the False Rejection Rate (FRR) of standard verification systems (e.g., Siamese networks) when presented with AuthSig-generated signatures versus original samples.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How resilient is the watermark extraction mechanism against targeted adversarial attacks or diffusion-purification attempts designed to strip the embedded metadata?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The robustness evaluation covers common digital distortions (JPEG, noise) and print-scan processes, but lacks analysis of malicious, model-aware attacks intended to forge or destroy the watermark.
- Why unresolved: Deep-learning-based watermarking schemes are often vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that optimize for image preservation while maximizing extraction error.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extraction accuracy metrics following adversarial perturbation attacks (e.g., PGD) or image-to-image translation attacks applied to the watermarked signatures.

## Limitations
- Limited dataset scale (120 signers training, 30 testing) may not generalize to diverse handwriting styles and cultural variations
- 48-bit watermark capacity appears constrained by robustness requirements with unexplored higher capacity possibilities
- Architectural specifications lack critical hyperparameters like loss weights, training schedules, and network layer depths

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The fundamental mechanism of style-space watermarking via gated residual fusion is well-supported by the mathematical formulation and ablation studies showing decoupling necessity
- **Medium confidence**: The keypoint-driven augmentation strategy appears sound theoretically, but lacks direct empirical validation beyond the reported robustness improvements
- **Medium confidence**: The supervised contrastive learning for feature decoupling is supported by the dramatic performance differences in Table 3, though the clean separation of content and style features remains challenging

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on augmentation**: Remove keypoint-based TPS augmentation and replace with standard affine transforms. Compare watermark extraction accuracy under the same distortion suite (JPEG, blur, print-scan) to quantify the augmentation contribution.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Train AuthSig on GPDS-150 (120 signers) but evaluate exclusively on CEDAR or IAM datasets without fine-tuning. Measure extraction accuracy and HWD to assess domain transfer capability.

3. **Watermark capacity stress test**: Incrementally increase watermark length from 48 bits to 96 and 144 bits while monitoring extraction accuracy and visual distortion metrics. Identify the capacity-robustness tradeoff curve.
