# iServe: An Intent-based Serving System for LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.13111
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13111
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: iServe reduces latency by 77.62%, cost by 86.70%, and SLO violations by 7.09× while improving GPU throughput by 4.72× compared to state-of-the-art systems.

## Executive Summary
iServe is an intent-based LLM serving system that automates the deployment configuration selection process for LLM inference. The system introduces lightweight LLM fingerprints to efficiently profile and estimate latency and memory requirements across hundreds of deployment configurations, eliminating the need for expensive manual profiling. Based on user intent (minimize latency, cost, memory, or meet SLOs), iServe selects optimal configurations and applies a load-aware GPU placement policy. Evaluation shows iServe significantly outperforms existing systems while reducing profiling costs by 6.05× (GPU-hours).

## Method Summary
iServe addresses the challenge of optimizing LLM serving by introducing a fingerprint-based profiling system that captures essential architectural characteristics of LLMs. The system profiles only key components (embedding and hidden layers) to estimate performance across various deployment configurations without running full models. When a request arrives, iServe analyzes the user's intent and matches it with precomputed fingerprints to select the optimal deployment configuration. A load-aware GPU placement policy then dynamically allocates GPUs based on current system load and configuration requirements. This approach eliminates the manual, time-consuming process of profiling each configuration combination while maintaining accuracy in performance predictions.

## Key Results
- 77.62% latency reduction compared to state-of-the-art serving systems
- 86.70% cost reduction through optimal configuration selection
- 7.09× reduction in SLO violations with improved GPU throughput of 4.72×

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
iServe works by abstracting LLM complexity into lightweight fingerprints that capture essential performance characteristics. By focusing on the repetitive structure of decoder-only models (embedding and hidden layers), the system can accurately extrapolate full-model performance from partial profiling. The intent-based selection mechanism ensures configurations are chosen based on user priorities rather than generic optimization. The load-aware placement policy dynamically adapts to system conditions, preventing bottlenecks and maximizing resource utilization across heterogeneous workloads.

## Foundational Learning
- LLM Fingerprinting - Profiling only key architectural components to estimate full-model performance. Why needed: Full model profiling is prohibitively expensive. Quick check: Compare fingerprint predictions against actual full-model measurements.
- Intent-based Configuration Selection - Matching user requirements (latency, cost, memory) with optimal deployment settings. Why needed: Different applications have different priorities. Quick check: Verify intent satisfaction across diverse use cases.
- Load-aware GPU Placement - Dynamic allocation of GPUs based on current system load and configuration requirements. Why needed: Static allocation leads to resource contention. Quick check: Measure GPU utilization under varying load patterns.
- SLO-aware Serving - Ensuring service level objectives are met through proactive configuration selection. Why needed: SLA violations can be costly. Quick check: Track SLO violation rates across different workloads.
- Configuration Space Reduction - Eliminating suboptimal configurations through intelligent filtering. Why needed: Brute-force searching all configurations is impractical. Quick check: Validate reduction ratio versus actual performance gains.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: User Request -> Intent Analyzer -> Fingerprint Matcher -> Configuration Selector -> GPU Placer -> Serving Engine

Critical Path: User Request → Intent Analyzer → Fingerprint Matcher → Configuration Selector → GPU Placer → Serving Engine

Design Tradeoffs: The system trades initial profiling overhead for long-term optimization gains, sacrificing some configuration granularity for significant reduction in profiling costs. The load-aware placement introduces complexity but enables better resource utilization across heterogeneous workloads.

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation when fingerprinting assumptions break (non-standard architectures), configuration mismatches under extreme load variations, and placement policy failures in highly heterogeneous environments.

First Experiments:
1. Profile a small set of diverse LLMs to validate fingerprint accuracy against full-model measurements
2. Test intent-based configuration selection with synthetic workloads across different priority scenarios
3. Evaluate GPU placement policy under varying load patterns to measure resource utilization improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How can intent-based serving systems integrate accuracy as a user intent given the current lack of standardized metrics?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.1 states, "We consider developing an LLM serving system that adapts to accuracy requirements as future work," and Section 9 calls this an area for extensibility.
- Why unresolved: The paper omits accuracy because the community has yet to define a suitable metric, leaving a gap in balancing quality against latency and cost.
- What evidence would resolve it: A system implementation that profiles and optimizes for a defined accuracy proxy (e.g., perplexity) alongside standard metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the fingerprint-based profiling technique be generalized to models with non-decoder-only architectures, such as multimodal models?
- Basis in paper: Section 9 notes, "To accommodate models that deviate from this structure (e.g., LLaVA)... We leave this investigation to future work."
- Why unresolved: Current fingerprints rely on the repetitive hidden layers of decoder-only models; unique components like image layers require different profiling logic.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of the Fingerprint Controller that successfully estimates performance for models with distinct encoders or modalities.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can LLM serving systems effectively manage latency variations when deploying across heterogeneous GPU types?
- Basis in paper: Section 9 states, "Deploying LLMs across heterogeneous devices introduces new challenges... We leave this investigation to future work."
- Why unresolved: The current placement policy treats hardware as an opaque box or assumes homogeneous clusters, failing to account for latency variance across different GPU stages.
- What evidence would resolve it: A placement algorithm that accounts for specific device capabilities and inter-stage latency variance in mixed-gpu clusters.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Is it possible to accurately extrapolate physical metrics, such as energy efficiency or carbon reduction, from lightweight LLM fingerprints?
- Basis in paper: Section 9 mentions that for broader intents like energy efficiency, "further work is needed to accurately extrapolate these from the fingerprint to the full LLM."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if power consumption and carbon footprint scale linearly with the architectural components captured by the fingerprint.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validation demonstrating that fingerprint-derived power estimates correlate strongly with full-model power measurements.

## Limitations
- Fingerprinting assumptions may break for non-standard LLM architectures with unique components
- Load-aware placement policy effectiveness not validated in heterogeneous GPU environments
- Evaluation lacks stress testing under extreme load conditions and with newer model architectures

## Confidence
High confidence in core technical contributions: The fingerprint-based profiling approach and intent-driven configuration selection are well-defined and supported by systematic evaluation.
Medium confidence in generalization claims: While the evaluation covers multiple configurations and models, the extent to which these results translate to production environments requires further validation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct stress testing with varying request patterns and model sizes to verify SLO violation claims under realistic production conditions.
2. Evaluate iServe's performance in heterogeneous GPU environments to assess the load-aware placement policy's effectiveness across different hardware configurations.
3. Perform cross-model validation with newer LLM architectures to determine if the fingerprinting approach maintains accuracy and efficiency with evolving model designs.
