# Multi-objective Hyperparameter Optimization in the Age of Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.08371
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08371
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: PriMO is the first HPO algorithm integrating multi-objective user beliefs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with up to 10x speedups

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating expert prior knowledge into multi-objective deep learning hyperparameter optimization. The authors introduce PriMO, a novel Bayesian optimization framework that integrates multi-objective user beliefs while leveraging cheap approximations for improved efficiency. PriMO satisfies key desiderata including utilization of cheap approximations, integration of expert priors, strong anytime performance, and strong final performance. Through extensive experiments on 8 deep learning benchmarks, PriMO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both multi-objective and single-objective settings, offering significant speedups while maintaining robustness even when priors are misleading.

## Method Summary
PriMO employs a Bayesian optimization approach with a prior-augmented acquisition function that incorporates expert beliefs into the optimization process. The method leverages cheap proxy approximations during initial design to accelerate the search process. The framework is designed to balance exploration and exploitation while respecting the multi-objective nature of the optimization problem. The algorithm integrates user beliefs through a carefully designed prior distribution that guides the search without dominating it, allowing the system to recover from potentially misleading priors through continued exploration.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8 DL benchmarks in both multi-objective and single-objective settings
- Provides up to 10x speedups compared to existing methods through effective use of cheap approximations
- Demonstrates robust performance across different prior conditions, including successful recovery from misleading priors
- Outperforms existing methods in anytime performance while maintaining strong final optimization results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of PriMO stems from its principled integration of expert knowledge with Bayesian optimization techniques. By augmenting the acquisition function with prior beliefs, the algorithm can intelligently guide the search process while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of Bayesian optimization. The use of cheap proxy approximations during initial design phases allows for rapid exploration of the search space without sacrificing the quality of final solutions. The framework's ability to recover from misleading priors demonstrates the robustness of the underlying Bayesian framework, which naturally balances prior information with observed evidence.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Probabilistic optimization framework that builds a surrogate model to guide search; needed for handling expensive black-box functions efficiently; quick check: verify acquisition function balances exploration/exploitation
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting objectives; needed because DL models typically have multiple performance metrics; quick check: confirm Pareto front quality through hypervolume metrics
- **Acquisition Functions**: Strategy for selecting next evaluation points in Bayesian optimization; needed to balance exploration and exploitation; quick check: validate acquisition function selects diverse, promising configurations
- **Prior Integration**: Incorporating expert knowledge into optimization algorithms; needed to leverage domain expertise and improve search efficiency; quick check: test sensitivity to prior quality and magnitude
- **Proxy Approximations**: Using computationally cheap approximations to expensive objectives; needed for faster initial exploration; quick check: measure correlation between proxy and true objectives

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: PriMO -> Prior-augmented Acquisition -> Bayesian Optimization -> Cheap Proxies -> Expert Priors

**Critical Path**: PriMO algorithm initialization → cheap proxy evaluations → Bayesian surrogate model update → prior-augmented acquisition function optimization → configuration selection → objective evaluation → model refinement

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades some computational overhead from Bayesian optimization against improved search efficiency through expert knowledge integration. The use of cheap proxies accelerates initial exploration but requires careful correlation validation with true objectives.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate: inadequate prior specification, weak correlation between proxies and true objectives, acquisition function misalignment with problem characteristics, or insufficient exploration of the search space.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test PriMO on a simple synthetic multi-objective problem with known Pareto front 2) Evaluate sensitivity to prior quality using controlled prior misinformation 3) Compare anytime performance against baseline methods on a standard DL benchmark

## Limitations
- Potential sensitivity to the quality and specification of expert priors
- Computational overhead from Bayesian optimization framework may be significant for very large-scale problems
- Need for more extensive validation across diverse deep learning architectures and domains
- Limited detailed timing analysis for computational efficiency claims

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical framework and experimental design are sound
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability across different DL architectures and domains
- **Low confidence**: Computational efficiency claims without detailed timing analysis

## Next Checks
1. Test PriMO on additional deep learning benchmarks with different architectures (e.g., transformers, graph neural networks) to validate generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (prior integration, proxy usage, acquisition function) to overall performance
3. Perform runtime analysis comparing PriMO's computational overhead against baseline methods across different problem scales
