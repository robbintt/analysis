# MGA: Memory-Driven GUI Agent for Observation-Centric Interaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24168
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24168
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 54.6% grounding accuracy on OSWorld, outperforming GTA1's 48.6%

## Executive Summary
MGA introduces a memory-driven GUI agent that reframes interaction as "observe first, then decide," decoupling decisions from historical trajectories through structured observation and abstracted memory. Each step is modeled as an independent state comprising the current screenshot, task-agnostic spatial-semantic information, and a dynamically updated memory summary. This design reduces error propagation and local exploration bias by grounding actions in complete interface understanding and maintaining de-biased temporal continuity. Evaluated on OSWorld and real desktop applications, MGA demonstrates improved robustness and generalization in GUI automation tasks.

## Method Summary
The core innovation lies in treating each interaction step as an independent state decision rather than a trajectory continuation. MGA employs a structured observation module that extracts both spatial layout and semantic information from GUI screenshots, then combines this with an abstracted memory summary that captures essential task-relevant information without historical noise. This memory is dynamically updated at each step, providing context while preventing error accumulation. The agent then makes decisions based on this complete, current state representation rather than relying on past action sequences. This approach fundamentally changes how GUI agents process information, moving from sequential decision-making to a more holistic, observation-first paradigm.

## Key Results
- Achieves 54.6% grounding accuracy overall, outperforming GTA1's 48.6%
- Shows larger performance gains in long-horizon tasks compared to baseline approaches
- Ablation studies confirm both structured observation and abstract memory contribute to improved performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The key mechanism is the decoupling of observation from action decisions. Traditional GUI agents make decisions based on action histories, which can lead to error propagation and local exploration bias. MGA's approach treats each interaction as an independent state decision, grounding actions in complete interface understanding. The memory abstraction captures essential task-relevant information while filtering out historical noise, allowing the agent to maintain context without being burdened by past errors. This observation-centric approach ensures that each action is based on current, comprehensive information rather than potentially flawed historical trajectories.

## Foundational Learning

**Structured GUI Observation**
- Why needed: Traditional visual processing may miss spatial-semantic relationships crucial for GUI interaction
- Quick check: Verify the agent can identify button locations and their semantic purposes (e.g., "submit" vs "cancel")

**Memory Abstraction**
- Why needed: Raw historical data can introduce noise and propagate errors through sequential decisions
- Quick check: Confirm the memory summary captures task-relevant information while discarding irrelevant historical details

**Independent State Modeling**
- Why needed: Treating each step as dependent on past actions creates error accumulation and exploration bias
- Quick check: Test if the agent can recover from incorrect actions without compounding errors

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Screenshot/Observation -> Structured Extraction -> Memory Abstraction -> State Representation -> Action Decision

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from GUI screenshot through structured observation (extracting spatial and semantic features) to memory abstraction (creating a dynamic context summary) to state representation (combining current observation with memory) to action decision. Each component must function correctly for successful interaction.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The observation-first approach introduces latency between observation and action but gains robustness through complete interface understanding. The memory abstraction reduces noise but may occasionally discard useful historical information. The independent state modeling prevents error propagation but requires more computational resources per decision compared to trajectory-based approaches.

**Failure Signatures**
- If structured observation fails: Agent may misidentify GUI elements or their spatial relationships
- If memory abstraction fails: Agent may lose context or accumulate irrelevant information
- If state representation fails: Agent may make decisions based on incomplete or noisy information

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Test basic element identification on static GUI screenshots to validate structured observation
2. Evaluate memory abstraction on simple sequential tasks to confirm context retention
3. Assess independent state decision-making on short tasks with known optimal paths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance generalizability beyond evaluated benchmarks remains uncertain
- Memory abstraction may struggle with rapidly changing interface layouts
- Continuous interaction scenarios without discrete observation pauses are not thoroughly validated

## Confidence

**High Confidence**
- Architectural design principles are technically sound
- Reported grounding accuracy improvements are based on measurable metrics

**Medium Confidence**
- Claims about error propagation reduction are supported but need broader testing
- Robustness improvements in long-horizon tasks require more extensive validation

**Low Confidence**
- Generalization to diverse real-world GUI environments is speculative
- Scalability to complex interfaces with high interaction density remains unproven

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Application Generalization**: Evaluate MGA on diverse commercial and open-source GUI applications not included in training or benchmark datasets to assess real-world applicability.

2. **Long-Horizon Task Robustness**: Conduct extended trials on tasks requiring sustained interaction over prolonged periods to validate robustness against error accumulation and memory degradation.

3. **Dynamic Interface Handling**: Test MGA's performance on interfaces with rapidly changing layouts or content to determine the effectiveness of memory abstraction in maintaining accuracy under dynamic conditions.
