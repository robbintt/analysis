# CR3G: Causal Reasoning for Patient-Centric Explanations in Radiology Report Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11830
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11830
- Authors: Satyam Kumar
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: CR3G outperforms Claude-3.5 on Pneumothorax and Pleural Effusion causal relationship ratings (4.4-4.33 vs 4.25-3.75)

## Executive Summary
CR3G is a framework that enhances radiology report generation by incorporating causal reasoning and patient-centric explanations. The approach uses causal inference to analyze chest X-rays, moving beyond pattern recognition to understand cause-and-effect relationships between findings and diagnoses. Tested on the IUX-CXR dataset with 500 images annotated for causal relationships, reasoning, and patient-centric explanations, CR3G demonstrated improved performance for specific abnormalities compared to Claude-3.5.

## Method Summary
CR3G combines CLIP for image encoding, LLaVA-Med fine-tuned on MIMIC-CXR for initial report generation, and GPT-4 decoder with structured prompt templates to produce findings, causal relationships, reasoning, and patient-centric explanations. The framework was trained on IUX-CXR data with specific hyperparameters (batch sizes 64/96, learning rates 0.01/0.05) using NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Evaluation used CR and PCE ratings on 100 samples per abnormality against Claude-3.5 baseline.

## Key Results
- CR3G achieved higher causal relationship ratings for Pneumothorax (4.4 vs 4.25) and Pleural Effusion (4.33 vs 3.75) compared to Claude-3.5
- Patient-centric explanation ratings ranged from 3.33 to 4.17 across 5 abnormalities
- The framework correctly identified cause-and-effect relationships for 2 out of 5 tested abnormalities
- Performance varied significantly by abnormality type, with Cardiomegaly and Atelectasis showing weaker results (CR ~3.0-3.1)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prompt-driven extraction of causal relationships from radiology findings may improve diagnostic interpretability.
- Mechanism: The framework uses structured prompts to identify {cause} → {effect} pairs from extracted findings, then generates natural language reasoning to explain the physiological pathway connecting them.
- Core assumption: LLMs fine-tuned on medical data can approximate causal chains rather than merely associative patterns when explicitly prompted.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Causal inference is a powerful approach that goes beyond identifying patterns to uncover why certain findings in an X-ray relate to a specific diagnosis."
  - [section 4] "When analyzing causal relationships in chest X-rays (CXR), it is crucial to focus on true cause-and-effect connections that demonstrate how one finding directly leads to another."
- Break condition: If the model outputs associative relationships (e.g., "PICC lines present → Suggesting ongoing medical treatment") or reverses causation, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Patient-centric explanations simplify technical radiology language, potentially improving comprehension for non-experts.
- Mechanism: After generating causal relationships and reasoning, a secondary prompt condenses findings into layman-accessible language, replacing jargon with analogies and actionable context.
- Core assumption: Simplification preserves diagnostic accuracy while reducing cognitive load for patients.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CR3G generates causal relationships between findings, provides reasoning for these relationships, and creates simplified explanations for non-experts."
  - [section 3.2] "The patient-centric explanation simplifies complex medical findings into relatable terms."
- Break condition: If PCE ratings fall below 3 (indicating excessive jargon or poor clarity), the simplification mechanism is not functioning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning a vision-language model on domain-specific data enables multi-stage report generation with structured outputs.
- Mechanism: CLIP encodes the X-ray image; LLaVA-Med (fine-tuned on MIMIC-CXR) generates the initial radiology report; GPT-4 decoder produces structured outputs via prompt templates.
- Core assumption: The visual encoder captures diagnostically relevant features, and the LLM can reason over extracted findings to generate coherent explanations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "CR3G is built over the Large Language and Vision Assistant for BioMedicine (LLaVA-Med)... CLIP encoder and GPT-4 decoder is used in CR3G."
- Break condition: If the visual encoder fails to detect key abnormalities, downstream causal reasoning will be compromised.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Causal inference vs. correlation**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly distinguishes between associative patterns and true causation. Understanding Pearl's causal frameworks helps evaluate whether model outputs represent valid mechanisms.
  - Quick check question: Given the relationship "pleural effusion → mediastinal shift," is this direct causation, indirect causation, or association?

- Concept: **Prompt engineering for structured outputs**
  - Why needed here: CR3G relies on specific prompt templates to extract findings, generate causal chains, and produce patient-centric explanations. Poorly designed prompts yield associative or invalid relationships.
  - Quick check question: What prompt format would minimize the risk of generating "ground-glass opacities → inflammatory process" (reversed causation)?

- Concept: **Vision-language model fine-tuning**
  - Why needed here: The architecture builds on LLaVA-Med fine-tuned on MIMIC-CXR. Understanding how domain-specific fine-tuning affects feature extraction and report quality is essential for replication.
  - Quick check question: If fine-tuning data lacks diversity in disease presentations, how might this bias causal reasoning outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Chest X-ray image -> CLIP encoder -> LLaVA-Med (MIMIC-CXR fine-tuned) -> GPT-4 decoder with prompts -> Findings -> Causal relationships -> Reasoning -> Patient-centric explanation

- Critical path:
  1. Image encoding (CLIP) must capture abnormality-relevant features
  2. Findings extraction via regex must correctly parse radiology report text
  3. Prompt-driven causal reasoning must generate valid {cause} → {effect} pairs
  4. PCE generation must simplify without losing diagnostic fidelity

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Coverage vs. precision: Better CR/PCE for only 2/5 abnormalities (Pneumothorax, Pleural Effusion)
  - Complexity vs. interpretability: More detailed causal chains may improve accuracy but risk confusing non-expert readers
  - Static vs. dynamic modeling: Current approach uses static images; temporal dynamics are not captured

- Failure signatures:
  - Associative outputs: Relationships like "PICC lines → ongoing treatment" indicate failure to distinguish causation from association
  - Reversed causation: "Ground-glass opacities → inflammatory process" (should be inflammation → opacities)
  - Cycles in causal graphs: Figure 5 shows cyclic relationships, indicating logical inconsistency
  - Expert disagreement: Radiologists can create indirect causal relationships that the model struggles to generate

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison on IUX-CXR subset: Replicate the 500-image evaluation, computing CR and PCE ratings for all 5 abnormalities against Claude-3.5
  2. Ablation on prompt templates: Test alternative prompt formulations to reduce associative/reversed-causation errors
  3. Cross-dataset validation: Evaluate on NIH-CXR14 or PadChest to assess generalization across demographics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Generalization to diverse demographics**: The authors explicitly state future work should extend to other chest X-ray datasets from different demographics, such as NIH-CXR14 and PadChest, as current evaluation is restricted to IUX-CXR and may not capture geographic variations in disease prevalence.

- **Counterfactual explanations**: The paper lists "explore counterfactual explanations with more robust causal relationships and causal reasoning frameworks" as a specific direction for future work, as the current framework focuses on direct cause-and-effect relationships without validating through counterfactual reasoning.

- **Distinguishing causation from association**: In the Results and Analysis section, the authors note that CR3G often generates "non-causal relationships," such as treating clinical associations or risk assessments as direct causation, and occasionally reverses pathophysiology.

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation scope: Performance claims based on 5 abnormalities on a single dataset (IUX-CXR) without formal validation of causal chains
- Reliance on prompt engineering: Framework may not generalize beyond specified conditions and requires extensive manual annotation
- Clinical validity concerns: Generated explanations lack rigorous validation in real-world diagnostic workflows and may contain associative rather than truly causal relationships

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Technical architecture (CLIP + LLaVA-Med + GPT-4) is well-specified and follows established multimodal LLM approaches
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance claims for Pneumothorax and Pleural Effusion are supported by reported ratings, though sample size and annotation process introduce uncertainty
- **Low Confidence**: Assertion that CR3G "understands cause-and-effect relationships" lacks rigorous causal validation; many generated relationships appear associative rather than truly causal

## Next Checks

1. **Causal Chain Validation**: Conduct expert review of 50 randomly selected causal relationships to classify them as direct causation, indirect causation, association, or invalid. Compute precision and recall against ground truth causal chains.

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Evaluate CR3G on NIH-CXR14 and PadChest to assess performance across different demographics, disease presentations, and imaging protocols. Compare CR/PCE scores with the IUX-CXR baseline.

3. **Temporal Dynamics Assessment**: Test whether CR3G can handle sequential X-ray data (e.g., multiple time points for the same patient) to capture disease progression and validate causal relationships over time.
