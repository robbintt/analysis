- This study proposes an end-to-end audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system for cochlear implant (CI) sound coding simulations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AVSE-ECS, an end-to-end system that integrates audio-visual speech enhancement with a differentiable cochlear implant coding strategy for improved speech perception in noise. The system uses cross-attention fusion between audio and visual modalities within a UNet architecture, combined with joint training of enhancement and coding components using dual losses. Experiments show significant improvements in objective speech intelligibility metrics (STOI, ESTOI) and signal-to-error ratio (SER) compared to audio-only approaches, with a 7.4666 dB SER improvement over traditional ACE strategy.

## Method Summary
The AVSE-ECS system combines an audio-visual speech enhancement module with a deep neural network-based coding strategy (ECS) that simulates the ACE cochlear implant strategy. The visual encoder (frozen TCN+ResNet-18) extracts mouth movement features from video, which replace audio keys and values in cross-attention blocks of the NCSN++ UNet architecture. The ECS model uses 4 dense layers with a differentiable top-k layer to select 8 channels from 22 possible. Joint training optimizes both spectrogram-level reconstruction and electrodogram-level coding through a combined loss function.

## Key Results
- AVSE-ECS achieves 7.4666 dB improvement in SER over traditional ACE strategy
- Objective speech intelligibility improves with STOI reaching 0.6305 (vs 0.6141 for pre-trained)
- Joint training with dual losses (spectrogram + electrodogram) outperforms pre-trained models
- Cross-attention fusion of audio-visual information enables effective speech enhancement in noisy conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-attention fusion of audio and visual modalities improves speech enhancement in noisy conditions.
- Mechanism: Visual embeddings from a TCN-based visual encoder (processing lip movements) replace audio keys and values in the self-attention blocks of the UNet architecture. This allows the model to use temporal mouth movement patterns to guide audio feature reconstruction when acoustic cues are degraded by noise.
- Core assumption: Visual speech cues (lip movements) remain reliable when audio is corrupted, and these cues carry phonetically relevant information that can be aligned with audio features through attention.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "utilizing cross-attention blocks to integrate audio and visual information"
  - [section 2.5] "the self-attention blocks within the UNet architecture are modified by replacing the audio keys and values with visual embeddings"
  - [corpus] Related work (Real-Time System for Audio-Visual Target Speech Enhancement) confirms audio-visual speech enhancement is an active research direction, though corpus does not provide direct validation of cross-attention specifically for CI applications.
- Break condition: If visual input is occluded, low-resolution, or asynchronous with audio (>~100ms latency), cross-attention may introduce misalignment artifacts rather than improvements.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Joint training of the AVSE module and ECS coding strategy with dual losses produces better electrode stimulation patterns than independent pre-training.
- Mechanism: The total loss L_Total = α * L_Spec + β * L_Elec combines spectrogram-level reconstruction (enhanced vs. clean speech) with electrodogram-level refinement (enhanced vs. clean electrode patterns). This creates a gradient signal that encourages the AVSE module to produce outputs that are not just acoustically clean but also optimized for the specific CI coding transformation.
- Core assumption: The clean electrodogram (derived from ECS processing clean speech) represents an attainable and desirable target for the enhanced output; the L_Elec loss provides signal beyond what L_Spec alone offers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.6] "By narrowing the distance between the clean electrodogram and the enhanced electrodogram, the output electrode pattern in AVSE-ECS can be further refined"
  - [table 3] Joint training achieves STOI 0.6305 vs. pre-trained 0.6141, and SER improvement of 7.4666 dB vs. 3.7291 dB
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for dual-loss joint training in CI systems; this appears to be a novel contribution.
- Break condition: If β is set too high (over-weighting electrodogram loss at the expense of spectrogram fidelity), the model may produce electrode-optimized outputs that sacrifice perceptual speech quality. Table 2 suggests β=1.0 slightly underperforms β=0.5.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A differentiable DNN-based coding strategy (ECS) enables end-to-end gradient flow that traditional ACE processing cannot support.
- Mechanism: The ECS model replicates ACE's envelope detection and channel selection using 4 dense layers (1024→512→256→22 neurons) plus a differentiable top-k layer. This replaces the non-differentiable operations in ACE, allowing the AVSE module to receive gradients through the entire CI simulation pipeline.
- Core assumption: The DNN-based ECS sufficiently approximates ACE's functional behavior that optimizing for ECS outputs translates to improved ACE-equivalent stimulation patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "The ECS model replicates the core signal processing of ACE using a deep neural network (DNN) with a dedicated CS function"
  - [table 1] ECS on clean speech achieves STOI 0.7604, establishing baseline equivalence to ACE
  - [corpus] Weak corpus linkage; "Enhancing Cochlear Implant Signal Coding with Scaled Dot-Product Attention" mentions attention-based coding but does not validate ECS specifically.
- Break condition: If the ECS model poorly approximates ACE for certain input distributions (e.g., unusual noise types or speaker characteristics), end-to-end optimization may amplify this mismatch rather than improve real CI performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) and Extended STOI (ESTOI)**
  - Why needed here: These are the primary evaluation metrics. STOI measures time-frequency correlation between processed and clean speech (0–1 scale). ESTOI extends this for modulated noise maskers. Understanding what they capture helps interpret whether improvements reflect genuine intelligibility gains.
  - Quick check question: If a system improves SER by 5 dB but STOI remains unchanged, what does this suggest about the perceptual quality?

- Concept: **Electrodogram / Channel Selection in CIs**
  - Why needed here: The ECS model outputs 22-channel electrodograms and selects N_topk=8 channels. This mimics how real CIs stimulate a subset of electrodes to represent spectral content. Understanding this constraint is essential for interpreting the L_Elec loss.
  - Quick check question: Why might selecting only 8 of 22 channels be beneficial for CI users rather than using all channels?

- Concept: **Cross-Attention for Multimodal Fusion**
  - Why needed here: The core innovation is replacing self-attention keys/values with visual embeddings. You need to understand Q/K/V attention mechanics to debug or modify this fusion strategy.
  - Quick check question: In cross-attention, what happens if the visual encoder produces embeddings with a different temporal resolution than the audio features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Video mouth ROI -> TCN (3D Conv) -> ResNet-18 -> visual embeddings
  - Noisy audio STFT -> NCSN++ UNet with cross-attention -> enhanced STFT
  - Enhanced STFT -> ECS (Dense layers + top-k) -> electrodogram

- Critical path:
  1. Extract mouth ROI from video -> TCN+ResNet -> visual embeddings
  2. Noisy audio -> STFT -> NCSN++ with cross-attention (visual embeddings guide denoising) -> enhanced STFT
  3. Enhanced STFT -> ECS (dense layers + top-k) -> electrodogram
  4. During training: L_Spec (enhanced vs. clean STFT) + L_Elec (enhanced vs. clean electrodogram)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Freezing visual encoder reduces training cost but prevents visual feature adaptation to CI-specific tasks.
  - Freezing ECS during joint training preserves pre-trained coding behavior but limits co-adaptation between enhancement and coding.
  - Setting timestep=1 in NCSN++ avoids iterative denoising (faster inference) but may sacrifice quality compared to full diffusion sampling.

- Failure signatures:
  - STOI improves but SER degrades: Model may be introducing distortions masked by correlation metrics.
  - Large gap between pre-trained and joint training: L_Elec weight (β) may need tuning; check if electrodogram loss is saturating.
  - No improvement over ASE-ECS: Visual input may be misaligned, low-quality, or the visual encoder is not providing useful features for this noise/speaker distribution.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce baseline comparison**: Run ACE, ECS, ASE-ECS, and AVSE-ECS (pre-trained) on the TMSV test set. Verify STOI/ESTOI/NCM/SER values match Table 3 within tolerance.
  2. **Ablate visual input**: Replace visual embeddings with zeros or random noise in AVSE-ECS. Confirm performance drops to ASE-ECS levels, validating that cross-attention is using visual information.
  3. **Sweep β values**: Test β ∈ {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0} on a validation split. Plot STOI vs. β to verify optimal region around 0.5 and check for task-specific sensitivity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the AVSE-ECS system perform in subjective listening tests with actual cochlear implant users compared to objective simulation metrics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 4.4 that "subjective listening tests are planned for the proposed AVSE-ECS method with both normal-hearing participants using CI simulations and actual CI users."
- Why unresolved: The current study relies entirely on objective metrics (STOI, ESTOI, NCM, SER), which serve as proxies but do not fully capture the perceptual experience or speech recognition performance of human users.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from human trials measuring word/sentence recognition scores and subjective quality ratings from CI users utilizing the processed signals.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed system be optimized to meet the latency requirements for real-time deployment on cochlear implant hardware or edge devices?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4 acknowledges that "Latency is challenging for real-time deployment" and notes plans to "reduce the model's computational load through techniques such as pruning and knowledge distillation."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation is executed on a personal computer and relies on the computationally heavy NCSN++ model, making it currently unsuitable for wearable CI processors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a modified AVSE-ECS model running on edge hardware (e.g., smartphones or smart glasses) with algorithmic latency below 10-20 ms.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the visual encoder pre-trained on English lip-reading data (LRW) generalize to the Mandarin speech data (TMSV) used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 2.3 specifies the visual encoder is pre-trained on the English LRW dataset, while the experiments utilize Mandarin speech; [explicit] Section 4.4 calls for further studies to ensure "cross-language... generalizability."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if a visual encoder trained on English visemes optimally extracts relevant phonetic cues for Mandarin enhancement, potentially limiting the efficacy of the audio-visual fusion.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing AVSE-ECS performance using visual encoders pre-trained on Mandarin datasets versus the current English-based encoder.

## Limitations

- Training protocol opacity: Key hyperparameters including learning rates, batch sizes, optimizer settings, and training duration are not specified.
- Cross-attention implementation ambiguity: Dimensional compatibility between audio features and visual embeddings is not explicitly verified.
- Differentiability uncertainty: The implementation details of the differentiable top-k layer in ECS are not specified, which is critical for end-to-end optimization.
- Dataset specificity: Results are limited to TMSV Mandarin dataset with specific noise conditions and speaker demographics.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The ECS model architecture and its role in enabling differentiable gradient flow. The dual-loss formulation (L_Spec + L_Elec) and its reported impact on SER improvement (7.4666 dB vs. 3.7291 dB) are well-documented.
- **Medium Confidence**: The cross-attention mechanism's effectiveness. While the implementation is described, the visual encoder is frozen, limiting adaptation to CI-specific features. The improvement could be sensitive to visual quality and alignment.
- **Medium Confidence**: The joint training improvements over pre-trained AVSE-ECS. The optimal β=0.5 is identified, but the sensitivity to this hyperparameter and the robustness across different noise types are not extensively explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce baseline comparison**: Implement and run ACE, ECS, ASE-ECS, and AVSE-ECS (pre-trained) on the TMSV test set. Verify that STOI, ESTOI, NCM, and SER values match those reported in Table 3 within a 1-2% tolerance to ensure the baseline implementations are correct.

2. **Ablate visual input**: Modify the AVSE-ECS model to replace visual embeddings with zeros or random noise during inference. Confirm that performance drops to ASE-ECS levels (STOI ~0.6141, SER ~3.7291 dB). This validates that the cross-attention mechanism is genuinely utilizing visual information rather than learning spurious correlations.

3. **Sweep β values**: Implement a hyperparameter sweep for β ∈ {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0} on a held-out validation split of the TMSV dataset. Plot STOI and SER against β to verify the optimal region around 0.5 and identify any task-specific sensitivity or degradation at extreme values (e.g., β=1.0).
