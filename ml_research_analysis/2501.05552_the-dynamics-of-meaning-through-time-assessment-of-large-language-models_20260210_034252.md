core_contribution: This study evaluates large language models' ability to capture
  temporal semantic shifts in language, specifically their understanding of how word
  meanings evolve across decades. Using tailored prompts, six prominent models (ChatGPT,
  GPT-4, Claude, Bard, Gemini, and Llama variants) were tested on terms like "Data
  Mining" and "Michael Jackson" from the 1920s to 2020s, with performance measured
  through human expert evaluations of factuality and comprehensiveness.

# The dynamics of meaning through time: Assessment of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.05552
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05552
- **Reference count**: 6
- **Primary result**: GPT-4 and Claude Instant 100k achieved highest scores in temporal semantic understanding evaluation

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates large language models' ability to capture temporal semantic shifts in language, specifically their understanding of how word meanings evolve across decades. Using tailored prompts, six prominent models (ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude, Bard, Gemini, and Llama variants) were tested on terms like "Data Mining" and "Michael Jackson" from the 1920s to 2020s, with performance measured through human expert evaluations of factuality and comprehensiveness. Results show GPT-4 and Claude Instant 100k consistently achieved the highest scores (22/22 for factuality and 21-22 for comprehensiveness), while the code-based Llama 34B outperformed larger Llama models, highlighting the importance of specialized training data over model size. General-purpose models like Google Bard and smaller Llama variants performed poorly, underscoring limitations in temporal semantic understanding.

## Method Summary
The study employed a comparative evaluation framework using tailored prompts to assess LLMs' understanding of temporal semantic shifts across six decades (1920s-2020s). Six prominent models were tested on specific terms, with human expert evaluations measuring factuality and comprehensiveness of responses. The evaluation process involved systematic scoring of model outputs against established criteria for temporal understanding, with particular attention to how meanings evolved across different time periods.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 and Claude Instant 100k achieved perfect scores (22/22) for factuality and near-perfect scores (21-22) for comprehensiveness
- Llama 34B code model outperformed larger Llama variants, demonstrating the importance of specialized training data over model size
- Google Bard and smaller Llama variants showed poor performance in temporal semantic understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that temporal semantic understanding in LLMs depends critically on the diversity and specificity of training data rather than model size alone. Models with broader, more heterogeneous training datasets that include historical texts and domain-specific corpora show superior performance in capturing semantic evolution across time periods. The mechanism appears to involve both the breadth of temporal coverage in training data and the architectural capacity to maintain context across extended time spans.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal context modeling**: Understanding how word meanings shift across decades is essential for historical analysis and digital humanities applications
  - *Quick check*: Can the model accurately track semantic changes for words with well-documented historical evolution
- **Domain-specific training data**: Specialized datasets improve temporal understanding more than model scaling
  - *Quick check*: Does model performance correlate with historical text coverage in training data
- **Cross-modal learning**: Integration of text and code training data enhances temporal semantic reasoning
  - *Quick check*: Do code-trained models show better temporal understanding than text-only models
- **Prompt engineering for temporal tasks**: Carefully crafted prompts are crucial for eliciting temporal semantic understanding
  - *Quick check*: Does prompt specificity affect model performance on temporal tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Input prompt -> Context window -> Temporal reasoning module -> Output generation
**Critical path**: Prompt processing → Semantic analysis → Temporal mapping → Response generation
**Design tradeoffs**: Model size vs. training data specialization; general knowledge vs. temporal specificity
**Failure signatures**: Generic responses lacking temporal specificity; conflation of meanings across time periods
**First experiments**: 1) Test model on single decade vs. multi-decade prompts 2) Compare performance on domain-specific vs. general terms 3) Evaluate impact of prompt temporal framing on response quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content

## Limitations
- Human evaluation introduces potential subjectivity in assessing temporal semantic understanding
- Limited sample size of six models tested may not capture full spectrum of capabilities
- Focus on specific terms and time range (1920s-2020s) represents narrow temporal and vocabulary coverage
- Does not address cultural or linguistic biases in temporal understanding across different languages

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Comparative performance rankings between models appear robust, particularly the consistent outperformance of GPT-4 and Claude Instant 100k across both metrics. The finding that Llama 34B outperformed larger Llama models is supported by the data and represents a meaningful insight about the importance of specialized training data over model size.

**Medium confidence**: The implications for digital humanities and historical linguistics applications, while logical, require further validation in real-world deployment scenarios. The relationship between training data composition and temporal understanding, while suggested by the results, could benefit from more granular analysis of specific training dataset characteristics.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-cultural validation by testing models on temporal semantic shifts in non-English languages and non-Western historical contexts to assess cultural bias in temporal understanding
2. Perform ablation studies on the Llama models to identify which specific training data components most strongly correlate with improved temporal semantic understanding
3. Implement automated evaluation metrics alongside human judgment to assess the consistency and potential bias in the evaluation process itself
