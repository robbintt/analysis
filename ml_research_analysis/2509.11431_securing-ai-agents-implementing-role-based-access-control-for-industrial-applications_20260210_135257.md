# Securing AI Agents: Implementing Role-Based Access Control for Industrial Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.11431
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11431
- Reference count: 2
- Key outcome: Role-Based Access Control with two-step authentication reduced unauthorized access by 98% and decreased prompt injection success from 73% to 3% in industrial AI agent applications

## Executive Summary
This study addresses critical security vulnerabilities in AI agents deployed in industrial settings, particularly focusing on prompt injection attacks and unauthorized access. The research proposes a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) framework that combines two-step authentication with granular permission controls. The framework was implemented using FastAPI and PostgreSQL, with role definitions for Admin, User, and Client. Experiments demonstrated significant security improvements while maintaining acceptable performance overhead in operational environments.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a two-step authentication process requiring both traditional credentials and secondary verification codes, combined with an RBAC engine that validates user permissions against role-based policies stored in PostgreSQL. The system uses JWT tokens for stateless authentication and intercepts all requests before they reach the AI agent, ensuring that only authorized users can execute specific actions. The implementation was tested with simulated workloads of 200 user sessions, including 50 malicious attempts, across open-source LLMs deployed via Flowise.

## Key Results
- Unauthorized access block rate: 98% reduction with two-step authentication
- Prompt injection success rate: Decreased from 73% to 3% with RBAC enforcement
- Performance overhead: Latency increased from 32ms to 55ms; throughput decreased from 1240 to 1100 req/s

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Two-step verification drastically reduces unauthorized access by invalidating stolen static credentials
- **Mechanism:** Authentication module requires secondary verification code after initial username/password check, creating temporal barrier even if attacker possesses valid credentials
- **Core assumption:** Attackers lack access to user's secondary authentication device
- **Evidence anchors:** 98% unauthorized access reduction; two-step mechanism implementation; identity management literature supporting robust identity checks
- **Break condition:** Secondary factor compromise or 2FA implementation flaws allowing bypass

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pre-processing requests through RBAC engine limits attack surface by restricting specific actions to authorized roles
- **Mechanism:** Access control layer intercepts requests, queries RBAC engine to verify role permissions before AI agent processing
- **Core assumption:** Malicious outcomes require high-privilege actions differing from standard user queries
- **Evidence anchors:** 73% to 3% prompt injection reduction; granular access controls enforcement; securing AI agent execution literature
- **Break condition:** Prompt injection achieving goals using only standard read/query permissions granted to low-privilege roles

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Centralized PostgreSQL role-permission mappings with JWT validation enables scalable, real-time policy enforcement
- **Mechanism:** User roles fetched from database, encoded into JWT; subsequent requests carry token; RBAC engine decodes token for instant permission validation
- **Core assumption:** JWT signature remains secure and unforgeable; token expiration logic correctly enforced
- **Evidence anchors:** Algorithm step 2 token decoding and validation; FastAPI-PostgreSQL implementation; JWT-based OAuth 2.0 usage
- **Break condition:** Real-time policy updates required; revoked permissions remain valid until JWT expires

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: OAuth 2.0 & JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
  - **Why needed here:** Framework relies on stateless authentication; understanding claim packing and validation essential for debugging access denials
  - **Quick check question:** If user role changes in PostgreSQL, why might they still have Admin access until current JWT expires?

- **Concept: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Matrix**
  - **Why needed here:** Security depends on correctly defining User-Role-Permission relationships; constraint ∑xᵢᵣ = 1 (one user, one active role context)
  - **Quick check question:** In this framework, does "Client" role have permission to modify AI agent configurations?

- **Concept: Prompt Injection**
  - **Why needed here:** Primary threat vector; understanding that prompt injection attempts to override system instructions to evaluate RBAC defense
  - **Quick check question:** How does restricting "modify configuration" permission mitigate prompt injection attack asking agent to "delete all logs"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** API Gateway (FastAPI) -> Auth Module (2FA + JWT) -> RBAC Engine (Role-Permission mapping) -> AI Agent (LLM/Flowise) -> Audit Logger
- **Critical path:** User Login → 2FA Validation → JWT Generation → Request with JWT → RBAC Validation → AI Agent Execution
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Security vs. Latency: 2FA and RBAC checks increase latency (32ms → 55ms) and reduce throughput (1240 → 1100 req/s)
  - Token Validity vs. Revocation: Stateless JWTs improve speed but make instant permission revocation difficult
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Latency (>60ms): Database bottlenecks or inefficient JWT validation logic
  - 401 Unauthorized (Valid Creds): 2FA service timeout or sync issues
  - 403 Forbidden (Valid Role): Role-Permission mapping misconfigured for requested action
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Latency Profile: Measure req/s and latency with "No Access Control" vs. "RBAC + 2FA"
  2. Injection Simulation: Attempt known prompt injection string as "Client" user to verify RBAC layer blocks request
  3. Token Expiry Test: Revoke user's Admin role in DB and observe if they can still perform Admin actions using previously issued valid JWT

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can machine learning and real-time contextual data be leveraged to dynamically adjust authentication requirements within the RBAC framework?
  - **Basis in paper:** Authors state future iterations could leverage usage patterns to detect anomalous access and reduce false positives
  - **Why unresolved:** Current implementation relies on static two-step verification without contextual data for dynamic policy adjustment
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Prototype demonstrating adaptive authentication model modifying access rigidity based on user behavior risk profiles

- **Open Question 2:** Can the proposed mathematical optimization model be expanded to effectively incorporate stochastic elements, such as uncertain threat levels?
  - **Basis in paper:** Paper notes future work could expand objective function by incorporating stochastic elements and real-time data
  - **Why unresolved:** Current mathematical formulation assumes fixed risk parameter and does not account for fluctuating threat landscapes
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Simulations showing updated objective function maintains optimal security-cost balance under variable threat conditions

- **Open Question 3:** What specific privacy-preserving techniques are required to integrate biometric verification into industrial AI agents without violating data protection regulations?
  - **Basis in paper:** Authors highlight biometrics raise privacy concerns requiring focused integration of privacy-preserving techniques
  - **Why unresolved:** Study focuses on OAuth 2.0/JWT and does not test or implement biometric modalities or regulatory compliance
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Modified framework architecture securing biometric templates and satisfying industrial data protection standards

## Limitations

- Limited threat model scope: Focuses on prompt injection and unauthorized access but does not address data poisoning, model extraction, or supply chain attacks
- Implementation assumptions: Assumes perfect two-step authentication and JWT validation; real-world vulnerabilities could compromise reported 98% protection rate
- Performance measurement context: Metrics measured under simulated conditions may vary in industrial environments with higher concurrency or resource constraints

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Fundamental security mechanism of RBAC with two-step authentication is well-established; reported 98% unauthorized access reduction aligns with known security principles; mathematical framework and architectural components clearly specified

**Medium Confidence:** Implementation details sufficient for reproduction though exact database schemas and attack vectors require assumptions; performance metrics appear reasonable but may vary in different industrial contexts

**Low Confidence:** Long-term effectiveness against evolving prompt injection techniques and sophisticated attacks is uncertain; paper does not address adaptive attacks or framework vulnerabilities

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world deployment stress test:** Deploy framework in industrial pilot with 1000+ concurrent users; measure actual latency, throughput, and security effectiveness under realistic network conditions and workloads

2. **Advanced attack simulation:** Test framework against sophisticated prompt injection techniques including multi-turn attacks, context manipulation, and indirect bypass attempts through data analysis requests

3. **RBAC system security audit:** Conduct penetration testing specifically targeting authentication module, JWT implementation, and role-permission assignment logic to identify potential vulnerabilities compromising entire security framework
