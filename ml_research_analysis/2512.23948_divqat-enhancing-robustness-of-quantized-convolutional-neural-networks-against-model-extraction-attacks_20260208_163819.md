# DivQAT: Enhancing Robustness of Quantized Convolutional Neural Networks against Model Extraction Attacks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23948
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23948
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DivQAT improves model extraction attack resistance by 2-8% without significant accuracy loss

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of quantized convolutional neural networks to model extraction attacks, where adversaries replicate model functionality by querying prediction probabilities. The proposed DivQAT method enhances robustness by integrating a divergence-based loss term into Quantization Aware Training (QAT). Specifically, DivQAT maximizes the KL-divergence between prediction probabilities of original and quantized models while minimizing cross-entropy loss, thereby deviating quantized model probabilities from the original distribution. Experiments on benchmark vision datasets demonstrate significant improvements against state-of-the-art extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy.

## Method Summary
DivQAT modifies the standard QAT loss function by adding a divergence term that maximizes KL-divergence between the quantized model and original model predictions. The training procedure involves first training a full-precision model, then creating a quantized clone that is trained using the modified loss: L = L_CE(y, f_WQ(x)) - α·D_KL(f_WQ(x)||f_WL(x)). This forces the quantized model to maintain classification accuracy while producing probability distributions that differ from the original model, making extraction attacks more difficult. The method is evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and GTSRB using ResNet-18 architectures.

## Key Results
- DivQAT achieves adversary classification error increases of 2.51-7.99% over QAT baselines when combined with post-hoc defenses
- Defender accuracy remains within 3.66% of QAT baseline on CIFAR-10 while significantly improving robustness
- The method shows consistent improvements across multiple attack types (KnockoffNets, DFME, MAZE) and datasets
- ℓ₁ distance between clean and perturbed predictions remains below 0.6, satisfying transparency constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1 - Divergence-based Probability Poisoning
Maximizing KL-divergence during QAT creates quantized models with perturbed probability outputs that degrade extraction attack effectiveness without significant accuracy loss. The modified loss function simultaneously maintains task performance through cross-entropy minimization while forcing the quantized model to produce probability distributions that differ from the original model. This inherent deviation acts as built-in noise that corrupts the attacker's training data. Break condition: If attackers use hard-label-only extraction (no probability access), the mechanism becomes ineffective.

### Mechanism 2 - Inverted Knowledge Transfer for Generalized Decision Boundaries
By inverting the standard knowledge distillation paradigm (maximize rather than minimize KL-divergence), the quantized model learns a decision boundary that generalizes adequately but resists replication. Traditional distillation minimizes both CE and KL to transfer knowledge closely. DivQAT maximizes KL while minimizing CE, forcing the quantized model to learn correct classifications through different internal representations and boundary placements. Break condition: If the task requires the quantized model to closely match the original model's confidence scores, the divergence objective conflicts with functional requirements.

### Mechanism 3 - Defense Synergy Through Pre-Diverged Distributions
DivQAT provides a foundational perturbation layer that amplifies the effectiveness of post-training defenses when combined. Standard defenses (RS, DCP) inject perturbations into clean probability distributions. DivQAT models start with already-divergent distributions, so the same perturbation budget achieves greater adversarial disruption with less added noise per defense layer. Break condition: If deployment constraints limit inference-time computation, adding post-hoc defenses may exceed latency budgets.

## Foundational Learning

- **Quantization Aware Training (QAT) vs. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)**: Understanding why QAT enables divergence loss modification (vs. PTQ which is inference-only) is essential for implementation. Quick check: Can you explain why PTQ cannot incorporate a divergence loss term during quantization?

- **KL-Divergence directionality (asymmetry)**: The paper maximizes D_KL(f_WQ || f_WL), not the reverse; understanding asymmetry is critical for correct implementation. Quick check: If you swapped the arguments in the KL-divergence, would the mechanism still work as intended? Why or why not?

- **Model extraction attack taxonomy**: The paper evaluates KnockoffNets (dataset-based), DFME, and MAZE (generative); understanding why generative attacks are more severely impacted explains mechanism sensitivity. Quick check: Why would a generative attack (DFME/MAZE) be more sensitive to probability perturbation than a dataset-based attack (KnockoffNets)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Original Model (f_WL) -> Quantized Model (f_WQ) -> Loss Computation (L_CE + D_KL) -> Quantization Config -> Optional Post-hoc Layer (RS/DCP)

- **Critical path**: 1) Train full-precision model with standard cross-entropy 2) Clone and initialize quantization simulation 3) Per batch: (a) forward pass through both models, (b) compute L_CE and D_KL, (c) combine with α, (d) backpropagate to quantized model only 4) Validate; tune α for accuracy-robustness balance 5) Export; optionally configure post-hoc defense

- **Design tradeoffs**: α selection (higher α → stronger defense but larger accuracy drop); config variant ('mobile' vs 'server'); defense combination (DivQAT alone vs. DivQAT+post-hoc); accuracy budget (CIFAR-10 shows +3.66% defender error)

- **Failure signatures**: Excessive accuracy drop (>5%) → α too high; low robustness against KnockoffNets → combine with post-hoc defenses; high ℓ₁ distance → violates transparency requirements; dataset-specific behavior (GTSRB differs from CIFAR)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline reproduction: Implement DivQAT on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, α=0.05; verify defender accuracy within 3-4% of QAT baseline and adversary error increases >2% against KnockoffNets 2) α sensitivity analysis: Train with α ∈ {0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.08, 0.10}; plot defender accuracy vs. adversary error 3) Defense combination test: Apply DCP (ℓ₁ budget 0.6) to best α model; compare adversary error against QAT+DCP baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How effective is DivQAT in defending quantized models in non-computer vision domains, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
- Can the DivQAT defense strategy be adapted to protect models against extraction attacks where the adversary only has access to hard labels (top-1 predictions)?
- How robust is DivQAT against adaptive adversaries who are aware of the defense and attempt to reverse the divergence perturbations?

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to classification tasks with specific architectures (ResNet-18) and datasets (CIFAR variants, SVHN, GTSRB)
- Effectiveness against adaptive attackers who can modify extraction strategies remains untested
- Trade-off between ℓ₁ distance constraint (≤0.6) and applications requiring calibrated probabilities not fully explored

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: DivQAT's mechanism of maximizing KL-divergence during QAT and basic implementation are clearly specified
- **Medium confidence**: Reported robustness improvements against evaluated attack methods are credible but some implementation details remain unspecified
- **Medium confidence**: Synergy claims with post-hoc defenses are supported by results but require verification across different threat models

## Next Checks
1. **Adaptive Attack Validation**: Implement an adaptive extraction attack that specifically accounts for DivQAT's divergence mechanism, using adversarial training or incorporating knowledge of the modified loss function

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Validate DivQAT's effectiveness on a significantly different dataset (e.g., ImageNet or medical imaging) to assess whether observed robustness patterns generalize

3. **Calibration Impact Assessment**: Quantify impact of DivQAT on probability calibration metrics and evaluate whether ℓ₁ distance constraint (≤0.6) is sufficient for applications requiring calibrated uncertainty estimates
