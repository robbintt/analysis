# On Representational Dissociation of Language and Arithmetic in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.11932
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11932
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Simple arithmetic and general language are encoded in completely separated regions in LLM internal representations across all layers, with classification accuracy reaching 100%.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether language and arithmetic reasoning are represented in separate regions within large language models (LLMs), inspired by neuroscientific evidence of dissociation between linguistic and non-linguistic processing in the human brain. The authors analyze the geometry of LLM internal representations using linear classifiers and cluster separability tests. They find that simple arithmetic equations and general language input are encoded in completely separated regions across all layers, with classification accuracy reaching 100%. This separation holds even for controlled stimuli like spelled-out equations, suggesting a specific arithmetic region rather than mere numerical encoding. However, more complex tasks requiring both language and arithmetic (like math word problems) form distinct clusters that don't overlap with either simple language or arithmetic regions, suggesting that LLMs don't treat these as composites of simpler operations but instead use different, task-specific representations. This indicates that arithmetic is handled in multiple specialized regions rather than a single universal arithmetic region, raising questions about the language-thought dissociation within LLMs.

## Method Summary
The study uses linear probing and cluster separability tests to analyze representational geometry in LLMs. Researchers extract last-token hidden representations from multiple layers and train linear SVMs to classify between language and arithmetic inputs. They also compute Generalized Discrimination Value (GDV) to quantify cluster separability. The controlled stimulus categories include LANG (multilingual texts), EQ (simple equations), EQSP (spelled-out equations), LANG NUM (numerical Q&A), LANG NUMEQ (arithmetic-embedded questions), and GSM8K (math word problems). The analysis examines whether different task types occupy linearly separable subspaces and whether complex tasks reuse simple task representations or form distinct clusters.

## Key Results
- Language and simple arithmetic equations are encoded in completely separable regions across all layers (classification accuracy reaching 100%, negative GDV values).
- Complex tasks requiring both language and arithmetic (math word problems) form distinct clusters that don't overlap with either simple language or arithmetic regions.
- The arithmetic region identified for simple equations shows perfect generalization to spelled-out equations, but complex tasks don't reuse this region.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Language and arithmetic inputs occupy linearly separable subspaces from layer 1 onward.
- Mechanism: The model maps inputs into distinct high-dimensional regions based on task type (language vs. arithmetic), enabling a linear hyperplane to perfectly separate them. This separation persists across all layers, suggesting early and sustained routing.
- Core assumption: Linear separability of representations indicates functionally distinct processing regions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "simple arithmetic equations and general language input are encoded in completely separated regions in LLMs' internal representation space across all the layers"
  - [section 3.1]: "classification accuracy achieved 100% at all the layers except for the embedding layer"
  - [corpus]: Related work on knowledge neurons and representational subspaces supports modular encoding in transformers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Complex tasks requiring both language and arithmetic (e.g., math word problems) do not compose by reusing simple language/arithmetic regions.
- Mechanism: Instead of routing through simple language and arithmetic clusters sequentially, complex tasks form their own third cluster. The language–arithmetic classifier trained on simple stimuli always predicts these inputs as "language," and GDV shows they are equidistant from both simple clusters.
- Core assumption: Cluster separation and classifier predictions indicate that representations are not compositional in the expected pipeline manner.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "more complex tasks requiring both language and arithmetic (like math word problems) form distinct clusters that don't overlap with either simple language or arithmetic regions"
  - [section 4]: "the models do not treat these more complex problems as a composite of language and arithmetic problems"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus support—limited prior work on compositional routing in LLMs; more research needed.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Arithmetic is encoded in multiple specialized regions rather than a single universal region.
- Mechanism: Different arithmetic task formats (e.g., equations vs. word problems) activate different subspaces. The arithmetic region identified with simple equations is not reused for math word problems, suggesting format-specific specialization.
- Core assumption: Distinct clusters for different arithmetic formats imply functionally separate processing pathways.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "arithmetic is handled in multiple specialized regions rather than a single universal arithmetic region"
  - [section 4]: "arithmetic in a particular task format A... is addressed in a different region with that in a task format B"
  - [corpus]: Related work on arithmetic validation gaps (arXiv:2502.11771) hints at task-specific processing, but direct evidence is limited.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear probing (linear classifiers on internal representations)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses linear SVMs to test if language and arithmetic are separably encoded.
  - Quick check question: Can a linear hyperplane perfectly separate two sets of representations in a given layer?

- Concept: Cluster separability (GDV)
  - Why needed here: GDV quantifies how distant clusters are beyond just classification accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What does a GDV of -1 or lower indicate about two clusters?

- Concept: Representational dissociation (neuroscience and LLMs)
  - Why needed here: The paper draws analogy to brain imaging evidence for language vs. non-linguistic reasoning.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for two cognitive functions to be "dissociated" in terms of brain/activation patterns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LLM layers → last-token representations → linear SVM classifier → GDV distance metric → layer-wise analysis of separability. Controlled stimulus categories (LANG, LANG-NUM, EQ, EQSP, LANG-NUM-EQ, GSM8K) provide comparisons.
- Critical path: (1) Extract last-token representations per layer for each stimulus type; (2) Train/test linear SVM on language vs. arithmetic pairs; (3) Compute GDV for all relevant pairs; (4) Visualize with PCA for sanity checks.
- Design tradeoffs: Using last-token representations captures end-of-sequence context but may miss token-level dynamics. Linear probes test linear separability but may underestimate non-linear structure. GDV is scale-invariant but does not capture causal importance.
- Failure signatures: Classification accuracy near chance (~50%); GDV near or above 0 (overlapping clusters); complex-task representations lying inside simple language or arithmetic clusters.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the language vs. simple-equation classification across layers; confirm 100% accuracy and negative GDV.
  2. Add held-out arithmetic formats (e.g., division-only, larger numbers) to test generalization of the arithmetic cluster.
  3. Apply the trained language–arithmetic classifier to GSM8K and LANG-NUM-EQ to verify they are predicted as "language" and form distinct clusters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the observed representational dissociation between language and arithmetic be verified through causal intervention rather than observational probing?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that "whether our observation is aligned with LLM’s actual abilities/behaviors should be tested via causal analysis," specifically suggesting interventions that selectively impair linguistic or reasoning abilities.
- Why unresolved: Linear classifiers and cluster separability tests only demonstrate that regions are geometrically distinct, not that they are functionally independent or responsible for specific model outputs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful identification of specific network components where ablation selectively degrades arithmetic reasoning while preserving fluency, or vice-versa.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Are there multiple, specialized arithmetic regions for different task formats rather than a single universal arithmetic module?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] The paper notes in Section 4 that complex tasks like math word problems form distinct clusters from simple arithmetic, suggesting "arithmetic in a particular task format A is addressed in a different region with that in a task format B."
- Why unresolved: The experiments show that complex tasks neither overlap with simple arithmetic regions nor composite regions, implying fine-grained modularity that current experiments did not fully map.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive mapping of representations across a wider variety of arithmetic and reasoning tasks to identify if specialized regions scale linearly with task complexity or format.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the acquisition of reasoning skills depend on the pre-existence of language skills during training?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] The Limitations section asks, "does achieving good reasoning skills pre-require good language skills?" and suggests this requires different experimental designs than those used in the paper.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on analyzing the internal states of already pre-trained models, providing no insight into the developmental trajectory or learning dependencies between these skills.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training experiments where language learning scenarios are ablated or modified to observe the causal impact on the emergence of arithmetic reasoning capabilities.

## Limitations
- The study's primary limitation is its exclusive focus on linear separability, which may underestimate non-linear representational relationships between language and arithmetic processing.
- The finding that complex tasks form distinct clusters rather than compositional combinations relies heavily on classifier predictions and GDV metrics without direct intervention experiments to establish causal relationships.
- The arithmetic cluster identified for simple equations shows perfect generalization to spelled-out equations, but the paper does not explore whether this generalizes to more complex arithmetic operations or larger numerical ranges.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Language and simple arithmetic equations are represented in completely separable regions across all layers (classification accuracy reaching 100%, negative GDV values).
- **Medium confidence**: Complex tasks requiring both language and arithmetic form distinct clusters that don't overlap with either simple language or arithmetic regions. While the classifier predictions and GDV metrics support this, the claim about non-compositionality would benefit from intervention experiments.
- **Low confidence**: Arithmetic is handled in multiple specialized regions rather than a single universal arithmetic region. This conclusion extrapolates from limited evidence about different task formats forming distinct clusters, but lacks direct causal validation.

## Next Checks
1. **Intervention validation**: Ablate the simple-equation arithmetic region and measure performance degradation on both simple equations and math word problems to establish whether arithmetic processing truly uses multiple specialized regions.

2. **Non-linear separability analysis**: Apply non-linear dimensionality reduction (t-SNE, UMAP) and clustering validation metrics to the same representation spaces to determine if non-linear structure reveals additional representational relationships not captured by linear classifiers.

3. **Generalization stress test**: Extend the arithmetic cluster analysis to include division, exponentiation, and larger numerical ranges to determine whether the arithmetic region identified for simple equations generalizes to more complex mathematical operations.
