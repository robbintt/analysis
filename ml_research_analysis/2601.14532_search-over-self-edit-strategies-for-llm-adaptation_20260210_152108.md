# Search over Self-Edit Strategies for LLM Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14532
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14532
- Authors: Alistair Cheong; Haolin Cong; Tyler Yang; Dustin Miao
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Archive variant peaked at 45.1% QA accuracy vs. 50.3% for best human-designed baseline

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models can discover effective self-edit strategies through task feedback, comparing two variants: one without memory and another with a lightweight archive of past templates. Using Qwen3-8B on SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation task with SQuAD, the archive variant briefly approached but did not surpass the strongest human-designed "Rewrite" baseline (45.1% vs. 50.3% validation accuracy). Both variants suffered rapid exploration collapse, with the archive providing short-term robustness but accelerating homogenization. The work reveals that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently improve upon optimized human strategies.

## Method Summary
The method involves generating self-edit templates that specify how to transform passages into synthetic training data and LoRA hyperparameters. The model proposes M=5 templates per iteration, completes them to generate training sequences, applies self-edits via LoRA fine-tuning, and evaluates QA accuracy. Top-performing (template, completion) pairs are selected for SFT training of the proposer. Two variants are tested: No Archive (weights-only) and With Archive (conditioning on top/bottom 2 past templates). The process iterates for 5 rounds, with the archive variant showing initial collapse followed by recovery, then eventual homogenization.

## Key Results
- Archive variant peaked at 45.1% QA accuracy vs. 50.3% for strongest human-designed "Rewrite" baseline
- Both variants showed rapid exploration collapse with intra-iteration text similarity rising above 0.92
- Archive provided short-term robustness but accelerated homogenization once stable
- Degradation observed in "Rewrite" and archive variants correlated with decreasing synthetic data length

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can learn to propose higher-yield self-edit templates through task feedback, but their effectiveness depends critically on whether exploration diversity is maintained.
- Mechanism: The model generates templates specifying (a) how to transform passages into synthetic training data and (b) hyperparameters for LoRA fine-tuning. Each self-edit is evaluated by cloning the model, applying the edit, and measuring downstream QA accuracy. The proposer is trained via SFT on high-performing pairs, shifting probability mass toward strategies that improved task performance.
- Core assumption: The fixed update operator (self-supervised NTP with LoRA) is sufficiently expressive that better training data/hyperparameters translate to better adaptation.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] archive variant outperformed 'Implications' and briefly approached 'Rewrite' baseline (45.1% vs. 50.3%); [Section 3.2.3] SFT on constructed dataset with causal language modeling loss.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A lightweight archive of past templates provides short-term robustness by enabling error correction, but without explicit novelty pressure, it accelerates homogenization rather than sustained improvement.
- Mechanism: The archive stores top-2 and bottom-2 templates with their metrics. The model can avoid failures by analyzing low-performers, build on successes, and correct unstable proposals (e.g., too-high learning rates) because failures replace archive entries and change the conditioning context.
- Core assumption: The model can generalize from exemplars to propose meaningfully different strategies rather than simply imitating top entries.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] rapid collapse of exploration in both variants, with archive providing short-term robustness but also accelerating homogenization; [Section 5.1] rebound after iteration 0 when worst entries were replaced.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Repeated self-training on self-generated data causes performance degradation when templates implicitly encourage data compression that loses task-relevant signal.
- Mechanism: Under repeated ReSTEM updates, selection pressure favors templates that produce shorter, "safer" outputs. For "Rewrite"-style templates, longer paraphrases increase opportunities for factual substitutions, harming precision. The model learns to generate compressed data that reduces training loss but degrades downstream QA accuracy.
- Core assumption: Degradation is template-dependent, not inevitable—templates that add propositions without paraphrasing can increase recall without precision penalties.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 5.3] data length decreases over iterations for degrading methods while 'Implications' shows increasing length and remains stable.

## Foundational Learning

- **ReSTEM (Reinforcement Self-Training)**: Used here as an approximation where top-k performers are selected and SFT is applied instead of optimizing a non-differentiable reward directly. Why needed: Understanding this is essential for diagnosing why mode collapse occurs. Quick check: Why does ReSTEM concentrate probability mass more aggressively than policy gradient RL?

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Self-edits are applied via LoRA fine-tuning. The template includes hyperparameters (rank, alpha, learning rate, epochs) that directly affect adaptation quality. Why needed: Poor hyperparameter choices (e.g., lr=5e-3) caused initial collapse in the archive variant. Quick check: How does LoRA rank affect the capacity for knowledge incorporation vs. catastrophic forgetting?

- **Open-ended search (novelty vs. learnability)**: The paper frames self-edit discovery as a search problem where progress requires both novelty (exploring new strategies) and learnability (building on past successes). Why needed: The archive is a rudimentary mechanism for the latter but lacks explicit novelty pressure. Quick check: What would a quality-diversity archive (e.g., MAP-Elites) change about the homogenization dynamics observed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: CreateSelfEditTemplates -> CompleteSelfEditTemplates -> ApplySelfEdits -> BuildSFTDataset -> TrainModel -> UpdateArchive (archive variant)
- **Critical path**: Template quality → completion quality → synthetic data informativeness → LoRA adaptation effectiveness → QA accuracy → selection for SFT → next-iteration template distribution
- **Design tradeoffs**: k=2 vs k=1 (higher k exposes more diversity but may cause overfitting); include vs exclude original passage in D (including stabilizes but confounds improvement source); archive size (small archive is tractable but provides limited exploration signal)
- **Failure signatures**: Mode collapse (intra-iteration text similarity >0.92, hyperparameter similarity >0.98); initial collapse with recovery (archive variant iteration 0 accuracy ~4-18% due to unstable hyperparameters); post-peak decline (archive variant peaks at iteration 2 then declines); template-level degradation (synthetic data length decreases over iterations)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce baselines with passage concatenation disabled to establish fair comparison; 2) No-archive variant with diversity metrics to track intra-iteration similarity; 3) Archive variant with learning rate constraints to avoid initial collapse

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can quality-diversity algorithms (e.g., MAP-Elites) replace naive archiving to prevent the homogenization of self-edit templates?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.4 states that "explicit injection of novelty pressure is required to mitigate mode collapse" and suggests using "quality-diversity techniques like MAP-Elites" for future archive implementations.
- Why unresolved: The authors found their naive archive accelerated homogenization because it anchored generation on high-performing exemplars without maintaining behavioral diversity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using a MAP-Elites archive showing sustained template diversity and validation accuracy that does not decline after initial peaks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does replacing the ReSTEM update with reinforcement learning prevent the rapid collapse of exploration?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 5.4, the authors note that while "RL would softly shift probability mass," ReSTEM forces the model to imitate a "tiny set of winners," suppressing exploration.
- Why unresolved: The current SFT-based update strategy concentrated probability mass aggressively, leading to mode collapse.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified training loop using a policy gradient algorithm (like PPO) that maintains a flatter distribution over templates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does increasing model scale allow for the discovery of self-edit strategies that surpass carefully optimized human baselines?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.4 posits that the task couples meta-level strategy design with instance-level data creation, which "may exceed the capacity of an 8B model."
- Why unresolved: The 8B model (Qwen3) failed to surpass the "Rewrite" baseline and suffered from rapid convergence to suboptimal strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the search process with a significantly larger model (e.g., 70B+ parameters) to observe if the model invents qualitatively distinct strategies.

## Limitations

- Narrow experimental scope—only one base model (Qwen3-8B) and one knowledge incorporation task (SEAL Single-Passage)
- Rapid homogenization across both variants raises questions about scalability to more complex tasks or larger models
- Exact SFT hyperparameters for proposer training remain unspecified, which could significantly impact search dynamics
- 50/200 passage splits are not publicly documented, making exact replication difficult

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Archive provides short-term robustness by enabling error correction; degradation mechanism via data compression is well-supported
- **Medium confidence**: Archive accelerates homogenization without explicit novelty pressure; explicit novelty pressure may be required for consistent improvement
- **Low confidence**: Mode collapse is primarily due to ReSTEM's winner-takes-all sampling rather than other factors

## Next Checks

1. Test explicit novelty pressure: Implement MAP-Elites or diversity regularization in proposer training to see if it prevents homogenization while maintaining archive's short-term robustness benefits
2. Cross-task generalization: Apply self-edit search framework to a different adaptation task to verify if degradation via compression is universal or task-specific
3. Proposer SFT ablation: Systematically vary proposer SFT hyperparameters to determine their impact on exploration-exploitation balance and mode collapse dynamics
