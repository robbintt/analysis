# Generative AI Pipeline for Interactive Prompt-driven 2D-to-3D Vascular Reconstruction for Fontan Geometries from Contrast-Enhanced X-Ray Fluoroscopy Imaging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13372
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13372
- Reference count: 38
- This study presents an AI pipeline using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini to convert 2D fluoroscopic angiograms into 3D vascular models for Fontan circulation analysis.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces an AI-driven pipeline that converts single-view 2D fluoroscopic angiograms into 3D vascular models suitable for CFD analysis of Fontan circulation. The 16-step iterative process employs Gemini 2.5 Flash for image enhancement and Hunyuan3D-2mini for 3D reconstruction, generating anatomically faithful representations in under 15 minutes. The pipeline enables rapid virtual flow visualization identifying stagnation zones and flow patterns, democratizing advanced hemodynamic analysis using routine clinical imaging data.

## Method Summary
The pipeline transforms contrast-enhanced X-ray fluoroscopic angiograms through a 16-step iterative process using Gemini 2.5 Flash API for systematic enhancement of vascular boundaries, artifact removal, and geometric optimization. After achieving anatomically faithful 2D projections through iterative refinement, the optimized images are processed through Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) to generate 3D STL files. The system includes a custom web-based interface enabling clinical oversight, step-by-step navigation, and iterative prompt-driven refinement. Virtual flow visualization is generated using Gemini 2.5 Flash to identify hemodynamic features before final 3D mesh creation.

## Key Results
- Successfully generated anatomically faithful 3D vascular models of Fontan circulation from single-view angiograms after iterative refinement cycles
- Complete processing pipeline achieved in under 15 minutes, including 16 iterative enhancement steps and 3D reconstruction
- Virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries, though qualitative rather than quantitative

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Iterative prompt-driven refinement reduces hallucinated vascular features in 2D angiogram projections through progressive geometric optimization.
- Mechanism: A 16-step processing sequence applies Gemini 2.5 Flash's transformer-based vision capabilities to systematically enhance vascular boundaries, remove artifacts, and optimize contrast within the 2D projection framework. Each iteration acts as a quality control checkpoint, allowing human oversight to identify and correct AI-generated anatomical errors.
- Core assumption: Multiple refinement cycles are necessary and sufficient to achieve anatomical fidelity; the underlying model has sufficient medical image understanding to converge on accurate representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative prompt-driven regeneration cycles via the developed interface to achieve anatomically faithful representations."
  - [Section 2.4] "Gemini 2.5 Flash systematically enhances vascular boundaries, eliminates hallucinated features, and optimizes geometric proportions within the 2D projection framework."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support for this specific iterative hallucination-reduction mechanism in vascular applications.
- Break condition: If hallucinations persist beyond 16 iterations or if model lacks domain-specific vascular priors, convergence fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Diffusion transformer architecture can reconstruct plausible 3D vascular geometry from a single optimized 2D projection view.
- Mechanism: Hunyuan3D-2mini's encoder-decoder networks with attention mechanisms extract depth relationships, vascular connectivity, and geometric proportions from the 2D input. The model applies learned anatomical priors from medical imaging datasets to generate volumetric meshes with physiologically plausible geometry.
- Core assumption: The optimized 2D projection contains sufficient geometric information for 3D inference; the model's training distribution includes sufficient vascular anatomy examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation."
  - [Section 3.2] "The neural reconstruction process leverages advanced computer vision techniques to interpret depth relationships, vascular connectivity, and geometric proportions from the optimized 2D projection view."
  - [corpus] Related work on 4D Flow MRI super-resolution (arxiv:2508.14950) demonstrates GAN-based reconstruction challenges in vascular imaging, suggesting domain-specific limitations.
- Break condition: If input 2D view lacks critical geometric information (e.g., vessel overlap, occluded regions), 3D reconstruction will be incomplete or inaccurate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Large language models can generate clinically relevant virtual flow visualizations by interpreting geometric flow paths without formal CFD computation.
- Mechanism: Gemini 2.5 Flash applies learned fluid dynamics principles (mass conservation, velocity changes at constrictions/dilations) to generate velocity-coded streamline representations. Higher velocities are assigned to narrow regions, lower velocities to expanded areas, based on the model's understanding of hemodynamic behavior.
- Core assumption: The model's training includes sufficient physics understanding to approximate flow patterns; qualitative visualization provides clinical value without quantitative accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries."
  - [Section 3.4] "While this finding aligns with clinical expectations for Fontan circulation patterns...it represents the AI model's hemodynamic interpretation rather than validated CFD results."
  - [corpus] Graph deep learning for aneurysm flow simulation (arxiv:2512.09013) shows data-driven hemodynamic approximation is an active research area with known accuracy limitations.
- Break condition: Virtual flow visualization should not substitute for CFD when quantitative hemodynamic data is required for clinical decision-making.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer-based multimodal image processing
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Gemini 2.5 Flash processes and modifies medical images through prompt-driven iteration.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how attention mechanisms enable selective enhancement of vascular structures vs. background?

- Concept: Diffusion models for 3D reconstruction
  - Why needed here: Understanding Hunyuan3D-2mini's approach to inferring 3D geometry from 2D projections.
  - Quick check question: What geometric information is fundamentally lost when projecting 3D anatomy to 2D, and how might priors compensate?

- Concept: Fontan circulation hemodynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding the clinical context—why flow stagnation zones matter and what geometric features influence energy loss.
  - Quick check question: Why is the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) geometry critical for patient outcomes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Single-view contrast-enhanced fluoroscopic angiogram (DICOM or image format)
  - Stage 1: Gemini 2.5 Flash API (16 iterative steps) → enhanced 2D projections with artifact removal, contrast optimization, surface refinement
  - Stage 2: Virtual flow visualization (Gemini 2.5 Flash) → velocity-coded 2D streamlines
  - Stage 3: Hunyuan3D-2mini API → 3D mesh (STL format)
  - Output: STL file + flow visualization for CFD pipeline integration
  - Interface: Custom web browser UI with step navigation, progress tracking, edit history

- Critical path:
  1. Angiogram preprocessing and initial vascular segmentation
  2. Iterative refinement cycles (where hallucinations are identified/corrected)
  3. 2D projection quality optimization for 3D conversion readiness
  4. STL generation via Hunyuan3D-2mini
  5. Optional: Virtual flow visualization for rapid screening

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. accuracy: Fast API responses (<15 min total) require accepting iterative refinement rather than single-shot generation
  - Automation vs. oversight: Full automation risks undetected hallucinations; human-in-the-loop ensures anatomical fidelity but increases workflow time
  - Qualitative vs. quantitative: Virtual flow provides rapid insights but cannot replace formal CFD for clinical decisions

- Failure signatures:
  - Persistent hallucinated vessels after multiple iterations (model lacks domain priors)
  - Discontinuous or topologically incorrect 3D mesh (insufficient 2D projection quality)
  - Flow visualization contradicts expected hemodynamics (model physics understanding insufficient)
  - STL mesh insufficient for volume meshing (vertex density too low for boundary layer refinement)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the 16-step pipeline on the provided Fontan angiogram (Figure 1) to establish baseline iteration count and hallucination patterns.
  2. Test pipeline on angiograms from different projections (lateral vs. AP) to characterize view-dependency of 3D reconstruction accuracy.
  3. Compare virtual flow visualization against published CFD results for the same Fontan geometry to quantify approximation error bounds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can automated hallucination detection algorithms be developed to reduce the manual iteration burden in generative vascular reconstruction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4 states, "The development of automated hallucination detection algorithms could streamline the quality control process, while integration of quality control measures into the reconstruction pipeline could reduce manual oversight requirements."
- Why unresolved: The current pipeline relies on a 16-step iterative process requiring human-in-the-loop visual inspection to identify and correct hallucinated vascular features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of an automated quality metric that filters hallucinations without manual intervention, tested across multiple cases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the geometric accuracy of the generated 3D models compare to gold-standard imaging modalities across diverse patient anatomies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4 notes that "Broader validation across multiple cases, different geometric configurations, and various imaging conditions will be necessary to establish the general applicability and iteration requirements of the approach."
- Why unresolved: The study presents a comprehensive validation of only a single representative case of failing Fontan circulation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study quantifying geometric deviation between AI-generated STLs and matched CT/MRI volumes for a cohort of patients.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the AI-generated virtual flow visualizations quantitatively correlate with formal Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.4 states the visualization "should not be considered a substitute for rigorous computational fluid dynamics analysis" and that "formal CFD validation would be required for quantitative clinical decision-making."
- Why unresolved: The "virtual flow" is an interpretation of physics by a large language model (Gemini) rather than a numerical solution to fluid equations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison of velocity fields and stagnation zones between the AI-generated visualizations and Navier-Stokes-based CFD results on identical geometries.

## Limitations

- Pipeline performance depends heavily on iterative human oversight for hallucination correction, introducing workflow variability and potential inter-operator differences.
- Virtual flow visualization provides qualitative rather than quantitative hemodynamic insights, limiting clinical utility for precise therapeutic decisions.
- 3D reconstruction from single-view projections inherently loses depth information, potentially compromising geometric accuracy in regions with vessel overlap or complex branching.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The 16-step iterative pipeline architecture is technically feasible and the processing time claim (<15 minutes) is reasonable for the described API-based workflow.
- Gemini 2.5 Flash can perform image editing tasks like artifact removal and contrast enhancement as demonstrated in multimodal applications.
- Hunyuan3D-2mini can generate 3D meshes from 2D images as a general capability of diffusion transformer models.

**Medium Confidence:**
- The pipeline successfully generates anatomically faithful 3D vascular models for Fontan geometries after iterative refinement.
- Virtual flow visualization can identify stagnation zones and flow patterns consistent with expected Fontan hemodynamics.
- The approach democratizes CFD analysis by enabling geometry generation from routine angiographic data.

**Low Confidence:**
- The virtual flow visualization provides clinically actionable insights without formal CFD validation.
- The 3D reconstructions maintain sufficient geometric fidelity for accurate CFD simulation across diverse Fontan anatomies.
- The pipeline generalizes beyond the specific Fontan case presented without requiring extensive prompt engineering for each patient.

## Next Checks

1. **Quantitative Validation Against CFD Ground Truth**: Apply the pipeline to generate 3D geometries from angiograms of Fontan patients with published CFD studies, then compare key hemodynamic parameters (energy loss index, flow distribution) between the AI-generated virtual flow visualization and the validated CFD results.

2. **Multi-Projection Robustness Testing**: Process angiograms from different viewing angles (lateral, oblique, multiple projections if available) for the same patient to assess how projection-dependent information loss affects 3D reconstruction accuracy and whether multi-view input improves results.

3. **Inter-Operator Variability Assessment**: Have multiple clinicians independently run the 16-step pipeline on the same angiogram dataset, documenting iteration counts, hallucination correction patterns, and final STL quality to quantify the human-in-the-loop variability and establish standardized refinement protocols.
