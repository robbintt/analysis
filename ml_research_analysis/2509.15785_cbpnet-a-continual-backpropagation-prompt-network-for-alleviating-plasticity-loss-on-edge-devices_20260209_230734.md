core_contribution: This paper addresses plasticity loss in continual learning on edge
  devices, where the model's ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to a frozen
  backbone and limited prompt parameters. The authors propose CBPNet, a framework
  that integrates a Continual Backpropagation (CBP) mechanism with DualPrompt to adaptively
  reinitialize underutilized neurons.

# CBPNet: A Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network for Alleviating Plasticity Loss on Edge Devices

## Quick Facts

- Addresses plasticity loss in continual learning on edge devices using adaptive neuron reinitialization

## Executive Summary
CBPNet addresses plasticity loss in continual learning by integrating a Continual Backpropagation mechanism with DualPrompt. The framework monitors contribution utility of internal units and selectively reinitializes low-utility neurons to restore learning vitality without compromising prior knowledge. By training less than 0.2% of backbone parameters, CBPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance of 69.41% on Split ImageNet-R while maintaining high efficiency for resource-constrained edge devices.

## Method Summary
CBPNet combines DualPrompt with a novel Continual Backpropagation (CBP) mechanism. The method freezes a ViT backbone to preserve general visual knowledge while adding an Efficient CBP Block that monitors neuron utility through exponential moving averages of activation and weight magnitudes. When neurons mature (age > threshold) and exhibit low utility, they are probabilistically reinitialized by resampling input weights and zeroing output weights. This adaptive reinitialization restores the model's capacity to learn new tasks without significantly degrading stored knowledge, achieving plasticity through a small post-hoc bottleneck module rather than modifying the frozen backbone.

## Key Results
- Improves average accuracy by over 1% compared to DualPrompt on Split CIFAR-100
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance of 69.41% on Split ImageNet-R
- Maintains high efficiency by training less than 0.2% of backbone parameters
- Demonstrates stability with smaller performance drops in later tasks compared to DualPrompt

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adaptive Re-initialization of Stagnant Units
The framework tracks neuron "age" and "utility" to identify and recycle underutilized units. When a neuron matures and shows low utility, it's probabilistically reset, refreshing the optimization landscape for future tasks while preserving prior knowledge through zeroed output weights.

### Mechanism 2: Contribution Utility as a Proxy for Feature Importance
Utility is calculated using exponential moving average of activation magnitude combined with downstream weight magnitudes. This holistic evaluation identifies neurons that are functionally redundant or "dead" and can be safely recycled without harming the frozen backbone's features.

### Mechanism 3: Decoupled Plasticity via Post-Hoc Bottlenecking
A small, mutable CBP Block is placed after the frozen backbone, allowing aggressive modification without corrupting pretrained weights. This architectural isolation enables plasticity through the bottleneck while maintaining stability in the frozen backbone.

## Foundational Learning

- **Plasticity vs. Stability Trade-off:** Understanding that stability (retaining old knowledge) conflicts with plasticity (learning new knowledge) is crucial. CBPNet specifically targets plasticity loss in frozen backbone models.
  - Quick check: How does freezing the backbone improve stability but hurt plasticity?

- **Prompt Tuning (Prefix-Tuning):** DualPrompt injects learnable vectors into Transformer attention layers, with G-Prompts shared across tasks and E-Prompts task-specific. CBPNet adds CBP Block as a secondary adaptation mechanism.
  - Quick check: In DualPrompt, what is the difference between G-Prompts and E-Prompts in terms of task sharing?

- **Catastrophic Forgetting:** The frozen backbone strategy solves forgetting by preventing weight overwrites. CBPNet's zeroing of output weights during reinitialization minimizes interference with prior tasks.
  - Quick check: Why does zeroing the output weights of a re-initialized neuron minimize interference with prior tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** ViT Backbone -> DualPrompt (G-Prompts + E-Prompts) -> Efficient CBP Block -> Classification Head
- **Critical path:** Implement custom CBP Linear Layer that stores utility buffer and age counter, updates utility using EMA, and executes reinitialization logic after optimizer step for low-utility neurons.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Replacement rate (ρ) balances plasticity vs. instability; maturity threshold (m) must allow warming up; bottleneck size limits compensation capacity.
- **Failure signatures:** Accuracy collapse on early tasks indicates incorrect output weight zeroing; stagnant new task performance suggests utility threshold is too strict.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Sanity check: Run DualPrompt vs. CBPNet on Split CIFAR-100, verify ~1% gain and utility distribution changes. 2) Hyperparameter sensitivity: Vary replacement rate ρ (10⁻⁴ vs 10⁻⁵ vs 10⁻⁶). 3) Late-stage evaluation: Focus on Tasks 8-10 in Split ImageNet-R, comparing accuracy drop patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can the modular CBP mechanism be effectively adapted to non-vision domains like NLP? The current validation is restricted to vision benchmarks, and transferability to sequential, discrete textual data remains unverified.
- **Open Question 2:** Does integrating CBP with rehearsal-based strategies (memory buffers) yield superior stability-plasticity balance compared to the current rehearsal-free implementation? The interaction with gradient updates from replay buffers is unknown.
- **Open Question 3:** Is the Efficient CBP Block compatible with other prompt-based continual learning frameworks that utilize different prompt selection mechanisms? The utility metrics may depend on DualPrompt's specific feature distributions.

## Limitations
- Utility metric may not capture true feature importance for sparsely activated but critical neurons
- CBP Block's small size may limit capacity to compensate when backbone features are insufficient
- Re-initialization mechanism requires careful hyperparameter tuning with no clear optimal settings

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core architectural approach and utility monitoring mechanism are well-specified
- **Medium Confidence:** Performance improvements appear reasonable but exact hyperparameters are partially unspecified
- **Low Confidence:** Specific design choices for CBP Block dimensions, learning rates, and utility parameters lack complete specification

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on CBP Block Design:** Systematically vary bottleneck dimensions and utility update frequency to determine sensitivity and optimal design choices.
2. **Transferability Assessment:** Test CBPNet on broader continual learning scenarios with different backbones and task sequences to evaluate generalizability.
3. **Long-term Stability Analysis:** Extend evaluation beyond 10 tasks to assess effectiveness over very long task sequences and investigate accumulated utility metric errors.
