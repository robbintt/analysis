# Digital Overconsumption and Waste: A Closer Look at the Impacts of Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.18894
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18894
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Annual global energy consumption from generative AI estimated at 1.92-9.29 TWh, with 40% of users generating content solely for entertainment and 50% requiring over 50 iterations per idea

## Executive Summary
This work highlights the climate implications of widespread adoption of generative AI systems, estimating annual global energy consumption at 1.92-9.29 TWh - equivalent to the electricity consumption of entire nations like Mauritania and Kenya. The study reveals that a large portion of generated images are never viewed again after creation, with most users being casual rather than professional, generating content for non-utilitarian purposes. The authors identify digital waste as a critical sustainability challenge, where hidden environmental costs and lack of real-time feedback create a common-pool resource dilemma that drives overconsumption.

## Method Summary
The study combines survey-based user behavior analysis with energy consumption modeling to estimate the climate impact of generative AI systems. The methodology involves gathering public usage statistics from platforms like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, conducting surveys to understand user behavior patterns including iteration counts and use cases, and constructing energy models based on user counts, usage hours, and hardware assumptions. The energy calculation methodology references prior work that is currently "in press" with limited technical detail provided in this paper.

## Key Results
- Annual global energy consumption from generative AI: 1.92-9.29 TWh (range equivalent to Mauritania to Kenya's annual electricity consumption)
- 40% of users employ generative AI solely for entertainment purposes
- 50% of users require over 50 iterations to achieve satisfactory results
- Majority of generated images are never viewed again after initial creation
- User base consists primarily of casual users rather than professional creators

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Non-Utilitarian Generation Cascades into Digital Waste
Low-friction creation tools enable high iteration counts (>50 per idea) by casual users generating entertainment-focused content, resulting in accumulated energy consumption from abandoned outputs. Core assumption: Images "never looked at again" constitute waste based on value judgment about utility. Break condition: If iteration patterns shift toward purposeful generation or per-generation energy costs drop substantially.

### Mechanism 2: Information Asymmetry Creates Common-Pool Resource Dilemma
Hidden energy costs and lack of real-time feedback prevent users from calibrating consumption decisions, leading to individual overconsumption of shared infrastructure (compute, energy grid). Core assumption: Users would modify behavior if informed, though survey data shows skepticism about behavior change without education campaigns. Break condition: If systems expose per-action energy/carbon feedback or regulatory frameworks impose usage visibility requirements.

### Mechanism 3: Gratification-Driven Consumption Loop (HYPOTHESIZED, NOT VALIDATED)
Instant high-quality output with low skill barriers and escapism motivation may activate reward systems, driving prolonged engagement and elevated aggregate energy draw. Core assumption: Uses and gratification theory transfers from mass media to generative AI contexts, but explicitly stated as requiring future validation. Break condition: If empirical research fails to establish gratification-behavior correlation in GenAI contexts.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Digital Waste Definition
Why needed: Core claim rests on defining digital waste as encompassing emissions, resource extraction, and infrastructure costs of data creation and maintenance. Quick check: Can you distinguish between "data I don't need" and "digital waste" as defined in this framework?

### Concept: Uses and Gratification Theory
Why needed: Serves as hypothesized explanatory model for overconsumption; understanding it helps evaluate whether proposed mechanism is plausible. Quick check: What psychological needs might generative AI satisfy that traditional creative tools do not?

### Concept: Common-Pool Resource Dilemma
Why needed: Provides structural framing for why individual rational decisions (generate freely) lead to collective harm (aggregate energy/carbon impacts). Quick check: Why does invisible resource accounting make voluntary restraint unreliable at scale?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
User behavior -> Interface interaction -> Model inference -> Energy consumption -> Digital waste accumulation

### Critical Path
1. Baseline measurement: Instrument actual per-inference energy across hardware configurations
2. Utilization analysis: Track what fraction of generated outputs are accessed after creation
3. Intervention design: Build feedback loops exposing environmental costs at decision points
4. Technical optimization: Reduce inference energy via model architecture/hardware improvements

### Design Tradeoffs
- Accessibility vs. efficiency: Lowering creation barriers increases total generation volume
- Latency vs. energy: Faster inference may require more energy-intensive hardware configurations
- User autonomy vs. constraint: Iteration limits reduce waste but may degrade user experience

### Failure Signatures
- High iteration-to-satisfaction ratio (>50 iterations common)
- Low post-creation utilization ("most images never looked at again")
- User resistance to environmental information (survey showed skepticism about behavior change)

### First 3 Experiments
1. Energy instrumentation: Measure actual inference energy per image across GPU types, model sizes, and batch configurations
2. Utilization logging: Implement telemetry to track what percentage of generated outputs are accessed within 24h, 7d, 30d windows
3. Feedback intervention trial: A/B test real-time energy/carbon displays in generative AI interface; measure impact on iteration counts and user awareness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does uses and gratification theory apply to generative AI to explain non-utilitarian consumption? The authors explicitly state this requires future validation as they have not yet empirically validated the specific psychological drivers in this context.

### Open Question 2
How do generative AI systems interact with cognitive reward systems, particularly regarding escapism in immersive environments? The correlation between heightened escapism and ability to create "virtual sanctuaries" is currently hypothesized regarding future negative societal impacts.

### Open Question 3
What is the precise global energy consumption of generative AI systems given current lack of transparency regarding user numbers and hardware? The authors acknowledge their 1.92-9.29 TWh estimate is extremely broad due to unknown daily user numbers, hours of use, and hardware information.

## Limitations
- Energy consumption estimates carry significant uncertainty due to unknown hardware configurations and undisclosed calculation methodologies
- Survey-based behavioral analysis lacks transparency in sample size, recruitment methodology, and response rates
- Gratification theory hypothesis remains explicitly unvalidated and requires empirical testing

## Confidence
- Medium: Energy consumption estimates and digital waste characterization based on survey data
- Medium: Common-pool resource dilemma framework for explaining overconsumption
- Low: Gratification theory hypothesis (explicitly stated as requiring future validation)

## Next Checks
1. Instrument actual inference energy per generation across diverse hardware configurations to validate the 1.92-9.29 TWh estimate range
2. Deploy utilization tracking to measure what percentage of generated outputs receive any post-creation access within defined timeframes
3. Conduct controlled A/B testing of real-time environmental feedback displays in generative AI interfaces to measure behavioral impact
