# Knowledge-Integrated Representation Learning for Crypto Anomaly Detection under Extreme Label Scarcity; Relational Domain-Logic Integration with Retrieval-Grounded Context and Path-Level Explanations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.12839
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12839
- **Reference count**: 16
- **Primary result**: RDLI improves F1-score by 28.9% over GNN baselines under 0.01% label availability, while maintaining perfect recall.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Relational Domain-Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert-derived heuristics as differentiable, logic-aware signals within representation learning for crypto anomaly detection. The key innovation is the integration of expert knowledge graphs with retrieval-grounded contextual signals to detect complex, multi-hop illicit flows under extreme label scarcity. Experiments on real-world cryptocurrency data demonstrate that RDLI improves F1-score by 28.9% over GNN baselines under 0.01% label availability, while maintaining perfect recall. Expert user studies show significantly better trust, usefulness, and clarity compared to feature-based explanations, confirming its practical forensic value. The method generalizes to other financial domains and supports audit-ready interpretability aligned with FATF regulations.

## Method Summary
RDLI constructs an Expert Knowledge Graph from LLM-annotated transaction data using hierarchical typologies (anomaly_type→subtype_family→subtype→keywords). DeepWalk embeddings capture graph structure, while a Retrieval-Grounded Context (RGC) module dynamically incorporates real-time market and regulatory information via cosine similarity. The unified representation concatenates raw features, KG embeddings, and context embeddings, which is fed to downstream predictors (LightGBM, GRU, GraphSAGE). The framework is evaluated on real-world crypto transactions under extreme label scarcity (0.01% labels) with address-disjoint and temporal train-test splits.

## Key Results
- RDLI achieves 28.9% F1 improvement over GNN baselines under 0.01% label availability
- Maintains perfect recall while improving precision from 0.012 to 0.489 on LightGBM variant
- Expert user studies show significantly better trust, usefulness, and clarity compared to feature-based explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RDLI addresses the dual challenges of extreme label scarcity and need for interpretable explanations in crypto anomaly detection by integrating expert knowledge as differentiable signals. The knowledge graph captures multi-hop money laundering logic (e.g., layering, smurfing) that standard GNNs miss without sufficient labeled examples. The retrieval-grounded context dynamically adapts to real-time market conditions and regulatory changes, while the unified representation allows downstream models to leverage both structured knowledge and contextual signals. The path-level explanations satisfy FATF compliance requirements by showing the logical flow of detected anomalies.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Transaction Data**
  - Why needed here: Standard GNNs fail to capture complex, multi-hop logic of money laundering under label scarcity, motivating RDLI's knowledge-integrated approach
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a standard GNN message-passing over a transaction graph might miss a "fan-out/fan-in" layering scheme if it has very few labeled examples to learn from?

- **Knowledge Graph Embeddings**
  - Why needed here: RDLI converts structured Expert Knowledge Graph into dense vector embeddings to make symbolic knowledge consumable by neural networks
  - Quick check question: What is the primary goal of a graph embedding algorithm like DeepWalk, and what does it preserve about the graph's structure?

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Principles**
  - Why needed here: RDLI's RGC module enriches model input with dynamically retrieved, relevant information to adapt to real-time market conditions
  - Quick check question: In a RAG system, what are the two main stages, and what is the critical assumption about the retrieved documents?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Expert Knowledge Graph Construction → DeepWalk Embeddings → Retrieval-Grounded Context → Unified Representation (Concat(x_i, e_i, c_i)) → Downstream Predictor (LightGBM/GRU/GraphSAGE)
- **Critical path**: The Expert Knowledge Graph quality is the system's foundation; flawed KG leads to uninformative embeddings degrading both detection and explanations. RGC module quality is next critical—irrelevant context introduces misleading signals.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Interpretability vs. Complexity: Structured KG and RGC provide interpretability but add engineering complexity versus end-to-end neural models
  - Static vs. Dynamic Knowledge: Offline KG construction prevents leakage but may become stale; RGC adds dynamic element but depends on external news quality
  - Cost: LLM annotation, vector database maintenance, and retrieval latency add overhead to standard model training
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Stale Knowledge: New typologies not captured in KG cause detection performance drop
  - Context Noise: Polluted news corpus introduces noise, increasing false positives/negatives
  - Embedding Decoupling: Misaligned KG embeddings and raw features create ineffective unified representation
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablate KG component: Train predictor with raw features + KG embeddings without RGC to quantify KG contribution alone
  2. Ablate RGC module: Train with raw features + RGC context without KG embeddings to measure contextual grounding benefit
  3. Expert explanation validation: User study comparing RDLI path-level explanations vs SHAP feature attributions for trust and actionability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: Can RDLI maintain performance on episodic, star-graph transaction structures (e.g., traditional finance) where long-horizon dependencies are absent?
  - Basis: Discussion notes "topological mismatch" with lower gains on credit card data due to blockchain "flow networks" vs "shallow bipartite star graphs"
  - Why unresolved: Framework relies on multi-hop, logic-driven motifs inherently sparse in episodic data
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful application to datasets lacking sequential depth or modified aggregation for star-topologies

- **Open Question 2**: How does mapping unseen concepts to zero vectors impact detection of novel/evolved money laundering strategies?
  - Basis: Section 3.1 states "unseen concepts mapped to zero vectors" for test transactions not in train graph
  - Why unresolved: Creates "cold start" problem for emerging illicit typologies with absent logic paths
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on time-shifted test sets with emergent keywords/anomaly types not in training

- **Open Question 3**: What is sensitivity of Knowledge Graph's structural integrity to LLM annotation hallucinations or noise?
  - Basis: Method relies entirely on LLM-generated hierarchical labels but provides no error analysis for spurious relationships
  - Why unresolved: Noisy graph could propagate incorrect "logic-aware" signals, degrading precision of differentiable signals
  - What evidence would resolve it: Ablation study measuring performance degradation with synthetic noise in concept graph edges/attributes

## Limitations
- Strong empirical claims depend on proprietary data and LLM annotation pipelines not publicly available
- Effectiveness may vary significantly with different data distributions, annotation quality, and news corpus relevance
- Claims about generalization to other financial domains lack empirical validation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Architectural design combining KG embeddings with RGC is technically coherent and addresses real forensic compliance needs
- **Medium Confidence**: 28.9% F1 improvement claim is plausible but reproducibility limited by missing implementation details
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization claims to other domains and cost-benefit analysis of added complexity are not quantified

## Next Checks
1. **Public Dataset Replication**: Implement RDLI on publicly available crypto transaction dataset (e.g., Elliptic) with FATF-style typologies to verify knowledge integration benefits outside original data environment

2. **Knowledge Graph Robustness Test**: Systematically vary KG quality and completeness (corrupted hierarchies, missing edge types) to measure detection performance degradation and identify failure thresholds

3. **Real-Time Context Ablation Study**: Conduct longitudinal evaluation disabling RGC during market volatility periods to quantify actual contribution versus noise, measuring detection accuracy and false positive rates
