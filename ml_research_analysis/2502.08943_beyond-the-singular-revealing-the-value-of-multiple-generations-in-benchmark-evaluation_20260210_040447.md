# Beyond the Singular: Revealing the Value of Multiple Generations in Benchmark Evaluation

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08943

- Primary result: Multiple generations per prompt reduce variance and improve LLM benchmark score estimation by treating prompt difficulty as a latent variable

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental limitation of current LLM benchmark evaluations that rely on single generations per prompt, which ignores model randomness and leads to unreliable score estimates. The authors propose a hierarchical statistical model where prompt difficulty is treated as a latent variable drawn from a beta distribution, with generation correctness following a Bernoulli process conditioned on this difficulty. By generating multiple responses per prompt, the method enables more accurate estimation of benchmark scores and introduces P(correct) as a prompt-level difficulty metric. Experiments demonstrate that this approach reduces variance, improves score estimation, and can detect mislabeled or ambiguous prompts through semantic consistency analysis.

## Method Summary
The method treats prompt difficulty as a latent variable drawn from a beta distribution, with generation correctness following a Bernoulli process conditioned on this difficulty. Multiple generations per prompt allow for more accurate estimation of both prompt difficulty (P(correct)) and overall benchmark scores. The approach introduces semantic consistency metrics using embedding similarity to identify potentially ambiguous or mislabeled prompts. Experiments were conducted using four LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B/70B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Ministral 8B) across four benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GSM8K, IFEval, MuSR), comparing single-generation and multiple-generation evaluation strategies.

## Key Results
- Multiple generations per prompt reduce variance and improve benchmark score estimation accuracy
- P(correct) distributions vary significantly between benchmarks, with reasoning tasks showing more diffuse distributions
- The approach successfully identifies potentially mislabeled or ambiguous prompts in GSM8K through semantic consistency analysis
- Models behave like random samplers on challenging reasoning tasks, with P(correct) distributions indicating difficulty in finding correct solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hierarchical statistical framework captures the inherent randomness in LLM outputs by modeling prompt difficulty as a latent variable. Multiple generations allow for better estimation of this latent difficulty through the law of large numbers, reducing the variance in score estimates. The beta-Bernoulli structure provides a principled way to aggregate generation outcomes and estimate both prompt-level difficulty and overall benchmark performance. Semantic consistency analysis using embeddings helps identify prompts where multiple generations yield semantically divergent answers, suggesting potential ambiguity or labeling issues.

## Foundational Learning
- **Beta distribution for latent variables**: Used to model the distribution of prompt difficulties across the benchmark
  - Why needed: Captures the variability in prompt difficulty as a continuous distribution rather than discrete categories
  - Quick check: Verify that empirical P(correct) distributions across prompts follow beta-like shapes

- **Hierarchical statistical modeling**: Treats prompt difficulty as a latent variable with generation correctness conditioned on it
  - Why needed: Properly accounts for the two-level uncertainty (prompt difficulty and generation randomness)
  - Quick check: Compare model fit metrics (e.g., AIC/BIC) between hierarchical and flat models

- **Semantic consistency metrics**: Uses embedding similarity to detect ambiguous prompts
  - Why needed: Identifies prompts where multiple generations yield semantically divergent answers
  - Quick check: Calculate average pairwise cosine similarity of embeddings across multiple generations per prompt

- **P(correct) as difficulty metric**: Ratio of correct generations per prompt serves as an interpretable difficulty measure
  - Why needed: Provides a prompt-level difficulty score that can be aggregated for benchmark analysis
  - Quick check: Correlate P(correct) with human-judged prompt difficulty ratings

- **Bernoulli process for generation outcomes**: Models each generation as a Bernoulli trial with success probability equal to prompt difficulty
  - Why needed: Captures the binary nature of correct/incorrect generation outcomes
  - Quick check: Verify that generation outcomes follow expected Bernoulli distributions for prompts of known difficulty

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Generation -> Prompt Difficulty Estimation -> Score Aggregation -> Ambiguity Detection

**Critical Path**: Generate multiple responses per prompt → Calculate P(correct) for each prompt → Aggregate P(correct) to estimate benchmark score → Analyze semantic consistency to detect ambiguous prompts

**Design Tradeoffs**: Multiple generations significantly increase computational cost (100x) but provide more reliable score estimates and additional insights into benchmark quality; the beta distribution assumption simplifies the model but may not capture all prompt difficulty distributions

**Failure Signatures**: Poor model fit when prompt difficulties don't follow beta distribution; semantic consistency metric fails to detect ambiguity in numerical reasoning tasks; computational cost becomes prohibitive for large-scale evaluations

**First Experiments**: 1) Test single vs. multiple generation score variance on a small benchmark subset; 2) Validate beta distribution assumption by fitting empirical P(correct) distributions; 3) Compare semantic consistency metric performance against human annotations on known ambiguous prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The beta distribution assumption for prompt difficulty is not empirically validated across different benchmark types
- Semantic consistency metric effectiveness varies across task types and may miss certain forms of ambiguity
- Substantial computational cost increase (100x more generations) may not justify incremental insights for all use cases

## Confidence
High: The statistical framework for treating prompt difficulty as a latent variable and using multiple generations to reduce variance is methodologically sound and well-explained. The experimental setup and implementation details are clearly described.

Medium: The claim that current single-generation evaluations provide unreliable score estimates is supported, but the magnitude of improvement from multiple generations varies significantly across benchmarks and may be overstated for some tasks. The semantic consistency approach for detecting ambiguous prompts shows promise but needs more rigorous validation.

Low: The beta distribution assumption for prompt difficulty is not empirically tested. The semantic consistency metric's effectiveness across different task types is not thoroughly validated. The computational cost-benefit analysis is incomplete.

## Next Checks
1. Test the beta distribution assumption for prompt difficulty by fitting empirical distributions from multiple benchmarks and comparing goodness-of-fit metrics
2. Validate the semantic consistency approach on benchmarks with known ambiguity issues using human annotations to establish ground truth
3. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis comparing score estimation accuracy improvements against the computational overhead across different benchmark types and model sizes
