# SQuARE: Sequential Question Answering Reasoning Engine for Enhanced Chain-of-Thought in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.09390
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09390
- Reference count: 31
- Llama 3.2 3B achieves 88.5% accuracy with SQuARE vs 87.5% with chain-of-thought on TriviaQA

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SQuARE (Sequential Question Answering Reasoning Engine), a novel prompting technique that enhances reasoning in large language models by prompting them to generate and answer multiple auxiliary questions before addressing the main query. The method builds upon chain-of-thought prompting frameworks but extends them with a self-interrogation paradigm, systematically decomposing queries into iterative steps. Evaluations conducted across multiple question-answering datasets using Llama 3 (3B and 8B) and GPT-4o models demonstrate that SQuARE significantly outperforms traditional chain-of-thought prompts and existing rephrase-and-respond methods.

## Method Summary
SQuARE implements a self-interrogation paradigm that prompts LLMs to generate and answer auxiliary questions before tackling the main query. The method extends traditional chain-of-thought frameworks by systematically breaking down complex queries into sequential reasoning steps. Each step involves generating a sub-question, answering it, and using that answer to inform subsequent questions. This iterative process creates a reasoning chain that builds toward the final answer. The technique is evaluated across multiple question-answering datasets using Llama 3 (3B and 8B) and GPT-4o models, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over baseline prompting methods.

## Key Results
- On TriviaQA, Llama 3.2 3B achieves 88.5% accuracy with SQuARE compared to 87.5% with chain-of-thought and 86.0% with rephrase-and-respond
- Similar improvements observed across other datasets and model configurations
- Performance gains are particularly pronounced for smaller-scale models where sequential questioning substantially improves final answer quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SQuARE method works by decomposing complex reasoning tasks into manageable sub-questions that guide the model through logical inference steps. By forcing the model to explicitly articulate intermediate reasoning steps, it reduces cognitive load and prevents the model from attempting to solve the entire problem in one pass. The sequential nature of the questioning creates a scaffolded reasoning process where each answer informs subsequent questions, building a coherent chain of thought. This approach leverages the model's ability to generate relevant sub-questions while ensuring those questions are answered before proceeding, creating a more structured and reliable reasoning process than traditional chain-of-thought prompting.

## Foundational Learning
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Why needed - Provides baseline reasoning framework; Quick check - Verify model can generate coherent intermediate reasoning steps
- **Self-Questioning Paradigms**: Why needed - Enables systematic query decomposition; Quick check - Confirm model generates relevant sub-questions
- **Sequential Reasoning**: Why needed - Builds logical inference chains; Quick check - Validate answers inform subsequent questions
- **Extractive QA Datasets**: Why needed - Standard evaluation benchmarks; Quick check - Ensure dataset compatibility with method
- **Prompt Engineering**: Why needed - Critical for technique effectiveness; Quick check - Test prompt variations on performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Main Query -> Auxiliary Question Generation -> Auxiliary Answer Generation -> Answer Synthesis -> Final Answer

**Critical Path:** The sequence of auxiliary question generation and answering forms the critical path, as each step depends on the previous answer to formulate the next question and ultimately construct the final response.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational overhead (multiple generations per query) for improved reasoning accuracy, particularly benefiting smaller models that benefit more from structured scaffolding. The sequential approach may introduce latency but provides more reliable reasoning paths.

**Failure Signatures:** The method may fail when auxiliary questions are irrelevant or when the model cannot generate meaningful sub-questions, leading to circular reasoning or incomplete inference chains. Performance degradation may occur on highly abstract or numerical reasoning tasks not well-suited to extractive QA decomposition.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test SQuARE on a single extractive QA dataset with Llama 3B to establish baseline performance improvement
2. Conduct ablation study removing auxiliary question generation to isolate its contribution
3. Measure inference time overhead compared to standard chain-of-thought prompting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on extractive question-answering datasets, limiting generalization to complex reasoning tasks
- Performance gains show diminishing returns for larger models, suggesting the technique is most beneficial for smaller-scale models
- Computational overhead from generating multiple auxiliary questions and answers is not fully characterized

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core methodology and implementation details are well-documented, and comparative results against baselines are reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalization of performance improvements across diverse reasoning tasks remains uncertain due to evaluation limitations
- **Medium Confidence**: Computational overhead characterization is incomplete, making practical trade-off assessment difficult

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate SQuARE on non-extractive QA datasets and multi-hop reasoning benchmarks to test generalization beyond simple factoid questions

2. Conduct systematic ablation experiments to identify which components of the sequential questioning framework contribute most significantly to performance improvements

3. Measure inference time and computational overhead introduced by SQuARE compared to baseline methods to assess practical trade-offs across different model scales
