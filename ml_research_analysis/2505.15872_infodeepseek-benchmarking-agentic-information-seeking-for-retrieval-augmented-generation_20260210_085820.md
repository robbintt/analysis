# InfoDeepSeek: Benchmarking Agentic Information Seeking for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.15872
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15872
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces a benchmark for evaluating agentic information seeking in dynamic web environments

## Executive Summary
InfoDeepSeek addresses critical limitations in existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) benchmarks by introducing a new framework for evaluating agentic information seeking in real-world, dynamic web environments. Unlike traditional RAG benchmarks confined to static settings with limited corpora and simple queries, InfoDeepSeek uses 245 manually curated questions designed to test determinate, difficult, and diverse scenarios across multiple domains, languages, and attributes. The benchmark introduces novel fine-grained evaluation metrics including answer accuracy, information accuracy, effective evidence utilization, and information compactness.

The benchmark reveals significant performance gaps across multiple LLMs, search engines, and question types, highlighting the substantial challenges of agentic information seeking. By testing in dynamic web environments with real-time search engine APIs (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo), InfoDeepSeek provides a more realistic evaluation framework that better reflects the complexities of real-world information retrieval tasks. The work offers actionable insights for future research while establishing a foundation for more rigorous evaluation of agentic information seeking systems.

## Method Summary
InfoDeepSeek employs a comprehensive evaluation framework for agentic information seeking in dynamic web environments. The benchmark consists of 245 manually curated questions spanning multiple domains, languages, and attributes including multi-hop reasoning, long-tail queries, distracting information, and false premises. The evaluation framework introduces four fine-grained metrics: answer accuracy (whether the final answer is correct), information accuracy (whether cited information is accurate), effective evidence utilization (whether relevant evidence is properly used), and information compactness (whether answers are concise and focused).

The benchmark tests across multiple configurations including different LLMs, search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo), and question types. Questions are designed to be determinate (having clear correct answers), difficult (requiring complex reasoning and information synthesis), and diverse (covering various domains and query complexities). The dynamic web environment evaluation leverages real-time search engine APIs to simulate realistic information seeking scenarios, moving beyond the static corpus limitations of traditional RAG benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Significant performance gaps observed across different LLMs, search engines, and question types
- Novel fine-grained metrics reveal nuanced differences in agentic information seeking capabilities beyond simple accuracy measures
- Dynamic web environment evaluation exposes challenges not captured by static RAG benchmarks
- Benchmark demonstrates the substantial complexity of real-world information seeking tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
InfoDeepSeek works by creating a realistic evaluation environment that mirrors actual information seeking challenges. The dynamic web environment forces agentic systems to handle real-time search results, varying information quality, and the need for complex reasoning across multiple sources. The carefully designed question set ensures comprehensive testing across different cognitive demands, from straightforward fact retrieval to multi-hop reasoning and handling distracting or false information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Determinate vs. Indeterminate Questions**: Determinate questions have clear correct answers, essential for objective evaluation metrics. Quick check: Verify question-answer pairs have consensus agreement among multiple annotators.
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Questions requiring information synthesis across multiple sources test complex cognitive capabilities. Quick check: Ensure questions genuinely require at least two distinct information sources for correct answers.
- **Dynamic vs. Static Evaluation Environments**: Dynamic environments reflect real-world information seeking where web content changes over time. Quick check: Compare performance consistency across different evaluation time periods.
- **Fine-grained Metrics vs. Overall Accuracy**: Breaking down evaluation into specific dimensions (answer accuracy, information accuracy, etc.) provides more diagnostic insights. Quick check: Validate that fine-grained metrics correlate with human judgment of answer quality.
- **Evidence Utilization**: Measuring whether systems effectively use relevant evidence tests practical reasoning capabilities. Quick check: Compare cited evidence relevance scores against human annotations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Question Bank -> LLM Agent -> Search Engine API -> Evidence Retrieval -> Answer Generation -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**: Question → Search → Evidence Selection → Answer Generation → Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Manual question curation ensures quality but introduces potential bias; dynamic web evaluation provides realism but reduces reproducibility; fine-grained metrics offer diagnostic value but require more complex implementation.

**Failure Signatures**: Systems may excel at simple fact retrieval but fail on multi-hop questions; may cite accurate information but fail to synthesize coherent answers; may generate verbose answers lacking information compactness.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison: Run InfoDeepSeek with multiple LLMs using the same search engine configuration
2. Search engine variation: Test the same LLM with different search engines to isolate search engine impact
3. Question type analysis: Evaluate performance breakdown across different question attributes (multi-hop, long-tail, etc.)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Manual curation of 245 questions may introduce subjective biases in question selection and difficulty calibration
- Dynamic web environment evaluation depends on real-time search engine APIs, making reproducibility challenging due to temporal content changes
- Fine-grained metrics lack established baselines for comparison, making it difficult to assess statistical significance of performance gaps

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Identification of RAG benchmark limitations is well-supported by literature review
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim of significant performance improvements requires broader validation
- **Low Confidence**: Assertion about actionable insights for future research is somewhat speculative

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-rater reliability analysis on question difficulty and diversity classifications using multiple human annotators
2. Perform longitudinal studies tracking benchmark performance across different time periods to quantify impact of dynamic web content changes
3. Compare fine-grained metrics against human evaluation scores to validate automated metric accuracy
