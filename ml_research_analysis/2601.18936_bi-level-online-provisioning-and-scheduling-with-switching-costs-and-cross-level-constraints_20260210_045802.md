core_contribution: This work studies a bi-level online optimization and learning framework
  for network resource provisioning under switching costs and cross-level constraints.
  The problem involves slow-time-scale budget provisioning coupled with fast-time-scale,
  state-aware scheduling, where the lower-level scheduling faces a varying constraint
  threshold due to online provisioning decisions.

# Bi-Level Online Provisioning and Scheduling with Switching Costs and Cross-Level Constraints

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18936
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18936
- Authors: Jialei Liu; C. Emre Koksal; Ming Shi
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Proposes BLOL algorithm achieving O(√K) regret with high-probability safety guarantees for bi-level online provisioning under switching costs and cross-level constraints

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a bi-level online optimization framework for network resource provisioning where slow-time provisioning decisions couple with fast-time scheduling under state-dependent constraints. The key innovation is a bi-level algorithm (BLOL) that uses dual feedback from the lower-level scheduling as sensitivity information for the upper-level update. The method addresses the challenge of varying constraint thresholds at the lower level by solving a budget-adaptive safe exploration problem (BALDE) based on an extended occupancy-measure linear program. The framework provides both near-optimal regret bounds and high-probability safety guarantees.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a bi-level algorithm that decomposes the problem into upper-level provisioning and lower-level scheduling. The upper level uses Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with dual feedback from the lower level to update provisioning decisions. The lower level solves a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with time-varying budget constraints using a safe exploration method called BALDE. BALDE extends the occupancy-measure linear program to handle varying budget constraints and provides high-probability safety guarantees. The algorithm iteratively solves the CMDP with current budget constraints, collects dual feedback, and uses this as sensitivity information for the OCO update at the upper level.

## Key Results
- Achieves O(√K) regret bound for the bi-level optimization problem
- Provides high-probability safety guarantees with near-zero constraint violations
- Outperforms fixed-budget and fixed-scheduling baselines in queue-aware bandwidth provisioning experiments
- Demonstrates better cost-latency balance compared to traditional approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by decomposing the bi-level problem and using dual feedback as sensitivity information. The upper level treats the lower-level dual as gradient information for the OCO update, while the lower level uses this dual to adapt its exploration strategy. The BALDE method ensures safety by maintaining a buffer around the constraint threshold and using occupancy-measure LPs to find policies that satisfy varying budget constraints. The key insight is that dual feedback from the lower-level solver provides the sensitivity information needed for the upper-level OCO update, enabling coordination between the two levels.

## Foundational Learning

**Online Convex Optimization (OCO)** - Why needed: Provides the framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty at the upper level. Quick check: Verify regret bounds hold under varying constraint thresholds.

**Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDP)** - Why needed: Models the lower-level scheduling problem with budget constraints. Quick check: Confirm safety guarantees when constraints vary over time.

**Occupancy-Measure Linear Programs** - Why needed: Enables exact policy optimization for CMDPs with known dynamics. Quick check: Validate LP solutions match MDP policies under varying budgets.

**Dual Sensitivity Analysis** - Why needed: Provides the bridge between lower-level constraints and upper-level updates. Quick check: Test sensitivity accuracy when constraint functions are noisy.

**Budget-Adaptive Safe Exploration** - Why needed: Allows safe learning when budget constraints change over time. Quick check: Verify safety margins hold under rapid budget fluctuations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Upper-level OCO solver -> Dual feedback computation -> Lower-level CMDP solver (BALDE) -> State-dependent constraint evaluation -> Dual feedback to upper level

**Critical Path:** OCO update → Lower-level CMDP solve → Constraint evaluation → Dual computation → OCO update

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational complexity (solving LPs at each step) for safety guarantees and theoretical convergence. Using dual feedback enables coordination but requires accurate constraint function knowledge.

**Failure Signatures:** Safety violations indicate inaccurate dual feedback or violated LP assumptions. High regret suggests poor dual sensitivity or ineffective CMDP solutions. Convergence issues may stem from incorrect occupancy measure computations.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test algorithm with synthetic constraint functions to verify safety guarantees hold
2. Evaluate performance with perfect vs. estimated constraint functions to assess robustness
3. Compare against baselines under varying switching cost magnitudes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit challenges include handling non-convex constraint functions, extending to partial observability settings, and scaling to large state-action spaces.

## Limitations

- Assumes full observability of state-dependent constraints at lower level
- Relies on convex dual formulations that may not hold for non-convex problems
- Experimental validation limited to single queue-aware bandwidth provisioning scenario
- Safety guarantees assume known constraint functions, not robust to estimation errors

## Confidence

**Theoretical framework:** High - well-established connections to OCO and CMDP literature
**BALDE algorithm safety:** Medium - depends on precise knowledge of occupancy measure LP and accurate dual feedback
**Practical deployment:** Low - scalability concerns with real-time LP solving and non-convex constraint handling

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate performance under noisy or partially observed constraint functions to test safety guarantee robustness
2. Benchmark against state-of-the-art RL methods (PPO, SAC) on the same bandwidth provisioning task
3. Test algorithm on heterogeneous network topologies and different cost functions to assess generalizability
