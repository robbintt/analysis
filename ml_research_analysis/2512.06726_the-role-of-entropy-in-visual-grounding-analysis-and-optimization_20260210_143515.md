# The Role of Entropy in Visual Grounding: Analysis and Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.06726
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06726
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ECVGPO improves visual grounding performance by 0.25-1.06 points across multiple benchmarks through entropy control that maintains exploration-exploitation balance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of maintaining effective exploration during reinforcement learning fine-tuning for visual grounding tasks. Unlike reasoning tasks where entropy naturally collapses after training, visual grounding exhibits high entropy due to the presence of many low-probability responses with high advantage. The authors propose ECVGPO, a method that dynamically adjusts policy entropy through self-information-based advantage reshaping. By computing token-level self-information and reshaping advantages for high-variance rewards, ECVGPO achieves better exploration-exploitation balance than standard GRPO. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL3 models show consistent improvements across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, LISA-Grounding, and RefGTA benchmarks.

## Method Summary
ECVGPO builds on VLM-R1/GRPO for visual grounding fine-tuning, predicting bounding box coordinates from text queries. The key innovation is self-information-based advantage reshaping where token-level self-information Si,t = -log π(oi,t|q,o<i) is computed and used to modify advantages for positive samples when reward_std < δ. The reshaping follows A'i = max(Ai,t/l0, Ai,t - Si,t/r0), with hyperparameters l0=25, δ=0.1, and r0 values tuned per model (10 for Qwen, -50 for InternVL-8B). The method maintains elevated policy entropy during training, contrasting with the entropy collapse observed in reasoning tasks. Training uses rollout=8, temperature=1.0, iterations=1, β=0.04, lr=1e-6, batch_size=4 with bf16 precision and DeepSpeed stage 3.

## Key Results
- ECVGPO outperforms standard GRPO by 0.25-1.06 points on visual grounding benchmarks
- Consistent improvements across Qwen2.5-VL (0.25-0.66 points) and InternVL3 (0.48-1.06 points) models
- Demonstrates greater training stability with lower variance (std up to ±6.3 on some benchmarks)
- Achieves improvements without additional computational overhead during inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Visual grounding tasks maintain high entropy during RL training because they contain many near-optimal solutions (low IoU variance) with similar advantages. This contrasts with reasoning tasks where entropy collapses as the policy converges to a single optimal path. ECVGPO exploits this property by identifying high-advantage responses that have low probability (high self-information) and boosting their advantage scores. The self-information-based reshaping creates a feedback loop where the policy is encouraged to explore these valuable but under-sampled responses, maintaining diversity while still converging toward optimal solutions. The method's effectiveness stems from aligning the exploration strategy with the inherent structure of visual grounding tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Policy entropy in RL**: Measures uncertainty in action selection; high entropy enables exploration while low entropy indicates exploitation. Why needed: Understanding entropy dynamics is crucial for recognizing why standard RL approaches fail in visual grounding.
- **Self-information computation**: Si,t = -log π(oi,t|q,o<i) quantifies how surprising each token prediction is under the current policy. Why needed: This metric identifies which responses are both valuable (high advantage) and under-explored (high self-information).
- **Advantage reshaping**: Modifying policy gradients based on additional signals beyond reward. Why needed: Standard advantage computation doesn't account for the exploration-exploitation trade-off specific to visual grounding.
- **Reward variance thresholding**: Using δ=0.1 to determine when to apply entropy control. Why needed: Prevents unnecessary entropy manipulation when reward distributions are already stable.
- **Near-optimal solution density**: Visual grounding has M ≫ 1 near-optimal bounding boxes with similar IoU scores. Why needed: This property distinguishes visual grounding from reasoning tasks and motivates specialized entropy control.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Input text+image → Visual encoder → Text encoder → Fusion module → Policy network → Action sampler → Reward computation → Advantage calculation → ECVGPO reshaping → Policy update
- **Critical path:** Text query and image → multimodal fusion → bounding box prediction → IoU reward → advantage computation → self-information calculation → advantage reshaping → policy gradient update
- **Design tradeoffs:** ECVGPO adds minimal computational overhead (self-information is cheap to compute) while providing significant performance gains. The method trades implementation complexity for better exploration, requiring careful hyperparameter tuning of r0, l0, and δ.
- **Failure signatures:** If r0 is misconfigured, entropy may collapse (r0 too positive) or exploration may be insufficient (r0 too negative). High training variance indicates instability in the entropy control mechanism.
- **First experiments to run:** 1) Verify entropy maintenance during training by plotting policy entropy curves; 2) Compare IoU distributions between ECVGPO and GRPO to confirm better exploration of low-probability high-advantage responses; 3) Ablate the δ threshold to determine sensitivity of the method to reward variance assumptions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
How can the optimal hyperparameters ($r_0$, $l_0$, $\delta$) for ECVGPO be determined automatically for different model architectures and datasets, rather than requiring manual tuning? The paper manually sets different $r_0$ values (10, 25, -50) for each model without providing a principled selection method. This requires an adaptive mechanism or theoretical framework that predicts optimal hyperparameters based on model/dataset characteristics.

### Open Question 2
Does ECVGPO generalize to other perception-oriented tasks beyond visual grounding (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation)? The study focuses exclusively on visual grounding, and the entropy dynamics in other perception tasks remain unexplored. Systematic evaluation on diverse perception tasks is needed to assess generality.

### Open Question 3
What is the theoretical relationship between the number of near-optimal solutions ($M$ in Eq. 11) and the optimal entropy control strategy? The analysis is qualitative, and the paper does not establish whether tasks with more/fewer near-optimal solutions require different entropy control intensities. Controlled experiments varying solution density could yield a predictive model.

## Limitations
- The entropy analysis relies on assumptions about reward distribution normality that may not hold across all model architectures
- The choice of negative r0 values for InternVL models versus positive for Qwen models lacks theoretical justification beyond empirical tuning
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on IoU accuracy without examining whether improvements reflect genuine spatial understanding versus memorization
- The format compliance reward of 0.5 may create artificial optimization pressure that doesn't reflect real-world grounding performance

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: ECVGPO consistently improves benchmark scores across multiple models and datasets (Qwen2.5-VL +0.25-0.66, InternVL3 +0.48-1.06). The entropy maintenance mechanism is well-defined and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that visual grounding requires different entropy control than reasoning tasks is supported by analysis but lacks ablation studies showing what happens with standard GRPO.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that ECVGPO achieves "better exploration-exploitation balance" is qualitative and not directly measured.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on δ threshold**: Systematically vary δ from 0.05 to 0.2 to determine sensitivity of entropy maintenance and performance gains, testing whether the 0.1 choice is critical or robust.
2. **Cross-architecture transfer**: Apply ECVGPO to non-MLLM visual grounding models (e.g., CLIP-based or specialized visual encoders) to test whether entropy control benefits generalize beyond the tested model families.
3. **Real-world grounding evaluation**: Test models on unconstrained visual grounding datasets where format compliance is not enforced, measuring whether IoU improvements translate to practical spatial reasoning capability versus format-specific optimization.
