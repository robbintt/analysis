# RealPDEBench: A Benchmark for Complex Physical Systems with Real-World Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01829
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01829
- Reference count: 40
- RealPDEBench is the first scientific ML benchmark integrating real-world measurements with paired numerical simulations for complex physical systems.

## Executive Summary
RealPDEBench introduces a novel benchmark for scientific machine learning that combines real-world measurements with paired numerical simulations across five complex physical systems in fluid dynamics and combustion. The benchmark includes three distinct tasks: real-world training, simulated training, and simulated pretraining with real-world fine-tuning. With nine evaluation metrics and ten baseline models, the benchmark reveals significant discrepancies between simulated and real-world data while demonstrating that pretraining on simulated data consistently improves both accuracy and convergence when fine-tuning on real-world measurements.

## Method Summary
RealPDEBench is designed to address the gap between simulated and real-world data in scientific machine learning by providing paired datasets across multiple physical systems. The benchmark consists of five real-world datasets paired with their numerical simulations, three task formulations that test different training scenarios, nine evaluation metrics spanning both data-oriented and physics-oriented perspectives, and ten baseline models for comparison. The methodology emphasizes the importance of bridging the simulation-reality gap through pretraining strategies and provides standardized protocols for evaluating model performance across different physical domains.

## Key Results
- RealPDEBench successfully integrates real-world measurements with paired numerical simulations for the first time in scientific ML benchmarking
- Significant discrepancies were observed between simulated and real-world data across all five physical systems
- Pretraining with simulated data consistently improved both accuracy and convergence when fine-tuning on real-world data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RealPDEBench works by providing a standardized platform that captures the fundamental challenge in scientific ML: the gap between idealized simulations and messy real-world measurements. By pairing real data with simulations from the same physical systems, the benchmark enables researchers to study how pretraining on simulation data can transfer to real-world applications. The mechanism relies on the observation that while simulations may not perfectly capture reality, they contain underlying physical structures that can be leveraged through pretraining to improve performance on real data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Physics-Informed Learning**: Needed to incorporate domain knowledge into ML models; quick check involves verifying conservation laws are respected
- **Data-Simulation Discrepancy Analysis**: Essential for understanding model generalization; quick check involves comparing distribution statistics between paired datasets
- **Transfer Learning**: Required for leveraging simulation data to improve real-world performance; quick check involves measuring pretraining benefits across domains
- **Multi-Physics Modeling**: Important for handling complex systems with multiple interacting phenomena; quick check involves validating coupling terms between physical processes
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Critical for scientific applications requiring confidence estimates; quick check involves analyzing prediction intervals against ground truth
- **Domain Adaptation**: Necessary for bridging simulation-reality gaps; quick check involves measuring domain shift metrics like MMD

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Data Collection -> Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Evaluation -> Analysis
Critical Path: Real-world data acquisition paired with numerical simulations → Baseline model training on both domains → Pretraining on simulated data → Fine-tuning on real-world data → Comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics
Design Tradeoffs: Balancing model complexity with physical interpretability, choosing between data-driven and physics-informed approaches, trade-off between computational cost and accuracy
Failure Signatures: Poor performance on real data despite good simulation results, inability to converge during fine-tuning, metrics showing large gaps between simulated and real-world performance
First Experiments:
1. Train baseline models on real data only to establish performance floor
2. Train baseline models on simulated data only to establish performance ceiling
3. Implement simple pretraining-finetuning pipeline to verify transfer learning benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark relies on only five physical systems, limiting generalizability across diverse scientific domains
- Does not provide detailed analysis of the sources of discrepancies between simulated and real-world data
- Focus on supervised learning tasks may not capture challenges in unsupervised or reinforcement learning approaches

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Claim that RealPDEBench is the first benchmark integrating real-world measurements with paired numerical simulations
- **Medium confidence**: Pretraining with simulated data consistently improves accuracy and convergence on real-world data
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability of observed simulated-real discrepancies to other physical systems

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic study to identify and quantify sources of discrepancies between simulated and real-world data
2. Extend benchmark to additional physical systems to validate generalizability of findings
3. Design experiments to assess model robustness under distribution shifts and varying environmental conditions
