# Empowerment Gain and Causal Model Construction: Children and adults are sensitive to controllability and variability in their causal interventions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08230
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08230
- Reference count: 3
- Key outcome: Children and adults prefer systems with controllable variability for goal-directed tasks, while showing preference shifts toward purely variable systems for exploratory play

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes that empowerment—maximizing mutual information between actions and outcomes—serves as an intrinsic reward guiding causal model construction. The authors bridge reinforcement learning and causal inference frameworks by suggesting that humans use empowerment as a metric for identifying which variables to intervene upon when building causal models. Through two behavioral studies with children (ages 5-10) and adults, they demonstrate that participants show systematic preferences for systems offering both controllability and variability, with these preferences shifting based on whether the task context is goal-directed or exploratory.

The findings suggest a nuanced relationship between controllability and variability in causal learning, where both components are necessary for effective model construction. Children and adults alike show sensitivity to this trade-off, preferring controllable variability for intervention-based learning while being more accepting of purely variable systems when exploration is the primary goal. This work provides empirical support for empowerment as a guiding principle in causal learning and offers a potential theoretical bridge between Bayesian causal inference and reinforcement learning approaches.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted two studies with children aged 5-10 and adult participants. Participants were presented with different machine configurations varying in controllability (whether actions could reliably produce outcomes) and variability (whether multiple outcomes were possible). In the first study, participants chose which machines to interact with for different purposes: achieving specific goals versus free exploration. The second study examined learning outcomes by measuring participants' ability to construct accurate causal models after interacting with different machine types. Both studies used a within-subjects design where participants experienced multiple machine configurations across different task contexts.

## Key Results
- Both children and adults showed strong preference for machines with controllable variability when pursuing goal-directed tasks
- Participants demonstrated a significant shift toward preferring purely variable systems when the task context emphasized exploration over goal achievement
- Learning outcomes were superior when participants interacted with controllable variability systems, particularly for intervention-based causal learning
- The preference patterns emerged consistently across age groups, suggesting a robust underlying mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism appears to operate through empowerment maximization as an intrinsic reward signal. When constructing causal models, humans need to identify which variables can be effectively intervened upon. Systems offering controllable variability provide both the information content (variability) and the reliability signal (controllability) necessary for learning intervention effects. The mutual information between actions and outcomes serves as a natural metric for identifying these learnable intervention points, guiding attention toward variables that are both informative and actionable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Empowerment maximization**: Understanding mutual information between actions and outcomes as an intrinsic reward - needed to grasp the theoretical framework; quick check: can you calculate empowerment for a simple system?
- **Controllability vs. variability trade-off**: Recognizing that both components serve different but complementary roles in learning - needed to interpret preference patterns; quick check: can you identify which systems maximize each component independently?
- **Causal intervention learning**: Understanding how humans identify which variables to intervene upon - needed to connect empowerment to causal model construction; quick check: can you explain why purely variable systems are less useful for intervention learning?
- **Bayesian causal inference**: Familiarity with probabilistic approaches to causal learning - needed to appreciate the bridge to reinforcement learning; quick check: can you contrast Bayesian and RL approaches to causal learning?
- **Intrinsic motivation in learning**: Understanding how internal rewards guide exploration and learning - needed to contextualize empowerment as an intrinsic reward; quick check: can you name other intrinsic motivation frameworks in developmental psychology?
- **Developmental trajectories in causal learning**: Understanding how causal reasoning develops across childhood - needed to interpret age-related findings; quick check: can you identify key developmental milestones in causal reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Empowerment signal -> Preference formation -> Causal model construction -> Intervention selection

Critical path: System interaction → Information gain assessment → Preference formation → Model updating → Intervention selection

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances exploration-exploitation by using empowerment as a unified metric, but this may oversimplify the complex dynamics of causal learning. Purely controllability-focused or variability-focused approaches would miss the synergistic benefits of their combination.

Failure signatures: Systems lacking either controllability or variability would fail to support effective causal learning. Over-reliance on either component alone could lead to suboptimal model construction or exploration strategies.

First experiments:
1. Manipulate empowerment levels directly while holding controllability and variability constant
2. Test preference patterns with systems that vary in dimensionality (number of variables)
3. Examine how task complexity affects the controllability-variability trade-off preferences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical claims about empowerment serving as an intrinsic reward remain largely conceptual rather than empirically tested through direct manipulation
- Sample sizes and age ranges may limit generalizability of the developmental findings
- Alternative explanations for the observed preference patterns have not been fully ruled out
- The complex interplay between controllability and variability in causal learning may be oversimplified

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments manipulating empowerment levels directly while controlling for controllability and variability independently
2. Test the framework with larger, more diverse age ranges and sample sizes to assess developmental trajectories
3. Implement computational models that formally integrate empowerment maximization with Bayesian causal inference mechanisms
