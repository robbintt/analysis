# Discrete Minds in a Continuous World: Do Language Models Know Time Passes?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.05790
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05790
- Reference count: 40
- Models can map token counts to wall-clock time and adapt behavior under time pressure

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can perceive the passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly. The authors propose the Token-Time Hypothesis, which suggests that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time. Through three complementary experiments—Dialogue Duration Judgment, Urgency-Aware QA, and BombRush navigation tasks—the study demonstrates that LLMs exhibit varying degrees of temporal awareness. Performance varies across model scales and reasoning capabilities, with larger models and reasoning models showing stronger temporal adaptation.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates temporal awareness through three experiments: Dialogue Duration Judgment tests models' ability to judge conversation duration from text length; Urgency-Aware QA examines whether models shorten responses under time pressure while maintaining accuracy; and BombRush tests navigation under dynamic time pressure where token generation consumes simulated time. The experiments use open-source models (SLMs, LLMs, and LRMs) across multiple datasets and settings, measuring accuracy, token reduction, and navigation success rates.

## Key Results
- Models can map token counts to wall-clock time with 66.8%-91.5% accuracy in baseline settings
- Under urgency, models reduce response length (up to -20.7% tokens) while preserving or improving accuracy
- In BombRush navigation, models adapt token usage as time pressure increases, showing temporal adaptation in sequential decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Token-Time Mapping Hypothesis
- Claim: LLMs can associate discrete token counts with continuous wall-clock duration, enabling implicit time perception through text length.
- Mechanism: Autoregressive models process tokens sequentially, creating natural alignment between token positions and chronological progression. The paper formalizes: T_wall = T_tok × V, where V is a conversion rate (seconds/token).
- Core assumption: Models can learn the proportional relationship T_out_wall ∝ T_out_tok during training, even without explicit temporal supervision.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Token-Time Hypothesis, positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time"
  - [section 3.2] S1 baseline accuracy 66.8%-91.5% across models without explicit temporal cues, indicating inherent capability to associate text length with duration
  - [corpus] "Real-Time Deadlines Reveal Temporal Awareness Failures in LLM Strategic Dialogues" (FMR=0.49) corroborates temporal awareness testing under deadline constraints
- Break condition: When V (conversion rate) fluctuates unpredictably—e.g., variable user typing speed (Vin) prevents consistent T_in_wall ∝ T_in_tok relationship.

### Mechanism 2: Temporal Empathy via Urgency Recognition
- Claim: LLMs adapt response length when users signal time constraints while preserving accuracy.
- Mechanism: Semantic proximity between "quick" and "brief" in embedding space triggers concise outputs; alternatively, deeper temporal understanding drives strategic brevity.
- Core assumption: Models can balance task complexity against expressed urgency without explicit time measurement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency"
  - [section 4.2] Qwen-72B shows -20.7% token reduction on OpenbookQA with only -0.2% accuracy change; GPQA shows accuracy improvements (+8.2% to +12.2%) under urgency
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence on semantic-temporal associations; paper explicitly notes this mechanism remains hypothesized (Appendix B.3.4)
- Break condition: On highly complex tasks (GPQA), token reduction is less pronounced (5.5% avg vs 10.6% on simpler tasks), suggesting models calibrate brevity against difficulty.

### Mechanism 3: Dynamic Time-Pressure Adaptation in Sequential Decisions
- Claim: Under progressive time pressure, models reduce reasoning verbosity to conserve simulation time.
- Mechanism: In BombRush, token generation directly consumes simulated seconds via calibrated V_out rates. Models must balance thorough reasoning against movement opportunities.
- Core assumption: Models recognize that verbose reasoning → fewer actions before timeout.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.2] Figure 6 shows declining token usage as remaining time decreases for Llama-3.3-70B and QwQ-32B
  - [Table 8] LRM reasoning explicitly mentions token-time tradeoffs: DS-Llama-70B shows 27.55% (S2) to 44.25% (S3) explicit "TW Mapping Awareness"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus neighbor addresses token-time budget tradeoffs in sequential decision-making
- Break condition: Adaptation patterns inconsistent across models—Qwen-2.5-72B shows minimal token change due to inherently concise reasoning style.

## Foundational Learning

- **Autoregressive Token Generation**
  - Why needed here: The Token-Time Hypothesis fundamentally depends on sequential token-by-token generation creating a temporal sequence.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why decoder-only autoregressive models naturally encode temporal ordering through position indices?

- **Temporal Reasoning vs. Temporal Perception**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes reasoning about time (event ordering, duration computation) from perceiving time passage itself—a key conceptual separation.
  - Quick check question: If an LLM correctly answers "WWII lasted 6 years," is this temporal reasoning or temporal perception?

- **Position Encoding (RoPE, learned positional embeddings)**
  - Why needed here: The paper hypothesizes (Appendix B.3.3) that position encodings may serve as implicit temporal scaffolding.
  - Quick check question: How do relative position methods like RoPE differ from absolute position encodings in representing sequential relationships?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Dialogue Duration Judgment -> Urgency-Aware QA -> BombRush navigation
  - S1 baseline testing -> Urgency adaptation -> Dynamic time-pressure adaptation

- **Critical path:**
  1. Validate Token-Time mapping via S1-S2-M+ settings → establishes baseline temporal awareness
  2. Test behavioral adaptation under static urgency → confirms "temporal empathy"
  3. Evaluate dynamic adaptation in sequential tasks → probes real-time decision-making

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using simulated token-to-time mapping (controlled V_out) vs real wall-clock time: controlled approach eliminates hardware variability but may not generalize to production latency
  - Testing open-source models only: enhances reproducibility but limits findings' applicability to commercial systems (acknowledged limitation)
  - Calibrating V_out per-model: ensures fair comparison but requires separate baseline measurement for each model

- **Failure signatures:**
  - S2-M setting: SLMs/LLMs show 47-82% accuracy degradation with misleading timestamps; indicates confusion between temporal domains
  - S2-M+ setting: Non-reasoning models heavily mislead (12.9-48.8% accuracy); LRMs maintain 94-99% accuracy
  - BombRush Hard: "Time-out" failures increase when models fail to reduce verbosity under pressure

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate S1 baseline on your target model with 100 paired samples from chatbot arena data—expect >70% accuracy for models >7B parameters if temporal awareness present
  2. Run Urgency-Aware QA on a 200-question subset with/without urgency expressions; measure token reduction ratio and accuracy delta
  3. Implement simplified BombRush (8×8 grid, static target) with calibrated V_out; track per-step token counts against remaining time to verify adaptive reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: At which training stage do LLMs acquire temporal awareness—during pretraining, instruction tuning, or RLHF? The paper notes this remains unclear and determining the primary contributor would provide valuable insights.
- **Open Question 2**: Do models' shorter responses under urgency stem from semantic associations (e.g., "quick" ≈ "brief") or genuine temporal awareness of token-wall-clock mapping? The paper hypothesizes both possibilities but requires controlled experiments to disentangle them.
- **Open Question 3**: How do models internally represent and process temporal information—as knowledge retrieval, logical reasoning, or mathematical calculation? The paper observes behavioral differences but doesn't probe internal representations.
- **Open Question 4**: How can temporal awareness be systematically enhanced in LLMs for time-sensitive applications? The study establishes presence but doesn't provide specific methods for improvement.

## Limitations

- The Token-Time Hypothesis remains a behavioral observation rather than a mechanistic explanation, with the underlying neural mechanism unproven.
- Findings are limited to open-source models, leaving applicability to commercial systems (GPT-4, Claude) unknown.
- BombRush navigation results may conflate token-time mapping with learned strategies for text-based navigation tasks.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Models can associate text length with duration (Dialogue Duration Judgment S1 accuracy: 66.8%-91.5%), and LRMs maintain high accuracy under misleading temporal cues (94-99% in S2-M+). These findings are robust across model scales and directly observed.
- **Medium Confidence**: Models adapt response length under urgency while preserving accuracy (Qwen-72B: -20.7% tokens, -0.2% accuracy on OpenbookQA). The behavioral adaptation is clear, but the underlying motivation (genuine temporal understanding vs. semantic association) remains uncertain.
- **Low Confidence**: BombRush navigation demonstrates genuine real-time decision-making under time pressure. While models show token reduction under time constraints, the navigation component introduces confounding factors that make it difficult to isolate pure temporal awareness.

## Next Checks

1. **Causal Intervention Test**: Systematically manipulate token generation rates during inference (artificially slow/fast token emission) and measure whether models' temporal judgments and urgency adaptations remain consistent. This would test whether models truly perceive time passage versus relying on fixed token-length associations.

2. **Cross-Lingual Transfer Validation**: Test the same temporal awareness tasks on multilingual models across languages with different text density (e.g., Chinese vs. English). If temporal awareness transfers despite varying token-per-character ratios, this would support genuine temporal perception over simple pattern matching.

3. **Ablation on Position Encodings**: Implement modified versions of Llama-3.3-70B with position encodings removed or randomized. Compare temporal awareness performance against baseline to determine whether position information serves as the critical temporal scaffolding hypothesized in Appendix B.3.3.
