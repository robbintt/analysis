# FedCCL: Federated Clustered Continual Learning Framework for Privacy-focused Energy Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.20282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20282
- Reference count: 39
- Mean energy prediction error: 3.93% (±0.21%)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FedCCL, a federated learning framework designed for privacy-preserving energy forecasting in distributed environments with heterogeneous data distributions and varying computational capabilities. The framework combines static pre-training clustering with asynchronous federated learning to enable immediate model specialization while reducing coordination overhead. FedCCL demonstrates superior performance compared to centralized baselines while maintaining data privacy, achieving a mean energy prediction error of 3.93% and power prediction error of 6.44% across photovoltaic installations in central Europe.

## Method Summary
FedCCL employs a two-stage approach: static pre-training clustering using DBSCAN based on static characteristics, followed by asynchronous federated learning. The clustering phase groups similar installations before training, allowing for immediate model specialization without extensive coordination. The asynchronous communication protocol enables participants with varying computational capabilities to contribute without being constrained by slower peers. This design maintains data privacy by keeping sensitive information local while still benefiting from collective model improvements.

## Key Results
- Mean energy prediction error of 3.93% (±0.21%) and power prediction error of 6.44% (±0.17%)
- Outperforms centralized baselines while maintaining data privacy
- Minimal performance degradation (0.14 percentage points) for new installations
- Effective across heterogeneous data distributions and varying computational capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from the strategic combination of static clustering and asynchronous federated learning. By clustering installations based on static characteristics before training, FedCCL enables immediate model specialization that would otherwise require extensive coordination and communication overhead. The asynchronous protocol allows participants to contribute updates at their own pace, accommodating varying computational capabilities while maintaining overall system performance. This approach addresses the fundamental challenge of distributed machine learning where data heterogeneity and resource constraints typically degrade model accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- Federated Learning: Distributed machine learning that keeps data local while training a shared model
  - Why needed: Enables privacy-preserving learning across multiple parties without centralizing sensitive data
  - Quick check: Verify gradient aggregation correctly combines local model updates
- DBSCAN Clustering: Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise
  - Why needed: Groups similar installations for specialized model training without prior knowledge of cluster count
  - Quick check: Ensure clustering quality using silhouette score or similar metrics
- Asynchronous Communication: Updates transmitted without waiting for all participants
  - Why needed: Accommodates varying computational capabilities and network conditions
  - Quick check: Monitor staleness of updates and their impact on convergence

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
DBSCAN Static Clustering -> Asynchronous Federated Learning -> Model Specialization -> Performance Evaluation

Critical Path:
Static characteristic extraction → DBSCAN clustering → Initial model training → Asynchronous update aggregation → Performance monitoring

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework prioritizes privacy and adaptability over computational efficiency. Static clustering provides immediate specialization but may miss temporal variations. Asynchronous communication improves participation but introduces update staleness. The tradeoff between model accuracy and privacy is managed through careful aggregation strategies that maintain data locality.

Failure Signatures:
Poor clustering quality leads to mismatched model specialization and degraded accuracy. Network latency or participant dropout can cause excessive update staleness, slowing convergence. Insufficient participant participation reduces the diversity of training data, limiting model generalization. Monitoring cluster stability and update frequency helps identify these issues early.

First Experiments:
1. Baseline centralized training comparison with identical data distribution
2. DBSCAN clustering sensitivity analysis varying epsilon and minimum points parameters
3. Asynchronous vs synchronous federated learning performance comparison under varying network conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to photovoltaic installations in central Europe, limiting generalizability to other regions and energy sources
- Static clustering approach may not capture temporal variations in energy generation patterns or adapt to evolving conditions
- Asynchronous protocol effectiveness depends on specific network conditions and participant availability, which were not fully characterized
- No explicit security analysis of clustering mechanism or potential adversarial attacks on the federated learning framework

## Confidence
- High confidence in accuracy metrics and error rates, given detailed experimental methodology and clear baseline comparisons
- Medium confidence in privacy-preserving claims, lacking explicit security analysis of clustering mechanism
- Medium confidence in scalability claims, as experiments involve limited installations compared to potential real-world deployments

## Next Checks
1. Test framework across diverse geographic regions and energy sources to assess generalizability beyond central European photovoltaics
2. Implement dynamic clustering mechanisms that adapt to temporal variations in energy generation patterns
3. Conduct comprehensive security analysis including potential adversarial attacks on clustering process and federated learning protocol
