- Primary result: Systematic classification of implicit philosophical assumptions in ML representation papers reveals predominance of structural idealism

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a structuralist decision framework to classify implicit philosophical assumptions in machine learning research on neural network representations. Through a modified PRISMA protocol and deductive content analysis, five influential papers were examined using three hierarchical criteria: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The analysis reveals that learned representations are predominantly treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architecture, data priors, and training dynamics, aligning with structural idealism. The framework provides a rigorous foundation for interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning, clarifying conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust.

## Method Summary
The research employed a modified PRISMA protocol to systematically select and analyze machine learning papers addressing neural network representations. Starting from 27 papers identified through Boolean searches across four databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library), the selection was narrowed to five papers through inclusion criteria focusing on publication date (2005-2025), engagement with representational questions, and substantial theoretical discussion. Each paper was classified using a three-stage decision tree based on structuralist criteria: entity elimination (are entities eliminated or retained?), source of structure (is structure discovered or imposed?), and mode of existence (is mode empirical or mathematical?). This deductive content analysis framework mapped papers to one of four structuralist positions.

## Key Results
- 60% of analyzed papers aligned with structural idealism, treating representations as model-dependent constructions
- Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appeared selectively across papers
- Structural realism was notably absent from all examined papers
- The framework successfully operationalized philosophical concepts for empirical classification in ML literature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing a systematic decision tree that translates complex philosophical positions into observable textual indicators. The three hierarchical criteria create a logical progression that forces researchers to make explicit their ontological commitments. By mapping philosophical positions to specific linguistic markers and argumentative structures, the framework enables reproducible classification of implicit assumptions that typically remain unexamined in technical ML discourse.

## Foundational Learning

**Structuralism in Philosophy of Science**
Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how scientific theories relate to reality through structural relationships rather than direct correspondence.
Quick check: Can identify key structuralist positions (realism, idealism, eliminative, non-eliminative) and their distinguishing features.

**PRISMA Protocol Adaptation**
Why needed: Ensures systematic and reproducible paper selection while maintaining relevance to the research question.
Quick check: Can explain modifications made to standard PRISMA for philosophical content analysis.

**Deductive Content Analysis**
Why needed: Enables systematic classification of philosophical positions using predefined categories rather than emergent themes.
Quick check: Can distinguish between deductive and inductive content analysis approaches and their appropriate applications.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Database Search -> Paper Selection (27→10→5) -> Three-Stage Classification (Entity Elimination → Source of Structure → Mode of Existence) -> Structuralist Position Assignment

**Critical Path**
The most time-intensive and critical component is the three-stage classification process, where subjective interpretation of textual evidence determines final positioning. Each stage requires careful attention to linguistic indicators and argumentative context.

**Design Tradeoffs**
Single-coder approach ensures consistency but limits reliability; small sample size enables depth but restricts generalizability; strict decision tree provides clarity but may oversimplify hybrid positions.

**Failure Signatures**
Classification ambiguity when papers exhibit mixed linguistic indicators across criteria; selection bias if initial search queries miss relevant conceptual clusters; over-reliance on citation metrics may exclude emerging but influential work.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Apply framework to three additional ML papers with clear philosophical commitments to test classification consistency
2. Conduct inter-rater reliability test using the original five papers with multiple coders
3. Map classification results against publication venue to identify disciplinary patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
Can the structuralist decision framework achieve robust inter-rater reliability when applied by multiple independent coders? The current single-coder design limits reproducibility and objectivity, requiring validation through multi-coder studies with statistical reliability measures.

**Open Question 2**
Does the predominance of structural idealism persist when the framework is applied to a statistically significant sample of machine learning literature? The current n=5 sample is too small for statistical inference, necessitating expansion to determine if findings are representative.

**Open Question 3**
Can automated methods, such as fine-tuned language models, accurately perform structuralist classification to enable large-scale analysis? Manual analysis is resource-intensive, and it remains unknown whether NLP models can capture nuanced philosophical distinctions.

**Open Question 4**
Do influential machine learning papers typically adhere to a single structuralist stance, or do they require fuzzy coding to capture hybrid philosophical commitments? The current discrete decision tree may oversimplify complex papers that span multiple positions.

## Limitations

- Small sample size (n=5) limits statistical power and generalizability of findings
- Single-coder approach without inter-rater reliability measures introduces potential classification bias
- Citation-based selection criteria may systematically favor certain research traditions or publication venues

## Confidence

High: The structuralist framework's internal logical consistency and systematic application are methodologically sound
Medium: The empirical finding of structural idealism predominance is supported but requires replication with larger samples
Low: The claim of structural realism's absence requires cautious interpretation due to small sample size and absence of evidence limitations

## Next Checks

1. Conduct inter-rater reliability testing using the same five papers to assess classification consistency across multiple coders
2. Expand the sample size to at least 20 papers and compare philosophical position distributions to test structural idealism predominance
3. Apply the framework to papers from different publication venues to examine disciplinary context influence on philosophical positioning
