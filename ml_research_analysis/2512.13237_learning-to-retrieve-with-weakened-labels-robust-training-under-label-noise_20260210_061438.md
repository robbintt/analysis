# Learning to Retrieve with Weakened Labels: Robust Training under Label Noise

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.13237
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13237
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Label weakening improves retrieval robustness under 50% label noise, achieving 0.812 recall@10 vs 0.641 for cross entropy on MS MARCO.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of training neural retrieval models under label noise, a common issue in real-world datasets where annotations may be erroneous or sparse. The authors propose a label weakening approach that replaces single, potentially corrupted binary relevance labels with ambiguated target sets derived from both observed supervision and model confidence scores. This method allows for a set of plausible labels, reducing the risk of memorizing noisy annotations while maintaining flexibility for the model to disambiguate relevance during training.

The approach was evaluated on four diverse ranking datasets (MS MARCO, LC-QuAD, Mintaka, and AIDA) using two retrieval models (dual bi-encoder and E5) and one re-ranking model (cross-encoder). Experiments simulated label noise at varying ratios (0.0 to 0.5) and compared the label weakening method against 10 state-of-the-art loss functions. Key results showed that label weakening significantly improved performance under high noise conditions, consistently outperforming or matching other robust loss functions across all datasets and models.

## Method Summary
The method involves training neural retrieval models robust to label noise via label weakening—constructing ambiguated target sets that include original labels plus plausibly relevant documents from model confidence. The approach uses four datasets with noise simulated by replacing correct documents with semantically similar non-relevant candidates at ratios {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}. Three architectures are employed: dual bi-encoder (BLINK-based BERT), E5, and cross-encoder. The label weakening method uses confidence threshold β and relaxation α to form R*q = Rq ∪ {d : p(d|q) ≥ β}, optimizing an optimistic superset loss with delayed epoch-level ambiguity updates.

## Key Results
- On MS MARCO with 50% noise, the dual bi-encoder with label weakening achieved a recall@10 of 0.812 compared to 0.641 for cross entropy.
- On LC-QuAD with 50% noise, recall@10 improved from 0.7 to 0.9 with label weakening.
- The method was particularly effective on datasets with higher annotation noise and ambiguity, such as Mintaka.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The label weakening approach works by constructing ambiguated target sets that include both the original labels and additional documents that the model is confident are relevant. This allows the model to learn from a broader set of examples, reducing the risk of overfitting to noisy labels. The optimistic superset loss encourages the model to rank all documents in the ambiguated set highly, while the delayed epoch-level updates prevent the model from reinforcing incorrect labels too quickly.

## Foundational Learning
- **Label Noise:** Incorrect or ambiguous annotations in training data. Why needed: Real-world datasets often contain noisy labels that can degrade model performance.
- **Ambiguited Target Sets:** Sets of documents that include both original labels and additional plausible relevant documents. Why needed: Allows the model to learn from a broader set of examples, reducing the risk of overfitting to noisy labels.
- **Optimistic Superset Loss:** A loss function that encourages the model to rank all documents in the ambiguated set highly. Why needed: Ensures the model learns to rank all plausible relevant documents highly, even if the original labels are noisy.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Data loaders -> Noise injection -> Dual bi-encoder/E5/Cross-encoder -> Label weakening module -> Faiss indexing -> Training loop
- **Critical Path:** The critical path for training involves loading data, injecting noise, computing ambiguated target sets, and updating model parameters using the optimistic superset loss.
- **Design Tradeoffs:** The main tradeoff is between the complexity of the label weakening approach and the potential improvements in robustness to label noise. The approach adds some complexity but can significantly improve performance under high noise conditions.
- **Failure Signatures:** If the model memorizes noisy labels, recall will drop sharply at noise ≥0.3. If there's runaway self-reinforcement, training will diverge.
- **First Experiments:** 1) Implement dual bi-encoder with in-batch negatives and Faiss indexing. 2) Add label weakening module that computes p(d|q) each epoch and forms R*q via threshold β. 3) Train for 10 epochs and evaluate Recall@10 and MRR on MS MARCO with 50% noise.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The specific implementation details of β and α remain unspecified, leaving some ambiguity in reproducing the exact results.
- The lack of detailed hyperparameter settings and noise injection mechanisms is a notable gap.
- The method's effectiveness across a broader range of retrieval architectures is not fully explored.

## Confidence
- **High:** The core claim that label weakening improves robustness to label noise in retrieval tasks is well-supported by empirical evidence across multiple datasets.
- **Medium:** The generality of the approach across architectures is suggested but not fully explored with a limited set of models.
- **Low:** Exact reproducibility is challenging without clarification on β, α, and noise generation details.

## Next Checks
1. Verify the exact values of β and α used in experiments and test their sensitivity by varying them systematically.
2. Implement the semantic-aware noise injection procedure (e.g., using BM25 to find similar non-relevant candidates) to ensure faithful noise simulation.
3. Confirm the delayed epoch-level update mechanism for R*q and test the impact of per-batch vs. epoch-level updates on training stability.
