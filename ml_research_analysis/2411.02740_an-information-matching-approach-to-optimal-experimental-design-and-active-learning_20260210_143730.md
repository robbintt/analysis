# An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2411.02740
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** The information-matching method selects a minimal subset of training data by aligning the Fisher Information Matrix of the training data with that of the target QoIs, achieving target precision with as little as 1-8% of candidate data.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel information-matching approach for optimal experimental design and active learning. The method selects a minimal subset of training data by solving a convex optimization problem that aligns the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) of the training data with that of the target quantities of interest (QoIs). By formulating the problem as a semidefinite program with L1 regularization, the approach identifies sparse solutions that ensure sufficient information to achieve desired prediction precision while bypassing issues with unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters.

The method demonstrates significant efficiency gains across diverse applications including power systems, underwater acoustics, and material science. It consistently achieves target precision using only a small fraction of the candidate data pool, making it particularly valuable for experiments where data acquisition is costly or time-consuming. The approach is theoretically grounded, with guarantees that the propagated uncertainties of the QoIs will be within predefined target uncertainties.

## Method Summary
The information-matching method solves a convex optimization problem that minimizes the L1-norm of data weights subject to the constraint that the Fisher Information Matrix of the selected training data dominates the FIM required for the target QoIs. The core formulation ensures that if the candidate data is sufficiently rich, the optimal solution will identify a minimal subset of data points that provides enough information to constrain only the parameters relevant for the QoIs. The method can be extended to active learning by iteratively updating parameters and retaining the maximum historical weight, ensuring non-decreasing information content across iterations.

## Key Results
- Achieved target precision using only 1-8% of candidate data across three diverse domains (power systems, underwater acoustics, material science)
- Consistently identified sparse solutions with L1 regularization, demonstrating 5% data usage in receiver placement optimization
- Provided theoretical guarantees that prediction uncertainties remain within predefined bounds when the optimization is feasible
- Successfully bypassed issues with unidentifiable parameters by focusing only on parameter combinations relevant to the QoIs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information Matching via Semidefinite Constraints
- **Claim:** If the FIM of the selected training data dominates the FIM required for QoI precision, prediction uncertainty is theoretically bounded.
- **Mechanism:** The method solves a convex optimization problem where the constraint $I(w) \succeq J$ ensures the parameter covariance from the data is smaller than the covariance allowed by the QoI targets.
- **Core assumption:** The model behaves approximately linearly with respect to parameters within the uncertainty region.
- **Evidence anchors:** Theorem 1 states that uncertainties of the QoIs propagated from optimal training data are within predefined target uncertainties.

### Mechanism 2: Sparsity via L1 Regularization
- **Claim:** Minimizing the L1-norm of data weights induces sparsity, identifying a minimal subset of necessary data points.
- **Mechanism:** By minimizing $\|w\|_1$ subject to the information constraint, the convex solver drives weights of redundant candidates to zero.
- **Core assumption:** A sparse solution exists; a small subset of the candidate pool is informative for the QoI.
- **Evidence anchors:** The optimal receiver locations account for only 5% of candidate locations.

### Mechanism 3: Active Learning Convergence via Non-Decreasing Information
- **Claim:** Iteratively updating parameters and retaining maximum historical weight ensures convergence to a feasible dataset.
- **Mechanism:** Algorithm 1 updates the parameter estimate, which changes the local FIM. Taking the element-wise maximum of new and previous weights ensures cumulative information bound remains satisfied.
- **Core assumption:** Initial parameter guess is sufficiently distinct or iterative updates don't oscillate wildly between regions requiring contradictory data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) & Cramér-Rao Bound
  - **Why needed here:** FIM represents the curvature of the likelihood (information) and its inverse bounds the covariance (uncertainty) of parameters.
  - **Quick check question:** If the FIM is singular (determinant is zero), what does that imply about parameter identifiability? (Answer: Infinite variance, unidentifiable).

- **Concept:** Semidefinite Programming (SDP) & Matrix Inequality ($A \succeq B$)
  - **Why needed here:** The core constraint $I \succeq J$ is a matrix inequality meaning the difference $I - J$ must be positive semidefinite.
  - **Quick check question:** Does $I \succeq J$ imply that all elements of matrix $I$ are larger than $J$? (Answer: No, it refers to the quadratic form/eigenvalues).

- **Concept:** Sloppy Models
  - **Why needed here:** The method explicitly targets "sloppy" models where parameters are effectively unidentifiable.
  - **Quick check question:** In a sloppy model, are the eigenvalues of the FIM typically uniform or spread over many orders of magnitude? (Answer: Spread over many orders).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Candidate Generator -> Model & Jacobian Engine -> QoI Definition -> SDP Solver -> Active Loop (Optional)
- **Critical path:** Computing the Jacobian $J_f$ for every candidate in the pool before selection is the most computationally expensive step.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Setting target precision ($\Sigma$) too small increases required data points and may render the problem infeasible
  - Larger candidate pools offer better optimality but increase time to compute FIMs for all candidates
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Infeasibility:** Solver returns "infeasible" - candidate pool lacks diversity to constrain QoI parameters to desired precision
  - **Dense Weights:** Solver assigns non-zero weights to almost all candidates - model is essentially "sloppy" everywhere relevant to the QoI
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Linear Regression Test:** Create a linear model $y = \theta_1 x + \theta_2 x^2$. Set QoI as just the slope $\theta_1$. Verify the method selects data that constrains $\theta_1$ while ignoring $\theta_2$ if unidentifiable.
  2. **PMU Placement (Replication):** Replicate the IEEE 14-bus system example from the Supplementary Material to verify the code produces known sparse sensor locations (Buses 2, 6, 9).
  3. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Run the active learning loop on the MoS2 potential example with different initial parameters to verify final uncertainty remains within bounds regardless of initialization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can the information-matching method be effectively scaled to large machine-learning models, specifically machine-learned interatomic potentials, while maintaining computational efficiency?
  - **Basis:** Authors state future work may extend the method to larger models and machine-learning applications including machine-learned interatomic potentials.
  - **Why unresolved:** Current demonstrations are limited to parametric physics-based models with moderate parameter counts; large neural network potentials involve orders of magnitude more parameters and complex non-linearities.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Application to high-dimensional neural network potentials demonstrating tractable convex optimization and target precision comparable to parametric cases.

- **Open Question 2:** What are the theoretical limiting behaviors of the convex optimization problem (Eq. 4) regarding robustness, particularly in cases of extreme ill-conditioning or near-singularity?
  - **Basis:** Conclusion notes that deeper theoretical analysis of the limiting behavior of the optimization may offer valuable guidance on robustness.
  - **Why unresolved:** While Theorem 1 establishes bounds on covariance, the paper primarily relies on empirical validation without rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence properties or stability limits.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Formal theoretical analysis deriving conditions under which the semidefinite programming solver maintains stability.

- **Open Question 3:** How can candidate datasets be systematically augmented to resolve infeasibility when the initial pool lacks the necessary information to constrain quantities of interest?
  - **Basis:** Authors acknowledge a key limitation that identifying additional data points to achieve feasibility remains an open, problem-dependent question.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current method detects infeasibility but doesn't offer an automated mechanism to determine what new data is required.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of an iterative "data suggestion" protocol that analyzes the null space of the candidate FIM relative to the QoI FIM.

## Limitations

- The method's validity relies heavily on the local linear approximation via the Fisher Information Matrix, which may break down for highly non-linear models or models with strong non-Gaussian uncertainties.
- The computational cost of calculating Jacobians for all candidate data points scales poorly with extremely large candidate pools, though this is mitigated by efficient auto-differentiation.
- A critical limitation is that infeasibility can occur if the candidate data lacks the diversity needed to constrain the target QoIs to the desired precision, which is a model-dependent failure mode not easily diagnosed a priori.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The mechanism of L1-regularized sparsity inducing minimal data selection is a well-established property of convex optimization and is directly observable from the solution.
- **Medium Confidence:** The information-matching guarantee via the matrix inequality constraint is theoretically sound, but its practical efficacy depends on the accuracy of the linear FIM approximation and numerical conditioning.
- **Medium Confidence:** The convergence guarantee of the active learning loop is logically consistent, but the paper's validation across diverse domains doesn't exhaustively test all possible failure modes like phase transitions.

## Next Checks

1. **Linear Model Verification:** Implement a simple linear regression test case to empirically verify that the method selects data constraining only the QoI-relevant parameters while ignoring unidentifiable ones.

2. **Solver Robustness Test:** Systematically test the IEEE 39-bus power system case with intentionally undersampled or biased candidate pools to document the conditions under which the solver returns infeasible solutions.

3. **Numerical Conditioning Study:** For the underwater acoustics case, replicate the Jacobian calculations with varying numerical differentiation step sizes and compare the resulting data selection to assess sensitivity to the "preconditioning" step mentioned in the paper.
