# Multi-Objective Causal Bayesian Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.14755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14755
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Introduces MO-CBO framework that reduces exponential search space to polynomial size via intervention border characterization, showing improved Pareto front diversity and cost-effectiveness compared to non-causal methods

## Executive Summary
This work extends causal Bayesian optimization to multi-objective settings by leveraging known causal structures to identify Pareto-optimal intervention strategies. The key insight is that only a polynomial-sized subset of intervention sets can be possibly optimal, characterized by their "interventional border" property. The proposed CAUSAL PARETO SELECT algorithm decomposes the problem into independent local optimizations and balances exploration using relative hypervolume improvement. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over traditional multi-objective BO, particularly in settings with unobserved confounders.

## Method Summary
The method leverages known causal graphs to reduce the exponential search space over intervention sets to a polynomial-sized subset of "possibly Pareto-optimal minimal intervention sets" via the interventional border characterization. The global MO-CBO problem decomposes into independent local multi-objective problems, each solved with standard MOBO methods (DGEMO). The final solution aggregates and filters local Pareto fronts, with exploration balanced across intervention sets using relative hypervolume improvement (RHVI) as the acquisition function.

## Key Results
- Theoretical framework reduces search space from exponential to polynomial size via intervention border characterization
- Algorithm identifies more diverse and cost-effective solutions compared to traditional non-causal MOBO
- Performance improvements are particularly pronounced in settings with unobserved confounders
- Demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world causal graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Search Space Reduction via Intervention Border
The exponential search space over all intervention sets P(X) can be reduced to a polynomial-sized subset of "possibly Pareto-optimal minimal intervention sets" without losing optimal solutions. The paper defines a "minimal UC-territory" (MUCT) as the minimal set of variables connected to targets via unobserved confounders, and an "interventional border" (IB) as the parents of this territory. Theorem 4.8 proves that an intervention set is possibly Pareto-optimal if and only if it equals its own interventional border—i.e., IB(G_Xs, Y) = X_s.

### Mechanism 2: Local Problem Decomposition with Pareto Aggregation
The global MO-CBO problem decomposes into |S| independent local multi-objective problems, and the causal Pareto front is the Pareto-optimal subset of all local fronts. Proposition 3.4 shows that the causal Pareto front for any collection S is a subset of the union of local Pareto fronts. Each local problem (w.r.t. intervention set X_s) is a standard multi-objective optimization task solvable with existing MOBO methods.

### Mechanism 3: Relative Hypervolume Improvement for Balanced Exploration
Normalizing hypervolume improvement by the current front's hypervolume enables fair comparison across local problems with different scales. RHVI = HVI(μ(X_s, B_s), P_l_f(X_s)) / H(P_l_f(X_s)). At each iteration, the algorithm computes candidate batches for all local problems, then selects the batch with maximum RHVI.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and do-calculus**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework relies on interpreting interventions via do(X_s = x_s), which modifies the graph by removing incoming edges. Understanding c-components and confounding is essential for identifying intervention borders.
  - Quick check question: Given a graph where X → Y and X ← U → Y (U unobserved), what is the effect of do(X = x) vs. conditioning on X = x?

- **Concept: Pareto Optimality and Hypervolume**
  - Why needed here: The goal is finding Pareto-optimal intervention set-value pairs. Hypervolume quantifies front quality; HVI measures improvement from adding new points.
  - Quick check question: If points A = (1, 5) and B = (3, 2) are on the current Pareto front, what is the hypervolume contribution of adding C = (2, 3) relative to a reference point (4, 6)?

- **Concept: Gaussian Process Surrogates in Bayesian Optimization**
  - Why needed here: Each local problem uses independent GPs to model objectives μ_i(X_s, ·). Acquisition functions (via DGEMO) guide sampling.
  - Quick check question: Why might independent GPs be suboptimal when objectives share exogenous noise? What alternative surrogate could capture this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Graph Analyzer -> Local Problem Manager -> Batch Selector -> Intervention Executor -> Global Aggregator

- **Critical path:**
  1. Implement graph traversal for intervention border (Definitions 4.5, 4.6; iterate over power set until IB(G_X_s, Y) = X_s)
  2. Integrate DGEMO for local MOBO; ensure diversity regions are computed per intervention set
  3. Implement RHVI acquisition; handle edge cases (empty fronts, zero hypervolume)
  4. Validate on SYNTHETIC-1 (no confounders) before testing confounded settings

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Independent vs. multi-task GPs: Current design uses independent GPs per local problem—simpler but misses shared information
  - Batch size vs. iteration count: Larger batches explore more per iteration but may waste samples on suboptimal intervention sets early
  - Strict vs. relaxed Pareto filtering: Aggressive filtering yields sparse final fronts; relaxed thresholds retain diversity but include near-dominated solutions

- **Failure signatures:**
  - RHVI collapse: If all local fronts converge quickly, RHVI → 0; algorithm may stall
  - Empty O_{G,Y}: If graph structure yields no valid intervention border sets, fall back to full P(X) search with warning
  - Unobserved confounder misspecification: If true confounders differ from modeled graph, SYNTHETIC-2-style failures occur

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce SYNTHETIC-1 (Figure 3a): No confounders, O_{G,Y} = {{X1, X2}}
  2. Stress test with increasing |X|: Scale to 8+ treatment variables; measure wall-clock time for intervention border computation
  3. Ablate RHVI vs. random local selection: Replace RHVI with uniform random choice; quantify convergence gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can integrating multi-task Gaussian processes into the surrogate model improve sample efficiency by capturing shared information across treatment variables?
- How can the MO-CBO framework be adapted to handle time-dynamic causal models?
- How robust is the CAUSAL PARETO SELECT algorithm to errors or misspecifications in the provided causal graph structure?

## Limitations
- The method assumes the causal graph structure is known and correctly specified
- Independent GP surrogates may miss shared structure across intervention sets
- RHVI acquisition's reliance on hypervolume normalization introduces instability with small local fronts

## Confidence
- High confidence: The search space reduction mechanism (Theorem 4.8) and local problem decomposition (Proposition 3.4) are rigorously proven
- Medium confidence: Empirical validation shows improved GD/IGD metrics but limited to single baseline comparison
- Low confidence: Method's robustness to causal graph misspecification is not tested

## Next Checks
1. Stress test causal structure misspecification: Perturb the known graph and measure performance degradation on SYNTHETIC-2
2. Multi-task GP ablation: Replace independent GPs with a multi-task GP that shares information across intervention sets
3. RHVI stability analysis: Systematically vary local front hypervolumes and measure RHVI selection behavior
