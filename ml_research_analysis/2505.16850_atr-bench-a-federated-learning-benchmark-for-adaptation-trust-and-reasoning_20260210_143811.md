# ATR-Bench: A Federated Learning Benchmark for Adaptation, Trust, and Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.16850
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16850
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** First comprehensive benchmark systematically evaluating federated learning across Adaptation, Trust, and Reasoning dimensions using standardized protocols and eight widely-used datasets.

## Executive Summary
ATR-Bench introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for federated learning that evaluates methods across three critical dimensions: Adaptation (handling data heterogeneity and generalization), Trust (robustness to attacks and fairness), and Reasoning (conceptual framework). The benchmark provides unified evaluation protocols, standard datasets, and open-source assets to enhance reproducibility and comparability across the FL research community. Through systematic experiments across eight datasets, ATR-Bench reveals key insights into the strengths and limitations of existing approaches, highlighting the need for methods that jointly address generalization, robustness, fairness, and reasoning in real-world FL deployments.

## Method Summary
ATR-Bench systematically evaluates Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) across three dimensions using eight standard datasets (CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, Digits, Office-Caltech, PACS, Office31). The benchmark employs standard HFL setup with $M$ clients using SGD (momentum 0.9, weight decay 1e-5), local epochs $U=10$, batch size 64. Adaptation is evaluated through label/domain skew using Dirichlet distribution ($\beta \in \{0.1, 0.5, 1.0\}$), trust through Byzantine/backdoor attacks (Pair/Symmetry Flipping, Random Noise, Min-Sum) and fairness metrics, while reasoning remains conceptual. Key metrics include Adaptation scores ($A_U$, $A_O$), Byzantine robustness ($A_{u}^{Byz}$), Accuracy Decline ($I$), Attack Success Rate ($R$), and Fairness measures (Contribution Match Degree $E$, Performance Deviation $V$).

## Key Results
- ATR-Bench provides first systematic evaluation framework for FL across adaptation, trust, and reasoning dimensions
- Experimental results reveal limitations of existing methods in jointly addressing generalization, robustness, fairness, and reasoning
- Standard protocols and open-source assets enable reproducible and comparable FL research across diverse datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive coverage of real-world FL challenges through standardized protocols that enable fair comparison across methods. By evaluating across eight diverse datasets and three critical dimensions, ATR-Bench captures the multifaceted nature of FL deployment challenges, from data heterogeneity and generalization to security threats and fairness concerns. The unified evaluation framework with well-defined metrics provides clear benchmarks for progress in each dimension.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dirichlet Distribution ($\beta$ parameter)**: Used to create non-IID data partitions across clients, where lower $\beta$ creates more heterogeneous distributions - needed to simulate realistic federated scenarios; quick check: verify class distributions across clients are sufficiently skewed for $\beta < 1.0$
- **Byzantine Attack Models**: Represent malicious clients that send corrupted updates (Pair Flipping, Symmetry Flipping, Random Noise) - needed to evaluate robustness to security threats; quick check: confirm attack success rate increases with attack intensity
- **Leave-One-Out Training**: Required for exact Contribution Match Degree calculation by training $2^M$ subsets - needed for fair contribution evaluation; quick check: verify computational feasibility through approximation methods
- **SGD with Momentum**: Standard optimization with momentum 0.9 and weight decay 1e-5 - needed for stable convergence across diverse datasets; quick check: monitor loss curves for convergence patterns
- **Label Domain Skew Metrics**: Measure performance under different levels of data heterogeneity - needed to evaluate adaptation capabilities; quick check: confirm performance degradation as $\beta$ decreases
- **Fairness Metrics**: Include Contribution Match Degree ($E$) and Performance Deviation ($V$) - needed to ensure equitable treatment of clients; quick check: verify fairness scores correlate with known contribution patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Preprocessing -> Model Training (HFL) -> Attack Injection -> Metric Computation -> Results Aggregation

**Critical Path:** Dataset partitioning (Dirichlet) → Federated training rounds → Attack application (if trust evaluation) → Metric calculation → Benchmark result compilation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Computational feasibility vs. exact fairness evaluation (approximating 2^M Leave-One-Out training), comprehensive dimension coverage vs. experimental complexity, standardization vs. method-specific considerations

**Failure Signatures:** High learning rate divergence (loss spikes/NaNs), empty client datasets (class imbalance in extreme $\beta$ values), computational infeasibility for fairness metrics (runtime explosion), attack detection failure (robustness metrics not improving)

**First Experiments:**
1. Label Skew Adaptation: CIFAR-10 with 10 clients, SimpleCNN, $\beta=0.5$, FedAvg baseline, verify $A_U \approx 67\%$
2. Byzantine Robustness: CIFAR-10 with 20% attackers, Pair Flipping attack, compare DnC vs FedProx using $A_{u}^{Byz}$ and Degradation $I$
3. High Learning Rate Test: CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50, $lr=1e-1$, monitor for divergence within first 5 rounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational infeasibility of exact fairness metrics requiring 2^M training runs
- Handling of extreme non-IID splits that may create empty local datasets
- Stability concerns with high learning rates (1e-1) for deeper architectures like ResNet-50

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Standard dataset selection, baseline experimental results for adaptation and trust metrics, reproducibility protocols
- **Medium confidence:** Completeness of trust evaluation under diverse attack scenarios, fairness metric implementation details
- **Low confidence:** Practical scalability of fairness evaluation, reasoning dimension operationalization

## Next Checks
1. Verify computational tractability of fairness metrics by implementing the Leave-One-Out approximation and measuring runtime scaling
2. Test extreme Dirichlet parameters (β=0.1) to identify failure modes in dataset partitioning and client participation
3. Validate high learning rate configurations (1e-1) across all datasets using learning rate warm-up schedules to prevent divergence
