# Can summarization approximate simplification? A gold standard comparison

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.16181
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16181
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Abstractive summarization achieves ROUGE-L score of 0.654 at paragraph level against gold-standard simplifications

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether abstractive summarization can approximate manual text simplification by comparing automated summarization outputs with gold-standard simplifications from the Newsela corpus. Two BART-based BRIO summarization methods were applied: document-wide and paragraph-by-paragraph processing. The outputs were evaluated against four levels of professional simplification using ROUGE-L scores. Results showed a top ROUGE-L score of 0.654 for paragraph-by-paragraph summarization at level 1, with an average score of 0.566 across all levels. This demonstrates that while summarization does not fully replicate manual simplification, paragraph-by-paragraph summarization can serve as a useful preparatory step for manual annotators. The study highlights the potential for interdisciplinary approaches in text simplification research.

## Method Summary
The researchers applied BRIO, a BART-based summarization model, to the Newsela corpus containing 1,913 English articles with four levels of professional simplification each. Two processing methods were used: document-wide summarization that treats the entire article as one input, and paragraph-by-paragraph summarization that processes each paragraph individually. The resulting summaries were compared against each simplification level using ROUGE-L F1 scores, precision, and recall metrics to measure lexical overlap between automated outputs and human simplifications.

## Key Results
- Paragraph-by-paragraph summarization achieved a top ROUGE-L score of 0.654 against level 1 simplifications
- Average ROUGE-L score across all four levels was 0.566 for paragraph-by-paragraph processing
- Document-wide summarization showed severe precision/recall imbalance (precision ~0.06, recall ~0.9)
- ROUGE-L scores decreased with simplification level, dropping to 0.529 at level 4

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Paragraph-level summarization produces outputs more similar to manual simplification than document-wide summarization.
- Mechanism: Block-by-block iteration preserves structural organization, mimicking how human annotators process texts sequentially rather than reorganizing entire documents at once.
- Core assumption: Manual simplification operates with attention to paragraph-level discourse structure rather than treating the document as an undifferentiated whole.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "top ROUGE-L score of 0.654 for paragraph-by-paragraph summarization at level 1"
  - [section]: "Our hypothesis for the better performance of the paragraph-by-paragraph... lies in the nature of the process: a block-by-block iteration might be more similar to the manually performed annotation than a text-wide transformation is."
  - [corpus]: Limited direct support; neighbor papers focus on evaluation metrics rather than processing granularity.
- Break condition: Source documents lack clear paragraph boundaries, or target simplification requires cross-paragraph content reorganization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Summarization achieves content compression but fails to replicate the lexical and syntactic transformations characteristic of simplification.
- Mechanism: Summarizers optimize for information density with domain-agnostic vocabulary, while simplification requires systematically simpler vocabulary and grammatical structures (short active forms vs. long passive forms).
- Core assumption: The divergence between summarization and simplification stems primarily from vocabulary choice and syntactic complexity, not content selection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "while summarization does not fully replicate manual simplification"
  - [section]: "the structural lexicon and syntactical choices of the simplified version would not appear through document-wide summarification"
  - [corpus]: Related work (Automated Feedback Loops, arXiv:2505.16172) notes simplification algorithms may lose information, suggesting ongoing challenges.
- Break condition: Summarization models are specifically fine-tuned on simple-language corpora, or semantic similarity metrics (not ROUGE-L) are used for evaluation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ROUGE-L captures surface-level lexical overlap but systematically underestimates similarity for semantically equivalent reformulations.
- Mechanism: LCS-based metrics reward exact lexical matches while penalizing valid paraphrases and synonymous substitutions that characterize good simplification.
- Core assumption: Lexically different but semantically equivalent simplifications should be scored as "similar."
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: Comparison achieved "a top ROUGE-L score of 0.654"
  - [section]: "As ROUGE-L cannot measure semantic similarity between instances, all sequences that are semantically correct but lexically different would not compute as 'similar'"
  - [corpus]: REFLEX (arXiv:2511.07458) explicitly addresses limitations of surface-level metrics like ROUGE for summarization evaluation.
- Break condition: Task requires only surface-level verification, or when comparing outputs constrained to identical vocabulary.

## Foundational Learning

- **ROUGE-L (Longest Common Subsequence F1)**:
  - Why needed here: Primary evaluation metric; measures grammatical integrity, keyword conservation, and coherence via longest common subsequence matching.
  - Quick check question: If a summary paraphrases "The cat sat on the mat" as "A feline rested on the rug," would ROUGE-L score this as similar?

- **Abstractive vs. Extractive Summarization**:
  - Why needed here: BRIO is an abstractive model that generates new text rather than selecting passages, which affects the types of divergence from manual simplification.
  - Quick check question: Would an extractive summarizer likely produce higher or lower ROUGE-L scores against simplification targets?

- **Newsela Corpus Structure**:
  - Why needed here: Understanding the 5-level simplification hierarchy (original + levels 1-4, from 12th grade to 3rd grade) is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Why might summarization-simplification overlap decrease at higher simplification levels (level 4)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - Newsela corpus -> BRIO BART model -> Two processing pipelines -> ROUGE-L evaluation

- **Critical path**:
  1. Load original Newsela articles (1,913 documents)
  2. Apply BRIO summarization via chosen method
  3. Compare outputs against 4 simplification levels using ROUGE-L (precision, recall, F1)
  4. Aggregate scores level-wise

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Document-wide: Fast execution (seconds per article) but severe precision/recall imbalance (precision ~0.06, recall ~0.9)
  - Paragraph-by-paragraph: Higher quality (ROUGE-L 0.566 avg) but 10x-50x slower; requires optimization for large-scale use
  - ROUGE-L vs. semantic metrics: Faster computation but misses paraphrase equivalence

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Very high recall (>0.9) with very low precision (<0.1): Indicates document-wide mode generating short outputs that miss structural vocabulary
  - ROUGE-L dropping with simplification level: Expected behavior; higher simplification levels have more lexical divergence
  - Processing time exceeding minutes per article: Paragraph-by-paragraph mode without GPU acceleration

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Run document-wide BRIO on a 10-article subset; verify precision/recall imbalance pattern matches paper (precision ~0.06-0.08, recall ~0.73-0.92).
  2. **Granularity comparison**: Apply both methods to same 10 articles; confirm paragraph-by-paragraph achieves 4-5x higher ROUGE-L scores.
  3. **Metric sensitivity test**: Compute ROUGE-SEM or SARI on paragraph-by-paragraph outputs to assess whether semantic metrics show higher similarity than ROUGE-L suggests (tests the paper's acknowledged limitation).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the use of semantic-aware metrics like ROUGE-SEM or SARI reveal a higher or lower degree of similarity between abstractive summarization and manual simplification than the ROUGE-L scores reported?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state that ROUGE-L cannot measure semantic similarity and suggest that "future work... should implement ulte- rior thorough analyses with more refined metrics, such as ROUGE-SEM or SARI."
- Why unresolved: The current study relied solely on ROUGE-L, which focuses on the Longest Common Subsequence and fails to credit lexically different but semantically correct simplifications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-evaluating the existing BRIO outputs against the Newsela gold standard using SARI (which measures simplicity) and ROUGE-SEM.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the output of abstractive summarization compare to that of dedicated Automated Text Simplification (ATS) algorithms when applied to the same complex input?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors call for a "comparison between manual simplification, automated summarization and automated simplification algorithms" to investigate the intrinsic similarities between the tasks.
- Why unresolved: The study only compared summarization outputs to manual simplifications, without benchmarking against specific ATS systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study applying both BRIO and standard ATS models to the Newsela corpus and evaluating the lexical and syntactic differences.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can optimization procedures be developed to reduce the computational cost of the paragraph-by-paragraph method to make it viable for large-scale application on consumer hardware?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that paragraph-by-paragraph processing took 10x to 50x longer than document-wide processing and states that "investigation into optimization procedures... should also be conducted."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation is computationally expensive and impractical for large datasets without high-performance hardware.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and benchmarking optimized inference techniques (e.g., batch processing) to demonstrate a reduction in processing time per document without loss of summary quality.

## Limitations
- ROUGE-L evaluation may systematically underestimate similarity for valid simplifications using different vocabulary
- Processing time for paragraph-by-paragraph summarization limits practical applicability without optimization
- Results may not generalize across different text domains or genres

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Paragraph-by-paragraph summarization produces higher ROUGE-L scores than document-wide summarization
- **Medium Confidence**: Summarization serves as useful preparatory step for manual annotators
- **Medium Confidence**: ROUGE-L limitations systematically affect similarity measurement

## Next Checks
1. **Semantic metric validation**: Recompute similarity scores using semantic metrics (ROUGE-SEM, BERTScore, or SARI) to determine if these capture additional overlap missed by ROUGE-L.
2. **Cross-domain testing**: Apply the same methodology to simplification corpora from different domains (e.g., Wikipedia Simple English) to assess generalizability.
3. **Annotation quality check**: Have human annotators rate a sample of summarization outputs against manual simplifications to validate whether ROUGE-L scores correlate with perceived quality.
