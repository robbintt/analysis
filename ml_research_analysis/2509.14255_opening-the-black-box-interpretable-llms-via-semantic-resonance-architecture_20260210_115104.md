# Opening the Black Box: Interpretable LLMs via Semantic Resonance Architecture

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14255
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14255
- Authors: Ivan Ternovtsii
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: SRA achieves 13.41 validation perplexity on WikiText-103, outperforming dense baseline (14.13) and Standard MoE (13.53) with matched active parameters (29.0M)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the interpretability problem in large language models, particularly in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures where learned gating functions remain opaque. The proposed Semantic Resonance Architecture (SRA) replaces learned gating with a Chamber of Semantic Resonance (CSR) module that routes tokens based on cosine similarity with trainable semantic anchors. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that SRA achieves superior performance (13.41 validation perplexity) while developing distinct, semantically coherent specialization patterns and dramatically reducing dead expert rates from 14.8% to 1.0%.

## Method Summary
SRA replaces learned gating functions with a Chamber of Semantic Resonance (CSR) that routes tokens based on cosine similarity with trainable semantic anchors. Each token is routed to the expert with the highest similarity score between its embedding and the expert's semantic anchor. A novel Dispersion Loss encourages orthogonality among anchors to enforce diverse specialization. The architecture maintains the same number of experts and parameters as standard MoE but replaces the learned gating mechanism with this semantically-driven routing approach. During training, anchors are updated through backpropagation along with expert parameters.

## Key Results
- SRA achieves validation perplexity of 13.41 on WikiText-103, outperforming dense baseline (14.13) and Standard MoE (13.53)
- Expert utilization improves significantly with only 1.0% dead experts compared to 14.8% in standard MoE
- The architecture maintains matched active parameters (29.0M) while achieving superior performance
- Semantic routing provides inherent interpretability through similarity scores between tokens and anchors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SRA works by replacing opaque learned gating functions with explicit semantic similarity matching. Instead of having experts compete through learned gates, each token is routed to the expert whose semantic anchor is most similar according to cosine distance. This creates a direct, interpretable relationship between tokens and experts based on their semantic content. The Dispersion Loss further encourages anchors to represent distinct semantic concepts by penalizing similarity between different anchors, forcing experts to develop specialized semantic representations rather than overlapping capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

**Cosine Similarity**: Measures angular distance between vectors, used here to determine semantic alignment between tokens and expert anchors. Needed to create interpretable routing decisions based on semantic content rather than learned weights. Quick check: Verify cosine similarity produces values in [-1, 1] range and correctly identifies semantically similar pairs.

**Mixture-of-Experts Architecture**: Framework where different experts handle different types of input, with gating functions determining routing. Needed as the baseline architecture being improved for interpretability. Quick check: Confirm that gating functions sum to 1 across experts for each token.

**Orthogonality and Dispersion**: Mathematical property encouraging vectors to be perpendicular, used to enforce diverse expert specialization. Needed to prevent experts from learning redundant capabilities. Quick check: Verify that dispersion loss increases when expert anchors become more similar.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Embeddings -> CSR Module (Cosine Similarity + Argmax) -> Expert Selection -> Dense Feed-Forward Layer -> Output

**Critical Path**: Token embedding → Cosine similarity computation with all anchors → Argmax routing decision → Selected expert processing → Output combination

**Design Tradeoffs**: Explicit semantic routing sacrifices some potential routing flexibility for interpretability gains. The cosine similarity approach may miss complex semantic relationships that learned gates could capture, but provides transparent decision-making.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor semantic anchor initialization could lead to suboptimal routing; insufficient dispersion loss weight might result in overlapping expert specializations; cosine similarity might not capture all relevant semantic relationships.

**First Experiments**:
1. Initialize with random semantic anchors and monitor early routing patterns
2. Test with varying dispersion loss weights to find optimal specialization balance
3. Compare routing decisions between learned gates and cosine similarity on sample tokens

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is constrained to a single dataset (WikiText-103) with only 29.0M active parameters, making scalability unclear
- Lack of qualitative analysis of whether semantic anchors capture meaningful semantic distinctions versus arbitrary patterns
- No demonstration that interpretable routing translates to better downstream task performance

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in quantitative performance claims (perplexity and expert utilization metrics)
- **Medium** confidence in interpretability claims (routing decisions are explainable but semantic value unproven)
- **Low** confidence in generalization claims (single dataset, single model size tested)

## Next Checks
1. Test SRA on multiple datasets (e.g., C4, OpenWebText) to verify consistent performance improvements across domains
2. Conduct human evaluation studies where annotators assess whether semantic anchors correspond to meaningful linguistic categories
3. Evaluate SRA's downstream task performance on benchmarks like GLUE or SuperGLUE to determine if interpretable routing translates to better task performance
