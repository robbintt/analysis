# TOGA: Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.09445
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09445
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Achieves state-of-the-art performance on grounded QA (NExT-GQA) and open-ended QA (MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA) benchmarks with mIoU of 24.4 and Acc@GQA of 24.6 on NExT-GQA.

## Executive Summary
TOGA introduces a vision-language model for open-ended video question answering with temporal grounding under weak supervision. The method jointly generates answers and temporal spans using multi-scale video features and an LLM decoder, trained with pseudo labels derived through consistency constraints. By leveraging a three-stage training pipeline that includes vision-text alignment, instruction tuning with pseudo-labels, and consistency constraint filtering, TOGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both grounded QA and open-ended QA benchmarks.

## Method Summary
TOGA uses a three-stage training pipeline: (1) Stage 1 trains a Multi-Scale Vision-Language Connector (MS-VLC) to align video features with text embeddings on VideoChatGPT data, (2) Stage 2 generates pseudo temporal labels by cropping video segments, generating descriptions with the stage-1 model, and creating consistency-filtered QA pairs, and (3) Stage 3 adds a consistency constraint during instruction tuning with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The model processes videos at 16 frames (dense) and 4 frames (sparse) resolution, predicting temporal spans as integer tokens in the [0, 100] range. This approach enables training without ground-truth temporal annotations while achieving strong performance on grounded and open-ended video QA tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves mIoU of 24.4 and Acc@GQA of 24.6 on NExT-GQA benchmark
- Accuracy scores of 73.8% and 52.0% on MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA respectively
- Multi-scale temporal representation outperforms single-scale models
- Consistency constraint filtering provides significant performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Joint Answer-Grounding Dependency
By training a single LLM decoder to output `Answer [start, end]` in one sequence, TOGA captures the correlation between the answer's semantic content and the duration/location of the visual evidence via cross-attention. This joint generation is superior to independent prediction because the validity of an answer is intrinsically tied to the temporal extent of the visual evidence. The core assumption is that answers and their corresponding temporal segments are semantically linked, and independent decoders sever this dependency.

### Mechanism 2: Consistency-Filtered Pseudo-Labeling
The model generates candidate pseudo-labels and verifies them through a bi-directional consistency check: if the generated segment $[t_1, t_2]$ answers the question "What happens in $[t_1, t_2]$?" with the same semantic content. This ensures that correct temporal grounding and its corresponding description are consistent, while hallucinated or noisy segments fail this cycle. The core assumption is that a correct temporal grounding and its description are bi-directionally consistent.

### Mechanism 3: Discrete Multi-Scale Temporal Tokens
TOGA discretizes time into integer tokens $[0, 100]$ and processes video at multiple frame rates, enabling better temporal reasoning than continuous regression or single-scale features. The MS-VLC captures high-frequency motion (dense scale) and long-term context (sparse scale), while the LLM predicts time as text tokens leveraging its token-generation strength. The core assumption is that LLMs are better at generating discrete integer tokens than continuous floating-point values for temporal representation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Weakly Supervised Learning**
  - **Why needed here:** The model must learn to localize events in time without ground-truth timestamps. Understanding how pseudo-labels bridge the gap between video-text pairs and temporal grounding is the core challenge.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a simple video-description pair is insufficient for training a grounding model, and how TOGA generates the missing temporal signal?

- **Concept: Instruction Tuning**
  - **Why needed here:** TOGA relies on prompt engineering to force the LLM to output specific formats (e.g., `Answer [start, end]`). The model must "learn" these formats from the prompt structure.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to the grounding output if the system prompt is removed or changed to a generic "Describe the video" prompt?

- **Concept: Temporal Representation in LLMs**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard LLMs are not natively calibrated for time. TOGA maps video time to the range [0, 100]. Understanding this quantization is vital for interpreting outputs.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the paper claim integer tokens [0, 100] are superior to floating-point tokens [0.0, 1.0] for this specific architecture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** CLIP-ViT-Large (frozen vision encoder) -> MS-VLC (trainable connector with RegNet + 3D conv) -> Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (LLM decoder)

- **Critical path:** The MS-VLC alignment is the bottleneck. If the sparse/dense features are not properly aligned to the text embedding space in Stage 1, the pseudo-label generation in Stage 2 will be garbage, making the consistency filtering in Stage 3 useless.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Frame Count: (16, 4) was selected over (32, 8). Higher frames increased training time 3x for lower mIoU (21.5 vs 24.4), likely due to spurious features.
  - Temporal Format: Discrete integers chosen over floats.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Hallucinated Grounding: Model outputs correct answer but timestamps are [0, 100] (full video). This suggests the consistency filter failed or the model reverts to global context.
  - Format Breakdown: Model answers the question but omits `[start, end]`. Check prompt adherence or instruction tuning weights.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Overfit Single Video: Take one video with known ground truth. Train/Run TOGA to verify it can output the format `Answer [t1, t2]` correctly before scaling.
  2. Ablate MS-VLC: Run inference using only the dense connector vs. only the sparse connector. Verify the hypothesis that dense fails on long events and sparse fails on short events (Table 4).
  3. Pseudo-Label Inspection: Before full training, manually inspect the pseudo-labels generated in Stage 2. If the "referring" question consistency check doesn't filter out obviously wrong segments, the Stage 1 alignment is broken.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the model be extended to handle evidence distributed across multiple, disjoint temporal intervals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We consider one grounding interval for each answer. Thus, we cannot handle cases where the evidence for an answer is distributed across multiple intervals."
- Why unresolved: The current output format `Answer [start, end]` and architecture strictly enforce the prediction of a single continuous segment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modification of the output structure to support multiple segments and validation on a dataset containing multi-interval ground truth annotations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does modeling temporal dependencies between sequential questions within the same video improve grounding accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We also answer all questions for a video independently. However, capturing the temporal dependencies between the answers could help generate more accurate answers with groundings."
- Why unresolved: The current inference strategy processes each question in isolation without a memory mechanism for previous Q/A pairs, limiting reasoning for "before/after" clauses.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis on the NExT-GQA benchmark between the current independent model and a context-aware variant that processes questions sequentially.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the evaluation against the specific biases or "leniency" of the judge LLM?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The supplementary material notes Llama 3.1 yields higher scores than GPT-3.5 due to being "more lenient," suggesting the metric may lack consistency.
- Why unresolved: The paper relies entirely on LLM-based evaluation for open-ended QA without correlating these scores with human judgments or ground-truth semantic equivalence.
- What evidence would resolve it: A correlation study between human annotator scores and various LLM judges (GPT vs. Llama) on the same set of open-ended predictions.

## Limitations

- Dependency on high-quality pseudo-label generation for weak supervision, where poor initial vision-text alignment degrades the entire training pipeline
- Temporal discretization to [0, 100] range may introduce quantization errors for very short events (<1 second) or extremely long videos (>100 seconds)
- Assumption that answer-grounding dependency is consistent across all question types, which may not hold for abstract or purely linguistic questions

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Joint answer-grounding dependency improves performance over independent prediction
- Multi-scale temporal representation outperforms single-scale
- Consistency filtering provides significant gains (mIoU 24.4 vs 12.1 without it)

**Medium Confidence:**
- Integer temporal representation is superior to floating-point (only one ablation shown)
- Weak supervision approach matches or exceeds fully supervised methods
- MS-VLC architecture details (specific RegNet configurations not fully specified)

**Low Confidence:**
- Generalizability to videos outside the [0, 100] second range
- Performance on videos with rapid scene changes or complex temporal dependencies

## Next Checks

1. **Pseudo-Label Quality Audit:** Manually inspect 50 randomly sampled pseudo-labels generated in Stage 2. Calculate the percentage that pass visual inspection for temporal accuracy and semantic consistency. If >20% are clearly incorrect, the consistency constraint may be insufficient.

2. **Temporal Resolution Sensitivity Test:** Evaluate TOGA on a subset of NExT-GQA videos with ground truth timestamps at 0.1s resolution. Compare mIoU performance when using [0, 100] integer representation versus [0.0, 1.0] float representation. This validates whether integer discretization is truly superior or if the [0, 1] range simply requires more training data.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization:** Test TOGA on a held-out domain (e.g., instructional cooking videos or sports highlights) not represented in any training data. Measure performance degradation relative to in-domain NExT-GQA performance. This reveals whether the model learns generalizable temporal grounding or overfits to the specific video characteristics in the training set.
