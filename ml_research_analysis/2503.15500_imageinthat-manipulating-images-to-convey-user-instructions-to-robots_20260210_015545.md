# ImageInThat: Manipulating Images to Convey User Instructions to Robots

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.15500
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15500
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Users completed robot instruction tasks 64.8% faster using ImageInThat compared to text-based methods

## Executive Summary
ImageInThat introduces a novel paradigm for instructing robots through direct manipulation of images. The system provides a timeline-style interface where users can manipulate objects and fixtures in images, add instructions in natural language, and automatically generate captions. A user study demonstrated that participants were significantly faster (64.8% less time) using ImageInThat compared to a text-based method for kitchen manipulation tasks, with fewer errors and higher confidence in instruction clarity.

## Method Summary
ImageInThat combines direct image manipulation with a timeline interface to create robot instructions. Users can manipulate objects in images, add instructions using natural language, and benefit from automatic captioning and goal prediction. The system uses large language models to translate image-based instructions into robot actions. A user study compared ImageInThat against a text-based method across four kitchen manipulation tasks with 12 participants, measuring task completion time, error rates, and user preferences.

## Key Results
- Participants completed instruction tasks 64.8% faster using ImageInThat versus text-based methods
- ImageInThat resulted in fewer errors, particularly missing steps, compared to text-based approach
- Participants preferred ImageInThat and felt more confident their instructions would be understood by robots

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ImageInThat leverages the natural human ability to understand spatial relationships and object manipulations through visual representation. By allowing users to directly manipulate images rather than describe actions textually, the system reduces cognitive load and ambiguity in instruction communication. The timeline interface provides clear sequencing, while visual highlighting and automatic captioning ensure instructions are comprehensive and unambiguous.

## Foundational Learning
- Image manipulation interfaces: Understanding visual programming paradigms that reduce cognitive load in instruction design
- Timeline-based instruction sequencing: Learning how temporal organization affects instruction clarity and execution accuracy
- LLM-based instruction translation: Grasping the capabilities and limitations of large language models in converting human instructions to robot-executable code
- User preference measurement: Understanding methodologies for evaluating human-computer interaction systems
- Error analysis in instruction giving: Learning how different instruction paradigms affect the types and frequency of errors

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: ImageInThat -> LLM Translation -> Robot Execution

Critical path: User manipulation of images → Timeline ordering → Caption generation → LLM instruction parsing → Robot action execution

Design tradeoffs: Visual interface provides intuitive manipulation but requires image generation capabilities; LLM translation offers flexibility but introduces potential reliability issues

Failure signatures: 
- Image manipulation errors leading to incorrect robot actions
- Timeline sequencing mistakes causing execution order problems
- LLM translation failures resulting in unexecutable or incorrect instructions
- Visual interface limitations for complex or abstract tasks

Three first experiments:
1. Test system with increasingly complex kitchen tasks to establish capability boundaries
2. Compare instruction accuracy between image manipulation and text description for identical tasks
3. Evaluate system performance across different robot platforms and environmental conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- User study limited to 12 participants and only four kitchen manipulation tasks, limiting generalizability
- Comparison limited to a single text-based baseline without evaluation against other instruction paradigms
- Heavy reliance on large language models introduces potential reliability concerns and domain dependencies
- No evaluation of accessibility for users with visual impairments or those less comfortable with image-based interfaces

## Confidence
- High confidence: 64.8% faster task completion with ImageInThat is well-supported by experimental data
- Medium confidence: User preference data and confidence ratings show clear trends but are based on small sample size
- Medium confidence: LLM-based translation demonstration is promising but requires more rigorous validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale user study (N≥50) with diverse task types across multiple domains (manufacturing, healthcare, service robotics) to assess generalizability
2. Compare ImageInThat against additional instruction paradigms including voice commands, gesture-based systems, and mixed-reality interfaces to establish relative effectiveness
3. Perform systematic evaluation of the LLM-based translation pipeline, including failure case analysis, domain adaptation testing, and real-world robot execution trials with error recovery scenarios
