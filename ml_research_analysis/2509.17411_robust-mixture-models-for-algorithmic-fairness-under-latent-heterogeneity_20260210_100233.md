# Robust Mixture Models for Algorithmic Fairness Under Latent Heterogeneity

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.17411
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17411
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: ROME framework improves worst-group performance by 2-13% across three real-world datasets while discovering latent subgroups without requiring predefined labels

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses algorithmic fairness challenges when minority subgroups are latent and heterogeneous, particularly when disparities involve complex interactions among both continuous and discrete features. The authors propose ROME (RObust Mixture Ensemble), a framework that discovers latent group structure while optimizing for worst-group performance. ROME uses sensitive attributes to assign instances to latent groups but constrains prediction models to use only non-sensitive features, ensuring fairness. The method incorporates distributionally robust optimization to improve worst-case performance across discovered groups, making it practical when sources of disparities are unknown or evolving.

## Method Summary
ROME employs two complementary approaches: an EM algorithm for linear models and a neural Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for nonlinear settings. The framework learns latent groups using sensitive attributes for group assignment while constraining experts to use only non-sensitive features for prediction. This ensures fairness by preventing direct use of sensitive attributes in the prediction models. The method incorporates distributionally robust optimization to improve worst-case performance across discovered groups. For linear settings, ROME-EM provides interpretable parameter recovery with closed-form updates, while ROME-MoE handles complex nonlinear relationships through adaptive gating networks that route instances to appropriate experts based on learned latent group membership.

## Key Results
- ROME-EM achieved a 10.58% reduction in worst-group MSE compared to pooled regression while maintaining accurate parameter recovery in simulation studies
- On three real-world datasets, ROME-MoE variants significantly improved worst-group performance (p<0.001) with improvements ranging from 2-13% depending on dataset and metric
- The method maintained competitive overall accuracy while achieving worst-group improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of latent group discovery without predefined labels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ROME addresses the fundamental challenge of algorithmic fairness when subgroup membership is unknown by simultaneously discovering latent group structure and optimizing for worst-case performance. The key mechanism is separating group assignment (using sensitive attributes) from prediction (using only non-sensitive features), which ensures fairness while still leveraging subgroup information for optimization. The distributionally robust optimization framework explicitly targets worst-group performance by optimizing over a Wasserstein ball around the empirical distribution, making the model robust to underrepresented subgroups.

## Foundational Learning
- **Latent class models**: Mixture models where group membership is not directly observed but must be inferred from data
  - *Why needed*: Real-world fairness disparities often exist in hidden subgroups that are not explicitly labeled
  - *Quick check*: Verify that EM algorithm converges and produces meaningful latent group assignments
- **Distributionally robust optimization**: Optimization framework that considers worst-case performance over a family of distributions
  - *Why needed*: Standard empirical risk minimization can ignore minority subgroups that have disproportionate impact on fairness
  - *Quick check*: Confirm that Wasserstein ball radius selection meaningfully affects worst-group performance
- **Mixture-of-Experts architecture**: Ensemble method where different models (experts) are trained for different subsets of the data
  - *Why needed*: Different subgroups may have distinct relationship patterns between features and outcomes
  - *Quick check*: Evaluate whether experts learn meaningfully different prediction patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data -> Sensitive Attribute Processing -> Latent Group Assignment -> Non-sensitive Feature Processing -> Expert Models -> Aggregation -> Predictions

**Critical Path**: The most important sequence is Sensitive Attribute Processing -> Latent Group Assignment -> Expert Models, as this enables the fairness-preserving discovery of subgroup structure while maintaining predictive performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity (mixture models are more expensive than single models) for improved fairness and subgroup discovery. The separation of sensitive attributes for assignment versus non-sensitive features for prediction ensures fairness but may limit predictive power if sensitive features contain predictive signal about the outcome.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor latent group discovery (groups that don't correspond to meaningful subgroups), sensitivity to Wasserstein ball radius selection, computational intractability for high-dimensional data, and potential overfitting when the number of latent groups is too large relative to sample size.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run ROME-EM on a simple simulated dataset with known subgroups to verify parameter recovery and group assignment accuracy
2. Compare ROME-MoE performance across different Wasserstein ball radii to identify optimal robustness-accuracy tradeoff
3. Evaluate computational scaling by running ROME on datasets with increasing numbers of features to assess high-dimensional performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on synthetic data and three real-world datasets, which may not capture full complexity of real-world fairness challenges
- Performance improvements show varying magnitudes across datasets (2-13%), suggesting potential sensitivity to data characteristics or implementation details
- The method assumes knowledge of sensitive attributes for group discovery while prohibiting their use in prediction, which may not always be practical or optimal

## Confidence
- **High**: Worst-group performance improvements (supported by multiple datasets and statistical significance)
- **Medium**: Parameter recovery in simulations (limited to linear settings)
- **Low-Medium**: Practical applicability given small number of real-world datasets tested

## Next Checks
1. Test scalability on high-dimensional datasets with hundreds of features to assess computational feasibility
2. Evaluate sensitivity to Wasserstein ball radius selection through systematic parameter sweeps
3. Apply the method to additional real-world fairness benchmarks with known subgroup disparities to verify robustness across domains
