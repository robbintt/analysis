# Adapting LLMs to Time Series Forecasting via Temporal Heterogeneity Modeling and Semantic Alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.07195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07195
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TALON achieves up to 11% improvement in mean squared error on seven real-world benchmarks

## Executive Summary
TALON addresses the challenge of adapting large language models to time series forecasting by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment. The method partitions multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments and dynamically routes each to specialized experts, enabling localized modeling of diverse temporal patterns. A Semantic Alignment Module then aligns continuous time series features with LLM-compatible representations via contrastive learning, eliminating the need for handcrafted prompts during inference. Evaluated on seven real-world benchmarks, TALON consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
TALON adapts large language models for time series forecasting through two key innovations: temporal heterogeneity modeling and semantic alignment. The framework partitions multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments based on their temporal patterns, then routes each segment to specialized experts for localized modeling. The Semantic Alignment Module bridges the gap between continuous time series features and LLM-compatible representations using contrastive learning techniques. This approach eliminates the need for handcrafted prompts during inference while maintaining strong forecasting performance. The method demonstrates effectiveness across seven real-world benchmarks, showing significant improvements over existing approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 11% improvement in mean squared error compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- Demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization capabilities
- Shows robust performance across different LLM backbones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TALON works by addressing the fundamental mismatch between continuous time series data and discrete LLM representations. The temporal heterogeneity modeling captures diverse patterns within multivariate series through segment-wise processing, allowing specialized treatment of different temporal dynamics. The semantic alignment module then creates a bridge between these heterogeneous temporal patterns and LLM-compatible representations through contrastive learning, enabling the model to leverage pre-trained LLM knowledge without requiring manual prompt engineering.

## Foundational Learning
- Temporal heterogeneity: Different segments of time series exhibit distinct temporal patterns that require specialized modeling approaches
- Why needed: Standard monolithic models struggle to capture diverse temporal dynamics in multivariate series
- Quick check: Verify that segment partitioning captures meaningful temporal patterns through visualization

- Contrastive learning: A technique for learning representations by contrasting similar and dissimilar pairs
- Why needed: Enables alignment between continuous time series features and discrete LLM representations
- Quick check: Ensure learned representations show clear separation between different temporal patterns

- Expert routing: Dynamic assignment of data segments to specialized models based on their characteristics
- Why needed: Allows localized modeling of diverse temporal patterns rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all approach
- Quick check: Validate that routing decisions correlate with temporal pattern similarity

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Time Series Data -> Temporal Segmentation -> Expert Routing -> Semantic Alignment Module -> LLM Backbone -> Forecast Output

Critical path: The core processing pipeline follows Time Series Data through Temporal Segmentation to Expert Routing, then through the Semantic Alignment Module to the LLM Backbone for final forecasting. The Semantic Alignment Module is critical as it bridges the gap between time series features and LLM representations.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational complexity (multiple experts and segmentation) for improved modeling of heterogeneous temporal patterns. The choice of segmentation granularity and number of experts represents a key hyperparameter that affects both performance and efficiency.

Failure signatures: Poor segmentation quality leads to inappropriate expert routing and degraded performance. Insufficient alignment between time series features and LLM representations results in suboptimal utilization of pre-trained LLM knowledge. Over-segmentation can lead to insufficient data per segment for effective expert training.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate segmentation quality by visualizing temporal pattern clusters and expert assignment distributions
2. Test contrastive learning effectiveness by measuring representation similarity between aligned and unaligned feature spaces
3. Benchmark expert routing accuracy by measuring performance gains from specialized versus generic modeling approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Performance consistency across all seven benchmarks lacks statistical significance testing with confidence intervals
- Semantic Alignment Module contribution is not thoroughly isolated through ablation studies
- Limited experimental evidence for claimed robustness across different LLM backbones

## Confidence
- Consistency of performance improvements: Medium
- Effectiveness of Semantic Alignment Module: Medium
- Robustness across LLM backbones: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) across all benchmark datasets to verify the consistency of TALON's performance improvements over baselines, reporting confidence intervals for the reported MSE reductions.

2. Perform an ablation study specifically isolating the contribution of the Semantic Alignment Module by comparing full TALON against variants without this component across multiple datasets and forecasting horizons.

3. Evaluate TALON's performance across at least three different LLM backbones (e.g., GPT-3.5, LLaMA, and BERT-based models) using the same time series datasets to quantify the claimed robustness and flexibility in real-world deployment scenarios.
