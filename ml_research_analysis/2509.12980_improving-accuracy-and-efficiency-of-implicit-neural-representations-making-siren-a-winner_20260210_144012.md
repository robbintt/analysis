# Improving Accuracy and Efficiency of Implicit Neural Representations: Making SIREN a WINNER

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.12980
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12980
- Authors: Hemanth Chandravamsi; Dhanush V. Shenoy; Steven H. Frankel

- One-line primary result: WINNER initialization achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting with PSNR gains up to 62.7 dB and significant improvements in image reconstruction (up to 69% gains).

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the spectral bottleneck problem in SIRENs—a failure mode where networks collapse to near-zero outputs when fitting signals with high-frequency content misaligned with their pre-activation spectra. The authors propose WINNER, a target-aware initialization scheme that perturbs uniformly initialized SIREN weights with Gaussian noise. The noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal, broadening frequency support without adding trainable parameters. Experiments show WINNER achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting with PSNR gains up to 62.7 dB, significant improvements in image reconstruction (up to 69% gains), and better 3D shape fitting and denoising performance compared to baseline SIREN and other INR methods.

## Method Summary
WINNER perturbs uniformly initialized SIREN weights W^(l) with Gaussian noise η^(l) ~ N(0, s/ω₀) for layers 1–2 only. Noise scales are calculated using spectral centroid ψ of the target signal: s₀ = s_max₀ × (1 - e^(-aψ/C)) and s₁ = b × (ψ/C), with modality-specific hyperparameters [3500, 5, 3] for audio and [50, 5, 0.4] for images. The method increases pre-activation standard deviation from 1 to √(1 + ds²/2), broadening frequency support to match target spectral content while maintaining parameter efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting with PSNR gains up to 62.7 dB compared to baseline SIREN
- Significant image reconstruction improvements up to 69% gains in PSNR
- Better 3D shape fitting and denoising performance across multiple tasks
- Effectively mitigates spectral bias while preserving fine details

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spectral Bottleneck from Pre-activation Mismatch
When target high-frequency content dominates, gradient updates fail to affect high-frequency output components; this acts as a bottleneck that suppresses all frequency learning, not just out-of-band frequencies. The spectral content of pre-activations at initialization constrains what frequencies gradients can effectively modify during training.

### Mechanism 2: Noise-Induced Pre-activation Variance Expansion
Adding Gaussian noise to uniformly initialized weights increases pre-activation standard deviation from 1 to √(1 + ds²/2), broadening frequency support without adding parameters. Noise perturbation modifies pre-activation distributions, reducing low-frequency energy while increasing high-frequency sensitivity to parameter updates.

### Mechanism 3: Spectral Centroid as Target-Aware Noise Scale Predictor
Higher spectral centroid (more high-frequency content) triggers larger s₀ via saturating exponential and larger s₁ via linear scaling, adapting initialization to target spectral profile. Spectral centroid captures sufficient information about target frequency distribution to guide noise scale selection.

## Foundational Learning

- **Spectral Bias in Neural Networks**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why standard networks fail at high-frequency fitting is prerequisite to appreciating why SIRENs and WINNER are necessary.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why ReLU networks preferentially learn low frequencies before high frequencies?

- **SIREN Initialization (ω₀-scaling)**
  - Why needed here: WINNER builds on and modifies the standard SIREN uniform initialization scheme; understanding the baseline is essential.
  - Quick check question: What distribution are standard SIREN weights drawn from, and what role does ω₀ play in maintaining stable pre-activation variance?

- **Power Spectral Density of Pre-activations**
  - Why needed here: The paper diagnoses spectral bottleneck by analyzing PSD across layers; readers must understand this spectral analysis technique.
  - Quick check question: How would you compute and interpret the cumulative PSD of pre-activations to diagnose frequency support limitations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input layer → Layers 1-2 (noise-perturbed weights) → Layers 3-L (standard SIREN) → Output layer (linear)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Compute spectral centroid ψ of target signal
  2. Calculate s₀, s₁ using equations (3) with modality-appropriate hyperparameters
  3. Initialize weights uniformly per standard SIREN
  4. Sample noise ηjk ~ N(0, s/ω₀) for layers 1-2 only
  5. Perturb: W(l) ← W(l) + η(l) for l ∈ {1, 2}
  6. Train normally with gradient descent

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Larger s₀, s₁ → better high-frequency fitting but risk of low-frequency degradation
  - Noise only in layers 1-2 → limited parameter overhead vs. potentially suboptimal spectral broadening
  - Fixed hyperparameters per modality → simplicity vs. potential suboptimality for novel signal types

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Near-zero output with near-zero PSNR: Spectral bottleneck; s₀, s₁ too small for target frequency content
  - Good high-frequency but poor low-frequency PSNR: Overshooting noise scales; reduce s₀
  - Training instability/gradient explosion: s₀ or s₁ excessively large relative to ω₀

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce spectral bottleneck: Train standard SIREN on tetris.wav vs. bach.wav; observe PSNR collapse for high-frequency target
  2. Ablate noise scale: Fix s₁=2, sweep s₀ ∈ {0, 1000, 2000, 4000} on tetris.wav; verify PSNR improvement and identify optimal range
  3. Cross-modality transfer test: Apply audio hyperparameters [3500, 5, 3] to an image task; observe performance degradation vs. image-specific [50, 5, 0.4]

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can WINNER initialization be effectively extended to other INR architectures beyond SIREN, such as WIRE, Gauss, or ReLU-MLPs with positional encodings?
- Basis in paper: "Future work includes extending WINNER to other INR architectures and tasks" (Section 4, p.4)
- Why unresolved: WINNER's theoretical justification relies on properties of sinusoidal activations and their pre-activation spectra; it is unclear whether Gaussian noise perturbation on uniformly initialized weights generalizes to architectures with different activation functions or initialization schemes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments applying WINNER-style noise perturbation to WIRE, Gauss, and ReLU-PE networks across audio and image fitting tasks, with analysis of whether spectral-centroid-based noise scaling remains beneficial.

### Open Question 2
Can more robust, generalized methods be developed for automatically estimating optimal noise scales s₀ and s₁ without domain-specific hyperparameter tuning?
- Basis in paper: "Future work includes... developing more robust, generalized methods for estimating the noise scales s₀ and s₁" (Section 4, p.4)
- Why unresolved: Current hyperparameters ([3500, 5, 3] for audio, [50, 5, 0.4] for images) require manual selection; although Figure 3 shows robustness across a range, optimal values still depend on task type.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical derivation or data-driven algorithm that automatically computes s₀, s₁ from signal properties, validated across audio, images, and 3D data without requiring task-specific tuning.

### Open Question 3
How can WINNER be modified to prevent under-representation of low-frequency content while maintaining improved high-frequency fitting?
- Basis in paper: Table 1 shows SIREN2 underperforms on bach.wav (60.5 dB) compared to FINER (64.5 dB), with the paper noting "it can under-represent low-frequency content... depending on the choice of s₀ and s₁" (Appendix A.2, p.7)
- Why unresolved: WINNER broadens frequency support toward high frequencies via noise perturbation, but this may reduce sensitivity to low-frequency components; no adaptive mechanism currently balances both.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a hybrid or adaptive noise scheme that preserves low-frequency accuracy (matching or exceeding FINER on signals like bach.wav) while retaining high-frequency gains.

## Limitations
- Spectral centroid formula's universality across diverse signal types remains unproven
- Noise-only-in-first-two-layers design choice lacks theoretical justification for optimality
- Hyperparameter tuning appears manual and task-specific, suggesting limited generalizability

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The existence of spectral bottleneck and WINNER's effectiveness on tested audio and image datasets.

**Medium Confidence:** The adaptive spectral centroid formula's optimality. While the heatmaps show robustness across parameter ranges, the specific hyperparameter choices may be suboptimal or overfit to the tested datasets.

**Low Confidence:** The claim that WINNER adds "no trainable parameters" as a universal advantage. While true for initialization, the method's performance relative to other spectral bias mitigation techniques requires more comprehensive benchmarking.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Modality Generalization Test:** Apply WINNER with image hyperparameters [50, 5, 0.4] to a completely different signal type (e.g., video frames or scientific time series) and measure performance degradation compared to modality-specific tuning.

2. **Layer-Ablation Spectral Analysis:** Systematically vary which layers receive noise perturbation (layers 1-2, layers 2-3, all layers) and analyze resulting pre-activation PSDs and training dynamics.

3. **Benchmark Against Spectral Bias Alternatives:** Compare WINNER against frequency-aware sampling strategies (e.g., random Fourier features, adaptive sampling schedules) on the same tasks using identical architectures and training budgets.
