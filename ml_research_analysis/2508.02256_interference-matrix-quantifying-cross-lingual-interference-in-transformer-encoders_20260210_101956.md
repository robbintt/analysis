core_contribution: This paper constructs an interference matrix to quantify cross-lingual
  interference in encoder-only Transformer models across 83 languages by training
  and evaluating small BERT-like models on all possible language pairs. The analysis
  reveals that interference is asymmetrical, does not align with traditional linguistic
  features like language family or embedding similarity, but correlates with writing
  script, and that low-resource languages are more vulnerable to negative interference.

# Interference Matrix: Quantifying Cross-Lingual Interference in Transformer Encoders

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.02256
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02256
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Constructs interference matrix to quantify cross-lingual interference in encoder-only Transformers across 83 languages

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the interference matrix as a novel framework to quantify and analyze cross-lingual interference in multilingual encoder-only Transformer models. By training small BERT-like models on all possible language pairs across 83 languages, the authors systematically measure how language interference affects model performance. The analysis reveals that interference patterns are asymmetrical, do not correlate with traditional linguistic features like language family or embedding similarity, but show significant correlation with writing script. The framework demonstrates that low-resource languages are particularly vulnerable to negative interference and provides predictive power for downstream task performance.

## Method Summary
The authors construct interference matrices by training encoder-only Transformer models (small BERT-like architectures) on all possible language pairs from a set of 83 languages. Each model is trained with a fixed corpus size of 1M tokens per language. Performance is evaluated across language pairs to measure interference effects, creating a comprehensive matrix capturing how training on one language affects performance on another. The analysis systematically compares interference patterns against linguistic features including language family, embedding similarity, and writing script to identify predictive factors.

## Key Results
- Interference is asymmetrical and does not correlate with language family or embedding similarity
- Writing script shows significant correlation with interference patterns
- Low-resource languages demonstrate higher vulnerability to negative interference
- Interference matrix predicts downstream task performance drops with high accuracy (within 1.4 points on average)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The interference matrix works by systematically quantifying the degradation in cross-lingual performance through controlled pairwise training experiments. By training on all possible language combinations and measuring performance drop, it captures the interference effect as a measurable quantity. The asymmetry in interference suggests that representational conflicts are directional and depend on specific linguistic properties. The correlation with script similarity indicates that tokenization-level conflicts (likely at the subword unit level) play a significant role in cross-lingual interference.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-lingual interference:** The degradation in model performance when training on multiple languages simultaneously - needed to understand why multilingual models underperform monolingual counterparts
- **Interference matrix:** A quantitative framework mapping interference effects between all language pairs - needed to systematically measure and analyze cross-lingual conflicts
- **Script-based interference:** Interference patterns correlating with writing systems rather than linguistic features - needed to identify non-obvious sources of representational conflict
- **Asymmetrical interference:** Directional effects where training on language A affects language B differently than vice versa - needed to understand the non-reciprocal nature of language conflicts
- **Low-resource vulnerability:** The disproportionate negative impact on languages with limited training data - needed to address fairness and equity in multilingual modeling
- **Predictive interference:** Using interference matrices to forecast downstream task performance - needed to apply findings to practical model design

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Corpus -> Tokenizer -> Encoder-only Transformer -> Interference Matrix Computation -> Downstream Task Prediction
- **Critical path:** Training on language pairs → Measuring performance degradation → Building interference matrix → Analyzing correlations with linguistic features → Predicting downstream performance
- **Design tradeoffs:** Fixed corpus size (1M tokens) vs. real-world distribution, encoder-only focus vs. generalization to encoder-decoder models, pairwise training vs. computational efficiency
- **Failure signatures:** High interference despite linguistic similarity, low interference despite different scripts, asymmetrical interference patterns that cannot be explained by traditional linguistic features
- **First experiments:** 1) Validate interference patterns with domain-specific corpora, 2) Test script similarity effects through tokenization ablation, 3) Extend analysis to encoder-decoder architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Fixed corpus size of 1M tokens may not reflect real-world language distribution or domain effects
- Analysis limited to encoder-only Transformers; results may not generalize to decoder or encoder-decoder architectures
- Static interference patterns may not capture dynamic effects during fine-tuning or domain adaptation

## Confidence
- **Interference patterns:** High confidence - solid experimental methodology with 83 languages and controlled conditions
- **Script correlation:** Medium confidence - correlation established but causal mechanisms unclear
- **Downstream prediction:** Medium confidence - correlation within 1.4 points supports practical utility but requires further validation

## Next Checks
1. Test interference patterns with domain-specific corpora and varying corpus sizes to assess robustness
2. Extend analysis to encoder-decoder models like mT5 to determine if findings transfer across architectures
3. Conduct ablation studies on tokenization strategies to isolate whether script-based interference stems from subword unit conflicts versus semantic/phonological interference
