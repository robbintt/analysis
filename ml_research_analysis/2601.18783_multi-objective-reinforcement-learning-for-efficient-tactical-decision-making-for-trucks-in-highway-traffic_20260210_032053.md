# Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Tactical Decision Making for Trucks in Highway Traffic

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.18783
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18783
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** MORL framework learns continuous Pareto-optimal policies for autonomous trucks, achieving zero collisions and TCOP values close to analytical predictions (0.0012-0.0013 euros/m across traffic densities).

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework for autonomous truck tactical decision-making on highways, balancing safety, energy efficiency, and time efficiency. The MOPPO architecture learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies by conditioning both actor and critic networks on preference weight vectors, enabling adaptive control based on operational priorities. Experiments in a high-fidelity traffic simulator demonstrate the method's ability to approximate the Pareto frontier across varying traffic densities while maintaining safety through action masking and low-level controller integration.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a MOPPO framework that explicitly learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies using Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI)-based weight selection. The method conditions both actor and critic networks on a preference weight vector w, which defines trade-offs between safety, energy, and time objectives. During training, a GPI-based prioritization selects corner weights to maximize policy improvement, progressively refining the Pareto frontier approximation. A hierarchical architecture combines this MORL agent with low-level physics-based controllers (IDM for longitudinal, LC2013 for lateral control), while a rule-based action masking system prevents unsafe lane changes.

## Key Results
- Zero collision failures achieved during evaluation across all traffic densities
- Total Cost of Operation (TCOP) values per meter: 0.0012 euros/m in zero traffic, 0.0013 euros/m in medium and high traffic
- Efficient approximation of Pareto frontier across varying traffic densities (0-0.2 vehicles/meter)
- Framework demonstrates adaptive, preference-aware control suitable for heavy-duty vehicle applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Multi-objective reinforcement learning with explicit preference weighting enables adaptive, Pareto-optimal decision-making for autonomous trucks.
- **Mechanism:** MOPPO conditions actor and critic on preference weight vector **w**, defining trade-offs between safety, energy efficiency, and time efficiency. GPI-based prioritization selects corner weights maximizing policy improvement across evolving policy sets, refining Pareto frontier approximation.
- **Core assumption:** Linear scalarization captures user utility and Pareto-optimal policies exist and can be approximated by learning policies at specific corner weights.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states framework learns "continuous set of policies explicitly representing these trade-offs." Section 3.1 describes iterative policy construction using weight vectors. Related works like "Variance Reduced Policy Gradient Method for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning" support MORL approach.
- **Break condition:** Fails if true Pareto frontier is non-convex requiring non-linear scalarization, or if corner weight selection fails to sample preference space adequately.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Hierarchical control architecture ensures strategic adaptability and dynamically feasible, safe maneuvers.
- **Mechanism:** MORL agent outputs high-level tactical decisions (e.g., change lane, increase speed) passed to model-based controllers: IDM for longitudinal control and LC2013 for lateral maneuvers. This decoupling allows RL agent to focus on high-level strategy while low-level controllers handle complex truck physics.
- **Core assumption:** Low-level controllers are robust and can execute high-level commands safely across tactical decision range, and action space is sufficient for expressing necessary driving behaviors.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 2.3 states architecture "integrates MORL with model-based low-level controllers, ensuring both strategic adaptability and safety." Section C describes hierarchical decision making and control integration.
- **Break condition:** Fails if low-level controllers cannot execute commands safely in extreme conditions or if action space is too coarse for optimal behavior.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Rule-based safety filter implemented via action masking prevents unsafe lane-change policies.
- **Mechanism:** Environment provides binary mask identifying feasible actions before policy sampling. For lane changes, mask determined by kinematic, gap-based safety filter checking front/rear gaps in current/target lanes and braking feasibility. Unsafe actions receive large negative logits, making selection probability zero.
- **Core assumption:** Safety rules comprehensively model necessary conditions for safe lane changes, and sensors provide accurate state information about surrounding vehicles.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.2 describes action-masking mechanism conditioned on current state. Section 3.3 explains kinematic gap-based safety filter with finite vehicle dimensions and relative velocities.
- **Break condition:** Fails if safety rules are too conservative preventing efficient maneuvers or too permissive allowing collisions in edge cases not covered by rules.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
  - **Why needed here:** PPO is underlying policy-gradient algorithm training multi-objective actor-critic networks. Clipped objective ensures stable policy updates crucial when learning continuous policy sets.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how PPO's clipping mechanism prevents overly large policy updates, and why this is important for stability during MORL training?

- **Concept:** Pareto Optimality and Scalarization
  - **Why needed here:** Core goal is finding set of Pareto-optimal policies. Understanding Pareto-optimal solution as one where no objective can be improved without degrading another is key. Scalarization turns multi-objective problem into standard single-objective problem solvable by RL algorithms.
  - **Quick check question:** If you have two policies, Policy A (Energy=1.0, Time=3.0) and Policy B (Energy=2.0, Time=2.5), which one is Pareto-dominated? Why?

- **Concept:** Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI)
  - **Why needed here:** GPI framework allows reuse of learned policies. Core idea is new policy can be improved by combining value estimates from existing policies. Authors adapt GPI to policy-gradient setting to estimate optimal policy for new weight vector.
  - **Quick check question:** How does GPI-based prioritization in this paper differ from standard GPI used in value-based methods? (Hint: involves action logits instead of Q-values).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** State Encoder -> Weight Encoder -> Multi-Objective Actor -> Action Masking -> Low-Level Controllers -> SUMO Environment
- **Critical path:**
  1. Input: State (s) from SUMO and preference weight (w) from GPI-LS
  2. Encoding: State and weight encoded and combined
  3. Action Generation: Actor outputs action logits per objective, scalarized by w
  4. Safety Filtering: Action mask applied to scalarized logits, zeroing unsafe actions
  5. Execution: Action sampled and passed to low-level controllers for SUMO execution
  6. Learning: Transition (s, a, r, s', w) stored, PPO updates performed, GPI-LS updates policy set and selects new w

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Hierarchical vs. End-to-End: Hierarchical architecture simplifies RL problem but limits agent to what low-level controllers can execute, sacrificing potential optimality for safety and stability
  - Linear vs. Non-linear Scalarization: Linear scalarization simplifies GPI-LS algorithm but assumes convex Pareto front; non-convex trade-offs may be missed
  - Action Masking: Provides strong safety guarantee during training but may limit agent's ability to learn novel, safe behaviors beyond rule-based constraints

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Pareto Front Collapse: Learned policies cluster in small region, failing to explore full trade-off space; indicates issues with GPI-LS weight selection or reward scaling
  - Safe but Inefficient: Agent never changes lanes or accelerates aggressively, resulting in very high time costs; safety filter likely too conservative
  - Catastrophic Forgetting: Performance of older policies degrades as new policies are learned; suggests instability in shared network components

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation on GPI-LS: Train MOPPO agent with fixed set of weights (uniformly spaced) instead of GPI-LS prioritization; compare final Pareto front to isolate contribution of adaptive weight selection
  2. Action Masking Analysis: Remove action masking layer and train agent; analyze collision rate and final Pareto front to understand safety guarantee vs. policy flexibility/optimality trade-off
  3. Scalability Test: Evaluate agent in traffic densities outside training range (very high traffic or mixed vehicle types); assess generalization capability of learned Pareto frontier and robustness of GPI-LS weight selection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Linear scalarization assumes convex Pareto frontiers, potentially missing non-convex trade-offs between safety, energy, and time efficiency
- Action masking safety filter may be overly conservative, limiting exploration of efficient maneuvers
- Evaluation focuses on predefined traffic densities without testing in mixed or extreme traffic conditions that could reveal generalization limitations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Hierarchical architecture's integration with established low-level controllers (IDM/LC2013) provides robust foundation for safe execution of tactical decisions
- **Medium Confidence:** Pareto frontier approximation shows strong performance in controlled traffic scenarios, but generalization to unseen conditions remains uncertain
- **Medium Confidence:** Zero collision rate during evaluation is promising, though action masking safety filter significantly constrains policy space

## Next Checks
1. **Non-Convex Frontier Test:** Evaluate method on scenarios where safety-energy-time trade-offs create non-convex Pareto frontiers (e.g., sudden emergency braking) to assess whether linear scalarization misses optimal policies
2. **Safety Filter Ablation:** Train and test without action masking to quantify safety-efficiency trade-off and determine if agent can learn novel safe behaviors beyond rule-based constraints
3. **Traffic Density Extrapolation:** Test trained policies in traffic densities 50% above and below training range to evaluate robustness and identify potential catastrophic forgetting or performance degradation
