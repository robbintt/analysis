# Learning Fair Graph Representations with Multi-view Information Bottleneck

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25096
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25096
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: FairMIB reduces Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity by 98.8% and 99.3% relative to GCN on German dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness bias in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) arising from multi-source information, including node attributes, graph structure, and information diffusion. Traditional approaches fail to disentangle these sources, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between model utility and fairness. To overcome this, the authors propose FairMIB, a novel framework grounded in multi-view conditional information bottleneck principles. FairMIB first disentangles graph data into three independent views: feature, structural, and diffusion. It then applies a conditional information bottleneck to the fused representation to learn compressed representations that preserve task-relevant information while mitigating sensitive attribute leakage. Additionally, the framework introduces a multi-view consistency constraint to ensure semantic alignment across learned representations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior balance between fairness and utility.

## Method Summary
FairMIB is a novel framework for learning fair graph representations that addresses fairness bias in Graph Neural Networks by disentangling graph data into three independent views: feature, structural, and diffusion. The framework applies a conditional information bottleneck to the fused representation to learn compressed representations that preserve task-relevant information while mitigating sensitive attribute leakage. Additionally, FairMIB introduces a multi-view consistency constraint to ensure semantic alignment across learned representations. The approach is grounded in multi-view conditional information bottleneck principles and demonstrates superior balance between fairness and utility on five benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Key Results
- FairMIB reduces Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity by 98.8% and 99.3% relative to GCN on German dataset
- FairMIB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets
- Achieves superior balance between fairness and utility across all evaluated datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FairMIB works by addressing the fundamental challenge of fairness bias in Graph Neural Networks through a principled multi-view information bottleneck approach. The mechanism disentangles graph data into three independent views (feature, structural, and diffusion), allowing the model to separately analyze and control information flow from each source. By applying conditional information bottleneck to the fused representation, the framework learns compressed representations that retain only task-relevant information while filtering out sensitive attribute leakage. The multi-view consistency constraint ensures that semantic meaning is preserved across different representations, preventing information loss or misalignment that could compromise either fairness or utility.

## Foundational Learning

Information Bottleneck Theory: A principle for extracting relevant information from input variables for prediction tasks while compressing irrelevant information.
- Why needed: Provides theoretical foundation for selectively preserving task-relevant information while removing sensitive attributes
- Quick check: Verify that the conditional information bottleneck formulation correctly balances compression and prediction

Graph Neural Networks: Deep learning models designed to operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes
- Why needed: The target domain where fairness bias manifests and needs to be addressed
- Quick check: Ensure proper message passing and aggregation mechanisms are implemented

Multi-view Learning: Learning paradigm that exploits multiple distinct representations or views of the same data to improve learning performance
- Why needed: Enables separation of different information sources (features, structure, diffusion) for independent processing
- Quick check: Verify that views are truly independent and complementary

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Graph Data -> Disentanglement Module -> Feature View + Structural View + Diffusion View -> Information Bottleneck Module -> Compressed Representation -> Consistency Constraint Module -> Fair Representation -> Prediction Module

Critical Path: Disentanglement Module -> Information Bottleneck Module -> Consistency Constraint Module -> Prediction Module

Design Tradeoffs:
- Information preservation vs. compression: Balancing task utility with fairness requirements
- View independence vs. consistency: Ensuring views are separable but semantically aligned
- Computational complexity vs. performance: Multi-view processing increases computational overhead

Failure Signatures:
- Poor fairness metrics: Indicates insufficient information bottleneck regularization
- Degraded prediction performance: Suggests over-compression or misalignment in consistency constraints
- View entanglement: Shows failure in proper disentanglement of information sources

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study removing information bottleneck to quantify its contribution to fairness
2. Single-view baseline comparisons to validate multi-view benefits
3. Sensitivity analysis varying consistency constraint strength to find optimal balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability to larger, real-world graphs with complex structures
- Scalability concerns with multi-view disentanglement process for large-scale applications
- Experimental validation limited to five benchmark datasets, potentially missing broader fairness challenges

## Confidence
Confidence in the core methodology (High): The information bottleneck approach is theoretically sound, and the multi-view decomposition is a well-established technique. The use of conditional information bottleneck for fairness preservation is supported by recent literature.

Confidence in experimental results (Medium): While results show consistent improvements over baselines, the limited dataset diversity and potential overfitting to specific evaluation metrics warrant further validation.

Confidence in practical applicability (Medium): The framework's complexity and computational requirements for multi-view disentanglement may limit its applicability to large-scale real-world scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate FairMIB on larger, real-world graphs with varying sizes and densities to assess scalability and performance stability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component (feature, structural, and diffusion views) to overall fairness and utility
3. Test the framework's robustness to different fairness definitions and evaluation metrics beyond Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity
