# Large-Scale Bayesian Tensor Reconstruction: An Approximate Message Passing Solution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.16305
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16305
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CP-GAMP achieves 82.7% runtime reduction compared to variational Bayesian methods on synthetic tensors while maintaining comparable accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition algorithm for large-scale tensor reconstruction. The method leverages generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) to avoid high-dimensional matrix inversions, enabling efficient inference in probabilistic tensor models. To automatically infer tensor rank and noise power, the algorithm incorporates a Bernoulli-Gaussian prior with an expectation-maximization routine. Experiments demonstrate significant runtime improvements over state-of-the-art variational Bayesian methods while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy.

## Method Summary
CP-GAMP is a scalable Bayesian tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition algorithm that leverages generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) to avoid high-dimensional matrix inversions. The method incorporates a Bernoulli-Gaussian prior with an expectation-maximization routine to automatically infer tensor rank and noise power. By using component-wise likelihood functions and avoiding matrix inversions, CP-GAMP achieves efficient inference in probabilistic tensor models. The algorithm is specifically designed for large-scale tensor reconstruction tasks where traditional methods face computational bottlenecks.

## Key Results
- On synthetic 100×100×100 tensors (rank 20, 20% observed), CP-GAMP reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to variational Bayesian methods while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy
- Image inpainting experiments show 56.3% runtime reduction and 0.22 dB NMSE improvement
- The algorithm's efficiency stems from avoiding matrix inversions and handling component-wise likelihood functions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CP-GAMP works by leveraging the generalized approximate message passing framework to perform Bayesian inference without explicitly computing high-dimensional matrix inversions. The algorithm treats tensor decomposition as a probabilistic inference problem where the factors are treated as random variables with prior distributions. By using the expectation-maximization algorithm to jointly estimate the tensor factors, rank, and noise variance, CP-GAMP automatically adapts to the data structure. The Bernoulli-Gaussian prior allows the model to automatically determine which components are active versus noise, effectively learning the tensor rank during inference rather than requiring it as a fixed input.

## Foundational Learning

**Generalized Approximate Message Passing (GAMP)**
- Why needed: Traditional message passing algorithms scale poorly with problem size due to matrix inversions
- Quick check: Verify that GAMP maintains accuracy while avoiding O(n³) matrix operations

**CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) Decomposition**
- Why needed: Provides a compact representation of multi-way data that captures latent factors
- Quick check: Ensure factor matrices have orthogonal properties when applicable

**Bernoulli-Gaussian Prior**
- Why needed: Enables automatic rank determination by modeling component sparsity
- Quick check: Confirm that the prior correctly identifies active versus inactive components

**Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm**
- Why needed: Allows joint estimation of latent factors, rank, and noise parameters
- Quick check: Monitor convergence of both E and M steps for stability

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
CP-GAMP -> GAMP Core -> Bernoulli-Gaussian Prior -> EM Optimization -> Tensor Reconstruction

**Critical Path**
Data → Factor Initialization → GAMP Iteration → Posterior Estimation → EM Update → Convergence Check → Final Reconstruction

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Memory vs. Accuracy: CP-GAMP trades some precision for computational efficiency by avoiding exact matrix operations
- Rank Flexibility vs. Convergence: Automatic rank determination may lead to slower convergence compared to fixed-rank methods
- Bayesian Rigor vs. Scalability: Maintains probabilistic framework while scaling to larger problems

**Failure Signatures**
- Slow convergence indicates poor initialization or inappropriate prior parameters
- Divergence suggests numerical instability in the GAMP updates
- Rank overestimation occurs when the Bernoulli-Gaussian prior is too permissive

**3 First Experiments**
1. Run CP-GAMP on a small synthetic tensor (20×20×20, rank 3, 50% observed) to verify basic functionality
2. Compare reconstruction error and runtime against a standard CP decomposition with known rank
3. Test sensitivity to initialization by running multiple trials with different random seeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance validation was limited to synthetic tensors and a single image inpainting task, limiting generalizability
- The Bernoulli-Gaussian prior assumption may not capture all real-world data distributions with heavy-tailed or multimodal characteristics
- The paper does not address memory consumption or scalability beyond tested dimensions, and lacks comparison with non-Bayesian tensor completion methods

## Confidence

**High confidence**: CP-GAMP's theoretical framework and its avoidance of matrix inversions are well-established concepts in the literature.

**Medium confidence**: The reported runtime improvements and reconstruction accuracy are based on limited experimental scenarios and may not generalize to all tensor completion problems.

**Low confidence**: The claim of CP-GAMP being "particularly effective for large-scale tensor reconstruction tasks" lacks extensive empirical validation across diverse real-world applications.

## Next Checks

1. Test CP-GAMP on tensors with varying dimensions (e.g., 500×500×500) and ranks to evaluate scalability and performance under different conditions.

2. Compare CP-GAMP with non-Bayesian tensor completion methods on real-world datasets (e.g., video, hyperspectral images) to assess practical advantages.

3. Investigate the impact of different prior distributions (e.g., Laplace, Student's t) on reconstruction accuracy and runtime to determine the robustness of the Bernoulli-Gaussian assumption.
