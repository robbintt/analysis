# Higher-Order Causal Structure Learning with Additive Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.03831
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03831
- **Reference count:** 28
- **Primary result:** Learning causal structures with higher-order interactions using directed hypergraphs outperforms standard methods on synthetic data.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning causal structures in the presence of higher-order interactions between variables, which are common in real-world systems but often ignored by traditional methods. The authors extend the causal additive model (CAM) framework to directed hypergraphs (HDAGs), allowing explicit representation of multi-variable causal relationships. They introduce theoretical tools including the hyper Markov property and prove identifiability results for HDAGs, showing they can be distinguished up to hyper Markov equivalence classes. The paper also demonstrates that under certain conditions (e.g., Gaussian noise), the undirected hypergraph structure is directly identifiable from data. Empirically, the authors develop and test a higher-order extension of CAM (HCAM) on synthetic data with 1D, 2D, and 3D additive interactions.

## Method Summary
The paper extends CAM to higher-order causal interactions through directed acyclic hypergraphs (HDAGs). The HCAM algorithm follows a three-stage approach: (1) candidate search using neural networks and interaction detection to identify potential hyperedges, (2) greedy structure learning by iteratively adding hyperedges that maximize log-likelihood under Gaussian noise assumptions, and (3) pruning near-zero interaction terms. The theoretical contribution establishes that HDAGs are identifiable up to hyper Markov equivalence classes through conditional multi-independence tests, extending classical DAG equivalence theory to higher-order interactions.

## Key Results
- HCAM significantly outperforms standard methods (CAM, GES) on 2D interaction data, where other methods fail to capture the structure
- Standard methods like CAM and GES perform well on simple 1D cases but cannot recover higher-order interactions
- The method demonstrates that modeling higher-order interactions is essential for learning complex causal structures in real-world systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Directed Hypergraph Encoding of Multi-Variable Causal Mechanisms
The hypergraph extends DAGs by allowing hyperedges (S, j) where a set of parent nodes S jointly cause child j through an interaction term f_S(x_S). The structural equation becomes X_j = Σ_{S∈HypPa(j)} f_S(x_S) + ε_j, where each f_S captures a distinct higher-order interaction rather than collapsing all parents into a single function.

### Mechanism 2: Conditional Multi-Independence for Hyper Markov Equivalence
HDAGs are identifiable up to hyper Markov equivalence classes (HMECs) via conditional multi-independence tests. Three variables X_i, X_j, X_k are "multi-dependent" if log p(x_i, x_j, x_k) requires a 3D energy term θ_ijk rather than being expressible as sum of 2D terms. The "body" of an HDAG is recoverable from inseparable variable sets.

### Mechanism 3: Greedy Hyperedge Selection with Neural Interaction Detection
A three-stage algorithm (HCAM) recovers HDAG structure by combining neural network-based interaction detection with greedy likelihood-based hyperedge addition. Stage 1 trains neural networks per variable and uses ARCHIPELAGO interpretability to score candidate hyperedges. Stage 2 greedily adds hyperedges maximizing log-likelihood. Stage 3 prunes near-zero additive terms.

## Foundational Learning

- **Causal Additive Models (CAM)**
  - Why needed here: HCAM extends CAM's additive noise assumption to higher-order interactions
  - Quick check: Can you explain why CAM assumes additive noise enables identifiability beyond Markov equivalence?

- **Hypergraphs and Hyperedges**
  - Why needed here: The core representation shift from pairwise edges to hyperedges is the paper's main contribution
  - Quick check: What distinguishes a directed hyperedge (S, j) from a set of pairwise edges {(s, j) : s ∈ S}?

- **Markov Equivalence Classes (MECs)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's theoretical contribution extends MEC theory to HMECs via multi-independence
  - Quick check: Why can't conditional independence tests alone distinguish between X → Y → Z and X ← Y ← Z?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Neural candidate search → Greedy HDAG builder → Pruning module → DAG projection
- **Critical path:** Neural candidate search → determines which hyperedges enter greedy search → directly impacts final HDAG structure
- **Design tradeoffs:** Neural preselection (10 candidates per variable) reduces exponential search but may miss true hyperedges; 5-epoch training trades accuracy for speed
- **Failure signatures:** Stage 1 failure (low precision/recall in neural detection), Stage 2 failure (acyclicity blocks candidates), Stage 3 failure (over-aggressive pruning)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. 1D vs. 2D comparison on known ground truth to confirm specialization tradeoff
  2. Hyperedge candidate ablation to measure recall vs. final recovery
  3. Sample complexity scaling on 2D data to validate O(n^2) sample complexity claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Latent Confounding Extension:** How can HCAM handle latent confounding while maintaining identifiability? The current proofs assume causal sufficiency.
- **Statistical Power for 3D+ Interactions:** How to improve statistical power for learning 3D and higher-order interactions given the O(n^K) sample complexity barrier?
- **Theoretically Grounded Candidate Search:** Can the heuristic neural candidate search be replaced by a method with finite-sample consistency guarantees?

## Limitations

- Heavy reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions for the greedy selection criterion
- Candidate search depends on neural interaction detection via Archipelago, which is not fully specified
- Empirical validation is confined to synthetic data with known ground truth

## Confidence

- **High:** Theoretical identifiability results for HDAGs under hyper Markov equivalence
- **Medium:** HCAM algorithm performance on synthetic 2D data vs. baselines
- **Low:** Scalability and robustness of neural interaction detection in noisy or high-dimensional real-world settings

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation of Neural Candidate Search:** Systematically vary the number of candidates per node (5, 10, 20) and measure recall of true hyperedges to identify the minimum required for adequate performance
2. **Non-Gaussian Noise Robustness:** Test HCAM on synthetic data with heavy-tailed or heteroskedastic noise to assess breakdown of the MSE-likelihood equivalence
3. **Real-World Application:** Apply HCAM to a domain with known higher-order interactions (e.g., gene regulatory networks) to evaluate performance beyond synthetic benchmarks
