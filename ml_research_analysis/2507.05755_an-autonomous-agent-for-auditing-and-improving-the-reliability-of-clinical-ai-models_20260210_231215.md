# An autonomous agent for auditing and improving the reliability of clinical AI models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.05755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05755
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Recovers 15-25% of lost performance under distribution shift

## Executive Summary
ModelAuditor is an autonomous LLM agent that evaluates and improves clinical AI model reliability by identifying context-specific failure modes under distribution shift. It engages practitioners in dialogue, selects clinically relevant metrics, simulates real-world data variations, and generates interpretable reports with actionable mitigation strategies. Tested across histopathology, dermatology, and chest radiography scenarios, ModelAuditor recovered 15-25% of lost performance compared to baseline models and outperformed generic augmentation methods. The agent achieves this through a multi-agent debate architecture that selects task-specific metrics and distribution shifts, then provides targeted re-training recommendations.

## Method Summary
ModelAuditor uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet as the controller, engaging practitioners in dialogue to understand clinical deployment contexts. Two sub-agents debate to select appropriate evaluation metrics from the MetricsReloaded framework and identify relevant distribution shifts from a catalog of 22 perturbations. The agent then simulates these shifts using TorchVision transforms, evaluates model performance, and generates interpretable reports with specific augmentation recommendations. The system runs on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes at a cost of less than US$0.50 per audit, making comprehensive reliability evaluation accessible to practitioners.

## Key Results
- Recovered 15-25% of lost performance under distribution shift compared to baseline models
- Outperformed state-of-the-art augmentation methods (AutoAugment) in three clinical scenarios
- Achieved comprehensive reliability evaluation in under 10 minutes on consumer hardware at <$0.50 per audit

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Context-to-Metric Translation via Multi-Agent Debate
The system maps ambiguous clinical deployment contexts to rigorous evaluation metrics by simulating a "proposer-critic" dialogue, reducing the need for the user to have deep ML expertise. Two sub-agents backed by an LLM query the user for clinical constraints and debate metric selection based on the MetricsReloaded framework until consensus is reached, ensuring the metric fits the clinical risk profile.

### Mechanism 2: Targeted Distribution Shift Simulation
Performance degradation is exposed by applying synthetic perturbations that specifically mimic the anticipated deployment environment, rather than generic corruptions. The agent selects from a catalog of 22 shifts and prioritizes those that match the clinical context, isolating failure modes tied to specific domain gaps.

### Mechanism 3: Closed-Loop Augmentation Recommendation
The agent recovers model performance by translating detected failure modes into targeted data augmentation policies for retraining. Once a vulnerability is found, the agent generates a specific Compose list of transforms for retraining, outperforming generic policies that might apply irrelevant or harmful transforms.

## Foundational Learning

- **Distribution Shift (Covariate Shift)**: Why needed here - The entire premise relies on the fact that models trained on Dataset A (source hospital) fail on Dataset B (target hospital) due to changes in imaging protocols. Quick check question: If a model trained on high-resolution scans is tested on compressed JPEGs, is this a label shift or a covariate shift?

- **Calibration (Expected Calibration Error - ECE)**: Why needed here - The paper emphasizes that a model can be accurate but "dangerously overconfident." Understanding how confidence scores align with actual accuracy is critical for the safety-critical context ModelAuditor operates in. Quick check question: If a model predicts "malignant" with 0.9 confidence but is only correct 50% of the time, is it well-calibrated?

- **Agentic Tool Use (ReAct / Debate)**: Why needed here - ModelAuditor is not just a chatbot; it invokes external tools (metrics calculations, image transforms). Understanding how an LLM outputs structured tags to trigger python functions is key to the architecture. Quick check question: How does the LLM know the valid parameters for the GaussianNoise tool?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Brain (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) -> Context (MetricsReloaded guidelines, 22 shift catalog) -> Tools (Python wrappers for ModelAuditorCore) -> Interface (CLI or conversational loop)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Input: User provides model + data + deployment text
  2. Debate: Sub-agents debate to output XML <metric> and <shift> tags
  3. Execution: Core tool runs the transforms and computes metrics (5-10 mins on CPU)
  4. Synthesis: Brain interprets the resulting DataFrame into natural language report

- **Design tradeoffs**: Uses general LLM rather than specialized medical fine-tune (lower cost, may lack deep nuance); relies on synthetic shifts rather than collecting new labeled data from target domain (cheaper/faster, potentially lower fidelity)

- **Failure signatures**: Hallucinated Tools (LLM attempts to call unimplemented transform); Debate Loop (proposer/critic cycle fails to converge)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce the SIIM-ISIC Audit: Run the provided melanoma classifier with prompt "teledermatology" and verify agent selects "Brightness" and "Zoom" shifts
  2. Stress Test Metric Selection: Give agent conflicting scenario ("High sensitivity required but data is extremely imbalanced") and observe if it selects FBetaScore or BalancedAccuracy
  3. Ablation on Debate: Bypass multi-agent debate and feed context directly to single agent; compare relevance of selected shifts against debated set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the ModelAuditor framework be effectively adapted for multimodal clinical models that fuse imaging with text or genomic data? The Discussion states the framework is "currently vision-only" and that multimodal models "will require an expanded metric ontology and new shift generators." Extension of the agent's tools to handle tabular or text data and demonstration of auditing a multimodal model would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How sensitive is the multi-agent debate architecture to the capability of the underlying LLM? The Discussion notes that "agentic decision quality is ultimately bounded by the underlying LLM; weaker or cost-optimized models might underperform." A benchmark comparing metric selection accuracy and debate coherence of the agent when powered by smaller, open-source, or lower-capability models would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
Does the reliance on a pre-defined catalog of synthetic perturbations limit the discovery of novel, domain-specific failure modes? The Discussion acknowledges that "simulated shifts (even a large catalog) can never be exhaustive." Evaluation of the agent's ability to identify failure modes in a "blind" deployment scenario where the root cause is a novel shift not represented in the tool catalog would resolve this.

## Limitations

- Relies on synthetic distribution shifts rather than real-world OOD data, which may fail to capture subtle domain-specific variations
- Multi-agent debate mechanism lacks complete implementation details, particularly internal coordination protocol and termination criteria
- Success metrics focus on recovering performance under simulated shifts, but real-world clinical deployment would require validation on actual OOD data from target institutions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Core architecture (LLM-controlled agent with tool use) is well-specified and reproducible; reported runtime and cost benchmarks are verifiable
- **Medium confidence**: 15-25% performance recovery claims are supported by three clinical scenarios, but generalizability across different medical imaging domains remains untested; debate mechanism's effectiveness over simpler prompting is plausible but not definitively proven
- **Low confidence**: Assumption that synthetic shifts perfectly proxy real-world distribution changes is the weakest link; without testing on truly OOD data from target hospitals, we cannot verify that identified failure modes match clinical reality

## Next Checks

1. Real-world OOD validation: Test ModelAuditor on a truly out-of-distribution dataset from a different hospital or scanner manufacturer than training data; compare synthetic shift-induced performance drops against actual OOD degradation

2. Clinical expert review: Have domain experts (radiologists, pathologists) review the agent's metric selections and mitigation recommendations for clinical appropriateness, particularly for rare but critical failure modes the LLM might miss

3. Ablation study on debate mechanism: Implement and compare full proposer-critic-mediator debate against simpler single-agent prompting approach; measure whether debate consistently produces more clinically relevant metric/shift combinations across diverse deployment scenarios
