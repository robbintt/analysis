# Supply Chain Optimization via Generative Simulation and Iterative Decision Policies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07355
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Introduces Sim-to-Dec framework integrating generative simulation with iterative decision-making for supply chain shipping optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Sim-to-Dec, a unified framework that integrates generative simulation with iterative decision-making for optimizing shipping strategies in supply chain transportation. The core method consists of two tightly coupled components: a generative simulator that learns transportation dynamics from historical data using autoregressive modeling, and a decision-maker that combines historical experience with future reward estimation to select optimal shipping modes. The framework enables risk-free evaluation and refinement of transportation strategies through continuous simulation feedback.

Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly outperforms baseline methods. The simulator achieves 50.3%, 7.3%, and 1.1% improvement in overall accuracy over the strongest baselines on DataCo, GlobalStore, and OAS datasets respectively. The decision-maker shows superior performance in balancing timely delivery rates and profit, with 4.1% and 6.8% improvement in overall metrics and 11.8% and 18.1% reduction in the gap between objectives on DataCo and OAS datasets. The framework maintains robust performance under distribution shifts and provides computational efficiency with only 1.2 seconds processing time on large datasets.

## Method Summary
The Sim-to-Dec framework consists of two main components. The generative simulator learns transportation dynamics from historical data using an LSTM encoder to fuse order attributes and shipping mode embeddings, then sequentially generates evolutionary features (delay risk → delivery time → on-time status) via autoregressive modeling. The decision-maker uses a dual-aware learning approach that combines historical reward estimation with future reward prediction from the frozen simulator, employing Gumbel-Softmax sampling for differentiable discrete decisions. The framework is trained end-to-end with a combined loss function that balances historical patterns and forward-looking reward estimation.

## Key Results
- Simulator achieves 93.51% overall accuracy on DataCo dataset, outperforming baselines by 50.3%, 7.3%, and 1.1% on three datasets respectively
- Decision-maker shows 4.1% and 6.8% improvement in overall metrics balancing timely delivery and profit on DataCo and OAS datasets
- Framework demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts while maintaining computational efficiency at 1.2 seconds processing time
- Autoregressive generation outperforms non-autoregressive approaches in capturing interdependent state transitions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Autoregressive generation enables fine-grained simulation of interdependent state transitions
- Mechanism: The simulator uses an LSTM encoder to fuse order attributes and shipping mode embeddings, then sequentially generates evolutionary features (delay risk → delivery time → on-time status) rather than predicting all states independently. This captures dependencies between successive state changes.
- Core assumption: Order states evolve with temporal dependencies where earlier states influence later ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "generative simulation module...leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate continuous state changes"
  - [Section 4.1] "we utilize the LSTM decoder to autoregressively generate evolutionary attributes" and Eq. 7-8 show sequential generation with zE_{<e,n} conditioning
  - [corpus] Related work on multi-echelon inventory RL (arxiv:2503.18201) notes RL struggles with "fine-grained state transitions" - consistent with this paper's motivation
- Break condition: If state transitions are largely independent (not sequentially dependent), autoregressive modeling adds complexity without benefit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dual-aware learning balances historical patterns with forward-looking reward estimation
- Mechanism: The decision network optimizes two objectives jointly - Lh encourages selecting modes with highest historical expected reward, while Lf trains a value network to predict batch-level rewards from simulator outputs. Gumbel-Softmax ensures differentiability for end-to-end training.
- Core assumption: Historical patterns remain partially predictive under moderate distribution shift; simulator provides reliable forward estimates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "history-future dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization"
  - [Section 4.2] Eq. 11-12 define historical reward Ed, Eq. 15-16 define future batch reward; Eq. 17 combines with λ weighting
  - [corpus] MORSE (arxiv:2509.06490) addresses multi-objective RL for supply chains with conflicting goals - similar dual-objective structure
- Break condition: If historical data is non-stationary or simulator predictions diverge significantly from reality under distribution shift, the dual signals may conflict and degrade decisions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Frozen simulator provides stable counterfactual environment for risk-free policy exploration
- Mechanism: The simulator is pre-trained and frozen during decision-maker training. This creates a fixed "world model" that allows the decision network to explore shipping mode selections and receive consistent feedback without real-world risk.
- Core assumption: The simulator captures sufficient real-world dynamics to serve as a reliable proxy for policy evaluation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.2] "The simulator is pre-trained, with its parameters frozen during decision-making. This design ensures that the simulator provides a stable and reliable risk-free environment"
  - [Table 1] Simulator achieves 93.51% overall accuracy on DataCo, suggesting high fidelity
  - [corpus] Graph-based Digital Twins paper (arxiv:2504.03692) similarly proposes simulation environments for supply chain optimization - convergent approach
- Break condition: If simulator accuracy degrades significantly on out-of-distribution scenarios, frozen parameters will produce misleading feedback signals.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Autoregressive sequence modeling
  - Why needed here: The simulator generates order states sequentially; understanding how LSTM decoders condition on prior outputs is essential for debugging simulation fidelity.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why zE_{<e,n} in Eq. 7 conditions the next state prediction on all previously generated states?

- Concept: Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization
  - Why needed here: Enables differentiable sampling from categorical distributions (shipping mode selection) for end-to-end gradient flow through discrete decisions.
  - Quick check question: Why can't standard argmax be used for shipping mode selection if the goal is differentiable training?

- Concept: Multi-objective optimization with competing objectives
  - Why needed here: The framework explicitly trades off timely delivery rate vs. profit; the "Diff" metric measures this tension.
  - Quick check question: How does the loss function in Eq. 17 balance the two objectives, and what role does λ play?

- Critical path:
  1. Train simulator on historical data (order info + chosen mode → observed states) until convergence
  2. Freeze simulator parameters
  3. Train decision network with combined loss, sampling modes via Gumbel-Softmax and receiving simulator feedback

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Autoregressive vs. parallel generation**: Autoregressive captures dependencies but slower inference; ablations show it outperforms non-autoregressive generation (Table 1)
  - **Frozen vs. co-trained simulator**: Freezing provides stability but cannot adapt if real dynamics drift
  - **λ weighting**: Higher λ emphasizes historical experience; sensitivity analysis (Fig. 5c-d) shows optimal λ varies by dataset

- Failure signatures:
  - Low simulator accuracy (>20% gap from baselines) → check attribute group encoding or LSTM capacity
  - Decision network collapses to single mode → check Gumbel-Softmax temperature or reward scaling
  - Large Diff metric with high Overall → objectives strongly conflicting; may need to adjust reward formulation or accept trade-off

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Simulator ablation**: Compare autoregressive vs. non-autoregressive vs. Markov on held-out test set using accuracy metrics (replicate Table 1 on new data split)
  2. **Distribution shift robustness**: Partition training/test by delivery time quartile; plot predicted vs. real fE_time distributions (replicate Fig. 4)
  3. **Decision-maker comparison**: Run Sim-to-Dec against LP, RL, and LLM baselines; measure TTime, TProfit, Diff, Overall on same test orders (replicate Table 2 methodology)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the generative simulator effectively generalize to supply chain domains with significantly different operational dynamics beyond the three tested datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The simulator shows highly variable performance across datasets (93.5% accuracy on DataCo vs. 62.6% on OAS), suggesting sensitivity to domain characteristics that the paper does not fully explain.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates robustness to distribution shift on one dataset but does not investigate cross-domain transfer or identify which domain features most affect simulator fidelity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments on additional datasets from different industries (e.g., perishable goods, hazardous materials) with analysis of feature importance for simulator accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can uncertainty quantification be integrated into the autoregressive simulator to provide confidence bounds on predicted order states?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The simulator outputs point predictions for risk, delivery time, and status without any uncertainty estimates, which limits risk assessment in high-stakes logistics decisions.
- Why unresolved: The LSTM-based architecture and MSE loss function produce deterministic outputs; the paper does not address probabilistic modeling or calibration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the simulator to output distributions (e.g., via Bayesian neural networks or ensemble methods) and evaluating calibration on held-out data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between simulator fidelity and decision-maker performance, and is there a fidelity threshold beyond which further improvements yield diminishing returns?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The framework assumes that higher simulator accuracy translates to better decisions, but the paper does not analyze this relationship systematically across different accuracy levels.
- Why unresolved: Ablation studies only remove components entirely; no controlled experiments vary simulator quality while holding other factors constant.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with simulators trained to different accuracy levels, measuring decision quality as a function of simulator fidelity.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the framework perform under real-time online adaptation scenarios where the decision-maker must continuously learn from streaming data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states the framework has "potential for broader applications in logistics optimization and adaptive decision-making systems," implying online adaptation is a future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current framework trains offline on historical data; the simulator parameters are frozen during decision-making, preventing real-time updates to changing logistics dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing an online learning variant with incremental simulator updates and evaluating performance on streaming data with concept drift.

## Limitations

- Limited generalization across diverse supply chain domains, as simulator performance varies significantly (93.5% vs 62.6% accuracy) across tested datasets
- Frozen simulator design prevents adaptation to real-time distribution shifts or concept drift in operational dynamics
- Deterministic outputs lack uncertainty quantification, limiting risk assessment capabilities for high-stakes logistics decisions

## Confidence

- **High** for simulator accuracy claims (93.51% overall on DataCo, with clear improvements over baselines) and the autoregressive mechanism (supported by Table 1 ablations)
- **Medium** for decision-maker performance (4.1-6.8% improvements) due to unknown λ tuning and reward formulation specifics
- **Medium** for distribution shift robustness claims, as the evidence shows robustness to moderate shifts but limited testing on severe shifts

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation under distribution shift**: Partition datasets by delivery time quartiles; train on one quartile, test on others; measure simulator accuracy and decision-maker performance degradation across quartiles to quantify robustness bounds.

2. **Reward function sensitivity**: Systematically vary the λ weighting in Eq. 17 (e.g., λ ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0}); for each λ, record TTime, TProfit, Diff, and Overall; identify optimal λ ranges and test whether extreme values cause objective collapse or mode collapse.

3. **Counterfactual policy evaluation**: Using frozen simulator, simulate decision-maker performance under hypothetical shipping cost increases (e.g., +20%, +50%) or delivery time penalties; compare predicted TTime and TProfit shifts to validate simulator's utility for scenario planning beyond the training distribution.
