# SX-GeoTree: Self-eXplaining Geospatial Regression Tree Incorporating the Spatial Similarity of Feature Attributions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.19845
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19845
- Reference count: 16
- Integrates impurity reduction, spatial residual control, and explanation robustness into geospatial decision tree induction

## Executive Summary
SX-GeoTree is a geospatial decision tree method that simultaneously optimizes prediction accuracy, spatial residual structure, and explanation consistency. By incorporating Moran's I for spatial autocorrelation and modularity maximization on a consensus similarity network (combining GWR coefficients and SHAP attributions), SX-GeoTree produces interpretable models with spatially coherent explanations. The framework demonstrates that explanation robustness can be achieved at scale through network community detection rather than per-sample searches, advancing trustworthy geospatial machine learning.

## Method Summary
SX-GeoTree extends traditional decision tree induction by optimizing three objectives: minimizing mean squared error (impurity reduction), controlling spatial autocorrelation of residuals via global Moran's I, and maximizing explanation robustness through modularity maximization on a consensus similarity network. The consensus network is constructed from GWR coefficients and SHAP attributions, representing local relationships and feature importance respectively. By recasting local Lipschitz continuity of explanations as a network community preservation problem, SX-GeoTree enforces spatially coherent explanations without requiring per-sample searches. This approach enables scalable integration of spatial similarity—extended beyond geometric proximity through GWR-derived local relationships—into interpretable models.

## Key Results
- Maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 R² of standard decision trees)
- Improves spatial residual structure (Moran's I reduction: Fujian 0.19→0.09, Seattle 0.10→0.05)
- Doubles attribution consensus modularity (Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09, Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05)
- Demonstrates complementarity of Moran's I and modularity terms through ablation studies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SX-GeoTree works by explicitly optimizing for spatially coherent explanations through network community detection. The consensus similarity network captures both local relationships (via GWR coefficients) and feature importance patterns (via SHAP attributions). By maximizing modularity on this network during tree induction, the method ensures that explanations remain stable and consistent across spatially similar locations. The spatial residual control through Moran's I prevents the model from exploiting spurious spatial patterns while maintaining predictive accuracy. This dual optimization of explanation consistency and residual structure creates more trustworthy and interpretable geospatial models.

## Foundational Learning

- **Moran's I**: Spatial autocorrelation statistic measuring similarity between neighboring locations; needed to quantify and control residual spatial structure
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: Game-theoretic feature attribution method; needed to quantify feature importance at each location
- **Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)**: Local regression method estimating location-specific coefficients; needed to capture spatially varying relationships
- **Modularity Maximization**: Community detection method identifying clusters in networks; needed to measure and enforce explanation consistency
- **Consensus Networks**: Aggregation of multiple similarity measures into unified representation; needed to combine GWR and SHAP information
- **Local Lipschitz Continuity**: Property ensuring small input changes produce small output changes; needed as theoretical foundation for explanation stability

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> Spatial Weights Matrix -> GWR & SHAP Computation -> Consensus Similarity Network -> Modularity Maximization -> Tree Induction -> Output Model

**Critical Path**: The core innovation lies in the integration of modularity maximization into the tree splitting criterion. During each split, SX-GeoTree evaluates not only traditional impurity reduction but also the impact on spatial residual structure (Moran's I) and explanation consensus (modularity). This requires pre-computing GWR coefficients and SHAP attributions, constructing the consensus network, and efficiently calculating modularity changes for candidate splits.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades some computational complexity for improved explanation consistency and spatial structure. While pre-computing GWR and SHAP values adds overhead, the consensus network approach enables scalable explanation robustness without per-sample searches. The choice of spatial weights matrix significantly impacts results, requiring careful consideration of geographic vs. feature-based similarity.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor spatial weights definition may lead to meaningless communities; over-regularization via Moran's I may suppress valid local patterns; instability in GWR coefficients can propagate to the consensus network; modularity maximization may fail if spatial patterns are too heterogeneous.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify Moran's I computation and interpretation on synthetic spatial data with known autocorrelation; 2) Test consensus network construction using GWR coefficients and SHAP attributions on a simple geospatial dataset; 3) Implement and validate modularity maximization on the consensus network to identify stable communities.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited testing to only two datasets with modest geographic coverage
- Reliance on only GWR and SHAP for consensus similarity may miss other important patterns
- Potential sensitivity to the choice of spatial weights matrix definition
- Framework's transferability to high-dimensional or non-stationary feature spaces remains untested

## Confidence
- High confidence in core methodological claims due to explicit mathematical formulation and clear mapping to network community detection
- Medium confidence in empirical claims about spatial residual improvements and attribution consensus due to limited dataset diversity
- High confidence that explanation robustness is achieved without per-sample search based on consensus network formulation

## Next Checks
1. Test SX-GeoTree on multiple diverse geospatial datasets (e.g., air quality, land cover) to assess generalizability
2. Perform ablation studies varying the spatial weights definition (e.g., k-nearest neighbors vs. distance decay) to quantify robustness
3. Evaluate explanation consistency under simulated local feature perturbations to confirm stability of modularity-based consensus attribution
