# Distributional Computational Graphs: Error Bounds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.16250
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16250
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Establishes non-asymptotic error bounds for distribution propagation through computational graphs using Wasserstein-1 distance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces distributional computational graphs (DCGs) where nodes represent probability distributions rather than point values. The authors analyze how discretization errors propagate through DCGs when using finite approximations of continuous distributions. They establish non-asymptotic error bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-1 distance without structural assumptions on the computational graph. The main theoretical result shows that output error is bounded by the graph's complexity, a distortion factor from Lipschitz constants, and combined quantization and compression errors.

## Method Summary
The method propagates probability distributions through a computational graph by recursively quantizing continuous distributions into discrete representations with 2^n atoms via mean-splitting, then applying Lipschitz-continuous operations to propagate these representations. When intermediate distributions exceed 2^n atoms, a compression step re-quantizes them. The framework provides deterministic alternatives to Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty propagation, with explicit error bounds that combine discretization, quantization, and compression effects.

## Key Results
- Error bound: W1(μΔ, μ(n),cΔ) ≤ Σs∈S Σγ∈P(s,Δ) ∏(u,v)∈γ ∥fv∥Lip · (1/2n)·diam(supp(μs)) + compression error
- For Euler-Maruyama SDEs, error grows as (1 + c√Δt)^k with k time steps
- Quantization error decays as O(2^-n) for distributions with finite mean
- Numerical results suggest bounds are qualitatively tight, with log-error vs n showing linear decay

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Error propagates multiplicatively along computational graph paths via Lipschitz constants.
- Mechanism: Each node function fv has Lipschitz constant ∥fv∥Lip. When input distributions differ by Wasserstein-1 distance ε, the output differs by at most ∥fv∥Lip · ε. For a path γ from source to terminal, errors compound as the product of Lipschitz constants along edges.
- Core assumption: All node functions are globally Lipschitz (Assumption 1); input distributions have finite mean.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "output error is bounded by the graph size, distortion factor (product of Lipschitz constants along paths), and combined quantization/compression errors"
  - [Lemma 3.3 proof] "W1(μv, μ(n)v) ≤ Σu∈in(v) ∥fv∥Lip W1(μu, μ(n)u)"
  - [corpus] Related work on distributional regression bounds (2505.09075) shares the Lipschitz composition principle but for different error metrics (CRPS).
- Break condition: Non-Lipschitz operations (e.g., division by near-zero random variables, b(t,x)ξ terms in Euler-Maruyama without special handling) invalidate the bound; Lemma 4.2 shows this requires additional assumptions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mean-based recursive partitioning quantizes distributions with O(2^-n) error decay.
- Mechanism: The quantization operator Tf(μ,n) recursively splits distribution mass at the mean f(μ), creating 2^n atoms. The Wasserstein-1 error equals the expected distance from samples to their quantized representatives, bounded by diam(supp(μ))/2^n for compactly supported distributions.
- Core assumption: Finite mean exists; splitting points yield nontrivial partitions (μ(Ω±) > 0).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Eq. 13] "W1(μ, μ(n)) ≤ (1/2) · diam(supp(μ)) / 2^n"
  - [Corollary 4.1] "W1(μ, μ(n)) = O(2^-n)" for Gaussian distributions via Lemma 4.1's asymptotic analysis
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific quantization scheme; EMPEROR (2509.16379) uses moment-preserving approaches but differs fundamentally.
- Break condition: Heavy-tailed distributions where diam(supp(μ(n))) diverges as n → ∞; Remark 2.1 explicitly notes Pareto distributions can break the bound.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Graph topology determines error accumulation via path counting and depth.
- Mechanism: The total error sums over all source-to-terminal paths P(s,Δ). Each source contributes independently. The number of paths #P(S,Δ) acts as a multiplicative factor on the per-source error bound.
- Core assumption: DAG structure with unique terminal vertex; no cycles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Theorem 1.1] Error bound explicitly contains "Σs∈S Σγ∈P(s,Δ) ∏(u,v)∈γ ∥fv∥Lip"
  - [Remark 1.1] "error ≲ size of G × distortion factor × (quantization error + compression error)"
  - [corpus] Distributional regression work (2505.09075) bounds risk but doesn't analyze graph topology effects—this is distinctive to DCGs.
- Break condition: Exponentially many paths (e.g., fully connected layers) make bounds vacuous; Section 5 notes #in(v) ≤ 2 doesn't improve bounds without stronger distributional assumptions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Wasserstein-1 distance
  - Why needed here: This metric quantifies distributional approximation quality and satisfies the Lipschitz composition property enabling error propagation analysis.
  - Quick check question: If two distributions have CDFs F and G, can you compute W1(μ,ν) = ∫|F(x) - G(x)|dx?

- Concept: Lipschitz continuity with respect to Wasserstein distance
  - Why needed here: The core proof strategy requires that if f is ∥f∥Lip-Lipschitz, then W1(f#μ, f#ν) ≤ ∥f∥Lip · W1(μ,ν).
  - Quick check question: For f(x) = 2x, what is ∥f∥Lip in the ℓ1-norm, and how does it amplify input distribution error?

- Concept: Pushforward measure (μ ∘ F^-1)
  - Why needed here: The output distribution μΔ is the pushforward of input distributions through the computational graph's composed function FΔ.
  - Quick check question: If X ~ μ and Y = f(X), what is the relationship between the distribution of Y and μ?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Source nodes (S)**: Input distributions μs (continuous or discrete)
  - **Quantization layer (T)**: Converts μs → μ(n)s with 2^n atoms via mean-splitting tree
  - **Propagation engine**: Applies fv functions compositionally; tracks intermediate distributions
  - **Compression gate**: When intermediate distribution has >2^n atoms, applies T(·, n) to reduce
  - **Terminal node (Δ)**: Output distribution μ(n),cΔ

- Critical path: Source → Quantization → [Propagate → (Conditional Compress)]* → Terminal. The compression decision at each intermediate node trades accuracy for tractability.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **n (quantization depth)**: Exponential accuracy gain (2^-n) but 2^n atoms; O(n) increases memory by 2×
  - **Graph depth vs. error**: Bound grows with depth via path products; deeper graphs require smaller Lipschitz constants to maintain accuracy
  - **Compression frequency**: More compression keeps memory bounded but adds (3/2^n)·diam(supp) error per compression step
  - Assumption: The paper's bound may be pessimistic; Remark 4.1 notes the √n exponent factor appears artifactual

- Failure signatures:
  - **Heavy-tailed inputs**: diam(supp(μ(n))) grows unboundedly; compression error dominates
  - **Non-Lipschitz operations**: Division, unbounded activation functions break Theorem 1.1 applicability
  - **Excessive graph depth**: Error grows as (1 + c√Δt)^k for Euler-Maruyama; may exceed tolerance for kN steps
  - **Path explosion**: If #P(S,Δ) is exponential, the bound becomes O(#P(S,Δ) / 2^n)—requires exponentially large n

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate Theorem 1.1 on a simple chain graph (3-5 nodes) with Gaussian inputs: measure W1(μΔ, μ(n),cΔ) and verify it decays as c/2^n. Vary n ∈ {4, 8, 12, 16} and plot log-error vs. n.
  2. Test break condition for heavy tails: Use Pareto-distributed inputs with shape parameter α ∈ {1.5, 2.0, 3.0}. Verify that error bound diverges for α ≤ 2 (infinite mean) and observe empirical behavior for finite-mean cases.
  3. Characterize depth-error tradeoff: For Euler-Maruyama on geometric Brownian motion (Section 4.1 parameters), vary N ∈ {100, 500, 1000, 1500} with fixed n. Verify log(W1) grows as c√N per Figure 3 (left panel).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the tight asymptotic bound on quantization error W1(μ, μ(n)) for generic discrete distributions, and can the current upper bound diam(supp(μ))/2n be improved?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Remark 2.1 states: "Finding a tighter bound for generic discrete distributions remains an open problem."
- Why unresolved: The current bound diverges for heavy-tailed distributions and is not sharp even for compactly supported distributions; the worst-case distribution achieves the bound but the constant is not optimal.
- What evidence would resolve it: A constructive proof showing either a distribution class achieving the current bound exactly, or a refined bound with explicit dependence on distributional properties beyond support diameter.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the √n factor in the exponent of the Euler-Maruyama error bound (Theorem 1.2) an artifact of the proof, or is it fundamentally necessary?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Remark 4.1 states: "The √n appearing in the exponent is likely an artifact of the proof. Indeed, it is a consequence of the estimated diam(E(n)) ≤ c√n."
- Why unresolved: The proof technique uses a crude diameter bound from Equation (13), but numerical simulations suggest the k√Δt term is sharp while leaving the √n factor uncertain.
- What evidence would resolve it: Either a refined analysis eliminating the √n factor, or construction of a counterexample showing the √n dependence is unavoidable for certain SDEs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Under the binary-branching assumption #in(v) ≤ 2, what is the asymptotic behavior of W1(μ(2n), T(μ(2n), n)) as n → ∞ for absolutely continuous μ?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5 discusses this as "a first step in understanding the compression error," noting it could improve bounds under the natural computational graph constraint.
- Why unresolved: The paper only bounds this indirectly via triangle inequality; direct analysis could yield tighter compression error bounds that exploit the binary structure of typical computational graphs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Explicit asymptotic rates for W1(μ(2n), T(μ(2n), n)) for standard distributions (e.g., Gaussian, uniform), with proof technique exploiting the 2n-to-n compression structure.

## Limitations

- The error bounds depend critically on Lipschitz continuity of all node functions, excluding common operations like division or ReLU activations with unbounded inputs
- The theoretical framework assumes finite moments and bounded supports, making it inapplicable to heavy-tailed distributions (Pareto with α ≤ 2 breaks the quantization error bound)
- The compression mechanism introduces additional error that scales with support diameter, which can be problematic for distributions with large or unbounded supports
- The bounds appear pessimistic in practice, with artifactual √n factors and potentially vacuous constants for deep or complex graphs

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The Wasserstein-1 propagation mechanism (Mechanism 1) and its Lipschitz composition property are mathematically sound and well-established
- **Medium Confidence**: The quantization error analysis (Mechanism 2) relies on unproven assumptions about support diameter behavior under recursive splitting, though numerical results support the claimed O(2^-n) decay
- **Medium Confidence**: The graph-topology error accumulation (Mechanism 3) follows logically from path counting, but the practical relevance depends on path structure that isn't characterized

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the mean-splitting quantization scheme on heavy-tailed distributions (Pareto with varying α) to empirically verify where the theoretical bounds break down
2. Characterize the actual Lipschitz constants for common operations in DCGs (ReLU, division, exponential) to identify which practical computations are excluded by the current framework
3. Perform a systematic study of path explosion effects by constructing DCGs with varying connectivity patterns and measuring when the #P(S,Δ) term makes bounds vacuous
