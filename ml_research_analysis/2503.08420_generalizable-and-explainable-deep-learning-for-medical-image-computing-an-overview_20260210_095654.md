# Generalizable and Explainable Deep Learning for Medical Image Computing: An Overview

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.08420
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08420
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** XGradCAM achieved highest ROAD confidence increase (0.12 for glioma tumor) outperforming GradCAM++ (0.09) and LayerCAM (0.08) in medical image classification tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of explainable AI techniques for medical image classification, addressing the critical need for transparency in clinical applications. The study systematically compares five XAI methods (GradCAM++, XGradCAM, EigenGradCAM, AblationCAM, LayerCAM) combined with ResNet50 on three medical datasets. Using the ROAD metric to quantitatively assess feature attribution quality, the experiments demonstrate that XGradCAM achieved the highest confidence increase in identifying pathological regions. The ResNet50 model achieved feasible accuracy across all datasets, with 86.31% accuracy in skin cancer classification. The findings suggest that certain XAI methods effectively highlight abnormal regions in medical images, with XGradCAM and AblationCAM showing particular promise for clinical applications due to their superior performance in identifying relevant features and higher confidence increases.

## Method Summary
The study employs ResNet50 as the backbone architecture for medical image classification across three datasets: brain tumor MRI (4 classes), skin cancer dermoscopy (7 classes), and chest X-ray (2 classes). The models are trained using SGD optimizer with learning rate 1e-3, weight decay 5e-4, and momentum 0.9 for 30 epochs. Images are resized to 224×224 with z-score normalization. Five XAI methods are applied to generate feature attribution maps, which are evaluated using the Remove and Debias (ROAD) metric to quantify the importance of highlighted regions. The ROAD metric systematically masks pixels identified as important and measures the resulting change in prediction confidence, with higher confidence increases indicating better feature attribution.

## Key Results
- XGradCAM achieved the highest ROAD confidence increase (0.12 for glioma tumor) compared to GradCAM++ (0.09) and LayerCAM (0.08)
- ResNet50 model achieved 86.31% accuracy in skin cancer classification with consistent F1 scores across all datasets
- AblationCAM showed high computational cost while XGradCAM provided better balance of performance and efficiency
- EigenGradCAM performed less effectively in specific scenarios, producing diffused attention maps for complex heterogeneity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (XGradCAM)
XGradCAM provides more precise localization of pathological features by computing the gradient of the target class score with respect to the final convolutional layer's feature maps. Unlike standard GradCAM, XGradCAM weights these feature maps using axiom-based gradients, which theoretically satisfy sensitivity constraints better, resulting in cleaner heatmaps that highlight abnormal regions with higher confidence scores (0.12 vs 0.09). The core assumption is that features activating neurons in the final convolutional layer correspond spatially to discriminative regions in the input image.

### Mechanism 2: Perturbation-based Faithfulness Evaluation (ROAD)
The ROAD metric quantitatively validates that the model relies on regions highlighted by XAI methods. It systematically removes (masks) pixels identified as "important" by the XAI heatmap and measures the resulting change in prediction confidence. A higher confidence increase implies the XAI method correctly identified features the model was actually using. The core assumption is that if an explanation is "faithful," removing the explained region should cause a significant drop in predictive power.

### Mechanism 3: Residual Feature Abstraction (ResNet50)
Residual connections in ResNet50 mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, allowing the network to learn hierarchical features from low-level edges to high-level anatomical structures without degradation. This enables feasible accuracy (e.g., 86.31% in skin cancer) across different datasets. The core assumption is that statistical patterns of pathology in training sets are representative of general population distributions in test sets.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses ResNet50 as the backbone for all experiments. Understanding how convolutional layers extract spatial hierarchies is required to interpret why gradient-based methods work on the final convolutional layer.
  - Quick check question: Why do we hook into the final convolutional layer rather than the fully connected layers for generating GradCAM heatmaps?

- **Concept: Gradient-based Explainability (CAM variants)**
  - Why needed here: The core comparison involves GradCAM++, XGradCAM, EigenGradCAM, etc. You must understand that these methods differ in how they weight feature maps using backpropagated gradients.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary mathematical difference between GradCAM++ and XGradCAM in terms of how they calculate importance weights for feature maps?

- **Concept: Perturbation Metrics (ROAD)**
  - Why needed here: The paper moves beyond visual inspection to quantitative evaluation using ROAD.
  - Quick check question: In the context of the ROAD metric, does a "positive" value indicate that the removed pixels were crucial for the model's original prediction or irrelevant?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Pipeline (Resize 224x224, Z-score normalization) -> Backbone (ResNet50) -> Classifier (FC layer mapping 2048 features -> num_classes) -> XAI Head (Gradient hooks on final conv layer) -> Evaluator (ROAD module)
- **Critical path:** Ensure the XAI hook correctly captures the gradients during the backward pass. A detached graph will result in zero heatmaps. Verify the confidence increase calculation logic.
- **Design tradeoffs:** XGradCAM vs. AblationCAM - Table III shows AblationCAM has high computational cost compared to XGradCAM. Use XGradCAM for real-time or large-batch processing; use AblationCAM only if maximum localization precision is required regardless of latency. EigenGradCAM - Avoid for skin cancer tasks; text notes it is "less effective" and "diffused" for complex heterogeneity.
- **Failure signatures:** Diffused Attention (heatmaps covering whole image or background), Low Confidence Increase (score close to 0 or negative), Overfitting (high training accuracy but low confidence increase in XAI metrics).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Reproduction: Train ResNet50 on Brain Tumor dataset and replicate 83.92% precision.
  2. XAI Verification: Generate heatmaps for 5 random glioma test samples using XGradCAM. Visually confirm heatmap overlaps with tumor region.
  3. Metric Validation: Run ROAD evaluation on those 5 samples. Check if confidence increase matches benchmark (~0.12). If negative, debug masking logic.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can hybrid XAI techniques effectively combine the granular focus of methods like LayerCAM with the broad class-level insights of GradCAM++ to provide more comprehensive explainability in medical diagnostics? The authors state that "hybrid XAI techniques may be developed, such as combining the meticulous focus of LayerCAM with the extensive class-level insights of GradCAM++ to achieve more comprehensive explainability." Existing methods often trade off between localizing fine-grained features and capturing global context, and integrating these approaches without generating conflicting or noisy visualizations remains a challenge.

### Open Question 2
Can computationally expensive XAI methods like AblationCAM be optimized or replaced by lightweight alternatives for real-time clinical application without sacrificing explanation fidelity? The Discussion notes that "high-cost techniques such as AblationCAM need to be optimized, or lightweight XAI methods need to be explored to address these challenges" regarding scalability and efficiency. While AblationCAM showed high confidence increases, it has high execution times, creating a bottleneck for deployment in resource-constrained or time-sensitive clinical environments.

### Open Question 3
How do current XAI techniques perform when applied to multimodal medical data or sequence data analysis beyond static image classification? The Conclusion states that this study "mainly focuses on image classification tasks, and can be extended to other medical fields in the future, such as sequence data analysis or multimodal data processing." The current study is limited to 2D images, and it is unclear if gradient-based visualization methods remain effective or interpretable when applied to temporal data or combined data types.

### Open Question 4
What specific visualization frameworks are required to simultaneously display model feature importance, uncertainty, and prediction confidence to improve clinical user interaction? The Discussion highlights that "improving the reliability and consistency... requires the development of higher quality and more detailed visualization tools" that allow users to "analyze model interpretations more easily." Current evaluations often rely on single metrics or static heatmaps, lacking a unified interface that allows clinicians to weigh the model's confidence against the visual explanation in real-time.

## Limitations
- The ROAD metric implementation details remain unclear with only a general GitHub reference provided
- Specific learning rate scheduling strategy during training is unspecified
- EigenGradCAM performed less effectively in specific scenarios, producing diffused attention maps for complex heterogeneity

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** ResNet50 baseline performance metrics (accuracy, F1 scores) are clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** XGradCAM superiority claims (0.12 confidence increase) rely on assumed ROAD implementation details
- **Medium Confidence:** AblationCAM computational cost characterization is qualitative without specific timing measurements

## Next Checks

1. Verify the exact ROAD metric implementation by testing on a simple binary classification problem where ground truth feature importance is known
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine if learning rate scheduling affects the confidence increase values reported for XGradCAM
3. Measure actual inference times for all five XAI methods to quantify the claimed computational burden difference between XGradCAM and AblationCAM
