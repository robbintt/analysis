# Mixture of Reasonings: Teach Large Language Models to Reason with Adaptive Strategies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.00606
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00606
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: MoR150 achieves 0.730 (2.2% improvement) with CoT prompting and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of task-specific prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs), which limits adaptability and efficiency. The authors propose Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous, task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR operates in two phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets for supervised fine-tuning. The results show that MoR significantly enhances performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines, demonstrating its ability to reason effectively without explicit guidance.

## Method Summary
MoR is a two-phase training framework that integrates diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs. In the Thought Generation phase, the model generates reasoning chain templates tailored to different tasks. In the SFT Dataset Construction phase, these templates are paired with benchmark datasets for supervised fine-tuning. This approach enables the LLM to autonomously adapt its reasoning strategy to the task at hand without requiring external prompt engineering. The framework is designed to enhance the model's ability to reason effectively across diverse scenarios, improving both performance and generalizability.

## Key Results
- MoR150 achieves 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting
- MoR150 achieves 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines
- Demonstrates autonomous, task-adaptive reasoning without explicit guidance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind MoR's success lies in its ability to embed diverse reasoning strategies into the LLM during training. By generating reasoning chain templates in the Thought Generation phase, the model learns to adapt its reasoning approach to the specific requirements of each task. The subsequent supervised fine-tuning with curated datasets reinforces these strategies, enabling the model to reason effectively without external prompts. This dual-phase approach ensures that the LLM can autonomously select and apply the most appropriate reasoning strategy for a given task, enhancing its overall performance and adaptability.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Why needed - to reinforce reasoning strategies with curated datasets; Quick check - verify dataset quality and alignment with reasoning templates.
2. **Reasoning Chain Templates**: Why needed - to provide structured approaches for diverse tasks; Quick check - assess template diversity and task coverage.
3. **Task-Adaptive Reasoning**: Why needed - to enable autonomous reasoning without external prompts; Quick check - test adaptability across unseen tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Thought Generation -> SFT Dataset Construction -> LLM Fine-Tuning

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves generating reasoning templates, pairing them with datasets, and fine-tuning the LLM to internalize these strategies.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances the need for diverse reasoning strategies with the computational overhead of dual-phase training. While SFT enhances performance, it may limit adaptability in scenarios with scarce or noisy data.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include overfitting to training datasets, limited generalizability to out-of-distribution tasks, and reduced adaptability in dynamic environments.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate MoR's performance on out-of-distribution tasks to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each training phase.
3. Test MoR's reasoning quality on adversarial inputs to evaluate robustness.
