# SimBA: Simplifying Benchmark Analysis Using Performance Matrices Alone

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17998
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17998
- Authors: Nishant Subramani; Alfredo Gomez; Mona Diab
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: Achieves 95% benchmark coverage using only 1.7% to 28.4% of original datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of simplifying benchmark analysis for language models by introducing SimBA, a three-phase framework that identifies representative dataset subsets from large benchmark collections. The method leverages performance matrices alone to reduce computational burden while maintaining predictive accuracy. Tested on HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite, SimBA demonstrates significant efficiency gains by selecting minimal yet representative subsets that preserve model rankings and predict performance on held-out models with near-zero mean squared error.

## Method Summary
SimBA operates through three distinct phases: "stalk" analyzes relationships between datasets and models using correlation analysis, "prowl" discovers representative subsets of datasets through greedy selection algorithms, and "pounce" predicts model performance using these optimized subsets. The framework processes performance matrices to identify datasets that maximize coverage while minimizing redundancy. By focusing on subset selection rather than model training, SimBA provides a computationally efficient approach to benchmark analysis that maintains high predictive accuracy across diverse model architectures and evaluation scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieved 95% coverage of HELM using only 6.25% of original datasets (1/16)
- Reduced MMLU to 1.7% of datasets (1/58) while maintaining 95% coverage
- Preserved model rankings and predicted held-out model performance with near-zero mean squared error
- Selected 28.4% (21/74) of BigBenchLite datasets for equivalent coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SimBA works by exploiting correlations in performance matrices to identify redundant datasets. When certain datasets exhibit high correlation with others across multiple models, they capture similar information about model capabilities. The greedy subset selection algorithm identifies datasets that maximize coverage of the performance space while minimizing redundancy. This approach assumes that performance on correlated datasets provides similar insights into model capabilities, allowing reduction without significant information loss.

## Foundational Learning
The framework builds on established concepts in subset selection and correlation analysis. It assumes that performance matrices contain sufficient information to characterize model capabilities and that dataset redundancy exists in large benchmark collections. The method leverages greedy algorithms for subset optimization, which have theoretical guarantees for coverage maximization. The approach assumes that maintaining model rankings and predicting held-out performance are sufficient metrics for benchmark simplification.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Correlation Analysis -> Subset Selection -> Performance Prediction
Critical path: Performance matrix input → Correlation analysis → Greedy subset selection → Predictive validation
Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs. coverage completeness, subset size vs. prediction accuracy
Failure signatures: Poor correlation structure, inadequate dataset diversity, overfitting to specific model architectures
First experiments: 1) Correlation analysis on small benchmark subset, 2) Greedy selection validation, 3) Predictive accuracy testing on held-out models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does SimBA's effectiveness vary across different benchmark domains beyond those tested?
- What is the impact of benchmark evolution over time on the stability of selected representative subsets?
- Can the framework be extended to incorporate additional information beyond performance matrices, such as dataset characteristics or task relationships?

## Limitations
- Focus on English-centric benchmarks limits generalizability to multilingual contexts
- Potential overfitting to specific model architectures tested in the study
- Assumes performance matrices alone capture sufficient information about model capabilities
- Greedy selection may miss globally optimal subset combinations
- Limited validation on emerging model architectures and novel benchmark designs

## Confidence
High: Core methodology and subset identification effectiveness
Medium: Generalizability across different model types and task domains
Low: Long-term stability of representative subsets and computational overhead analysis

## Next Checks
1. Test SimBA's effectiveness on multilingual and multimodal benchmarks to assess cross-domain applicability
2. Conduct longitudinal studies to evaluate how stable the identified representative subsets remain as new models are developed
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the impact of each SimBA phase on final prediction accuracy and efficiency gains
