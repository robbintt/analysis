# Investigating the Impact of Observation Space Design Choices On Training Reinforcement Learning Solutions for Spacecraft Problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06016
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06016
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: RL agents can learn spacecraft inspection tasks without sensors, but sensors improve training efficiency and policy quality

## Executive Summary
This paper examines how different observation space design choices affect reinforcement learning performance for spacecraft inspection tasks. The authors conducted ablation studies by training RL agents with various sensor configurations and reference frames while maintaining constant hyperparameters. The study demonstrates that while additional sensors are not strictly necessary for successful task completion, their inclusion generally accelerates training and produces more optimal, consistent behaviors. The Sun Angle and Uninspected Points sensors showed the best performance improvements. The choice between chief-centered (Hill's frame) and agent-centered reference frames had minimal impact on final performance, though agent-centered frames showed slight early-training advantages.

## Method Summary
The researchers trained reinforcement learning agents using PPO with fixed hyperparameters across different observation space configurations. They systematically varied sensor configurations (including Sun Angle, Uninspected Points, Range, and combinations thereof) and reference frames (chief-centered Hill's frame versus agent-centered frames) while keeping all other aspects of the training pipeline constant. Performance was evaluated based on task completion rates, training speed, and policy consistency across multiple runs. The spacecraft inspection task involved navigating to inspect specific points on a target spacecraft.

## Key Results
- RL agents successfully learned the inspection task without any additional sensors beyond basic state information
- Including sensors (particularly Sun Angle and Uninspected Points) accelerated training convergence and improved policy consistency
- Choice of reference frame (chief-centered vs agent-centered) had minimal impact on final performance, with agent-centered showing slight early-training advantages
- Range sensors provided the least performance benefit among the tested configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of observation space design choices stems from how they influence the agent's ability to form useful state representations. Sensors provide additional information that can simplify the learning problem by offering direct signals about task-relevant variables. For spacecraft inspection, knowing the Sun Angle helps with orientation and navigation, while tracking Uninspected Points provides clear progress indicators. The choice of reference frame affects how the agent perceives relative motion and spatial relationships, with agent-centered frames potentially offering more intuitive state representations for learning relative navigation tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Why needed - Fundamental framework for training agents to make sequential decisions; Quick check - Verify agent learns from reward signals and updates policy accordingly
- **Observation Space Design**: Why needed - Directly determines what information the agent has available for decision-making; Quick check - Confirm all relevant task variables are observable in the state representation
- **Reference Frames in Robotics**: Why needed - Affects how spatial relationships are represented and interpreted; Quick check - Ensure transformations between frames are mathematically consistent
- **Ablation Studies**: Why needed - Isolates the impact of individual design choices on overall performance; Quick check - Verify that only one variable changes between experimental conditions
- **Policy Gradient Methods (PPO)**: Why needed - Optimization algorithm used for training the RL agent; Quick check - Monitor KL divergence and loss curves for stable training
- **Spacecraft Dynamics**: Why needed - Governs the physical constraints and motion characteristics of the inspection task; Quick check - Validate that simulated dynamics match expected orbital mechanics

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Environment -> Observation Space -> RL Agent (PPO) -> Policy -> Actions -> Environment (feedback loop)
- **Critical Path**: State observation → Policy network → Action selection → Environment step → Reward calculation → Policy update
- **Design Tradeoffs**: More sensors increase information but may add complexity; chief-centered frames maintain global consistency while agent-centered frames may simplify relative navigation
- **Failure Signatures**: Slow/no learning indicates poor state representation; inconsistent policies suggest insufficient information or unstable training
- **First 3 Experiments**: 1) Train with minimal state information only, 2) Add Sun Angle sensor and compare learning curves, 3) Switch between chief-centered and agent-centered frames with identical sensor sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focused on a single spacecraft inspection task, limiting generalizability to other space robotics applications
- Only PPO algorithm was tested with fixed hyperparameters, preventing assessment of algorithm sensitivity to observation design
- Performance comparisons lacked detailed analysis of failure modes and edge case behaviors
- Statistical significance of observed performance differences was not thoroughly established

## Confidence
- High: RL agents can learn inspection tasks without additional sensors
- Medium: Sensors improve training efficiency and policy quality
- Medium-Low: Minimal impact of reference frame choice on final performance

## Next Checks
1. Test the same observation space configurations with alternative RL algorithms (SAC, TD3) to determine if PPO-specific factors influenced the results
2. Conduct stress tests by introducing perturbations, communication delays, or sensor noise to evaluate robustness differences between configurations
3. Expand the study to multiple distinct spacecraft tasks (docking, debris removal, formation flying) to assess whether observation space design principles transfer across problem domains
