# AutoNeural: Co-Designing Vision-Language Models for NPU Inference

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.02924
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02924
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Co-designed VLM architecture achieving 7× lower quantization error and 14× lower latency on NPUs while maintaining competitive accuracy

## Executive Summary
AutoNeural presents a vision-language model architecture specifically co-designed for efficient deployment on Neural Processing Units (NPUs), addressing the fundamental mismatch between GPU-optimized VLMs and resource-constrained NPU hardware. The paper identifies two critical bottlenecks: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) under low-precision constraints and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms. By replacing the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone using depthwise separable convolutions and integrating a hybrid Transformer-SSM language backbone based on State-Space Models (SSM) principles with gated convolutions, AutoNeural achieves linear-time complexity and significantly reduced memory I/O. The architecture demonstrates substantial performance improvements in both efficiency metrics and real-world deployment scenarios, particularly for automotive cockpit applications.

## Method Summary
The AutoNeural architecture employs a hardware-aware co-design approach that replaces conventional ViT encoders with MobileNetV5-style backbones using depthwise separable convolutions, which provide stable INT4/8/16 quantization performance. The language backbone integrates SSM principles with gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity and reduced memory I/O compared to traditional autoregressive attention mechanisms. This hybrid Transformer-SSM design specifically targets the quantization brittleness and I/O bottlenecks that plague standard VLMs on NPUs. The architecture was validated through deployment on the Qualcomm SA8295P NPU, demonstrating real-time performance capabilities for automotive cockpit applications with significant improvements in decoding speed and context window length while maintaining competitive accuracy on multimodal benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 7× lower quantization error compared to ViT-Transformer baselines under NPU precision constraints
- Demonstrates 14× lower end-to-end latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on multimodal benchmarks
- Delivers 3× decoding speed and 4× longer context window in real-world automotive cockpit deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of AutoNeural stems from addressing fundamental hardware-model mismatches through architectural modifications that are specifically optimized for NPU constraints. The MobileNetV5 backbone with depthwise separable convolutions provides stable quantization characteristics under low-precision constraints, eliminating the brittleness that affects ViTs. The hybrid Transformer-SSM language backbone with gated convolutions reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear time, directly addressing the I/O bottleneck of autoregressive attention mechanisms. This co-design approach ensures that the model's computational patterns align with NPU architecture strengths, enabling efficient parallel processing and memory access patterns that maximize hardware utilization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Essential for reducing parameter count and computational complexity while maintaining feature extraction capability in low-precision environments
- **State-Space Models (SSM)**: Provide linear-time sequence processing that eliminates the quadratic complexity bottleneck of traditional attention mechanisms
- **Gated Convolutions**: Enable controlled information flow and context integration while maintaining computational efficiency
- **INT4/8/16 Quantization**: Critical for NPU deployment but requires careful architectural design to prevent accuracy degradation
- **Hardware-Software Co-Design**: The fundamental principle that architectural optimizations must be guided by target hardware constraints and capabilities
- **I/O Bottleneck Analysis**: Understanding memory access patterns and their impact on computational efficiency is crucial for NPU optimization

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> MobileNetV5 Backbone -> Feature Fusion -> Hybrid Transformer-SSM Language Model -> Output

**Critical Path**: Vision Encoder (MobileNetV5) -> Multimodal Fusion -> Language Decoder (Hybrid SSM-Transformer) -> Output Generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture trades the superior feature extraction capability of ViTs for the quantization stability of depthwise separable convolutions, and replaces quadratic-attention Transformers with linear-time SSM-based mechanisms to achieve hardware efficiency at the cost of some modeling expressiveness.

**Failure Signatures**: Quantization instability manifesting as accuracy collapse, excessive latency due to inefficient memory access patterns, and context window limitations from attention mechanism constraints.

**First Experiments**:
1. Quantization sensitivity analysis comparing MobileNetV5 backbone versus ViT under INT4/8/16 constraints
2. Latency profiling of attention mechanism variants (standard vs. SSM-based) on target NPU hardware
3. Accuracy benchmarking of hybrid Transformer-SSM language models against pure Transformer baselines on multimodal tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance claims are heavily dependent on specific Qualcomm SA8295P NPU characteristics, limiting generalizability to other NPU architectures
- Lack of ablation studies prevents quantification of individual architectural contribution to overall performance gains
- Absence of specific benchmark results and accuracy metrics makes quality-cost tradeoff assessment difficult
- Potential degradation in multimodal reasoning capabilities from architectural simplifications is not addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in architectural design choices being hardware-appropriate for NPUs
- **Medium confidence** in absolute performance numbers due to hardware dependencies and lack of independent verification
- **Low confidence** in accuracy claims without supporting benchmark results or ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled ablation experiments to isolate contributions of MobileNetV5 backbone versus SSM-based language model
2. Test AutoNeural architecture across multiple NPU hardware platforms to verify generalizability
3. Provide comprehensive multimodal benchmark results with accuracy metrics to substantiate quality-cost tradeoff claims
