# ConSens: Assessing context grounding in open-book question answering
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.00065
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00065
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: Novel metric that measures context grounding in LLM-generated answers with ROC AUC 0.92

## Executive Summary
ConSens introduces a novel metric for assessing whether LLM-generated answers in open-book QA are truly grounded in provided context rather than relying on parametric knowledge. The method contrasts token perplexities with and without context to create a ratio that quantifies context influence on generated answers. Experiments demonstrate the metric's effectiveness in distinguishing grounded from ungrounded answers, detecting partial context removal, and identifying influential documents in RAG settings across three datasets.

## Method Summary
ConSens measures context grounding by calculating the ratio of token perplexities under two conditions: with and without context. This ratio, scaled to [-1, 1], quantifies how much the provided context influences the generated answer. The metric is computationally efficient, interpretable, and does not require external LLM APIs, making it scalable for practical assessment of context utilization in open-book QA systems.

## Key Results
- Effectively distinguishes grounded from ungrounded answers (ROC AUC 0.92)
- Detects partial context removal with high accuracy (ROC AUC 0.93)
- Identifies influential documents in RAG settings (ROC AUC 0.88)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the fundamental property that context-grounded answers should exhibit lower perplexity when the relevant context is available compared to when it is absent. By normalizing this difference across all tokens, ConSens creates a sensitive measure of context utilization that captures both the presence and strength of grounding signals in LLM outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Perplexity scoring**: Why needed - quantifies how well a language model predicts text; Quick check - verify perplexity decreases when context is relevant
- **Token-level analysis**: Why needed - captures fine-grained grounding signals; Quick check - ensure token-level scores aggregate meaningfully
- **Ratio normalization**: Why needed - enables comparison across different answer lengths; Quick check - confirm scores fall within [-1, 1] range
- **Context vs. no-context comparison**: Why needed - isolates the contribution of provided information; Quick check - verify that irrelevant context yields scores near zero
- **ROC AUC evaluation**: Why needed - provides standardized performance assessment; Quick check - confirm scores above 0.9 indicate strong discrimination

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Question -> LLM Generator -> Answer -> ConSens Metric (Context vs No-Context) -> Grounding Score
Critical path: Context provision → Answer generation → Perplexity calculation → Ratio computation → Grounding assessment
Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs. semantic depth; Model dependency vs. API independence; Granularity vs. interpretability
Failure signatures: Score near zero despite relevant context (possible semantic gap); High scores for irrelevant context (possible overfitting); Inconsistent scores across similar inputs (possible implementation issues)
First experiments: 1) Test with synthetic questions where ground truth is known; 2) Evaluate on partial context removal scenarios; 3) Compare against human-annotated grounding judgments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on perplexity-based scoring may capture surface-level lexical overlap rather than true semantic grounding
- Evaluation focuses primarily on English-language datasets, limiting generalizability to multilingual contexts
- Performance in resource-constrained environments or with extremely large contexts has not been evaluated

## Confidence
- High confidence: The metric's ability to distinguish grounded from ungrounded answers (ROC AUC 0.92)
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of detecting partial context removal and identifying influential documents
- Medium confidence: Computational efficiency claims and practical scalability

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ConSens performance across diverse languages and non-English QA datasets to assess cross-lingual generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing ConSens with alternative grounding metrics to isolate its unique contributions
3. Test the metric's behavior with increasingly large context windows to determine scalability limits and potential performance degradation
