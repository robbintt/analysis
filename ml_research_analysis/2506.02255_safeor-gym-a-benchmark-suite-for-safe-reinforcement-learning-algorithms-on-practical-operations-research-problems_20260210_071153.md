# SafeOR-Gym: A Benchmark Suite for Safe Reinforcement Learning Algorithms on Practical Operations Research Problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02255
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02255
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SafeOR-Gym introduces nine OR environments for evaluating safe RL algorithms on practical problems with constraints, revealing current approaches' limitations on mixed-integer and nonlinear problems.

## Executive Summary
SafeOR-Gym is a benchmark suite of nine operations research environments designed to evaluate safe reinforcement learning algorithms. The environments model realistic planning, scheduling, and control problems with structured constraints, hybrid discrete-continuous action spaces, and cost-based constraint violations. Integrated with the OmniSafe framework via the Constrained Markov Decision Process interface, SafeOR-Gym enables standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms including CPO, TRPOLag, P3O, OnCRPO, and DDPGLag. Experimental results across multiple environments demonstrate that while some tasks are tractable, others expose fundamental limitations in current approaches, particularly for problems involving mixed-integer decisions and nonlinear constraints.

## Method Summary
SafeOR-Gym implements nine OR problems as CMDPs with deterministic case study parameters and specified stochastic elements. The benchmark suite integrates seamlessly with OmniSafe, using a standardized experimental grid configuration for algorithm evaluation. Training is performed using AWS g4dn.xlarge instances with NVIDIA T4 GPUs, with episode counts varying by environment complexity. Performance is measured using average episodic reward and cost over 10 evaluation episodes, compared against Gurobi-derived "optimal" baselines. The environments capture realistic operational constraints including inventory limits, network flows, and unit commitment requirements.

## Key Results
- Safe RL algorithms show varying success across environments, with some tasks proving tractable while others expose fundamental limitations
- Current approaches struggle significantly with mixed-integer variables and nonlinear, nonconvex constraints in industrial OR problems
- Some environments (like BlendingEnv) cause algorithms to get stuck at zero-reward due to highly non-convex constraints
- Parameter sensitivity is high, with GridStorageEnv performance partially attributed to suboptimal cost parameter tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark suite works by providing standardized, reproducible environments that capture the complexity of real-world OR problems. By modeling these as CMDPs with explicit cost-based constraints, SafeOR-Gym creates a realistic testbed where safety violations have meaningful operational consequences. The integration with OmniSafe ensures consistent algorithm evaluation and comparison across different safe RL approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs):** Framework for modeling sequential decision-making with safety constraints. Needed to represent real-world operational constraints. Quick check: Verify CMDP formulation matches OmniSafe interface requirements.
- **Operations Research Problem Formulation:** Understanding network flows, inventory management, and scheduling as optimization problems. Needed to appreciate constraint complexity. Quick check: Review problem formulation in Supplementary Material.
- **Safe RL Algorithm Taxonomy:** Familiarity with CPO, TRPOLag, P3O, OnCRPO, and DDPGLag approaches. Needed to understand comparative performance. Quick check: Verify algorithm implementations in OmniSafe.
- **Gurobi Optimization Baseline:** Mixed-integer programming solver for computing near-optimal solutions. Needed as performance reference. Quick check: Compare Gurobi output with paper's "optimal" values.
- **Constraint Satisfaction vs. Penalty Methods:** Understanding different approaches to handling safety constraints. Needed to interpret algorithm behavior. Quick check: Monitor constraint violation metrics during training.
- **Stochastic vs Deterministic Environments:** Recognition of noise sources in real-world problems. Needed for proper evaluation. Quick check: Verify stochastic parameters match specification distributions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Environment Parameters -> SafeOR-Gym Wrapper -> OmniSafe Interface -> RL Algorithm -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path:** Problem instance definition → Environment implementation → OmniSafe CMDP interface → Algorithm training → Constraint violation monitoring → Performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The suite prioritizes realistic constraint modeling over computational efficiency, using cost-based violations rather than hard constraints to enable gradient-based learning. Mixed-integer variables are handled through hybrid action spaces rather than pure continuous approximations.

**Failure Signatures:** Algorithms getting stuck at zero-reward indicates inability to find feasible regions; high cost with low reward suggests constraint violations; train/eval gaps indicate overfitting to constraint-free regions.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Run GTEPEnv with CPO and verify reward/cost curves match reported trends
2. Execute InvMgmtEnv with stochastic demand and compare to deterministic baseline
3. Test BlendingEnv with DDPGLag to observe non-convex constraint handling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** How can safe RL algorithms be adapted to effectively handle mixed-integer decision variables and non-convex constraints inherent in industrial operations research problems? The paper shows existing algorithms perform poorly on such problems, with P3O and DDPGLag struggling on non-convex environments like BlendingEnv.

**Open Question 2:** Can safety constraints be directly encoded into neural network policies through architectural innovations or differentiable constraint satisfaction layers? Current methods relying on soft penalties or projection mechanisms fail in highly constrained or non-smooth action spaces.

**Open Question 3:** Can automated parameter tuning methods be developed for constraint-aware algorithms like CPO to ensure consistent performance across diverse environments without manual overhead? The analysis shows performance sensitivity to cost parameter tuning, particularly in GridStorageEnv.

## Limitations
- Missing hyperparameter specifications (neural network architectures, learning rates, Lagrange multiplier initialization) limit exact reproduction
- Stochastic elements may not be fully reproducible without exact random seed values
- Gurobi "optimal" baselines may not represent true global optima for non-convex constraint problems
- Performance rankings may be sensitive to unreported experimental details

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Benchmark suite design, OmniSafe integration, and fundamental claim about algorithm limitations on mixed-integer/nonlinear problems
- **Medium Confidence:** Specific algorithm performance rankings due to potential sensitivity to hyperparameters and random seeds
- **Low Confidence:** Absolute reward and cost values without access to exact problem instances and noise realizations

## Next Checks
1. Re-run GTEPEnv environment with Gurobi and compare "optimal" reward to paper's reported value
2. Perform sensitivity analysis on InvMgmtEnv by varying learning rates and hidden layer sizes
3. Track constraint satisfaction proportion in BlendingEnv versus Gurobi solution to quantify "sticking at zero-reward" phenomenon
