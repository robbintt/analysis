# Evaluating LLM-based Agents for Multi-Turn Conversations: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.22458
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22458
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Systematic review of LLM-based agent evaluation methods using dual taxonomies for goals and methods

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews evaluation methods for large language model (LLM)-based agents in multi-turn conversational settings. Using a PRISMA-inspired framework, the authors analyzed nearly 250 scholarly sources to develop two interrelated taxonomy systems: one defining what to evaluate (task completion, response quality, user experience, memory and context retention, planning and tool integration) and another explaining how to evaluate (annotation-based evaluations, automated metrics, hybrid strategies, self-judging methods). The study identifies key components of LLM-based agents and their evaluation dimensions, capturing both traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE scores and advanced techniques reflecting the dynamic nature of multi-turn dialogues. Based on the analysis of existing studies, the authors propose future directions including development of scalable, real-time evaluation pipelines, enhanced privacy-preserving mechanisms, and robust metrics that capture dynamic multi-turn interactions.

## Method Summary
The survey employed a PRISMA-inspired literature review methodology, analyzing 276 relevant papers from 1,123 unique records to develop a comprehensive evaluation framework. The method involves systematic categorization of evaluation goals into four interconnected areas (end-to-end experience, interaction patterns, memory spans, and planning) paired with methodological approaches (annotation-based, annotation-free, hybrid, and self-judging). The framework maps specific evaluation dimensions to appropriate assessment techniques, creating a structured approach for evaluating LLM-based agents across task completion, response quality, memory retention, and planning capabilities. The authors emphasize the importance of coupling goal definition with methodological selection to prevent fragmented or incomplete evaluation.

## Key Results
- Dual taxonomy system couples evaluation goals with assessment methods to reduce fragmentation
- Identifies memory evaluation must match retention spans (turn, conversation, permanent) to appropriate criteria
- Proposes planner evaluation as continuous control loop with four interdependent components
- Highlights need for adaptive metrics capturing multi-turn interaction dynamics holistically
- Calls for privacy-preserving evaluation pipelines using trusted execution environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured dual taxonomies reduce evaluation fragmentation by simultaneously defining evaluation goals and methodologies
- Mechanism: The framework couples "what to evaluate" (task completion, response quality, memory, planning) with "how to evaluate" (annotation-based, automated, hybrid, self-judging) to create a systematic mapping that prevents piecemeal assessment
- Core assumption: Comprehensive evaluation requires explicit categorization along both goal and method dimensions; implicit understanding leads to gaps
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our study offers a structured approach by developing two interrelated taxonomy systems: one that defines what to evaluate and another that explains how to evaluate"
  - [section 2] "Evaluations can be fragmented without a structured approach. To address this, we categorize evaluation goals into four interconnected areas"
  - [corpus] Evidence is weak; related papers focus on specific evaluation aspects but not the dual taxonomy structure itself
- Break condition: If evaluation frameworks treat goals and methods as independent rather than interdependent, the coupling mechanism fails

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Memory evaluation effectiveness depends on matching retention span (turn, conversation, permanent) to appropriate evaluation criteria and forms
- Mechanism: Information urgency determines retention strategy; turn memory requires per-turn accuracy, conversation memory demands context coherence over 40-600+ turns, permanent memory needs cross-session persistence. Forms (textual vs. parametric) trade off retrieval efficiency against adaptability
- Core assumption: Memory is not a single capability but a hierarchical cognitive resource with distinct operational requirements at each temporal level
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Identifies "memory and context retention" as key evaluation dimension
  - [section 2.3] "Memory in agent is not merely a storage unit but a dynamic cognitive resource that bridges the gap between transient interactions and enduring persona continuity"
  - [section 2.3.1] Specific benchmarks: LongEval [109] assesses retention over 40+ utterances; Maharana et al. [140] demonstrates dialogues spanning 600 turns
  - [corpus] "Multi-Faceted Evaluation of Tool-Augmented Dialogue Systems" addresses tool-related memory but not the temporal hierarchy explicitly
- Break condition: If evaluation benchmarks treat all memory spans uniformly or fail to differentiate short-term recall from long-term integration, the hierarchy mechanism produces misleading results

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Planner evaluation requires a continuous control loop with four interdependent components: task modeling, decomposition, adaptation, and reflection
- Mechanism: Task modeling establishes grounded understanding; decomposition breaks goals into executable sequences; adaptation responds to shifting user intents and environmental feedback; reflection validates plans through verification and selection before execution. Each component depends on the previous one functioning correctly
- Core assumption: Planning is not linear but cyclical; errors in early stages propagate and compound without metacognitive safeguards
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.4] "We view the planning process not as a linear pipeline, but as a continuous control loop comprising four essential dimensions"
  - [section 2.4.4] "Reflection serves as the metacognitive safeguard in the planning pipeline, ensuring that agents do not merely generate actions but rigorously evaluate their validity and optimality before and during execution"
  - [corpus] "T1: A Tool-Oriented Conversational Dataset for Multi-Turn Agentic Planning" addresses planning but focuses on dependencies rather than the full control loop
- Break condition: If any component in the loop (especially reflection) is missing or weak, error propagation occurs and multi-turn coherence degrades

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Multi-turn dialogue state management**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how agents maintain context across turns is prerequisite to evaluating memory spans and interaction patterns
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why turn-level BLEU scores fail to capture cross-turn coherence?

- Concept: **Annotation-free vs. annotation-based evaluation tradeoffs**
  - Why needed here: The survey fundamentally compares these approaches; knowing their strengths (precision vs. scalability) enables informed method selection
  - Quick check question: Why would LLM-as-judge methods be preferred for open-ended response quality but not for API call accuracy?

- Concept: **Agent architecture components (tool-use, memory, planning)**
  - Why needed here: Evaluation goals map directly to these architectural modules; understanding each component's function enables targeted assessment
  - Quick check question: How does an agent's tool-use capability interact with its planning and memory components?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
Evaluation Framework -> What to Evaluate (Goals) -> End-to-end Experience, Action/Tool-Use, Memory, Planner
Evaluation Framework -> How to Evaluate (Methods) -> Annotation-based, Annotation-free, Hybrid strategies, Self-judging

- Critical path: Start with end-to-end experience metrics (capturing real-world usability), then drill into component-specific evaluations. This prevents optimizing subcomponents while missing systemic failures

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Annotation-based vs. annotation-free: High precision/interpretability vs. scalability/adaptability
  - Textual vs. parametric memory forms: Full context access with retrieval overhead vs. efficient inference with editing challenges
  - Point-wise vs. pair-wise evaluation: Individual quality scoring vs. comparative ranking (pair-wise aligns better with human judgment but requires more computation)

- Failure signatures:
  - Memory leakage/drift over prolonged interactions (context retention failures)
  - Error propagation across turns (early-stage planning mistakes compound)
  - Hallucination in tool-use (invoking non-existent tools or misinterpreting outputs)
  - Evaluation method mismatch (using reference-based metrics for open-ended generation)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline taxonomy mapping: Take an existing multi-turn agent evaluation project and map its metrics onto the dual taxonomy. Identify which "what" dimensions are underspecified and which "how" methods dominate. This reveals gaps immediately
  2. Memory span stress test: Evaluate your agent using benchmarks that span different temporal scales (turn-level accuracy, 40+ turn retention, cross-session persistence). Compare performance across spans to identify where memory breaks down
  3. Annotation-free vs. annotation-based correlation: Run both evaluation approaches on the same multi-turn dialogue set. Calculate correlation between LLM-as-judge scores and human annotation. If correlation is weak (<0.6), either the judge prompt or the annotation guidelines need refinement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can evaluation frameworks develop adaptive metrics that holistically capture the dynamic interplay of multi-turn interactions rather than assessing turns in isolation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that current methods "assess conversation turns in isolation rather than holistically" and call for "adaptive metrics that can dynamically adjust to variations in context"
- Why unresolved: Existing metrics fail to track cumulative context drift or inter-turn dependencies effectively
- What evidence would resolve it: A benchmark scoring context maintenance across extended turns equal to per-turn fluency

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can "test-time evaluation" strategies be integrated to enable agents to perform real-time self-assessment of coherence and factual accuracy during generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that agents currently lack the capacity for "inline self-assessment" and proposes integrating "test-time evaluation strategies" for immediate correction
- Why unresolved: Agents currently produce output without internal feedback loops to detect hallucinations or context loss before the turn ends
- What evidence would resolve it: An agent architecture that validates chain-of-thought against memory constraints before responding

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can evaluation pipelines be designed to assess conversation quality in a privacy-preserving manner, such as using Trusted Execution Environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors argue that traditional methods risk exposing sensitive data and future work must explore "privacy-preserving mechanisms" like TEEs or federated learning
- Why unresolved: Rigorous evaluation currently requires centralized data access, conflicting with user confidentiality requirements in sensitive domains
- What evidence would resolve it: A pipeline returning metrics on encrypted data without decrypting raw text

## Limitations

- Potential publication bias toward established evaluation methods, limiting coverage of emerging techniques
- Insufficient analysis of cross-cultural evaluation variations and domain-specific benchmarks (healthcare, legal, financial)
- Does not address computational cost implications of different evaluation strategies
- Limited concrete implementation guidelines for integrating multiple evaluation methods

## Confidence

- High confidence in dual taxonomy structure's relevance and key evaluation dimensions identification
- Medium confidence in completeness of method categorization due to potential missing emerging techniques
- Low confidence in specific metric threshold recommendations due to application-specific dependencies

## Next Checks

1. **Taxonomy Completeness Audit**: Cross-reference the proposed evaluation dimensions against 10 recently published LLM evaluation papers not included in the original survey. Identify any missing categories or methods that should be incorporated

2. **Method Correlation Analysis**: For 3-5 established multi-turn dialogue benchmarks (MT-Bench, MultiWOZ, ToolBench), run both annotation-based and annotation-free evaluation methods on the same agent outputs. Calculate inter-method correlation coefficients to validate whether different approaches produce consistent quality assessments

3. **Memory Span Benchmark Replication**: Replicate the memory retention evaluation using LongEval benchmark [109] with a sample agent. Measure performance degradation across 40+ turn dialogues and compare against conversation-level metrics to validate the proposed temporal hierarchy in memory evaluation
