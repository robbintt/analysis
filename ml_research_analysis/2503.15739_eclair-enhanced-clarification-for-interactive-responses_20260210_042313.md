# ECLAIR: Enhanced Clarification for Interactive Responses

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.15739
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15739
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Unified framework for ambiguity detection and clarification in enterprise AI assistants, achieving 17-point precision improvement over baselines

## Executive Summary
ECLAIR is a unified framework designed to detect ambiguities and generate context-aware clarification questions in enterprise AI assistants. The system integrates multiple downstream agents to identify when clarification is needed and produce appropriate follow-up questions in a single pass. Tested on real user queries from the Adobe Experience Platform AI Assistant, ECLAIR demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline methods.

The framework addresses a critical challenge in enterprise AI assistants where user queries often contain ambiguities that can lead to incorrect responses. By providing intelligent clarification capabilities, ECLAIR helps ensure more accurate and relevant responses to user queries. The system's evaluation shows it achieves an F1 score of 0.657 compared to 0.520 for baseline methods, with a 17-point improvement in precision.

## Method Summary
ECLAIR employs a unified framework that integrates multiple downstream agents to detect ambiguities and generate clarification questions simultaneously. The system processes user queries through a single pass mechanism that identifies ambiguous elements and generates context-aware follow-up questions. The framework was specifically evaluated on real user queries from the Adobe Experience Platform AI Assistant, comparing its performance against baseline clarification methods using standard precision and F1 score metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieved 17-point improvement in precision over baseline methods
- F1 score of 0.657 compared to baseline F1 score of 0.520
- Higher precision in identifying when clarification is needed
- Demonstrated practical deployment through two use cases: entity disambiguation (dataset vs segment) and product disambiguation (Adobe Workfront vs Experience Manager)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The unified approach allows simultaneous ambiguity detection and clarification generation, eliminating the need for separate processing stages. By integrating multiple downstream agents, the system can leverage diverse perspectives and contextual information to make more informed decisions about when and how to request clarification. The single-pass design reduces latency and computational overhead compared to multi-stage approaches, while the context-aware generation ensures clarification questions are relevant to the specific user query and domain context.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Ambiguity Detection in Natural Language Processing**
   - Why needed: User queries often contain ambiguous terms, references, or intents that require clarification
   - Quick check: Evaluate detection accuracy on ambiguous vs unambiguous query datasets

2. **Context-Aware Question Generation**
   - Why needed: Clarification questions must be relevant to the specific domain and user context
   - Quick check: Measure relevance scores of generated questions against ground truth clarifications

3. **Multi-Agent Integration**
   - Why needed: Different agents can specialize in detecting different types of ambiguities
   - Quick check: Compare performance of single-agent vs multi-agent configurations

4. **Enterprise AI Assistant Architecture**
   - Why needed: Understanding integration points and data flow in enterprise systems
   - Quick check: Map system integration points and data dependencies

5. **Performance Evaluation Metrics**
   - Why needed: Proper evaluation requires understanding precision, recall, and F1 score implications
   - Quick check: Calculate confusion matrices for different threshold settings

6. **Single-Pass Processing Optimization**
   - Why needed: Real-time systems require efficient processing to maintain user experience
   - Quick check: Measure latency improvements compared to multi-pass alternatives

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> Ambiguity Detector -> Context Analyzer -> Clarification Generator -> Response

**Critical Path**: The system processes queries through the ambiguity detector first, which identifies potential ambiguities. Simultaneously, the context analyzer evaluates the query's domain-specific context. These components feed into the clarification generator, which produces appropriate follow-up questions when needed.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The unified single-pass approach trades some potential accuracy gains from separate processing stages for improved efficiency and reduced latency. The multi-agent design increases complexity but provides more comprehensive ambiguity detection. The context-aware generation requires more computational resources but produces more relevant clarifications.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failures include over-detection of ambiguities leading to unnecessary clarification requests, under-detection missing critical ambiguities, and context misinterpretation resulting in irrelevant clarification questions. The system may also struggle with highly domain-specific terminology or unusual query structures.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison test measuring precision, recall, and F1 scores against existing clarification methods
2. Cross-domain validation testing system performance on queries from different enterprise AI assistants
3. A/B testing with real users measuring task completion rates and satisfaction with clarification requests

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Tested only on data from a single enterprise AI assistant (Adobe Experience Platform), limiting generalizability
- 17-point improvement figure lacks context regarding baseline method characteristics
- Evaluation focuses primarily on precision and F1 scores without comprehensive false positive analysis
- No user satisfaction metrics or real-world deployment challenges addressed

## Confidence
- Major claims: Medium
- Performance metrics are well-documented and show consistent improvements
- Narrow scope of testing (single enterprise system) introduces uncertainty about broader applicability
- Practical deployment claims are supported but lack long-term performance data

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain testing across multiple enterprise AI assistants to validate generalizability beyond the Adobe platform
2. Implement A/B testing with real users to measure practical impact on user satisfaction and task completion rates
3. Perform longitudinal studies to assess system performance and user adaptation over extended deployment periods
