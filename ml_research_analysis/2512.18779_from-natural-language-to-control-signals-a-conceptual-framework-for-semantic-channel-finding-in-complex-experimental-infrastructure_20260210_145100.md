# From Natural Language to Control Signals: A Conceptual Framework for Semantic Channel Finding in Complex Experimental Infrastructure

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18779
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18779
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Four-paradigm framework achieves 90-97% accuracy for semantic channel finding across four operational facilities spanning two orders of magnitude in scale

## Executive Summary
Modern experimental facilities require natural-language interfaces to control systems, but existing methods struggle with scale, legacy naming conventions, and data quality. This work formalizes semantic channel finding as an architectural problem and introduces a four-paradigm framework: direct in-context lookup for small curated sets, hierarchical navigation for structured naming, interactive agent exploration for compositional addresses, and ontology-based search for facility-agnostic queries. Implementations at four operational facilities demonstrate practical deployment across diverse control-system architectures from clean hierarchies to legacy environments.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual framework that transforms natural language queries into control system channel addresses through four distinct paradigms. The approach addresses the challenge of mapping human-readable descriptions to machine-readable control signals in complex experimental infrastructure. The framework adapts to different naming conventions and system architectures, enabling semantic understanding of control system nomenclature across facilities ranging from small labs to large-scale user facilities. Implementations demonstrate practical utility with accuracy rates of 90-97% on expert-curated query sets.

## Key Results
- Four-paradigm framework achieves 90-97% accuracy on expert-curated natural language queries
- Successfully deployed across four operational facilities spanning two orders of magnitude in scale
- Handles diverse naming conventions from clean hierarchical structures to legacy systems
- Demonstrates practical utility for real-world experimental infrastructure control

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing the semantic channel finding problem into four complementary approaches that match different control system architectures and naming conventions. Direct in-context lookup leverages small curated datasets for immediate matches, hierarchical navigation exploits structured naming patterns, interactive agent exploration handles compositional addresses through iterative refinement, and ontology-based search provides facility-agnostic semantic understanding. This multi-paradigm approach ensures robustness across the heterogeneous landscape of experimental control systems, where no single method can address all scenarios effectively.

## Foundational Learning
**Semantic Channel Finding**: The process of mapping natural language descriptions to specific control system channels; needed because operators think in terms of experimental goals rather than technical channel names; quick check: can the system correctly map "increase beam intensity" to the appropriate control channel?
**Four-Paradigm Architecture**: Direct lookup, hierarchical navigation, interactive exploration, and ontology-based search; needed because different facilities have fundamentally different naming conventions and architectures; quick check: does the facility's naming scheme align with any of the four paradigms?
**Control System Scale Spectrum**: Facilities ranging from small labs with dozens of channels to large facilities with thousands; needed to understand the applicability boundaries of each paradigm; quick check: what is the approximate number of control channels in the target facility?
**Legacy Naming Conventions**: Historical naming patterns that may lack semantic clarity; needed because many operational facilities cannot easily migrate to modern naming schemes; quick check: are channel names based on physical locations, equipment types, or arbitrary identifiers?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Natural Language Query -> Paradigm Selection -> Channel Resolution -> Control Signal Output
**Critical Path**: Query understanding → Paradigm identification → Channel address resolution → Signal validation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Direct lookup offers speed but limited scope; hierarchical navigation provides structure but requires clean naming; interactive exploration handles complexity but introduces latency; ontology-based search enables flexibility but demands semantic maintenance
**Failure Signatures**: Unrecognized terminology → Paradigm mismatch → Ambiguous channel resolution → Signal validation failure
**First Experiments**:
1. Test direct in-context lookup on a small curated channel set with 10-20 predefined queries
2. Evaluate hierarchical navigation on a facility with clearly structured naming conventions
3. Assess ontology-based search performance on facility-agnostic queries using standardized terminology

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions, but several implications emerge from the work. The framework's performance on open-ended natural language interactions beyond expert-curated queries remains untested. The computational overhead and maintenance requirements for the interactive agent exploration and ontology-based search components are not fully characterized. The framework's applicability to non-English languages and diverse cultural naming conventions has not been evaluated.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on expert-curated queries, not capturing open-ended natural language complexity
- Performance metrics reported only for predefined query sets, leaving uncertainty about real-world generalization
- Framework assumes clean partitioning into four paradigms, yet many facilities exhibit hybrid characteristics
- Implementation details for interactive exploration and ontology-based search remain sparse regarding computational overhead

## Confidence
- High: Demonstrated accuracy on expert-curated queries (90-97%)
- Medium: Framework applicability across diverse facility scales and architectures
- Low: Real-world generalization to open-ended natural language interactions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with untrained operators using open-ended natural language queries to assess real-world usability and error patterns
2. Implement and measure performance overhead for the interactive agent exploration paradigm in live production environments
3. Test framework robustness on facilities with hybrid naming conventions that combine hierarchical, legacy, and ad-hoc elements
