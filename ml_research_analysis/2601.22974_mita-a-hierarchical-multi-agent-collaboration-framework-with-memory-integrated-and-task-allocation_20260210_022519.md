core_contribution: This paper introduces MiTa, a hierarchical multi-agent framework
  that integrates centralized task allocation with episodic memory summarization to
  address inefficiencies in LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. MiTa organizes agents
  into a manager-member hierarchy, where the manager uses allocation and summary modules
  to coordinate tasks globally and maintain long-horizon context.

# MiTa: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework with Memory-integrated and Task Allocation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22974
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22974
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Hierarchical multi-agent framework with task allocation and episodic memory summarization improves coordination efficiency by 54-68% in VirtualHome-Social environment

## Executive Summary
MiTa is a hierarchical multi-agent collaboration framework designed to address inefficiencies in LLM-based multi-agent systems. It introduces a centralized manager-member hierarchy where the manager coordinates task allocation and maintains episodic memory summarization for long-horizon context preservation. The framework aims to reduce inter-agent conflicts and improve coordination efficiency by integrating task allocation decisions with memory-based context management. Experimental results in the VirtualHome-Social environment demonstrate significant improvements in task completion efficiency compared to baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
MiTa organizes agents into a hierarchical structure with a centralized manager overseeing multiple member agents. The manager employs two key modules: a task allocation module that distributes tasks globally to minimize conflicts and redundancies, and a summary module that maintains episodic memory to preserve relevant historical information across long task horizons. This architecture enables coordinated decision-making while maintaining context awareness through memory integration. The framework is evaluated in the VirtualHome-Social environment, where it demonstrates improved performance through reduced task completion steps and maintained robustness even when member agents use weaker models.

## Key Results
- Achieved 54-68% reduction in task completion steps compared to baseline methods
- Maintained robust performance even when member agents used weaker models
- Demonstrated improved coordination through reduced inter-agent conflicts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MiTa works by addressing two core challenges in multi-agent collaboration: efficient task distribution and long-term context preservation. The centralized manager provides global oversight that prevents redundant work and conflicting actions through intelligent task allocation. Simultaneously, the episodic memory summarization captures and maintains relevant historical context, enabling agents to make informed decisions without being overwhelmed by raw historical data. This combination of hierarchical coordination and memory integration creates a system that scales more effectively than flat multi-agent approaches while maintaining task coherence over extended time horizons.

## Foundational Learning

**Hierarchical Agent Organization**
- Why needed: Flat agent structures suffer from coordination overhead and redundant work
- Quick check: Can the manager effectively monitor and coordinate multiple agents without becoming a bottleneck?

**Task Allocation**
- Why needed: Prevents inter-agent conflicts and ensures efficient work distribution
- Quick check: Does the allocation module minimize redundant tasks while respecting agent capabilities?

**Episodic Memory Summarization**
- Why needed: Preserves long-term context without overwhelming agents with raw historical data
- Quick check: Does the summary module maintain relevant information while filtering noise?

**Centralized Coordination**
- Why needed: Provides global oversight for conflict resolution and efficiency optimization
- Quick check: Can the manager balance coordination overhead with performance benefits?

**Long-Horizon Context Management**
- Why needed: Enables agents to maintain task coherence across extended sequences
- Quick check: Does the memory system effectively bridge information gaps across time steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Manager -> Task Allocation Module -> Member Agents
Manager -> Summary Module -> Memory Storage
Member Agents -> Manager (feedback)

**Critical Path**
Manager receives task context → Task allocation module distributes work → Member agents execute → Summary module updates memory → Manager coordinates next allocation

**Design Tradeoffs**
The centralized manager provides global coordination but may create bottlenecks. Memory summarization reduces information overhead but risks losing important details. The hierarchy simplifies coordination but may limit agent autonomy.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor task allocation leads to agent conflicts and redundant work. Ineffective memory summarization causes agents to lose context or repeat mistakes. Manager overload results in delayed coordination and reduced system responsiveness.

**Three First Experiments**
1. Test manager's ability to allocate tasks without conflicts in simple scenarios
2. Evaluate memory summarization effectiveness in preserving key context
3. Measure performance degradation when memory module is disabled

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to VirtualHome-Social environment, raising generalizability concerns
- Lacks ablation studies to isolate contributions of individual components
- Does not analyze scalability with increasing agent numbers or task complexity

## Confidence
- Task allocation effectiveness: High
- Episodic memory summarization: Medium
- Hierarchical structure benefits: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MiTa on additional multi-agent environments beyond VirtualHome-Social to test generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to measure individual contributions of task allocation, episodic memory, and hierarchical coordination
3. Analyze scaling behavior by increasing agent numbers and task complexity to assess performance under larger workloads
