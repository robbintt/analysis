core_contribution: This paper surveys the evolution of Event Extraction (EE) in the
  large language model (LLM) era, identifying how traditional EE tasks have shifted
  from static, sentence-level extraction to dynamic, cognitive scaffolds for intelligent
  systems. It outlines key challenges such as hallucination under weak constraints,
  fragile temporal and causal linking over long contexts, and limited long-horizon
  knowledge management.

# Event Extraction in Large Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19537
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19537
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey on how Event Extraction (EE) has evolved from static sentence-level extraction to dynamic cognitive scaffolds for intelligent LLM systems, highlighting challenges like hallucination, fragile temporal linking, and long-horizon knowledge management.

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines the transformation of Event Extraction (EE) in the large language model era, documenting how traditional EE tasks have evolved from isolated sentence-level extraction to dynamic cognitive scaffolds supporting intelligent systems. The paper identifies critical challenges including hallucination under weak constraints, fragile temporal and causal linking over long contexts, and limited long-horizon knowledge management capabilities. Through systematic analysis of methodologies, datasets, and evaluation protocols, the survey positions EE as a system-level structured interface that enables reliability, reasoning, and memory in LLM-centered solutions.

The survey provides a forward-looking perspective on EE's evolution, proposing that it should serve as an agent-ready perception and memory layer for open-world systems. By leveraging event schemas for grounding, employing event-centric structures for stepwise reasoning, and enabling relation-aware retrieval with graph-based RAG, the paper outlines how EE can overcome current limitations and support more robust, intelligent applications across diverse domains.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing research and methodologies in Event Extraction within the LLM era through comprehensive literature review and systematic categorization. The survey methodology involves analyzing traditional EE tasks and their transformation, identifying key challenges such as hallucination and temporal linking issues, and proposing methodological frameworks including event schema-based verification, event-centric reasoning structures, and graph-based relation-aware retrieval. The approach covers diverse application settings and evaluates existing datasets and protocols while proposing future directions for EE development as a system-level interface.

## Key Results
- EE has evolved from static, sentence-level extraction to dynamic cognitive scaffolds for intelligent LLM systems
- Major challenges include hallucination under weak constraints, fragile temporal and causal linking over long contexts, and limited long-horizon knowledge management
- Proposed solutions include leveraging event schemas for grounding, event-centric structures for reasoning, and graph-based RAG for relation-aware retrieval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of the proposed EE evolution stems from aligning extraction methodologies with LLM capabilities and limitations. Event schemas provide structural constraints that ground extractions in verifiable patterns, reducing hallucination by forcing outputs to conform to known event templates. Event-centric reasoning structures enable stepwise processing that breaks down complex temporal and causal relationships into manageable components, addressing the fragility of long-context linking. Graph-based RAG systems create relation-aware retrieval mechanisms that overcome context window limitations by maintaining structured knowledge connections rather than relying on linear context processing.

## Foundational Learning

**Event Schemas and Slot Constraints**
- Why needed: Provides structural templates that ground event extractions in verifiable patterns, reducing hallucination
- Quick check: Test schema compliance rates across different extraction models and datasets

**Temporal and Causal Linking**
- Why needed: Essential for maintaining coherent event sequences and understanding cause-effect relationships in long contexts
- Quick check: Measure accuracy degradation as context window sizes increase

**Relation-Aware Retrieval**
- Why needed: Enables efficient knowledge access beyond context windows by maintaining structured relationships
- Quick check: Compare retrieval accuracy between graph-based and standard RAG approaches

**Episodic Memory Management**
- Why needed: Supports long-horizon knowledge retention and updates that exceed context limitations
- Quick check: Evaluate memory update efficiency and retrieval accuracy over extended timeframes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Event Input -> Schema Validation -> Temporal Linking -> Causal Reasoning -> Memory Storage -> Relation Retrieval -> Output Generation

**Critical Path**
Schema validation -> Temporal linking -> Causal reasoning (these components must operate sequentially to maintain extraction integrity)

**Design Tradeoffs**
Structural constraint enforcement vs. extraction flexibility, computational efficiency vs. accuracy in long-context processing, static schema adherence vs. adaptive learning requirements

**Failure Signatures**
Hallucination spikes when schema constraints are relaxed, temporal linking failures at specific context lengths, retrieval accuracy drops when relation graphs become too complex, memory update bottlenecks with high-frequency changes

**First Experiments**
1. Schema compliance rate comparison across baseline and proposed verification methods
2. Temporal linking accuracy measurement across varying context window sizes
3. Graph-based RAG vs. standard RAG retrieval performance comparison

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Broad synthesis approach may sacrifice depth for comprehensive coverage across multiple domains
- Forward-looking predictions about system-level architectures remain largely theoretical and unproven at scale
- Proposed solutions are conceptual frameworks rather than demonstrated, validated systems

## Confidence
- High confidence in established observations about LLM capabilities and limitations in event extraction
- Medium confidence in proposed methodological frameworks and their cross-domain applicability
- Low confidence in forward-looking predictions about system-level architectures due to lack of empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the proposed event schema-based verification system on multiple real-world datasets to quantify hallucination reduction compared to baseline approaches
2. Conduct empirical studies measuring the degradation of temporal and causal linking accuracy as context windows expand, to establish concrete thresholds for current LLM limitations
3. Develop and evaluate an event-centric memory management system that demonstrates measurable improvements in long-horizon knowledge retrieval compared to standard RAG approaches, including quantitative analysis of retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency
