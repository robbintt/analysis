# DiaDem: Advancing Dialogue Descriptions in Audiovisual Video Captioning for Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.19267
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19267
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DiaDem outperforms Gemini series in dialogue description accuracy (65.9% REF, 79.3% ASR vs. 63.1%/71.0% and 63.6%/74.8%)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating accurate dialogue descriptions in audiovisual video captioning, which is critical for downstream understanding and generation tasks. Existing models struggle to produce faithful speaker attributions and precise utterance transcriptions in complex dialogue scenarios. To tackle this, the authors propose DiaDem, an audiovisual video captioning model enhanced through a two-stage training pipeline: first, a high-quality dataset is synthesized for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with foundational dialogue description skills, then a difficulty-partitioned two-stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) strategy is employed to further improve utterance transcription and speaker attribution accuracy. To systematically evaluate dialogue description quality, the authors introduce DiaDemBench, a comprehensive benchmark focusing on both speaker attribution accuracy and utterance transcription fidelity across diverse dialogue scenarios. Experimental results show that DiaDem outperforms the Gemini series in dialogue description accuracy while maintaining competitive performance on general audiovisual captioning benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a two-stage training pipeline to enhance dialogue description capabilities in audiovisual video captioning. First, a high-quality synthetic dataset is generated for supervised fine-tuning to provide the model with foundational dialogue description skills. Second, a difficulty-partitioned two-stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) strategy is employed to further refine utterance transcription and speaker attribution accuracy. The synthetic data generation process aims to create diverse dialogue scenarios with accurate speaker attributions and transcriptions. The GRPO strategy partitions training data by difficulty level and applies policy optimization techniques to progressively improve model performance on more challenging dialogue descriptions. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, the authors introduce DiaDemBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess speaker attribution accuracy and utterance transcription fidelity across various dialogue scenarios.

## Key Results
- DiaDem achieves 65.9% REF and 79.3% ASR accuracy in dialogue description, outperforming Gemini models (63.1%/71.0% and 63.6%/74.8%)
- The model maintains competitive performance on general audiovisual captioning benchmarks while excelling at dialogue-specific tasks
- DiaDemBench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework focusing on speaker attribution accuracy and utterance transcription fidelity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of DiaDem stems from its systematic approach to addressing dialogue description challenges through specialized training and evaluation. The two-stage pipeline first establishes foundational dialogue description skills through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic data, ensuring the model learns basic speaker attribution and transcription patterns. The difficulty-partitioned GRPO then progressively refines these skills by focusing on increasingly complex dialogue scenarios, allowing the model to develop robust capabilities for handling challenging cases. The synthetic data generation process can be carefully controlled to cover diverse dialogue scenarios, speaker configurations, and complexity levels that might be underrepresented in real-world data. DiaDemBench provides targeted evaluation that isolates dialogue-specific performance from general captioning abilities, enabling more precise assessment of improvements in this domain.

## Foundational Learning
- **Audiovisual video captioning**: The task of generating textual descriptions for video content by processing both visual and audio information. Why needed: Forms the baseline capability that DiaDem builds upon for dialogue-specific enhancements.
- **Speaker attribution accuracy**: The ability to correctly identify which speaker produced each utterance in dialogue scenarios. Why needed: Critical for creating coherent and accurate dialogue descriptions in multi-speaker situations.
- **Utterance transcription fidelity**: The precision with which spoken words are converted to text. Why needed: Ensures dialogue descriptions accurately capture what was said, not just who said it.
- **Synthetic data generation**: Creating artificial training data with controlled characteristics. Why needed: Allows coverage of diverse dialogue scenarios that may be rare or difficult to collect in real-world datasets.
- **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**: A reinforcement learning technique that optimizes policies relative to group performance. Why needed: Enables progressive improvement on increasingly difficult dialogue description tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Synthetic Data Generator -> SFT Module -> Difficulty Partitioner -> GRPO Optimizer -> DiaDem Model -> DiaDemBench Evaluator

**Critical Path**: The core training pipeline follows this sequence: synthetic data generation → supervised fine-tuning → difficulty-based partitioning → two-stage GRPO optimization. Each stage builds upon the previous one, with the synthetic data providing the foundation for SFT, which in turn prepares the model for the more sophisticated GRPO training.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The use of synthetic data enables comprehensive coverage of dialogue scenarios but may introduce domain gaps between synthetic and real data. The difficulty-partitioned approach allows focused training on challenging cases but requires careful calibration of difficulty levels. The two-stage GRPO strategy provides progressive refinement but increases training complexity and computational requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor speaker attribution accuracy may indicate insufficient diversity in synthetic training data or inadequate representation of speaker identification cues. Low utterance transcription fidelity could suggest limitations in audio processing or language understanding capabilities. Suboptimal performance on real-world data despite strong benchmark results might reveal domain adaptation issues between synthetic and actual dialogue scenarios.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate DiaDem's performance on diverse dialogue-rich video datasets beyond the proposed benchmark to assess real-world generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of synthetic data quality, difficulty partitioning, and GRPO strategy to identify key performance drivers
3. Analyze synthetic training data distribution to ensure adequate coverage of different dialogue complexity levels, speaker configurations, and potential biases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance comparisons with Gemini models lack specific details about baseline model variants, parameter counts, and training configurations, making it difficult to assess whether improvements stem from architectural innovations or scale differences
- The synthetic data generation process is described as producing "high-quality" data but lacks detailed analysis of data quality metrics, diversity coverage, and potential biases introduced during synthesis
- DiaDemBench, while comprehensive, is a newly introduced benchmark raising questions about its representativeness and ability to capture the full complexity of real-world dialogue scenarios across diverse video domains

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of synthetic data quality, difficulty partitioning in GRPO, and the two-stage training pipeline to determine which components drive the performance improvements
2. Evaluate DiaDem on established, diverse dialogue-rich video datasets (beyond the proposed benchmark) to verify generalization across different dialogue styles, languages, and video domains
3. Analyze the synthetic training data distribution to assess coverage of different dialogue complexity levels, speaker configurations, and potential biases that could affect real-world performance
