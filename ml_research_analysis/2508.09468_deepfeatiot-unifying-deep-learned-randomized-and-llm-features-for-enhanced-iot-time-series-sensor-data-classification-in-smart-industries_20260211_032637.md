# DeepFeatIoT: Unifying Deep Learned, Randomized, and LLM Features for Enhanced IoT Time Series Sensor Data Classification in Smart Industries

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.09468
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09468
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Key outcome**: DeepFeatIoT achieves 96.97% average accuracy and 96.28% F1 score on four IoT datasets by unifying learned local/global features, randomized convolutional kernels, and LLM features.

## Executive Summary
DeepFeatIoT addresses the challenge of classifying heterogeneous IoT time series sensor data, which is complicated by issues such as missing metadata, varying sampling frequencies, inconsistent units, and irregular timestamps. The proposed model integrates learned local and global features, non-learned randomized convolutional kernel features, and pre-trained large language model (LLM) features into a unified architecture. A dense feature transformation module ensures balanced contribution from features of different scales. Evaluated across four real-world IoT datasets, DeepFeatIoT achieved an average accuracy of 96.97% and F1 score of 96.28%, outperforming state-of-the-art models including DeepHeteroIoT and MultiROCKET. The ablation study confirmed the critical role of the unified feature representation, with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.0) demonstrating substantial performance gains.

## Method Summary
DeepFeatIoT classifies IoT time series by extracting four complementary feature types: learned local patterns via multi-scale convolutional kernels, learned global patterns via Bi-GRU, non-learned randomized convolutional features (10,000 kernels), and pre-trained GPT-2 features. A dense feature transformation (DFT) module projects each feature vector to 64 dimensions before concatenation to prevent domination by high-dimensional features. The model uses focal loss to handle class imbalance and achieves state-of-the-art results on four heterogeneous IoT datasets. Training involves 200 epochs with Adam optimizer, categorical focal cross-entropy loss, and automatic selection of best weights based on test accuracy.

## Key Results
- DeepFeatIoT achieved 96.97% average accuracy and 96.28% F1 score across four IoT datasets
- Outperformed DeepHeteroIoT by 2.9% accuracy and MultiROCKET by 4.6% accuracy
- Ablation study showed each feature type contributes significantly, with Cohen's d > 1.0 effect sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Feature diversity from multiple extraction paradigms improves generalization on heterogeneous IoT sensor data. The model extracts four complementary feature types: (1) learned local patterns via multi-scale convolutional kernels (sizes 3, 5, 7, 11), (2) learned global patterns via Bi-GRU with ReLU, (3) non-learned randomized convolutional features (10,000 kernels), and (4) pre-trained GPT-2 features. These capture distinct aspects of time series structure that any single extractor would miss.

### Mechanism 2
The Dense Feature Transformation (DFT) module prevents feature domination by normalizing dimensionality before fusion. Raw feature vectors have vastly different dimensions (Fr ∈ R20000, Fl ∈ R768, Fg ∈ R128, Fc ∈ R256). DFT projects each to R64 via learned dense layers with layer normalization before concatenation, ensuring balanced contribution rather than letting high-dimensional sparse features dominate gradients.

### Mechanism 3
Pre-trained LLM features transfer sequential pattern recognition to time series without domain-specific adaptation. Raw time series values are tokenized as text (numbers as character sequences separated by special characters) and fed through all 12 GPT-2 transformer blocks. Global average pooling extracts a 768-dim vector. The pre-trained attention patterns capture long-range dependencies that would require extensive training data to learn from scratch.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Multi-scale convolution for time series
  - Why needed here: IoT sensors exhibit patterns at different temporal scales (e.g., daily cycles vs. momentary spikes). Kernel sizes 3, 5, 7, 11 capture these simultaneously.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why concatenating outputs from different kernel sizes is preferable to a single dilated kernel?

- **Concept**: Randomized convolutional kernels (ROCKET family)
  - Why needed here: When labeled data is scarce (Swiss dataset: 346 samples, 11 classes), learned features overfit. Random kernels provide discriminative features without gradient-based training.
  - Quick check question: How does pooling (global max + proportion of positive values) convert convolution outputs to fixed-length features?

- **Concept**: Transfer learning from NLP to time series
  - Why needed here: Pre-training on large text corpora provides useful sequential priors. Understanding tokenization strategies for numerical data is essential.
  - Quick check question: What information is lost when tokenizing floating-point numbers as text strings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw time series → Multi-scale conv blocks → Bi-GRU stack + ReLU → 10,000 random kernels + pooling → GPT-2 + global avg pool → DFT module → MLP head → softmax output
- **Critical path**: DFT is the bottleneck—incorrect dimensionality here breaks feature balance; Random kernel configuration differs from original ROCKET; GPT-2 tokenization must preserve numerical precision
- **Design tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. speed (10.8 minutes average runtime); GPT-2 branch is the slowest component; Memory: 10,000 random kernels + GPT-2 activations require significant GPU memory; Simplification option: Remove LLM branch for 2-3% accuracy drop with faster inference
- **Failure signatures**: Accuracy drops on Swiss dataset specifically → check class imbalance handling; Random features dominate → verify DFT weights are learning; GPT-2 produces NaN → tokenization may be producing out-of-vocabulary tokens
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation by branch: Remove each feature type (RF, PF, learned local, learned global) individually and measure accuracy drop on held-out test set
  2. DFT vs. direct concatenation: Compare full model against DC variant to quantify fusion module contribution
  3. Dataset sensitivity: Train on each dataset independently, then evaluate zero-shot transfer to other datasets to assess domain specificity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can LLM-based feature extraction using direct numerical tokenization outperform domain-specific adapter or transformation approaches for IoT time series classification? The authors note their approach uses GPT-2 "without domain-specific adapter blocks like previous studies or re-programming or transformation (e.g., frequency domain conversion) of raw time series," and explicitly state this "paves the way for future research."

### Open Question 2
How robust is DeepFeatIoT's performance to variations in key architectural hyperparameters, including the DFT output dimension (64), randomized kernel count (10,000), and kernel configurations? The DFT module transforms all features to exactly 64 dimensions, and 10,000 randomized kernels with fixed length 9 and dilation 4 are used, but no sensitivity analysis justifies these specific choices.

### Open Question 3
Does DeepFeatIoT maintain its performance advantage when applied to IoT sensor datasets from domains substantially different from smart infrastructure, such as healthcare wearables or industrial manufacturing? While the paper claims generalization, all four evaluation datasets originate from similar smart city, airport, and building domains; datasets from healthcare, agriculture, or manufacturing are not tested.

## Limitations
- GPT-2 tokenization strategy for numerical time series data is not fully specified, which could affect LLM feature extraction consistency
- Focal loss hyperparameters (gamma, alpha) remain unspecified, potentially impacting class imbalance handling
- No computational complexity analysis provided, making scalability assessment difficult
- Limited evaluation on datasets with severe class imbalance or longer time series sequences

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Feature fusion mechanism effectiveness (proven by ablation study with Cohen's d > 1.0), overall classification accuracy claims (96.97% average), and performance superiority over baseline models
- **Medium confidence**: DFT module's specific implementation details and its exact contribution to balanced feature representation
- **Medium confidence**: LLM feature extraction methodology and its transfer learning effectiveness from text to numerical time series

## Next Checks
1. Implement controlled ablation studies removing each feature type (learned local, learned global, randomized, LLM) to quantify individual contributions and verify the claimed Cohen's d > 1.0 effect sizes
2. Test the model on additional IoT datasets with different characteristics (longer sequences, more severe class imbalance) to assess generalization limits and identify breaking conditions
3. Benchmark computational efficiency and memory usage across different hardware configurations, particularly focusing on the GPT-2 branch's resource requirements and potential optimization opportunities
