## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.21562
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21562
- Authors: Yihang Duan

- Primary result: Current AIGC detection methods often overfit to generator-specific features and lack reproducibility due to missing preprocessing details in publications

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the reproducibility challenges in AI-generated content (AIGC) image detection, addressing the lack of reproducibility and poor generalizability in current detection methods. Through analyzing 7 key papers, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method, the research identifies that detection methods often overfit to exclusive features of specific generators and that papers frequently omit critical preprocessing details. Experimental results show that basic performance can be reproduced when following core procedures, but performance drops sharply when preprocessing disrupts key features or when testing across different generators. The study provides empirical evidence for improving reproducibility in AIGC detection technologies and offers directions for researchers to disclose experimental details more comprehensively and verify generalizability.

## Method Summary
The study analyzes 7 representative AIGC detection papers and identifies common reproducibility issues. It constructs a lightweight test dataset with 1,000 real and 1,000 generated images from multiple sources (Chameleon dataset, sdv2, sdxl, flux generators, CivitAI, Pixiv). The research reproduces a VAE reconstruction-based detection method from Rajan et al. (2024), training classifiers on real images paired with their VAE reconstructions to capture VAE-specific high-frequency artifacts. The reproduced method is evaluated on the custom dataset, testing cross-generator generalization and robustness to preprocessing operations like JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and resizing. The study focuses on binary classification distinguishing real images from AI-generated images, measuring detection accuracy and generalization performance.

## Key Results
- Detection methods trained on single generators overfit to VAE-specific high-frequency artifacts, achieving high accuracy on that generator but failing to generalize to images from other generators
- Common preprocessing operations (JPEG compression, resizing, Gaussian noise) destroy the high-frequency features that detectors rely on, causing significant performance drops
- When preprocessing disrupts key features or when testing across different generators, detection performance drops sharply despite successful reproduction of original results under controlled conditions
- Current AIGC detection papers frequently omit critical preprocessing details, making exact reproduction difficult even when code is available

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VAE reconstruction-based training aligns detector features with the artifacts injected during the final generation step.
- Mechanism: In Latent Diffusion models, the VAE performs dimension elevation as the last generation step, injecting VAE-specific high-frequency artifacts. By training classifiers on real images paired with their VAE reconstructions, the detector learns these artifacts without needing to capture features from earlier diffusion steps.
- Core assumption: The artifacts are consistently produced by the VAE architecture across different images and are the primary detectable signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "VAE-specific high-frequency artifacts are key detection features"
  - [section 5]: "as the last link in the generation process of Diffusion models, the artifacts introduced by VAE are key identifiers of generated images"
  - [corpus]: CINEMAE paper confirms "image-based detectors still struggle with overfitting to generator-specific artifacts"
- Break condition: Preprocessing operations (JPEG compression, resizing, Gaussian noise) obscure or destroy the high-frequency features before detection.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: High-frequency domain artifacts serve as the primary classification signal for current AIGC detectors.
- Mechanism: Generated images exhibit distinct frequency and energy spectra patterns in high-frequency regions compared to real images. Detectors learn to classify based on presence/absence of these spectral signatures rather than semantic content.
- Core assumption: High-frequency artifacts are preserved in the training and test data, and real images lack these specific spectral patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4]: Figure 3 shows "after real images are reconstructed by the VAE of the corresponding generator, they acquire the same high-frequency features"
  - [section 4]: "features used for model classification exist in the high-frequency part"
  - [corpus]: FBA²D and DINO-Detect papers similarly focus on frequency-based detection, suggesting this is a common mechanism
- Break condition: JPEG compression, Gaussian noise addition, or resizing introduce competing high-frequency artifacts that the model learns instead of generator signatures.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Single-generator training causes detectors to overfit to VAE-specific artifacts rather than universal AIGC characteristics.
- Mechanism: Each VAE architecture produces unique high-frequency signatures. Detectors trained on images from one generator learn to recognize that generator's specific artifacts, which do not transfer to images from generators with different VAEs.
- Core assumption: Different generators have meaningfully different VAE architectures; universal AIGC features may not exist or are not captured by current training approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "methods overfit to exclusive features of specific generators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images"
  - [section 4]: "models trained on reconstructions from a specific VAE can effectively detect images generated by models with that VAE, but struggle to generalize to other generators"
  - [corpus]: Corpus papers consistently show cross-generator generalization as an unsolved challenge
- Break condition: Testing on images from a generator with a different VAE architecture than training data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Frequency Domain Analysis (Fourier Transform)**
  - Why needed here: All detection mechanisms operate on high-frequency spectral signatures; understanding frequency domain is essential for debugging why detectors fail under preprocessing.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why JPEG compression specifically affects high-frequency components of an image?

- Concept: **VAE Architecture in Latent Diffusion Models**
  - Why needed here: The VAE is identified as the source of detectable artifacts; understanding its role in the generation pipeline clarifies why reconstruction-based detection works.
  - Quick check question: What two roles does the VAE play in a Latent Diffusion model, and which step injects detectable artifacts?

- Concept: **Overfitting to Spurious Features in Binary Classification**
  - Why needed here: Detectors can achieve high accuracy by learning dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful signals; this explains reproducibility failures.
  - Quick check question: If a detector trained on JPEG-compressed data achieves 95% accuracy on compressed test images but 50% on uncompressed images, what has it likely learned?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Pipeline: Real images → VAE reconstruction → Paired training data → Classifier
  - Detection Pipeline: Input image → Preprocessing (optional) → Feature extraction → Binary classification
  - Frequency Analysis: FFT → Energy spectrum → Feature comparison

- Critical path:
  1. Ensure training data has NOT undergone preprocessing that destroys high-frequency artifacts (no JPEG compression, no resizing interpolation that adds artifacts)
  2. Match VAE architecture between training reconstruction and target generator
  3. Verify preprocessing consistency between training and inference

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single-generator training: High accuracy on that generator, poor generalization vs. Multi-generator training: Lower peak accuracy but better robustness
  - Data alignment (reconstruction-based): Better reproducibility vs. Mixed-generator training: Better claims of generalization but harder to verify
  - Strict preprocessing control: Fragile in deployment vs. Augmented training: May learn wrong features

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy drops from ~90%+ to ~50% when testing on new generator → Detector overfit to source generator's VAE
  - Reproduced results significantly below paper claims → Preprocessing differences (check JPEG quality, resizing method)
  - Near-perfect accuracy on one class, random on another → Dataset imbalance causing feature shortcut learning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Frequency spectrum baseline**: Run FFT on real images vs. generated images from your target generator; verify visible spectral differences exist in high-frequency regions before building detectors.
  2. **Preprocessing sensitivity test**: Take a working detector and test on images with/without JPEG compression (quality 75 vs. 95) and different resizing methods; measure accuracy drop to quantify fragility.
  3. **Cross-generator transfer test**: Train on reconstructions from one VAE (e.g., SDv2), test on images from another generator (e.g., SDXL, Flux); document the generalization gap explicitly.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do common, universal features exist among different generators that can be used to simplify model training and detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section explicitly poses this question: "Based on this, a key question arises: Do there exist common features among different generators that can be used to simplify model training and detection processes?"
- Why unresolved: The study finds that current detectors primarily overfit to VAE-specific high-frequency artifacts unique to specific generators (e.g., SDv2 vs. SDXL) rather than learning intrinsic universal features, causing generalization failure.
- Evidence: Identification of a feature set shared across diverse architectures (e.g., Diffusion, GAN, Autoregressive) that allows a single model to generalize without retraining on each specific generator.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can detection methods be developed to rely on features that survive common preprocessing operations like JPEG compression and resizing?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors conclude that "detection performance drops sharply when preprocessing disrupts key features" and show experimentally that common operations like JPEG compression "obscure" the high-frequency artifacts current models rely on.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that standard preprocessing destroys the VAE-specific artifacts used for detection, but it does not propose a method robust to these transformations, leaving a gap for real-world application.
- Evidence: A detector that maintains high accuracy on images processed with standard social media compression and resizing, without mistaking compression artifacts for generation artifacts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can detection strategies adapt as generative models evolve to minimize or remove distinct high-frequency artifacts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that "easily detectable explicit artifacts are gradually decreasing" due to the iterative optimization of VAE structures (moving from fixed-step convolutional designs), which increases the difficulty of cross-generator detection.
- Why unresolved: The study confirms that current methods depend on these fading artifacts; it does not explore what features remain detectable in future generator iterations where such artifacts are intentionally minimized.
- Evidence: Successful detection of images from next-generation models explicitly designed to suppress high-frequency periodic artifacts, or a theoretical framework identifying fundamental constraints in image generation that persist despite architectural optimization.

## Limitations
- The study focuses exclusively on Latent Diffusion models, leaving unclear whether findings about VAE-specific artifacts generalize to other AIGC architectures like GANs or autoregressive models.
- The lightweight test dataset, while practical for reproducibility testing, may not capture the full complexity of real-world AIGC detection challenges, potentially limiting external validity.
- Critical preprocessing details from the original papers were obtained through author communication rather than being publicly documented, raising questions about long-term reproducibility when those authors are no longer available.

## Confidence
- High: Detection methods overfit to generator-specific features (confirmed through cross-generator testing showing sharp performance drops)
- Medium: High-frequency artifacts are the primary detection mechanism (supported by frequency analysis but not definitively proven as the sole signal)
- Low: VAE reconstruction-based training is the optimal approach for reproducibility (only tested on one paper's method, may not generalize to other detection architectures)

## Next Checks
1. Test the reproduced detection method on images from GAN-based generators (StyleGAN, BigGAN) to verify if high-frequency artifact detection generalizes beyond Latent Diffusion models
2. Systematically vary JPEG compression quality (10-95) and measure detection accuracy degradation to quantify the exact preprocessing tolerance limits
3. Implement multi-generator training with VAE reconstructions from multiple sources and measure whether this improves cross-generator generalization while maintaining high accuracy on known generators
