# From Hallucinations to Jailbreaks: Rethinking the Vulnerability of Large Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24232
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24232
- Authors: Haibo Jin; Peiyan Zhang; Peiran Wang; Man Luo; Haohan Wang
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: A unified theoretical framework modeling hallucinations and jailbreak vulnerabilities as interconnected optimization problems, validated empirically on LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-4.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the surprising interconnection between two critical vulnerabilities in large foundation models: hallucinations and jailbreak attacks. The authors demonstrate that defenses against one vulnerability often impact the other, suggesting a deeper relationship than previously recognized. They propose a unified theoretical framework that models jailbreaks as token-level optimization problems and hallucinations as attention-level optimization problems. Through empirical validation on multimodal models, they establish that both vulnerabilities share similar loss convergence patterns and gradient behaviors driven by attention dynamics, revealing a common failure mode in large foundation models.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a unified theoretical framework by modeling jailbreak attacks as token-level optimization problems and hallucinations as attention-level optimization problems. They formulate two key propositions: Similar Loss Convergence, showing that loss functions for both vulnerabilities converge similarly when optimizing for target-specific outputs, and Gradient Consistency in Attention Redistribution, demonstrating that both exhibit consistent gradient behavior driven by shared attention dynamics. The framework is validated empirically on LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-4, examining optimization trends and gradient alignments across both vulnerability types.

## Key Results
- Established two theoretical propositions showing shared optimization patterns between hallucinations and jailbreak vulnerabilities
- Validated propositions empirically on LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-4 with consistent optimization trends and aligned gradients
- Demonstrated that mitigation techniques for hallucinations can reduce jailbreak success rates, and vice versa
- Revealed a shared failure mode in large foundation models through attention dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper reveals that hallucinations and jailbreak vulnerabilities are interconnected through shared attention mechanisms and optimization dynamics. Both vulnerabilities emerge from similar underlying processes where the model's attention mechanisms can be manipulated to produce target-specific outputs, whether through adversarial prompting (jailbreaks) or erroneous generation (hallucinations). The unified framework shows that these vulnerabilities follow parallel optimization trajectories and exhibit consistent gradient behaviors, suggesting they are manifestations of the same fundamental weakness in how large models process and attend to information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Critical for understanding how models process information and where vulnerabilities can be exploited; quick check involves tracing attention weight distributions during both normal and adversarial inputs.
- **Optimization Landscapes**: Essential for modeling how vulnerabilities emerge and can be mitigated; quick check involves comparing loss surface topologies between benign and adversarial optimization scenarios.
- **Gradient-Based Attacks**: Fundamental to understanding jailbreak methodologies; quick check involves analyzing gradient consistency across different attack vectors.
- **Token-Level vs. Attention-Level Optimization**: Distinguishes between different vulnerability exploitation strategies; quick check involves comparing optimization convergence rates at different abstraction levels.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Input -> Tokenizer/Encoder -> Attention Layers -> Feed-Forward Networks -> Output Generator -> Vulnerability Exploitation Points
- **Critical Path**: Attention redistribution serves as the critical vulnerability pathway, where both hallucinations and jailbreaks exploit similar attention manipulation mechanisms
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing model expressiveness (enabling complex reasoning) against vulnerability surface area (attention manipulation susceptibility)
- **Failure Signatures**: Both vulnerabilities manifest through abnormal attention weight distributions and similar loss convergence patterns during optimization
- **First Experiments**: 1) Trace attention weight evolution during adversarial optimization, 2) Compare loss convergence rates across vulnerability types, 3) Test cross-vulnerability mitigation effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical validation limited to only two multimodal models (LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-4), limiting generalizability
- Theoretical propositions rely on specific optimization assumptions that may not hold across diverse model families
- Limited experimental scope for demonstrating practical effectiveness of cross-vulnerability mitigation techniques
- Does not address computational overhead or performance trade-offs of proposed mitigation strategies

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework linking hallucinations and jailbreak vulnerabilities: Medium
- Empirical validation showing consistent optimization trends and aligned gradients: Medium
- Practical demonstration that hallucination defenses reduce jailbreak success rates: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the unified framework across a broader range of model architectures (e.g., text-only LLMs, vision transformers, audio models) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of attention mechanisms versus other factors in both vulnerabilities to validate the attention-level optimization hypothesis.
3. Evaluate the long-term stability and performance trade-offs of mitigation techniques that address both vulnerabilities simultaneously across extended deployment scenarios.
