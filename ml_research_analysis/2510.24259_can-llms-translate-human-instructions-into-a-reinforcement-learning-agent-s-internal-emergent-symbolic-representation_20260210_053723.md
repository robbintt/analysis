# Can LLMs Translate Human Instructions into a Reinforcement Learning Agent's Internal Emergent Symbolic Representation?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.24259
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24259
- **Authors:** Ziqi Ma; Sao Mai Nguyen; Philippe Xu
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LLMs show limited ability to translate natural language instructions into emergent symbolic representations, with performance highly sensitive to partition granularity and task complexity.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models can bridge the semantic gap between human natural language instructions and the emergent symbolic representations learned by hierarchical reinforcement learning agents. The researchers evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT, Claude, Deepseek, Grok) on their ability to translate natural language instructions into symbolic region sequences used by STAR algorithm agents in Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments. The experiments reveal that while LLMs demonstrate some capacity for this translation task, their performance is highly inconsistent and deteriorates significantly as symbolic partitions become more fine-grained. The findings suggest that current LLMs rely on surface-level pattern matching rather than genuine semantic grounding when attempting to align human language with agent internal states.

## Method Summary
The researchers employed a two-phase experimental design to evaluate LLM translation capabilities. First, they trained hierarchical reinforcement learning agents using the STAR algorithm in Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments, which produced emergent symbolic representations partitioning the state space into regions. Second, they presented LLMs with human natural language instructions and asked them to predict the sequence of symbolic regions the agent would traverse. The evaluation measured translation accuracy across different levels of partition granularity and task complexity, including simple navigation tasks and more complex tool-use scenarios like block pushing. Multiple LLMs were compared across trials with different participants to assess consistency and robustness of translation performance.

## Key Results
- LLMs demonstrate partial success in translating natural language instructions into symbolic region sequences, with accuracy decreasing as partitions become more fine-grained
- Translation performance varies significantly across different LLMs, with no single model consistently outperforming others across all task types
- LLMs struggle particularly with tool-use tasks involving block pushing, suggesting limitations in handling complex action hierarchies
- Performance shows high sensitivity to partition granularity, with accuracy dropping from approximately 70% for coarse partitions to below 40% for fine-grained partitions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The translation mechanism relies on LLMs' pattern recognition capabilities to map linguistic descriptions of goals to abstract symbolic representations. When LLMs succeed, they appear to identify surface-level correlations between instruction keywords and region characteristics rather than developing genuine semantic understanding of the agent's internal state space. The mechanism breaks down when symbolic representations become too abstract or when tasks require understanding of complex action hierarchies and tool interactions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Emergent Symbolic Representations**: Abstract state partitions learned by hierarchical RL agents that capture task-relevant structure - needed to understand what LLMs must translate into
- **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**: Multi-level decision-making where high-level policies operate on abstract states - needed to grasp the complexity of the translation task
- **Cross-Domain Symbolic Reasoning**: Ability to map between linguistic and abstract symbolic domains - needed to understand the core challenge
- **Partition Granularity**: The level of detail in symbolic state space partitioning - needed to interpret performance sensitivity findings
- **Tool-Use in RL**: Actions involving manipulation of objects to achieve goals - needed to understand task complexity variations

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Human Instructions -> LLM -> Symbolic Region Sequence -> RL Agent's Internal States
**Critical Path**: Instruction parsing → Semantic mapping → Symbolic prediction → Performance evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Granularity vs. accuracy tradeoff where finer partitions increase expressiveness but reduce translation success rates
**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent predictions across trials, sensitivity to phrasing variations, poor performance on tool-use tasks
**First Experiments**: 1) Compare LLM performance with rule-based translation baselines, 2) Test instruction phrasing variations systematically, 3) Evaluate different temperature settings for inference stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in source material.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope to only two Ant Maze environments, raising questions about generalizability to other RL domains
- Lack of systematic investigation into why LLMs show inconsistent performance across trials and participants
- No analysis of whether failures stem from architectural constraints, training data limitations, or fundamental representational alignment challenges
- Experimental design does not control for instruction phrasing variations or temperature settings that could confound results

## Confidence
**High confidence**: LLMs can partially translate instructions into symbolic sequences, though with notable limitations in accuracy and consistency
**Medium confidence**: LLMs rely on surface-level patterns rather than true symbolic grounding, but this conclusion needs additional probing experiments
**Low confidence**: Generalizability of findings to other RL environments or more complex symbolic representations remains uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying instruction phrasing, temperature settings, and context provision to isolate factors affecting translation accuracy
2. Expand evaluation to additional RL environments with different types of emergent symbolic representations and more complex hierarchical structures
3. Implement controlled experiments comparing LLM performance against rule-based translation systems and human translators to establish baseline performance
