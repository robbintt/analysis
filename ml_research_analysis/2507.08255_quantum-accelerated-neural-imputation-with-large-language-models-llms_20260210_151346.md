# Quantum-Accelerated Neural Imputation with Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.08255
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08255
- Reference count: 26
- Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to classical and LLM-based methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses missing data imputation in mixed-type tabular datasets by integrating quantum feature encoding with LLM-based architectures. Quantum-UnIMP replaces classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art classical and LLM-based imputation methods across benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
Quantum-UnIMP preprocesses mixed-type data (numerical, categorical, text) into a unified vector, maps it to 8-qubit IQP circuit parameters via linear transformation, and extracts quantum embeddings through Pauli-Z expectation values. These quantum embeddings serve as initial node representations in a 4-layer Transformer hypergraph LLM. The framework is trained end-to-end with Adam optimizer (lr=1e-4, batch size 32) using PennyLane's default.qubit simulator.

## Key Results
- 15.2% reduction in RMSE for numerical feature imputation compared to classical baselines
- 8.7% improvement in F1-Score for categorical feature classification
- Outperforms both classical MLP and random projection LLM baselines across UCI Adult, Bank Marketing, and Synthetic Healthcare datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** IQP feature maps capture complex, non-linear correlations that classical linear projections or MLPs miss
- **Mechanism:** The IQP circuit (Hadamard-Diagonal-Hadamard) encodes classical data into high-dimensional Hilbert space via superposition and entanglement
- **Core assumption:** The IQP embedding preserves informative correlations in mapping from classical vector to quantum state
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states core innovation is replacing classical embeddings with quantum feature maps; Section 3.2.3 describes IQP circuit mapping; corpus notes quantum circuits as isolated extractors
- **Break condition:** If measurement collapses quantum state information too aggressively, or IQP depth is insufficient to create entanglement

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Mixed-type preprocessing pipeline enables quantum circuits to handle heterogeneous tabular data
- **Mechanism:** Numerical features normalized to [0, π], categorical one-hot encoded, text features embedded via MiniLM; concatenated and linearly mapped to qubit rotation angles
- **Core assumption:** Linear mapping from high-dimensional classical vector to 8-qubit circuit doesn't create information bottleneck
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.2.1 describes preprocessing pipeline; Section 3.2.2 details linear mapping; corpus highlights importance of efficient encoding
- **Break condition:** If input dimension vastly exceeds qubit count, encoding becomes compression bottleneck

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Improving initial node representations in hypergraph LLM enhances missing value inference
- **Mechanism:** Quantum embeddings serve as initial node states; Transformer layers apply self-attention over enriched states
- **Core assumption:** LLM backbone is sufficiently expressive to exploit enhanced input geometry
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.3 describes quantum embeddings as initial node representations; ablation shows Random Proj. (0.36 RMSE) vs Quantum-UnIMP (0.25 RMSE)
- **Break condition:** If LLM architecture is biased towards standard token embeddings, it may ignore quantum-derived features

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** IQP (Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial) Circuits
  - **Why needed here:** Specific circuit architecture used to generate feature maps
  - **Quick check question:** How does the diagonal unitary U_{diag}(x) in an IQP circuit differ from standard rotation gates in terms of capturing input data x?

- **Concept:** Data Missingness Mechanisms (MCAR vs. MNAR)
  - **Why needed here:** Paper evaluates on synthetic datasets with MNAR patterns to test complex inference capabilities
  - **Quick check question:** In an MNAR scenario, why would a model need to infer a missing value based on correlation with other unobserved or observed variables?

- **Concept:** Quantum Measurement & Expectation Values
  - **Why needed here:** Bridge between quantum circuit and classical LLM is measurement step extracting embeddings via Pauli-Z expectation values
  - **Quick check question:** Why does taking expectation value of Pauli-Z operator result in real-valued classical vector suitable for neural network input?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Pre-processor (normalization, one-hot, MiniLM) -> Linear mapping to rotation angles -> 8-qubit IQP circuit -> Pauli-Z expectation measurements -> 4-layer Transformer hypergraph LLM
- **Critical path:** Linear mapping from concatenated feature vector to 8-qubit circuit parameters
- **Design tradeoffs:** 8 qubits for NISQ feasibility forces aggressive compression; simulation vs. hardware trade-off (simulation expensive at scale, hardware introduces noise)
- **Failure signatures:** Projection indistinguishability (uniform t-SNE overlap), training instability (gradient flow issues through quantum measurement interface)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check: Run UnIMP with Random Projections vs Classical MLP vs Quantum (IQP) on UCI Adult subset
  2. Encoding Stress Test: Compare recovery rates between VQC and IQP circuit on synthetic data with known high-order non-linear correlations
  3. Scale Limit Test: Gradually increase input features while keeping qubits fixed at 8 to identify bottleneck point

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does Quantum-UnIMP perform on actual NISQ hardware compared to simulators?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 6.2 notes running on real NISQ devices would introduce noise degrading performance
  - **Why unresolved:** All experiments used PennyLane's noise-free default.qubit simulator
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical results comparing imputation accuracy between simulated environment and physical quantum processors

- **Open Question 2:** Can quantum feature encoding pipeline efficiently scale to high-dimensional datasets?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 6.2 highlights scaling to hundreds of features is beyond current classical simulation capabilities
  - **Why unresolved:** Experiments restricted to datasets with 14-21 features using 8-qubit circuit
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstration processing high-dimensional industrial dataset analyzing qubit count, circuit depth, and computational overhead trade-offs

- **Open Question 3:** Does joint optimization of quantum circuit parameters and classical LLM architecture provide superior performance?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 6.3 identifies developing co-design methods as key future direction
  - **Why unresolved:** Current framework integrates specific quantum feature map into existing architecture without exploring LLM modifications
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative study showing convergence rates and final accuracy of co-designed hybrid model versus standard Quantum-UnIMP

## Limitations

- Reliance on classical simulation of quantum circuits doesn't capture real-world quantum noise and decoherence effects, potentially overestimating quantum advantage
- Shallow IQP circuit depth (2 layers, 8 qubits) requires aggressive compression of high-dimensional tabular data, risking lossy random projection behavior
- Ablation comparison uses only Random Projection and Classical MLP baselines, limiting claims about quantum superiority without stronger baselines

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Improved imputation accuracy (RMSE reduction up to 15.2%, F1 increase up to 8.7%) relative to classical and random projection baselines
- **Medium confidence:** IQP circuit generates richer embeddings than classical alternatives, given reliance on simulated noise-free quantum execution and shallow circuit depth
- **Low confidence:** Specific mechanism by which quantum entanglement in IQP circuit contributes to downstream LLM performance, as not directly validated and depends on untested assumptions about information preservation

## Next Checks

1. **Noise Robustness Test:** Re-run Quantum-UnIMP on noisy quantum simulator (PennyLane default.mixed or Aer noisy simulator) to quantify performance degradation under realistic decoherence and gate error models

2. **Circuit Expressibility Analysis:** Compare t-SNE visualizations and embedding distances of Quantum-UnIMP's IQP outputs versus classical MLP and random projections on synthetic data with known non-linear correlations to verify IQP provides distinguishable, information-rich representations

3. **Scaling Stress Test:** Systematically increase number of input features while keeping qubit count fixed at 8 to identify dimensionality threshold where linear mapping to quantum parameters becomes bottleneck and performance drops below classical baseline
