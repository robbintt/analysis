core_contribution: CODA introduces a trainable dual-brain agent framework that decouples
  a dynamic planner (Cerebrum) from a static executor (Cerebellum) to address long-horizon
  planning and precise execution challenges in scientific GUI domains. Using decoupled
  reinforcement learning, the planner is trained per software to specialize in strategic
  reasoning, then generalized via supervised fine-tuning from aggregated specialist
  trajectories.

# CODA: Coordinating the Cerebrum and Cerebellum for a Dual-Brain Computer Use Agent with Decoupled Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.20096
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20096
- Reference count: 27
- CODA achieves 39.96% pass rate (up from 15.36% baseline) on four ScienceBoard applications

## Executive Summary
CODA introduces a trainable dual-brain agent framework that decouples a dynamic planner (Cerebrum) from a static executor (Cerebellum) to address long-horizon planning and precise execution challenges in scientific GUI domains. Using decoupled reinforcement learning, the planner is trained per software to specialize in strategic reasoning, then generalized via supervised fine-tuning from aggregated specialist trajectories. Evaluated on four ScienceBoard applications, CODA achieves a 39.96% pass rate (up from 15.36% baseline) and establishes a new open-source state-of-the-art, demonstrating superior cross-domain generalization and planning ability.

## Method Summary
CODA proposes a dual-brain architecture where the Cerebrum handles dynamic long-horizon planning through specialized reinforcement learning per software, while the Cerebellum provides static precise execution. The key innovation is decoupled reinforcement learning that trains the planner independently from the executor, allowing the Cerebrum to focus on strategic reasoning while the Cerebellum maintains execution precision. The framework aggregates trajectories from specialist planners and uses supervised fine-tuning to create a generalized planner capable of handling multiple software environments.

## Key Results
- 39.96% pass rate on four ScienceBoard applications, representing a 160% improvement over baseline (15.36%)
- Establishes new open-source state-of-the-art performance in scientific GUI domains
- Demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization compared to single-brain approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The decoupled reinforcement learning approach allows specialized training of the planner for each software environment, enabling deep strategic reasoning for long-horizon tasks. By separating planning from execution, CODA avoids the common pitfall where agents must simultaneously learn strategic thinking and precise actions, which often leads to suboptimal performance in both areas. The supervised fine-tuning from aggregated specialist trajectories enables transfer learning across different software domains while maintaining the specialized reasoning capabilities developed during individual training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Decoupled Reinforcement Learning**: Training planner and executor separately to specialize in their respective tasks (why needed: prevents interference between strategic reasoning and precise execution; quick check: verify separate training pipelines function independently)
- **Specialist-to-Generalist Transfer**: Aggregating specialist trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (why needed: enables cross-domain generalization without losing specialized capabilities; quick check: measure performance degradation when applying specialist to new domains)
- **Dual-Brain Architecture**: Separating Cerebrum (planner) from Cerebellum (executor) (why needed: allows optimization of strategic reasoning and precise execution independently; quick check: compare performance with unified architecture)
- **Long-Horizon Planning**: Managing sequential decision-making over extended task durations (why needed: scientific GUI tasks often require multiple steps across different applications; quick check: evaluate planning depth and accuracy on multi-step tasks)
- **GUI State Representation**: Encoding visual and interaction states for agent decision-making (why needed: enables the agent to understand and navigate complex interface elements; quick check: validate state encoding captures essential GUI features)

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: User Input -> Cerebrum (Planner) -> Cerebellum (Executor) -> GUI Actions -> Reward Feedback -> Cerebrum Training
- **Critical Path**: Task specification flows through planner for strategy generation, executor for action implementation, with rewards driving planner improvement
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Decoupling enables specialized optimization but requires coordination mechanisms; specialist aggregation enables generalization but may dilute domain-specific expertise
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor planning leads to suboptimal action sequences; executor failures manifest as GUI interaction errors; coordination issues appear as misalignment between planned and executed actions
- **First Experiments**: 1) Train specialist planners on individual ScienceBoard applications, 2) Aggregate trajectories and perform supervised fine-tuning for generalization, 3) Evaluate cross-domain transfer performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to four ScienceBoard applications, restricting generalizability assessment
- Performance gains may not translate to other GUI-based domains or more complex scientific software
- Paper lacks detailed ablations to isolate contributions of planner, executor, and decoupling mechanism

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in reported performance metrics within tested ScienceBoard applications
- **Medium confidence** in scalability and generalization claims due to limited domain coverage
- **Low confidence** in robustness to noisy or unpredictable GUI states

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain validation: Test CODA on broader set of scientific and non-scientific GUI applications
2. Ablation study: Conduct systematic experiments to isolate contributions of decoupled components
3. Error analysis: Perform detailed failure mode analysis to understand error sources and patterns
