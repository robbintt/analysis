# AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12066
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066
- Authors: Alessandro Achille; Stefano Soatto
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: AI reasoning agents can function as universal task solvers, with learning fundamentally about reducing inference time through proper time measurement and power-law scaling relationships.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a theoretical framework showing that modern AI reasoning agents, including LLMs with chain-of-thought, can serve as universal task solvers capable of addressing any computable problem. The authors formalize these agents as stochastic dynamical systems and introduce "proper time" as a measure of computational effort. They demonstrate that the fundamental goal of learning in this context is to reduce inference time rather than improve accuracy, with speed-up factors directly related to algorithmic mutual information between training data and solutions. The framework reveals that scaling model size can paradoxically lead to "savant" behavior where brute-force computation replaces genuine learning, suggesting that optimizing for time efficiency rather than just accuracy is crucial for developing truly intelligent systems.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a novel theoretical framework that treats AI reasoning agents as stochastic dynamical systems, where the core objective shifts from accuracy maximization to inference time minimization. The authors formalize "proper time" as a measure of computational effort and establish a power-law scaling relationship between training time and inference time. They analyze learning through the lens of algorithmic mutual information, showing that speed-up factors are directly tied to the information shared between training data and solutions. The framework also examines the phenomenon of "savant" behavior that emerges when scaling model size, where increased computational capacity can substitute for genuine learning. The Pandora's box approach is proposed for determining optimal stopping points during computation, treating complex reasoning tasks as problems requiring careful resource allocation decisions.

## Key Results
- AI reasoning agents can be formalized as universal task solvers capable of solving any computable problem through proper time optimization
- Learning fundamentally reduces to inference time reduction, with speed-up factors directly related to algorithmic mutual information between training data and solutions
- Power-law scaling relationship exists between training time and inference time, though scaling model size can lead to "savant" behavior where brute-force computation replaces genuine learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by reframing the learning problem from one of accuracy optimization to inference time minimization. By treating AI agents as stochastic dynamical systems with a notion of "proper time," the framework captures the computational effort required for task completion. The power-law relationship between training and inference time emerges from the fundamental trade-off between computational resources invested during training and those required during inference. The algorithmic mutual information between training data and solutions quantifies the efficiency gains achievable through learning. This perspective explains why larger models can exhibit "savant" behavior - they have sufficient computational capacity to solve problems through brute-force rather than learned efficiency, highlighting the importance of optimizing for time rather than just accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- Stochastic dynamical systems theory: Needed to formalize AI agents as computational processes with measurable states and transitions. Quick check: Verify the mathematical consistency of treating reasoning chains as state transitions.
- Algorithmic information theory: Required to quantify the mutual information between training data and solutions, which determines speed-up factors. Quick check: Validate that the information-theoretic bounds align with empirical observations.
- Proper time measurement: Essential for quantifying computational effort in a way that captures both accuracy and efficiency. Quick check: Ensure proper time correlates with actual computational resources across different hardware platforms.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Training data → Model architecture → Inference engine → Solution output
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Model training → Inference optimization → Solution generation
- Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. inference time efficiency; model size vs. computational requirements; generalization vs. task-specific optimization
- Failure signatures: When brute-force computation dominates (savant behavior), when power-law scaling breaks down, when proper time measurements don't correlate with actual performance
- First experiments: 1) Measure proper time across different model sizes on standardized tasks, 2) Quantify algorithmic mutual information between training data and solutions for various architectures, 3) Test Pandora's box stopping criteria against traditional evaluation metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- The power-law scaling relationship may not hold under practical computational constraints and hardware limitations
- The theoretical framework may oversimplify the complex interactions between model architecture, training procedures, and task characteristics
- The "savant" behavior phenomenon requires more rigorous empirical validation across diverse problem domains and model architectures

## Confidence
- High confidence in the mathematical formalism of treating agents as dynamical systems
- Medium confidence in the theoretical relationships between training/inference time and algorithmic information
- Low confidence in the practical implications of "savant" behavior and Pandora's box stopping criteria

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of the power-law scaling relationship across multiple model architectures and diverse computational tasks
2. Systematic testing of the "savant" behavior hypothesis using controlled experiments with varying model sizes and computational budgets
3. Real-world benchmarking of the Pandora's box stopping criteria approach against standard evaluation metrics in practical applications
