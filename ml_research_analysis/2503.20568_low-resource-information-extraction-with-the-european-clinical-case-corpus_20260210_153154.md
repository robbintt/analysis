# Low-resource Information Extraction with the European Clinical Case Corpus

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.20568
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20568
- Reference count: 40
- Multilingual clinical dataset with diseases and test-result relations across nine European languages

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces E3C-3.0, a multilingual clinical case dataset annotated for diseases and test-result relations across nine European languages. The dataset was created using a semi-automatic approach combining automatic translation, annotation projection via large language models, and human revision. The authors demonstrate that fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset improves performance on clinical entity detection and relation extraction tasks, even with limited training data. Cross-lingual transfer learning further enhances results, particularly for low-resource languages, showing that augmented multilingual training can narrow the performance gap with native data.

## Method Summary
The authors developed E3C-3.0 using a semi-automatic annotation pipeline that combines automatic translation of clinical cases with annotation projection via large language models, followed by human revision. This approach enables creation of multilingual clinical datasets while maintaining annotation consistency across languages. The dataset focuses on diseases and test-result relations, which are critical for clinical information extraction. The methodology leverages cross-lingual transfer learning to improve performance on low-resource languages by training models on data from multiple languages simultaneously.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning LLMs on E3C-3.0 improves clinical entity detection and relation extraction performance
- Cross-lingual transfer learning enhances results for low-resource languages
- Augmented multilingual training narrows the performance gap with native data
- Dataset and code are publicly available for research use

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The semi-automatic annotation approach combines the scalability of machine translation and LLM-based annotation projection with human oversight to ensure quality. Cross-lingual transfer learning leverages shared linguistic and medical knowledge across languages, allowing models trained on high-resource languages to improve performance on low-resource languages. The focus on specific clinical entity types (diseases and test-result relations) provides targeted, practical value for medical information extraction tasks.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Annotation projection** - transferring annotations from source to target language via translation
   - Why needed: Enables efficient creation of multilingual datasets without manual annotation for each language
   - Quick check: Verify projection accuracy by comparing projected vs. human annotations on validation set

2. **Cross-lingual transfer learning** - leveraging multilingual training data to improve performance on low-resource languages
   - Why needed: Addresses data scarcity in clinical NLP for underrepresented languages
   - Quick check: Measure performance gains when adding data from other languages

3. **Clinical entity recognition** - identifying medical concepts like diseases and tests in text
   - Why needed: Fundamental task for extracting structured information from clinical narratives
   - Quick check: Evaluate entity detection precision and recall on held-out test set

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Clinical cases → Translation → Annotation projection (LLM) → Human revision → E3C-3.0 dataset → LLM fine-tuning → Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are the annotation projection quality and the cross-lingual training framework. Poor annotation projection would propagate errors across all languages, while ineffective cross-lingual transfer would limit the benefits for low-resource languages.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The semi-automatic approach balances annotation quality with scalability, but may introduce systematic biases from translation errors or LLM projection mistakes. The focus on specific entity types provides depth but limits breadth of coverage.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation in low-resource languages, inconsistent annotations across languages, translation errors affecting clinical terminology, or poor cross-lingual transfer indicating insufficient shared representation learning.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare annotation projection accuracy against fully manual annotations for a subset of cases
2. Evaluate cross-lingual transfer performance with varying proportions of native vs. projected data
3. Test model generalization to unseen clinical entity types beyond diseases and test-result relations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Annotation projection reliability for clinical text lacks detailed error analysis
- Limited ablation studies to isolate contributions of native vs. projected data
- Evaluation focused on specific entity types may limit generalizability
- Dataset creation process and quality metrics not fully detailed

## Confidence
- High confidence: Dataset creation methodology and general framework are well-described and technically sound
- Medium confidence: Performance improvements from fine-tuning and cross-lingual transfer are plausible but lack sufficient experimental controls
- Medium confidence: Claim that augmented multilingual training narrows gap with native data requires more rigorous validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct detailed error analysis comparing annotation projection quality across all nine languages, focusing on clinical terminology consistency
2. Perform ablation studies systematically varying proportions of native versus projected data in training
3. Validate generalizability by testing on additional clinical entity types and relation extraction tasks beyond diseases and test-result relations
