# Contrastive Learning Using Graph Embeddings for Domain Adaptation of Language Models in the Process Industry

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04631
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04631
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Graph-based domain adaptation approach for process industry language models achieves 9.8-14.3% improvement over mE5-large using 3x fewer parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a domain adaptation approach for language models in the process industry using contrastive learning with graph embeddings. The method adapts SciNCL's contrastive learning framework by incorporating heterogeneous knowledge graphs from plant operations data, where text logs and functional locations are interconnected through various relationship types. The key innovation involves using graph embeddings to generate document triplets that capture semantic relationships in technical terminology and abbreviations.

When applied to German plant operation logs, the approach fine-tunes small language models to outperform a state-of-the-art mE5-large text encoder on the proprietary Process Industry Text Embedding Benchmark (PITEB). The best results were achieved with mBERT fine-tuned using a two-stage process combining document-level similarity learning and query-document training with graph embedding-derived triplets.

## Method Summary
The approach extends SciNCL's contrastive learning framework by integrating heterogeneous knowledge graphs from process industry data. Text logs and functional locations are interconnected through relationship types, with graph embeddings capturing semantic relationships in technical terminology and abbreviations. The method generates document triplets from the graph structure to train language models on domain-specific semantics. Small language models are fine-tuned using a two-stage process: first on document-level similarity learning, then on query-document training with graph-derived triplets. This adaptation enables better handling of domain-specific abbreviations and technical terminology compared to general-purpose text encoders.

## Key Results
- mBERT fine-tuned with graph embeddings outperforms mE5-large text encoder by 9.8-14.3% on PITEB benchmark
- Achieves superior performance using three times fewer parameters than mE5-large
- Two-stage fine-tuning (document-level similarity + query-document training) yields best results
- Method effectively captures technical terminology and abbreviations in process industry domain

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging heterogeneous knowledge graphs to capture semantic relationships between technical documents and functional locations in process industry settings. Graph embeddings encode domain-specific terminology and abbreviations that are typically challenging for general-purpose language models. By generating document triplets from the graph structure, the contrastive learning framework can better distinguish between semantically similar and dissimilar pairs in the technical domain. The two-stage fine-tuning process first establishes document-level similarity patterns, then refines the model's ability to match queries with relevant documents, resulting in improved performance on domain-specific tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: Why needed - enables learning by comparing similar and dissimilar examples; Quick check - verify triplet generation follows established frameworks like SciNCL
- **Graph Embeddings**: Why needed - captures relationships between technical documents and functional locations; Quick check - confirm embedding captures domain-specific terminology
- **Heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs**: Why needed - represents multiple entity types and relationships in process industry data; Quick check - validate graph construction includes relevant relationship types
- **Domain Adaptation**: Why needed - adapts general-purpose models to specialized industry terminology; Quick check - compare performance on domain vs general benchmarks
- **Document Triplet Generation**: Why needed - provides training pairs for contrastive learning; Quick check - ensure triplets reflect true semantic relationships
- **Two-Stage Fine-tuning**: Why needed - progressively refines model from general to specific tasks; Quick check - compare single vs two-stage performance

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Text Logs -> Graph Construction -> Graph Embeddings -> Document Triplets -> Contrastive Learning -> Fine-tuned Language Model

Critical Path:
Graph Construction → Graph Embeddings → Document Triplets → Contrastive Learning → Fine-tuned Model

Design Tradeoffs:
- Small language models vs large encoders: parameter efficiency vs potential capacity limitations
- Proprietary vs public benchmarks: domain specificity vs generalizability
- Two-stage vs single-stage fine-tuning: improved performance vs increased complexity

Failure Signatures:
- Poor graph construction leads to irrelevant document triplets
- Inadequate graph embeddings fail to capture domain terminology
- Single-stage fine-tuning insufficient for complex technical domains

First Experiments:
1. Verify graph construction captures all relevant relationship types between documents and functional locations
2. Test document triplet generation quality by sampling and manual validation
3. Compare single-stage vs two-stage fine-tuning performance on small validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on proprietary benchmark (PITEB), limiting external validation
- Performance improvements based on single benchmark with unspecified composition
- Heterogeneous knowledge graph construction depends on specific plant operation data schemas
- Computational efficiency claims based on parameter counts without actual resource usage data

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Technical implementation follows established methodologies; parameter reduction claims are verifiable
**Medium confidence**: Benchmark performance improvements reported with specific percentages but lack independent verification; two-stage fine-tuning superiority demonstrated but needs more ablation studies
**Low confidence**: Transferability claims to other domains and languages are speculative; practical deployment benefits not demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. Replicate approach on publicly available technical document datasets to verify cross-domain applicability
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating impact of graph embeddings, contrastive learning, and two-stage fine-tuning
3. Measure actual computational resources (GPU hours, memory usage, inference latency) to validate efficiency claims beyond parameter count comparisons
