# End-to-End Spoken Grammatical Error Correction
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.18532
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18532
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: End-to-end system outperforms cascaded baselines on spoken grammatical error correction, achieving up to 8.8% relative WER reduction and 7.8% F0.5 improvement in feedback quality

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an end-to-end approach for spoken grammatical error correction (SGEC), built on the Whisper foundation model. The authors address the scarcity of labeled spoken data by developing an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline that expands the training set from 77 to over 2500 hours. The system combines fluent transcription prompts, reference alignment, and edit-level confidence estimation to improve both correction accuracy and feedback quality. Experiments on Linguaskill and Speak & Improve corpora show that the end-to-end approach outperforms cascaded and partial-cascaded baselines.

## Method Summary
The proposed end-to-end system leverages the Whisper foundation model and is trained on an expanded dataset generated via automatic pseudo-labeling. The authors introduce a pipeline that uses fluent transcriptions as prompts and aligns them with reference corrections to create training pairs. Edit-level confidence estimation is integrated to enhance feedback quality. The approach aims to directly correct grammatical errors in spoken responses without the need for separate transcription and correction stages.

## Key Results
- End-to-end system achieves up to 8.8% relative WER reduction compared to cascaded baselines
- F0.5 score for feedback quality improves by up to 7.8% relative
- Pseudo-labeling pipeline expands training data from 77 to over 2500 hours, enabling better generalization
- End-to-end approach outperforms both cascaded and partial-cascaded systems on in-house Linguaskill and public Speak & Improve corpora

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The end-to-end approach directly maps spoken input to corrected output, leveraging the Whisper foundation model's strong multilingual and ASR capabilities. By expanding training data via automatic pseudo-labeling and incorporating reference alignment, the system learns to correct grammatical errors while preserving fluency. Edit-level confidence estimation allows for more reliable feedback, improving pedagogical utility. This unified architecture reduces error propagation and leverages larger-scale training data, leading to improved performance over cascaded systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Automatic pseudo-labeling**: Needed to address the scarcity of labeled spoken grammatical error correction data; quick check: dataset size increases from 77 to over 2500 hours
- **Reference alignment**: Aligns fluent transcriptions with reference corrections to create training pairs; quick check: alignment quality impacts model accuracy
- **Edit-level confidence estimation**: Provides per-edit confidence scores for feedback generation; quick check: higher confidence correlates with better feedback quality
- **Whisper foundation model**: Serves as the base architecture for end-to-end SGEC; quick check: leverages strong ASR and multilingual capabilities
- **Cascaded vs. end-to-end systems**: Comparison highlights trade-offs between modularity and error propagation; quick check: end-to-end reduces intermediate error accumulation
- **F0.5 metric**: Balances precision and recall for feedback quality; quick check: higher F0.5 indicates better pedagogical utility

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Whisper encoder -> pseudo-labeled training data -> reference alignment -> edit-level confidence estimation -> end-to-end SGEC model
**Critical path**: Input speech -> Whisper ASR -> pseudo-labeled correction pairs -> end-to-end model training -> grammatical error correction and feedback
**Design tradeoffs**: End-to-end approach reduces modularity and error propagation but increases complexity; pseudo-labeling expands data but may introduce noise; edit-level confidence improves feedback but requires additional supervision
**Failure signatures**: Poor reference alignment leads to noisy training pairs; over-reliance on pseudo-labeled data may reduce robustness; insufficient confidence estimation may degrade feedback quality
**First 3 experiments**: 1) Ablation study on pseudo-labeled data size and quality; 2) Comparison of cascaded vs. end-to-end architectures; 3) Evaluation of edit-level confidence estimation on feedback metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out additional open questions beyond those already addressed in the limitations section.

## Limitations
- The expanded pseudo-labeled dataset may contain noise, impacting model robustness and generalization
- Feedback quality is primarily evaluated via automated metrics, which may not fully reflect pedagogical utility
- Experimental scope is limited to two corpora (Linguaskill and Speak & Improve), raising questions about broader applicability
- Claims about the superiority of end-to-end systems may not hold across different model architectures or languages

## Confidence
- **High**: End-to-end system outperforms cascaded baselines on tested datasets (measured by WER and F0.5)
- **Medium**: Pseudo-labeling pipeline meaningfully increases training data size and improves performance
- **Medium**: Proposed reference alignment and confidence estimation methods improve feedback quality
- **Low**: Generalizability to other spoken corpora or languages

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation of the expanded pseudo-labeled dataset to assess noise levels and their impact on model performance.
2. Test the end-to-end system on additional spoken grammatical error correction datasets, including out-of-domain and multilingual corpora.
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contributions of reference alignment and edit-level confidence estimation to feedback quality.
