core_contribution: This paper proposes a two-stage abstractive summarization framework
  for scientific papers that leverages automatic structural function recognition.
  The method first normalizes chapter titles and trains a classifier to identify key
  structural components (e.g., Background, Methods, Results, Discussion), then employs
  Longformer to generate context-aware summaries.

# Enhancing Abstractive Summarization of Scientific Papers Using Structure Information

## Quick Facts

- Method leverages automatic structural function recognition for abstractive summarization of scientific papers

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of abstractive summarization for scientific papers by proposing a two-stage framework that explicitly leverages structural information. The method first identifies key structural components (Background, Methods, Results, Discussion) through automatic classification, then uses Longformer to generate context-aware summaries. Experiments on PubMed and arXiv datasets show that incorporating structural information improves summary quality, with Longformer achieving strong ROUGE scores (45.38/19.27/40.97 on PubMed) and higher GEMCR scores indicating more comprehensive summaries compared to advanced baselines.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework operates in two stages: structural function recognition and summary generation. In the first stage, chapter titles are normalized and a classifier is trained to identify four key structural components of scientific papers: Background, Methods, Results, and Discussion. In the second stage, the Longformer model generates summaries using the structural information from the first stage to create context-aware outputs. This approach explicitly addresses the challenge of capturing structural information that is often overlooked by existing summarization methods, potentially leading to more coherent and comprehensive summaries of scientific papers.

## Key Results
- Longformer achieves ROUGE-1/2/L scores of 45.38/19.27/40.97 on PubMed dataset
- Longformer achieves ROUGE-1/2/L scores of 44.51/18.26/39.64 on arXiv dataset
- Higher GEMCR scores indicate more comprehensive summaries compared to advanced baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly leveraging the inherent structure of scientific papers, which typically follow standardized organizational patterns (Introduction/Background, Methods, Results, Discussion). By first identifying these structural components through classification, the system can apply targeted summarization strategies appropriate to each section type. Longformer's ability to handle long documents while maintaining contextual awareness allows it to generate coherent summaries that respect the relationships between different sections. This two-stage approach ensures that the summary generation process is informed by the document's logical organization rather than treating the paper as a flat sequence of text.

## Foundational Learning
- **ROUGE metrics**: Why needed - to measure lexical overlap between generated and reference summaries; Quick check - ensure ROUGE scores are calculated correctly across multiple variants (1, 2, L)
- **GEMCR metric**: Why needed - to assess summary comprehensiveness beyond simple overlap; Quick check - verify GEMCR implementation aligns with standard definitions
- **Longformer architecture**: Why needed - to handle the long input sequences typical of scientific papers; Quick check - confirm attention mechanism scales appropriately for document length
- **Scientific paper structure**: Why needed - to understand standard organizational patterns for effective summarization; Quick check - validate structural component labels match domain conventions

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Title normalization -> Structural classification -> Longformer summarization
**Critical path:** Input document → Normalize titles → Classify structural components → Generate section-aware summary with Longformer
**Design tradeoffs:** Uses Longformer for its ability to handle long documents but requires significant computational resources; structural classification adds preprocessing overhead but improves summary coherence
**Failure signatures:** Misclassification of structural components propagates errors to summary generation; Longformer may miss cross-section relationships if structural boundaries are too rigid
**First experiments to run:** 1) Test structural classifier accuracy on held-out data, 2) Compare summary quality with and without structural information, 3) Measure Longformer's ability to maintain context across document sections

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies exclusively on ROUGE and GEMCR metrics without human evaluation or factual consistency checks
- Method's effectiveness depends heavily on structural classifier accuracy, but no error analysis is provided
- Experimental design lacks ablation studies to isolate the contribution of structural information versus Longformer's architectural advantages

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation details and experimental methodology are clearly described and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Reported performance improvements over baselines, given the strong metrics and appropriate experimental setup
- **Low confidence**: Claims about the method's ability to produce more "comprehensive" summaries, as GEMCR alone cannot fully validate this assertion

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies with domain experts to assess factual accuracy, coherence, and comprehensiveness of generated summaries beyond automated metrics
2. Perform ablation studies comparing Longformer with and without structural information to quantify the specific contribution of the proposed two-stage approach
3. Test the method's robustness by introducing controlled errors in the structural classification step to measure propagation effects on final summary quality
