## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Hyperdimensional Contextual Bandits (HD-CB), the first exploration of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) for solving sequential decision-making problems in Contextual Bandits. The approach replaces computationally expensive ridge regression with simple, highly parallel vector operations in high-dimensional space, making it well-suited for resource-constrained systems. HD-CB maps environmental states to high-dimensional hypervectors and represents each action with dedicated hypervectors, using vector arithmetic for model updates instead of complex matrix operations.

The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages including faster convergence time, lower computational complexity (O(d) vs O(d³) for context size), improved scalability, and high parallelism. Four HD-CB variants are presented, implementing different exploration strategies while reducing memory overhead and hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks show that HD-CB consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to traditional linear CB algorithms, with particular effectiveness in recommendation systems achieving significantly higher average rewards as the number of actions increases.

## Method Summary
HD-CB implements four variants of contextual bandit algorithms using Hyperdimensional Computing principles. The approach maps context vectors to high-dimensional hypervectors using record-based encoding, where each feature is represented by a base vector combined with level vectors for discretized values. Each action has a dedicated hypervector that stores the history of contexts encountered when that action was taken. The estimated payoff for each action is computed via cosine similarity between the action's hypervector and the current context hypervector. Model updates use simple vector arithmetic: when action a_t is taken and reward r_t is received, the action's hypervector is updated by bundling (element-wise addition) the bound (element-wise multiplication) context hypervector with the thermometer-encoded reward hypervector.

The four variants implement different exploration strategies: HD-CB_EPS uses ε-greedy exploration, HD-CB_UNC2 adds uncertainty estimation via confidence hypervectors with thinning updates, HD-CB_UNC3 shares hypervectors across actions to reduce memory, and HD-CB_EXP3 incorporates exponential weighting for exploration. The algorithms operate with real-valued hypervectors using the Multiply-Add-Permute-C scheme and achieve O(d) complexity per iteration compared to O(d³) for traditional ridge regression methods.

## Key Results
- HD-CB variants achieve competitive or superior average rewards compared to LinUCB baseline across synthetic and real-world benchmarks
- HD-CB_UNC2 demonstrates best overall performance with significantly faster convergence time and lower execution time
- Computational complexity reduced from O(d³) to O(d), enabling efficient scaling to large action spaces and high-dimensional contexts
- In MovieLens-100k recommendation experiments, HD-CB consistently achieves higher average rewards as number of actions increases (N=100-1000)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HD-CB leverages the associative memory properties of hyperdimensional computing to efficiently store and retrieve context-action-reward associations. By representing contexts as high-dimensional hypervectors and using simple vector operations for updates, the method avoids computationally expensive matrix operations required by traditional linear contextual bandit algorithms. The high dimensionality provides robustness to noise and enables the system to capture complex patterns through distributed representations. The exploration strategies incorporated in different variants balance exploitation of known high-reward actions with exploration of uncertain regions, while the vector-based updates enable fast, parallelizable learning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)**: Computing paradigm using high-dimensional vectors (d > 1000) to represent and manipulate information through vector operations like bundling and binding. Needed because traditional matrix operations are computationally expensive for large-scale problems. Quick check: Verify that vector operations (addition, multiplication) correctly implement associative memory properties.
- **Contextual Bandits**: Sequential decision-making framework where agent observes context, selects action, receives reward. Needed as the problem domain requiring efficient learning algorithms. Quick check: Ensure correct implementation of reward accumulation and action selection policies.
- **Record-based Encoding**: HDC encoding scheme mapping feature values to hypervectors using base vectors and level vectors. Needed to convert continuous context features into distributed representations. Quick check: Verify that similar contexts produce similar hypervectors via cosine similarity.
- **Thermometer Encoding**: Binary encoding scheme where first k elements are 1 and remaining are 0. Needed for representing discrete reward values as hypervectors. Quick check: Confirm that different reward levels produce distinct hypervectors with appropriate similarity structure.
- **Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff**: Balancing between exploiting known good actions and exploring uncertain ones. Needed for effective learning in bandit problems. Quick check: Verify that exploration parameters produce appropriate balance between trying new actions and exploiting known rewards.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Context features -> Record-based encoding -> Context hypervector X_t,a -> Action hypervectors A_a -> Cosine similarity -> Estimated payoffs -> Action selection -> Reward -> Update A_a

**Critical Path**: Context encoding → similarity computation → action selection → reward reception → model update. Each iteration processes context, computes similarities, selects action, receives reward, and updates action hypervectors using vector arithmetic.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses high-dimensional vectors (D=1000) for robustness vs. memory overhead; record-based vs. level encoding for different representation needs; shared vs. dedicated hypervectors across actions for memory efficiency; simple vector operations vs. complex matrix operations for computational efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance with small HV sizes (<256); over/under-exploration due to incorrect hyperparameters; HV saturation in shared-memory variants at low dimensions; sensitivity to encoding parameters and random initialization.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement HDC primitives (bundling, binding, similarity) and verify associative memory properties with simple pattern storage/retrieval
2. Implement HD-CB_EPS with synthetic linear bandit environment and verify basic learning behavior
3. Compare HD-CB_EPS against LinUCB baseline on synthetic data with varying context dimensions and action spaces

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance sensitive to specific HDC encoding choices (record-based vs. level encoding) and exploration hyperparameters
- Underspecified details in thermometer encoding implementation and feature-to-level mapping could impact reproducibility
- Claims about "first exploration" of HDC for contextual bandits cannot be independently verified without broader literature review

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: HDC's computational advantages (O(d) vs O(d³) complexity, parallelizability) are well-established theoretical properties
- **Medium Confidence**: Empirical performance claims are supported by extensive experiments, but sensitivity to encoding choices and hyperparameters introduces variability
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about "first exploration" of HDC for contextual bandits cannot be independently verified without broader literature review

## Next Checks
1. **Encoding Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary record-based vs. level encoding, thermometer levels, and HV size to quantify performance impact
2. **Hyperparameter Robustness**: Conduct comprehensive grid search over ε, α, and α2 to identify optimal configurations and assess sensitivity
3. **Scalability Validation**: Test HD-CB performance on larger action spaces (N > 1000) and higher-dimensional contexts (d > 10) to verify claimed scalability advantages
