# SEQ-GPT: LLM-assisted Spatial Query via Example

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.10486
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10486
- **Reference count:** 20
- **Key outcome:** SEQ-GPT introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered system for Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), enabling users to search for multiple relevant locations using natural language.

## Executive Summary
SEQ-GPT is a novel system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance spatial query capabilities, particularly for multi-location searches. Unlike traditional methods that struggle with complex queries, SEQ-GPT uses natural language interaction and dialogue-based clarification to refine user queries dynamically. The system supports two modes: Map Mode for example-based queries and Chat Mode for natural language interaction, with seamless conversion between them. By generating synthetic dialogue data via a state transition graph, SEQ-GPT fine-tunes LLMs to parse structured queries effectively. Evaluation metrics like intent prediction accuracy and self-BLEU ensure precise query processing, demonstrating improved flexibility and user experience in spatial searches.

## Method Summary
SEQ-GPT integrates LLMs into a spatial query system by using a state transition graph to generate synthetic dialogue data for fine-tuning. This approach addresses the challenge of data scarcity in spatial query interactions. The system employs two primary modes: Map Mode, where users interact with examples on a map, and Chat Mode, which allows natural language interaction. A critical innovation is the seamless conversion between these modes, enabling users to switch based on their needs. The fine-tuning process leverages synthetic data to train LLMs for structured query parsing, enhancing their ability to handle complex, multi-location searches.

## Key Results
- Enhanced flexibility in multi-location spatial searches through natural language interaction.
- Improved user experience with dialogue-based query clarification and dynamic adjustments.
- Effective use of synthetic dialogue data for LLM fine-tuning, addressing data scarcity.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SEQ-GPT works by integrating LLMs into spatial query systems, leveraging their ability to process natural language and generate structured responses. The synthetic dialogue generation via a state transition graph allows the system to create diverse training data, which fine-tunes the LLM for accurate query parsing. The two-mode interaction (Map and Chat) provides flexibility, while the seamless conversion ensures a smooth user experience. The evaluation metrics, such as intent prediction accuracy and self-BLEU, validate the system's effectiveness in handling complex queries.

## Foundational Learning
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Essential for processing natural language and generating structured responses. *Why needed:* To enable natural language interaction for spatial queries. *Quick check:* Ensure the LLM can parse and respond to complex, multi-location queries.
- **State Transition Graphs:** Used to generate synthetic dialogue data. *Why needed:* To create diverse training data for fine-tuning LLMs. *Quick check:* Verify the graph generates varied and relevant dialogue scenarios.
- **Intent Prediction Accuracy:** Measures how well the system understands user queries. *Why needed:* To ensure precise query processing. *Quick check:* Test accuracy on a range of query types.
- **Self-BLEU:** Evaluates the diversity of generated responses. *Why needed:* To prevent repetitive or overly similar responses. *Quick check:* Analyze self-BLEU scores across different query contexts.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** User Input -> LLM Processing -> Query Refinement -> Spatial Search -> Results Display
- **Critical Path:** User Query -> LLM Fine-tuning (via synthetic data) -> Intent Prediction -> Spatial Search
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Map Mode vs. Chat Mode (example-based vs. natural language interaction). Seamless conversion balances flexibility and usability.
- **Failure Signatures:** Poor intent prediction accuracy, low self-BLEU scores, or inability to handle complex queries.
- **First Experiments:**
  1. Test intent prediction accuracy on a small dataset.
  2. Evaluate self-BLEU scores for response diversity.
  3. Assess the system’s ability to handle multi-location queries.
