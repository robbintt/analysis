- Primary result: Develops population-level methods for monitoring LLM-modified content across institutional and societal contexts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation presents systematic computational approaches to understanding large language model (LLM) impact on writing and information ecosystems. The research develops population-level methods for monitoring LLM-modified content across institutional and societal contexts, addresses fairness concerns in AI governance, and explores LLMs' potential to augment scientific communication. The core contribution is a distributional GPT quantification framework that estimates the fraction of AI-generated content in large corpora without requiring individual document detection.

## Method Summary
The core method develops a distributional quantification framework using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on mixture models. The approach models aggregate token occurrence distributions for human text ($P$) and AI text ($Q$), then estimates the mixture parameter $\alpha$ (fraction of AI text) that best explains observed corpus statistics. The method uses token occurrences rather than counts, applies POS filtering (typically adjectives), and optimizes $\alpha$ through MLE on log-likelihood functions. Validation uses semi-synthetic datasets blending known proportions of human and AI text.

## Key Results
- Up to 16.9% of peer review text may be substantially LLM-modified
- GPT detectors systematically bias against non-native English writers
- 22.5% LLM adoption in computer science academic publishing by 2024
- LLM-generated scientific feedback shows 30-39% overlap with human reviewers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Population-level estimation of AI-modified text is more robust and computationally efficient than individual document detection.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of classifying individual documents (which is brittle under distribution shifts), the framework models the aggregate token occurrence distributions for human text ($P$) and AI text ($Q$). It then uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to find the mixture parameter $\alpha$ (the fraction of AI text) that best explains the observed corpus statistics.
- **Core assumption:** The specific vocabulary usage of AI (e.g., frequency of adjectives like "commendable" or "meticulous") forms a stable, detectable statistical signature distinct from human writing patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "This method is over seven orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than existing approaches while maintaining superior accuracy under realistic distribution shifts."
  - [Section 3.4.3] "Our method reduces the in-distribution estimation error by 3.4 times... and the out-of-distribution estimation error by 4.6 times."
- **Break condition:** If AI writing styles converge fully with human styles, or if prompts change vocabulary drastically (e.g., "simplify this"), the token distributions $P$ and $Q$ may overlap significantly, causing estimation failure.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Standard GPT detectors systematically penalize non-native English speakers due to reliance on perplexity metrics.
- **Mechanism:** Detectors often flag text with low perplexity (high predictability) as AI-generated. Non-native writing, characterized by constrained grammar and vocabulary, naturally yields lower perplexity. Therefore, the detector conflates "linguistic simplicity" with "machine generation."
- **Core assumption:** Perplexity is inversely proportional to the likelihood of text being machine-generated, and non-native writing exhibits lower perplexity than native writing.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 2.2.1] "TOEFL essays unanimously misclassified as AI-generated show significantly lower perplexity... suggesting that GPT detectors might penalize authors with limited linguistic expressions."
  - [Section 2.2.2] "Using ChatGPT to improve the word choices... significantly reduces misclassification."
- **Break condition:** If detectors evolve to use semantic analysis or watermarking rather than perplexity-based scoring, this specific bias would theoretically disappear (though new biases may emerge).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** LLMs (specifically GPT-4) can generate scientific feedback with substantial overlap to human reviewers, particularly in identifying major flaws.
- **Mechanism:** The LLM parses the manuscript text and generates structured critiques. The overlap (30-39%) suggests the model identifies "convergent" issues—flaws or points obvious enough that multiple human reviewers would also likely flag them.
- **Core assumption:** The "hit rate" (percentage of AI comments matching at least one human comment) is a valid proxy for the utility and relevance of the feedback.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 6.3.1] "LLM feedback significantly overlaps with human-generated feedback... comparable to the overlap observed between two human reviewers (30-39% vs 28-35%)."
  - [Section 6.3.3] "Comments identified by multiple human reviewers are disproportionately more likely to be hit by GPT-4."
- **Break condition:** If the manuscript relies heavily on non-textual data (complex figures/math) that the text-only LLM cannot parse, or if the paper is extremely novel/paradigm-shifting such that "convergent" wisdom fails.

## Foundational Learning

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on Mixture Models**
- **Why needed here:** The core detection framework assumes a corpus is a mixture of two known distributions (Human $P$ and AI $Q$). You must understand how to mathematically estimate the mixing coefficient $\alpha$ to apply this method.
- **Quick check question:** If you have a bag of mixed red and blue marbles, and you know the probability of drawing a striped marble is 0.1 for red and 0.9 for blue, how would you estimate the percentage of blue marbles in the bag if 50% of your samples are striped?

**Perplexity and Entropy in NLP**
- **Why needed here:** Understanding why detectors flag "simple" writing is crucial for debugging false positives. Perplexity measures how "surprised" a model is by the next word; lower surprise is often an artifact of AI generation or constrained human writing.
- **Quick check question:** Why might a short, grammatically perfect sentence have *lower* perplexity than a long, rambling paragraph full of rare words?

**Distribution Shift / Concept Drift**
- **Why needed here:** The paper highlights that detectors fail when the "AI style" changes (e.g., GPT-3 vs GPT-4) or when prompts change. Recognizing that training data distributions are not static is vital for maintaining these systems.
- **Quick check question:** If an AI is prompted to "write like Shakespeare," would a detector trained on standard web text likely classify the output as Human or AI? Why?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Input Data -> Tokenizer and Frequency Counter -> Reference Models ($P$ and $Q$) -> MLE Solver -> Output ($\alpha$ estimate)

**Critical path:**
1. Generate "AI Corpus" by prompting an LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to perform the target task (e.g., write a review)
2. Extract token frequencies to define distribution $Q$
3. Extract token frequencies from historical human data to define $P$
4. Apply the MLE estimator to a target corpus to solve for $\alpha$

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Speed vs. Granularity: The method is extremely fast (O(1) relative to corpus size per estimation) but sacrifices *who* wrote the text for *how much* is AI
- Vocabulary Selection: Using "adjectives" (style words) is more robust than "nouns" (topic words) for cross-domain detection, but might miss AI text that strictly adheres to domain jargon

**Failure signatures:**
- Saturation: $\alpha$ estimates stuck at 100% or 0% regardless of input
- Drift: Estimates for pre-2022 human text suddenly rise, indicating the "Human" distribution $P$ is outdated or the "AI" distribution $Q$ is leaking into the human baseline
- Bias Alarm: High false positive rates on non-native speaker datasets (verifying Mechanism 2)

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Sanity Check (Synthetic):** Create a dataset with exactly 15% AI text and 85% Human text. Verify the estimator returns $\alpha \approx 0.15$
2. **Token Ablation:** Run the estimator using only *adjectives*, then only *verbs*, then *all words*. Compare accuracy and confidence intervals to see which token set drives the signal
3. **Temporal Stability:** Train the Human distribution $P$ on 2015 data and test on 2019 data. If $\alpha$ rises significantly for 2019 human text, the model is detecting "evolving human language" rather than AI

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Distribution Shift Vulnerability: The framework's performance on truly out-of-distribution data (e.g., highly technical domains or specialized writing styles) remains untested
- Perplexity Bias Validation: The empirical validation relies on TOEFL essay datasets that may not fully represent real-world academic writing patterns
- Feedback Overlap Interpretation: The methodology assumes that comments identified by multiple human reviewers represent high-quality feedback, but this may conflate consensus with substantive insight

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (supported by direct evidence and validation):
- Computational efficiency advantage of distributional quantification (7+ orders of magnitude faster than document-level detection)
- Systematic bias in GPT detectors against non-native English writers (validated through perplexity analysis of TOEFL essays)
- Widespread LLM adoption in academic publishing (22.5% in computer science by 2024)

**Medium Confidence** (supported by evidence but with methodological limitations):
- Population-level estimation accuracy under realistic distribution shifts
- Comparability of LLM-generated feedback to human reviewer overlap
- Risks of epistemic homogenization from LLM adoption

**Low Confidence** (theoretical predictions requiring additional validation):
- Long-term stability of distributional signatures across evolving LLM generations
- Generalizability of bias findings to all language assessment contexts
- Real-world impact of LLM feedback augmentation on scientific quality

## Next Checks

**Check 1: Cross-Domain Distribution Stability**
Test the distributional quantification framework on three diverse domains (legal documents, creative writing, and medical literature) using both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 outputs. Measure performance degradation and identify domain-specific vocabulary that may compromise detection accuracy.

**Check 2: Bias Amplification Under Prompt Engineering**
Evaluate whether sophisticated prompt engineering (e.g., "write in the style of a native speaker" or "use varied vocabulary") can systematically reduce the false positive rate for non-native speakers without compromising AI detection capability for other populations.

**Check 3: Feedback Quality Correlation Analysis**
Conduct a randomized controlled trial where manuscripts receive either human-only review, LLM-only review, or mixed review, then measure the correlation between feedback overlap and actual manuscript improvement metrics (acceptance rates, citation impact, or peer evaluation scores).
