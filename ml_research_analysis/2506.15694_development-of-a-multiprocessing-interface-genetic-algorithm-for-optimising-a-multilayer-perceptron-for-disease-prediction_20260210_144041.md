# Development of a Multiprocessing Interface Genetic Algorithm for Optimising a Multilayer Perceptron for Disease Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.15694
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15694
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: MIGA-optimized MLP achieves 99.12% accuracy for breast cancer, 94.87% for Parkinson’s, and 100% for chronic kidney disease with 60% time reduction

## Executive Summary
This study presents a hybrid framework combining kernel principal component analysis with a multiprocessing genetic algorithm (MIGA) to optimize multilayer perceptrons for disease prediction. The approach addresses computational inefficiency in hyperparameter tuning by parallelizing fitness evaluations while incorporating nonlinear feature extraction. The framework achieves high classification accuracy across three medical datasets and includes a graphical user interface for clinical adoption. The methodology demonstrates that parallelization can significantly reduce optimization time without sacrificing predictive performance.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates kernel PCA with radial basis function kernel for dimensionality reduction, followed by an MLP optimized using a multiprocessing genetic algorithm. The MIGA parallelizes fitness evaluations across CPU cores using Python's multiprocessing library, reducing tuning time by approximately 60% compared to standard GA. The genetic algorithm searches for optimal MLP hyperparameters including layer count, neuron count per layer, activation functions, and learning rate. A GUI allows nonexpert users to apply the framework without coding knowledge.

## Key Results
- Breast cancer dataset: 99.12% accuracy with optimized hyperparameters
- Parkinson's disease dataset: 94.87% accuracy
- Chronic kidney disease dataset: 100% accuracy
- 60% reduction in tuning time compared to standard genetic algorithm

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MIGA achieves computational efficiency through parallelization of fitness evaluations across multiple CPU cores, while kernel PCA extracts nonlinear feature relationships that improve MLP learning. The genetic algorithm effectively explores the high-dimensional hyperparameter space by maintaining population diversity and applying crossover and mutation operators. The combination of parallel processing and informed feature extraction creates a computationally efficient optimization pathway that scales better than sequential approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Kernel PCA**: Non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that projects data into higher-dimensional space where linear separation is possible; needed to capture complex feature relationships in medical data; quick check: verify eigenvalues decay appropriately
- **Multiprocessing in Python**: Parallel execution model using multiple CPU cores to speed up computation; needed to reduce genetic algorithm tuning time; quick check: monitor CPU utilization during parallel execution
- **Genetic Algorithm Operations**: Selection, crossover, and mutation processes for evolutionary optimization; needed to explore hyperparameter space efficiently; quick check: ensure population diversity remains above threshold
- **MLP Architecture**: Feedforward neural network with input, hidden, and output layers; needed as the predictive model; quick check: verify gradient flow during training
- **Fitness Function Design**: Objective metric that guides genetic algorithm optimization; needed to evaluate MLP performance during hyperparameter search; quick check: ensure fitness function captures desired performance characteristics

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Kernel PCA (RBF kernel) -> MLP architecture generator -> MIGA parallel fitness evaluation -> GUI interface

**Critical Path**
Data preprocessing → Kernel PCA feature extraction → Genetic algorithm initialization → Parallel fitness evaluation → Model selection → GUI deployment

**Design Tradeoffs**
Parallelization vs. memory overhead: MIGA uses multiprocessing which provides speed but increases memory usage compared to threading. Feature extraction vs. computational cost: Kernel PCA adds preprocessing time but may improve model accuracy. Genetic algorithm diversity vs. convergence speed: Maintaining diversity slows convergence but reduces risk of local optima.

**Failure Signatures**
Overfitting: Perfect training accuracy but poor generalization (especially concerning the 100% CKD result). Convergence failure: Genetic algorithm population stagnation with no improvement over generations. Memory exhaustion: Multiprocessing creating too many worker processes for available RAM.

**First Experiments**
1. Run MIGA with reduced population size to verify parallelization benefits
2. Compare kernel PCA with standard PCA on same datasets
3. Test single-core vs. multi-core execution to measure speedup

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the MIGA-MLP framework maintain its high predictive accuracy and efficiency when applied to larger, multi-center clinical cohorts, and what specific feature interactions will it reveal?
- Basis in paper: The Discussion states, "Future work will apply this methodology to additional clinical cohorts to confirm its robustness and to discover dataset-specific feature interactions."
- Why unresolved: The current study validates the framework only on three relatively small, publicly available datasets (UCI repository), which may not represent the complexity of larger clinical environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application and robust accuracy reporting on larger-scale hospital datasets with diverse patient demographics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the reported 100% accuracy on the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) dataset indicate model overfitting or data leakage resulting from the simple random splitting of a small dataset?
- Basis in paper: Table 5 shows the MLP achieved a perfect 1.0000 (100%) accuracy on the CKD dataset (400 instances), which is often a red flag for overfitting, especially given the data preprocessing involved KNN imputation on the training set.
- Why unresolved: The methodology (Section 3.2) uses a single random 80/20 split rather than cross-validation, making the performance metrics potentially volatile and less reliable for such a small dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-evaluation of the CKD model using stratified k-fold cross-validation to verify that the perfect score is not an artifact of the specific data split.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the computational efficiency of the MIGA compare to modern, industry-standard parallel hyperparameter optimization frameworks such as Optuna or Ray Tune?
- Basis in paper: The study compares the proposed MIGA against Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and standard GA, but omits comparison with contemporary libraries that also utilize parallel processing primitives.
- Why unresolved: While MIGA shows a 60% improvement over standard GA, it is unclear if a custom ThreadPoolExecutor approach outperforms highly optimized, state-of-the-art parallel tuning libraries.
- What evidence would resolve it: A benchmark experiment comparing tuning time and final accuracy between MIGA and parallelized Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) implementations.

## Limitations
- Kernel PCA hyperparameters (kernel type, number of components) were not systematically optimized
- Single random data split rather than cross-validation limits reliability of performance metrics
- No comparison against established automated ML frameworks (Auto-Sklearn, TPOT) to validate MIGA's superiority
- Perfect accuracy on CKD dataset raises overfitting concerns given the small dataset size
- Reproducibility depends on implementation details not fully disclosed in the paper

## Confidence

**Confidence labels:**
- MLP classification accuracy claims: **Medium** - High accuracy reported but lacks statistical significance testing and cross-validation details
- MIGA time reduction claims: **High** - Parallel processing benefits are well-established, though specific 60% figure needs independent verification
- GUI usability claims: **Low** - No user study data or quantitative usability metrics provided

## Next Checks
1. Conduct k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability across data partitions
2. Benchmark against standard automated ML tools on identical datasets and hardware
3. Perform ablation study comparing MIGA-tuned models with randomly initialized MLPs to quantify optimization benefits
