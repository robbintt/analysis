# Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.15304
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15304
- **Reference count**: 6
- **Primary result**: Poetic reformulation achieves 62% average attack-success rate across 25 frontier LLMs

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that poetic reformulation serves as a universal, single-turn jailbreak mechanism for large language models. Across 25 frontier models, adversarial poetry prompts achieved an average attack-success rate of 62%, with some models exceeding 90% ASR. The vulnerability persisted across multiple safety domains including CBRN, cyber-offense, manipulation, and loss-of-control scenarios. The systematic transformation of 1,200 MLCommons prompts into verse revealed that stylistic surface-form variation alone can bypass safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment approaches.

The research tested models from nine different providers and found susceptibility across all, indicating this is a structural vulnerability rather than provider-specific. Results show that current safety evaluations may overstate real-world robustness, as poetic framing dramatically degrades refusal performance across model families. The study's findings highlight that current alignment methods may be insufficient against surface-level adversarial transformations that maintain semantic content while altering stylistic presentation.

## Method Summary
The study systematically transformed 1,200 MLCommons safety prompts into adversarial poetry while preserving semantic content. These transformed prompts were then evaluated across 25 frontier language models from nine different providers. The researchers measured attack-success rates across multiple safety domains including CBRN, cyber-offense, manipulation, and loss-of-control scenarios. Automated evaluation was used to assess model responses and determine whether safety mechanisms were bypassed. The poetic transformations maintained the core intent of the original prompts while altering their surface form through verse structure and stylistic elements.

## Key Results
- Poetic reformulation achieved 62% average attack-success rate across 25 frontier models
- Some models exceeded 90% attack-success rate when confronted with poetic prompts
- Vulnerability persisted across four major safety domains: CBRN, cyber-offense, manipulation, and loss-of-control
- Models from all nine evaluated providers were susceptible, indicating structural rather than provider-specific vulnerability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism appears to exploit a fundamental limitation in how LLMs process surface-form variations versus semantic content. Current alignment approaches focus heavily on semantic understanding and explicit safety triggers, but appear vulnerable to stylistic transformations that maintain meaning while altering presentation. The poetic form may bypass safety mechanisms by presenting harmful content in a format that doesn't trigger traditional safety classifiers, which likely rely on surface-level pattern matching and explicit trigger words. This suggests that current safety mechanisms may be overly reliant on recognizing specific phrasings rather than understanding intent regardless of presentation style.

## Foundational Learning
- **MLCommons safety prompts**: Standardized safety evaluation benchmarks used to test model responses to potentially harmful content. Why needed: Provides consistent, validated test cases for safety evaluation. Quick check: Are prompts comprehensive across all relevant safety domains?
- **Attack-success rate (ASR)**: Metric measuring the percentage of prompts that successfully bypass safety mechanisms. Why needed: Quantifies effectiveness of jailbreak attempts. Quick check: Does ASR correlate with real-world safety performance?
- **Surface-form variation**: Changes to the presentation or style of text while preserving semantic meaning. Why needed: Identifies whether models are vulnerable to stylistic adversarial attacks. Quick check: Do other surface transformations (legal language, jargon) show similar vulnerabilities?
- **Safety domain classification**: Categorization of harmful content into domains like CBRN, cyber-offense, manipulation, and loss-of-control. Why needed: Enables systematic testing across different types of safety concerns. Quick check: Are all relevant safety domains adequately represented?
- **Single-turn jailbreak**: Attack that succeeds in one interaction without requiring multi-turn conversation. Why needed: Demonstrates vulnerability to immediate adversarial prompts. Quick check: Does this vulnerability persist in multi-turn contexts?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Safety classifiers -> Semantic analysis -> Surface pattern matching -> Response generation
Critical path: Input prompt → Poetic transformation → Safety evaluation → Model response
Design tradeoffs: Current architectures balance computational efficiency with safety, potentially sacrificing robustness to surface-form variations
Failure signatures: High ASR to poetic prompts, inconsistent refusal rates across stylistic variations
3 first experiments: 1) Test other stylistic transformations beyond poetry, 2) Evaluate defensive fine-tuning effectiveness, 3) Compare safety performance across different model families

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings based on automated evaluations may not capture full real-world deployment complexity
- Poetic transformations may not represent complete diversity of potential adversarial inputs
- 62% average ASR masks significant variation between individual models
- Study did not investigate underlying mechanisms of model vulnerability to poetic prompts

## Confidence
High: Core finding that poetic reformulation increases attack-success rates across multiple models and safety domains is well-supported
Medium: Assertion that this represents a "universal" vulnerability may overstate case given observed variation
Low: Implications for real-world deployment are suggestive but require additional validation in naturalistic settings

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess whether poetic prompts would be perceived as genuinely harmless
2. Test transferability of poetic vulnerability to other stylistic transformations like legal language or technical jargon
3. Investigate temporal stability by testing whether model updates affect susceptibility to poetic jailbreaks
