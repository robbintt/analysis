# Causal Structure Learning for Dynamical Systems with Theoretical Score Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.14361
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14361
- Reference count: 40
- CADYT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on causal structure learning in continuous-time dynamical systems

## Executive Summary
CADYT is a novel method for causal structure learning in continuous-time dynamical systems that addresses the challenges of irregular sampling and causal structure identification. The approach combines Gaussian Process regression with exact inference for continuous-time modeling and employs an information-theoretic scoring mechanism based on the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. CADYT uses a greedy search algorithm to discover the underlying causal structure, showing superior performance compared to existing methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data.

## Method Summary
CADYT addresses causal discovery in continuous-time dynamical systems by modeling the underlying dynamics using Gaussian Processes with exact inference. The method employs an information-theoretic score based on the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle to evaluate potential causal structures. A greedy search algorithm is used to find the most likely causal structure that explains the observed data. The approach is designed to handle irregular sampling patterns common in real-world dynamical systems while maintaining computational tractability through exact GP inference.

## Key Results
- CADYT outperforms state-of-the-art methods including DYNOTEARS, PCMCI+, and VARLINGAM
- Achieves lower Structural Hamming Distance and higher F1 scores and AUPRC values
- Successfully discovers causal networks closer to true underlying dynamics in both regularly and irregularly-sampled data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CADYT's effectiveness stems from its ability to model continuous-time dynamics accurately using Gaussian Processes with exact inference, which captures the temporal dependencies in irregularly-sampled data. The information-theoretic scoring approach based on the Algorithmic Markov Condition provides a principled way to evaluate causal structures by balancing model complexity and fit. The greedy search algorithm efficiently explores the space of possible causal structures while the MDL principle ensures that simpler, more parsimonious explanations are preferred.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gaussian Processes**: Probabilistic models that define distributions over functions; needed for continuous-time modeling and uncertainty quantification; quick check: understand kernel functions and covariance structure
- **Algorithmic Markov Condition**: Principle stating that the most likely causal structure minimizes the joint description length; needed for principled causal inference; quick check: grasp the connection between compression and causation
- **Minimum Description Length**: Information-theoretic principle that favors simpler models; needed for balancing model complexity and fit; quick check: understand how MDL relates to Bayesian model selection
- **Structural Hamming Distance**: Metric for comparing causal graphs; needed for quantitative evaluation of discovered structures; quick check: know how it differs from other graph distance measures
- **Greedy Search Algorithms**: Heuristic optimization approach that makes locally optimal choices; needed for tractable exploration of causal structure space; quick check: understand limitations and potential for local optima

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data -> GP Modeling -> Information-theoretic Scoring -> Greedy Search -> Causal Structure
**Critical Path**: Input time series data is first modeled using GP regression to capture continuous-time dynamics, then candidate causal structures are evaluated using the MDL-based score, with the greedy search algorithm selecting the optimal structure that minimizes description length
**Design Tradeoffs**: Exact GP inference provides accurate uncertainty quantification but may limit scalability; greedy search is computationally efficient but may miss global optima; MDL scoring balances complexity and fit but requires careful parameter tuning
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on highly non-linear systems, sensitivity to noise levels, potential local optima trapping in greedy search, scalability issues with high-dimensional systems
**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Test on synthetic regularly-sampled data with known ground truth, 2) Evaluate on irregularly-sampled synthetic data, 3) Compare performance against baselines on same datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation is based solely on synthetic data with known ground truth
- Computational complexity of exact GP inference may limit scalability to high-dimensional systems
- Assumptions of Gaussian processes and MDL principle may not hold for all real-world systems with noise and non-linearities

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: CADYT's theoretical foundation and its superiority over baseline methods on synthetic datasets
**Medium Confidence**: Scalability claims and performance on irregularly-sampled data
**Low Confidence**: Real-world applicability and robustness to violations of Gaussian process assumptions

## Next Checks
1. Test CADYT on multiple real-world dynamical systems with known or partially-known causal structures to assess practical performance
2. Evaluate computational scalability with increasing system dimensionality and time series length
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis to different noise levels, non-linearities, and sampling patterns to understand method limitations
