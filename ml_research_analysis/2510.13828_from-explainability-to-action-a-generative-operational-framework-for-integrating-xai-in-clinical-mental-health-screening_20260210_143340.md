# From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13828
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828
- Reference count: 40
- Identifies translation gap where technical XAI outputs fail to deliver clinically actionable insights

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical barrier in mental health screening: the inability of technical XAI outputs (like SHAP feature importance) to provide clinically actionable insights. The Generative Operational Framework proposes using LLMs as a "translation engine" to synthesize XAI outputs with clinical guidelines (via RAG) into human-readable, evidence-backed narratives. The framework directly addresses operational barriers including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and stakeholder-specific communication, representing a shift from isolated technical data points toward integrated, trustworthy, and actionable AI explanations in clinical practice.

## Method Summary
The framework operates on a pipeline architecture where a base ML model generates predictions, post-hoc XAI tools (like SHAP) produce technical explanations, and an LLM synthesizes these outputs with clinical guidelines retrieved via RAG into coherent narratives. The system requires training a predictive model on multimodal mental health data, applying SHAP/LIME for feature attribution, implementing RAG against clinical guideline corpora, and using LLM prompting to generate stakeholder-specific explanations. The minimum viable reproduction involves selecting a benchmark dataset (e.g., DAIC-WOZ), training a classifier, applying XAI methods, implementing RAG, and constructing LLM prompts for narrative generation.

## Key Results
- Identifies translation gap as primary barrier to clinical XAI adoption
- Proposes novel pipeline architecture using LLM + RAG for clinical narrative generation
- Addresses operational barriers: workflow integration, bias mitigation, stakeholder communication
- Shifts focus from technical explanations to integrated, actionable AI in clinical practice

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: LLM-Based Translation of Technical XAI to Clinical Narrative
An LLM functions as a "translation engine" converting opaque technical XAI outputs (e.g., SHAP feature importance scores) into clinically actionable narratives by synthesizing them with patient history and clinical guidelines. The framework operates on a pipeline: base ML model generates prediction → post-hoc XAI tools produce technical explanations → LLM ingests these outputs → augmented by RAG, LLM retrieves clinical context and synthesizes evidence-backed narrative. Core assumption: primary barrier is "translation problem" where technical data isn't actionable information. Evidence: framework uses SHAP outputs fed into LLM to create SAFE-T-aligned narratives. Failure occurs if generated explanations misrepresent model reasoning.

### Mechanism 2: Stakeholder-Specific Output Formatting
Clinical adoption requires dynamically reformatting explanations to serve distinct user groups' needs, time constraints, and goals. The generative engine's output is parameterized by target stakeholder: clinicians receive concise, actionable summaries for 15-minute consultations; patients get empathetic, comprehensible language; administrators focus on audit trails. Core assumption: utility is relative to recipient's role; "one-size-fits-all" explanations fail for critical stakeholders. Evidence: framework addresses "stakeholder-specific communication" and provides tailored outputs. Failure occurs if system cannot identify user context or reformatting loses critical nuance.

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Workflow Integration via Co-Design
Successful clinical translation requires iterative implementation centered on continuous feedback from end-users, moving from pre-deployment co-design through pilot testing to full integration. Operational pathway is staged: pre-deployment co-design with clinicians to map workflows; pilot testing to measure cognitive load and decision impact; full integration with EHR integration and staff training, maintaining continuous feedback loops. Core assumption: technical efficacy doesn't equal clinical utility; primary barriers are human and organizational. Evidence: framework provides "strategic roadmap" for moving "beyond generation of isolated data points" through iterative rollout. Failure occurs if feedback isn't incorporated, resulting in clinically irrelevant "shelfware."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Post-Hoc Explainability (SHAP/LIME)**
  - Why needed: Raw input for generative framework; understand SHAP/LIME attribute importance to features but produce technical outputs (plots, value arrays), not natural language explanations
  - Quick check: Can you distinguish between a model's prediction and a post-hoc tool's explanation of that prediction?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed: Key evidence-anchoring mechanism; allows LLM to cite clinical guidelines rather than relying on potentially flawed pre-trained memory, critical for safety
  - Quick check: How does RAG reduce risk of LLM hallucination in clinical context?

- **Concept: Clinical Workflow Integration**
  - Why needed: Primary adoption barrier; understand AI tool must fit into 15-minute consultation without adding cognitive load
  - Quick check: Why might highly accurate AI tool be rejected by clinicians even if explanations are technically correct?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component Map:** Patient data → Prediction Engine → Technical XAI Module → Translation Engine (LLM) → Knowledge Store (RAG) → Output Interface

- **Critical Path:** Technical XAI Output → LLM Translation Prompt → RAG-Augmented Synthesis → Clinician Narrative. Failure in RAG retrieval step directly leads to ungrounded, potentially hallucinated explanations.

- **Design Tradeoffs:**
  - LLM Fidelity vs. Fluency: More fluent, narrative outputs may smooth over subtle uncertainties in technical XAI data
  - Granularity vs. Timeliness: Detailed explanation may be too long for time-constrained clinician; system must balance depth with brevity

- **Failure Signatures:**
  - Hallucinated Justification: LLM invents rationale not present in XAI output or clinical guidelines
  - Actionability Gap: Generated narrative accurately describes model's logic but offers no clear path for clinical intervention
  - Context Mismatch: Providing patient-facing explanation to clinician, or vice versa

- **First 3 Experiments:**
  1. End-to-End Pipeline Validation: Feed synthetic patient data through entire pipeline to verify LLM can correctly synthesize SHAP explanation with retrieved DSM-5 criterion into coherent paragraph
  2. RAG Retrieval Precision: Test knowledge store by querying with XAI-derived keywords (e.g., "hopeless language") and measuring if it retrieves correct, relevant clinical guideline passages
  3. Clinician Shadowing: Observe 2-3 clinicians interacting with prototype output for 15 minutes each to validate "actionability" and "timeliness" of generated narrative

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can explanation faithfulness be rigorously audited when LLMs generate clinically fluent narratives that may not accurately reflect underlying model's true reasoning? Basis: LLM-generated explanations may create plausible but clinically misleading justifications. Unresolved because current XAI techniques verify technical fidelity, but LLM-generated natural language explanations introduce new layer where articulation and accuracy can diverge. Resolution requires automated faithfulness audits validated against clinician judgment in controlled studies comparing LLM narrative explanations to ground-truth model attributions.

### Open Question 2
What benchmark datasets and standardized metrics are needed to simultaneously evaluate clinical fidelity (DSM-5 alignment), explanation utility (actionability), demographic fairness, and temporal stability of XAI systems? Basis: No current dataset evaluates all four dimensions simultaneously. Unresolved because existing datasets focus on narrow dimensions and lack multimodal, demographically diverse, longitudinally structured data required. Resolution requires creation and open release of multimodal benchmark dataset with annotations across all four dimensions.

### Open Question 3
Do LLM-generated XAI explanations improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes in longitudinal real-world deployments, compared to traditional post-hoc methods? Basis: Fidelity, comprehensibility, and utility metrics are "rarely evaluated together in rigorous clinical validation studies" and no longitudinal impact data exists. Unresolved because framework identifies need for longitudinal studies demonstrating real-world impact. Resolution requires randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies tracking diagnostic accuracy, treatment adherence, and clinical outcomes over time.

### Open Question 4
How can bias in explanations be detected and mitigated, given that biased models may produce explanations that merely justify biased predictions—particularly for marginalized demographic groups? Basis: Biased models produce explanations that justify biased results; bias exists in both prediction and explanation itself. Unresolved because current fairness audits focus on prediction disparities; explanation utility and accuracy across demographic groups remain unmeasured. Resolution requires fairness audits measuring both prediction accuracy and explanation quality stratified by age, race, gender, and health literacy.

## Limitations
- LLM fidelity to source XAI outputs depends heavily on translation accuracy with no quantitative measure provided
- RAG-augmented synthesis assumes clinical guidelines are sufficiently comprehensive and up-to-date across diverse conditions
- Iterative implementation model requires sustained stakeholder engagement but doesn't address potential resistance or resource constraints

## Confidence

- **High:** Identification of translation gap between technical XAI outputs and clinical actionability
- **Medium:** Proposed pipeline architecture (XAI → LLM → RAG → Narrative)
- **Low:** Effectiveness of stakeholder-specific formatting without empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct end-to-end fidelity testing comparing LLM-generated narratives against raw SHAP attributions
2. Validate RAG retrieval precision using clinical keyword queries against DSM-5 corpus
3. Perform clinician shadowing sessions to evaluate actionability and timeliness of generated explanations
