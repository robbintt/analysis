# FLAIR: Feedback Learning for Adaptive Information Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.13390
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13390
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 22% improvement in recall for seen queries, 10% for unseen queries in production Copilot DECO

## Executive Summary
FLAIR introduces a lightweight feedback learning framework for adaptive information retrieval in large language model (LLM) copilots. It addresses the challenge of embedding misalignment in domain-specific technical contexts by integrating user feedback and synthetic queries into a two-track ranking mechanism. The framework operates offline by collecting feedback indicators and generating synthetic queries from documentation, then online by re-ranking retrieved documents based on both similarity scores and feedback signals. Integrated into Microsoft's Copilot DECO, FLAIR demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining production scalability.

## Method Summary
FLAIR implements a two-track ranking mechanism that combines traditional similarity-based retrieval with feedback-aware re-ranking. The offline component collects user feedback indicators and generates synthetic queries from documentation to train feedback models. The online component performs document retrieval using standard similarity metrics, then applies a two-track ranking system that considers both similarity scores and feedback signals to produce final results. This approach allows the system to adapt to domain-specific terminology and user preferences while maintaining the efficiency required for production deployment in LLM copilots.

## Key Results
- 22% improvement in recall for seen queries compared to baseline methods
- 10% improvement in recall for unseen queries over state-of-the-art approaches
- Outperforms NUDGE and HyQE on Microsoft's Copilot DECO production environment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FLAIR works by addressing the fundamental limitation of static embedding models in domain-specific contexts. Traditional retrieval systems rely solely on similarity scores that may not capture the nuances of technical terminology or user preferences. By incorporating user feedback indicators and synthetic queries generated from documentation, FLAIR creates a dynamic feedback loop that continuously improves retrieval accuracy. The two-track ranking mechanism allows the system to balance between general similarity and domain-specific relevance, making it particularly effective for technical support scenarios where precise information retrieval is critical.

## Foundational Learning
- **Feedback indicators computation**: The system needs to quantify user interactions to identify relevant documents; quick check: verify feedback indicators correlate with actual document usefulness through user studies
- **Synthetic query generation**: Creating queries from documentation helps bridge vocabulary gaps; quick check: measure coverage of synthetic queries against real user query distribution
- **Two-track ranking**: Combining similarity and feedback signals provides balanced retrieval; quick check: ablate each track to measure individual contribution to performance
- **Offline training pipeline**: Pre-computing feedback models reduces online latency; quick check: measure training time vs. online inference speed
- **Domain adaptation**: Technical contexts require specialized vocabulary handling; quick check: test performance across different technical domains
- **Production scalability**: System must handle thousands of concurrent users; quick check: benchmark throughput under realistic load conditions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: User Interaction -> Feedback Collection -> Synthetic Query Generation -> Model Training -> Online Retrieval -> Two-Track Ranking -> Final Results

Critical Path: User Query -> Document Retrieval -> Two-Track Ranking -> Output

Design Tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes accuracy over pure speed by adding feedback-based re-ranking, accepting slight latency increases for significant recall improvements. This tradeoff is justified by the technical support context where finding correct information outweighs minor response time delays.

Failure Signatures: Poor feedback indicators may indicate user confusion or system misunderstanding; synthetic queries might not cover edge cases; two-track ranking could overfit to specific feedback patterns; production deployment might face scalability bottlenecks under peak loads.

First Experiments:
1. Implement basic feedback indicator computation using simple click-through rates and measure correlation with document relevance
2. Generate synthetic queries from technical documentation and evaluate coverage against real user queries
3. Compare two-track ranking performance against single-track similarity-based retrieval using ablation studies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Proprietary datasets prevent independent validation of reported 22% and 10% recall improvements
- Key algorithmic details for feedback indicators and synthetic query generation are omitted
- Computational overhead and latency impact of the two-track ranking mechanism are not quantified

## Confidence
- FLAIR framework design and methodology: **Medium** - The two-track approach is clearly described, but key algorithmic details are omitted
- Performance improvements over baselines: **Medium** - Results are reported but cannot be independently verified due to proprietary datasets
- Production deployment and scalability: **Low** - Claims lack supporting quantitative evidence

## Next Checks
1. Implement a simplified version of the feedback indicator computation and synthetic query generation using open-source datasets to verify the basic approach works
2. Conduct ablation studies to measure the individual contributions of the similarity track vs feedback track to the overall performance gains
3. Perform computational overhead analysis comparing FLAIR's online ranking latency against baseline RAG implementations under realistic load conditions
