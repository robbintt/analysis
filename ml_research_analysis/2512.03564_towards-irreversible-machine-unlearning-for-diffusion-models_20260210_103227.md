# Towards Irreversible Machine Unlearning for Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.03564
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03564
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposes DiMRA attack and DiMUM defense for diffusion model unlearning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of finetuning-based machine unlearning methods in conditional diffusion models (CDMs) to relearning attacks. The authors propose DiMRA, an attack that can reverse state-of-the-art unlearning by continuing optimization on auxiliary data, and DiMUM, a novel unlearning method that achieves robustness through convergent memorization of alternative data. Experimental results demonstrate that DiMRA effectively attacks existing methods, while DiMUM shows superior performance in preserving generative quality and resisting attacks.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two main components: DiMRA, a relearning attack that fine-tunes unlearned diffusion models on auxiliary datasets to regenerate previously unlearned elements, and DiMUM, a convergent unlearning method that replaces targeted data with alternative data during training. DiMUM constructs synthetic data pairing retain images with unlearning prompts, then applies standard diffusion loss to converge to a new stable optimum that resists reversal. The approach is validated on CIFAR-10 for object unlearning and UnlearnCanvas for feature unlearning.

## Key Results
- DiMRA successfully reverses non-convergent unlearning losses in existing methods, achieving AR_DiMRA > 0.9 after 1K steps
- DiMUM achieves convergence with AR_DiMRA as low as 0.02 after 2K steps while maintaining FID scores close to pre-unlearning levels
- The attack's effectiveness correlates with the convergence behavior of the unlearning loss function
- Robustness requires 10K-20K unlearning steps depending on task complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: DiMRA Exploits Non-Convergent Unlearning Losses
Existing finetuning-based machine unlearning methods leave model parameters in a vulnerable non-optimal state that can be reversed through continued optimization on auxiliary data, even without knowledge of the original unlearning target. Finetuning-based MU methods use loss functions where the unlearning term is either divergent (gradient ascent) or non-convergent (mismatched replacement targets). The retain loss constrains parameters to stay near the pre-trained optimum, preventing convergence to a new stable state. Further optimization on any related dataset pushes parameters back toward the original basin. If unlearning loss converges to a distinct local optimum, DiMRA's gradient descent naturally stabilizes at that point rather than reversing.

### Mechanism 2: DiMUM Achieves Robustness Through Convergent Memorization
By restructuring unlearning as memorization of alternative data using a convergent loss, the model reaches a new stable optimum that resists reversal attacks. DiMUM constructs a synthetic dataset pairing retain images with unlearning prompts, then applies the standard diffusion loss. Since this loss has the same convergent form as pre-training, the model converges to a new optimum where unlearning prompts generate retain-distribution images. This optimum is also a local optimum for the DiMRA loss, blocking gradient-based reversal. If alternative data distribution deviates significantly from retain set, convergence quality and generation fidelity may degrade.

### Mechanism 3: Attack Effectiveness Correlates With Loss Convergence Quality
The susceptibility of an unlearned model to relearning attack is predictable from the convergence behavior of its unlearning loss function. Non-convergent losses leave optimization trajectories incomplete—parameters remain on a gradient path that DiMRA can continue. Convergent losses terminate at stable points where further optimization on related data produces minimal parameter change. AR_CL metric directly measures whether the model "remembers" its post-unlearning behavior under attack. Excessive unlearning steps may still degrade retained knowledge even with convergent loss; convergence alone doesn't guarantee utility preservation.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) and Classifier-Free Guidance
Why needed here: The entire methodology operates on CDMs where conditioning controls generation. Understanding the forward process, reverse denoising, and how CFG blends conditional/unconditional predictions is essential for seeing how unlearning can selectively target specific conditions. Quick check: Given the reverse process equation, what happens to generation if you set β=0? How does this relate to why some methods align unlearning targets with unconditional scores?

### Concept: Machine Unlearning as Distribution Matching
Why needed here: Definition formalizes MU as a dual objective: matching P_u to P_target while blocking generation of unlearned elements. This framing reveals why simple loss maximization is insufficient—it may succeed at blocking while failing at maintaining utility. Quick check: If P_target excludes images with unlearning features, why can't we simply retrain the model on D_r from scratch? What practical constraint motivates finetuning-based approaches?

### Concept: Loss Landscape Geometry and Optimization Convergence
Why needed here: The core insight is topological: non-convergent unlearning leaves parameters on an incomplete trajectory through loss space. DiMRA continues this trajectory; DiMUM terminates it at a new basin. Understanding local optima, gradient dynamics, and what makes a loss "convergent" explains the attack-defense asymmetry. Quick check: Why does the retain loss create a "constraint" rather than just another optimization term? How does β control the tradeoff between staying near the pre-trained optimum versus satisfying the unlearning objective?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Noise prediction network -> Forward diffusion -> Reverse sampling -> Unlearning module -> Attack pipeline

### Critical path:
1. Pre-train or load base model; verify generation quality on both retain and unlearning classes
2. Apply unlearning: select method; construct D_u and D_r; run unlearning optimization
3. Validate unlearning: compute AR_MU and FID on retain set
4. Launch attack: construct D_aux; optimize unlearned model using standard diffusion loss
5. Assess robustness: track AR_DiMRA over attack steps

### Design tradeoffs:
- Unlearning step count: More steps improve convergence and robustness but increase computational cost
- Alternative data selection: Must be semantically coherent but distributionally similar to retain set
- Balancing coefficient β: Higher β prioritizes unlearning over retention
- Auxiliary dataset realism: Attack effectiveness drops when D_aux differs from true retain set

### Failure signatures:
- Divergent unlearning: FID spikes rapidly; generated images become unrecognizable
- Apparent-but-reversible unlearning: AR_MU=0 but AR_DiMRA>0.9 after 1K attack steps
- Incomplete convergence: FID increases as unlearning and retain objectives haven't reconciled
- Class-dependent difficulty: Some concepts harder to robustly unlearn than others

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Attack vector validation:** Train DDPM on CIFAR-10, apply unlearning to "automobile" class, launch DiMRA using test set as auxiliary dataset, confirm AR_DiMRA climbs to 0.7-0.8
2. **Convergence diagnosis:** Implement all three loss types and plot training curves during unlearning; correlate loss convergence patterns with post-attack AR_DiMRA
3. **Robustness scaling curve:** For DiMUM, sweep unlearning steps and measure AR_DiMRA after fixed attack duration; expect monotonic decrease in AR_DiMRA as unlearning steps increase

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Question: Can relearning attacks be adapted to effectively compromise filter-based machine unlearning methods in diffusion models?
Basis in paper: Page 2 states, "It is worth noting that our proposed attack, DiMRA, is not designed to target filter-based MU for CDMs, but rather to target finetuning-based approaches."
Why unresolved: The paper explicitly limits the scope of DiMRA to finetuning-based methods, leaving the vulnerability of filter-based methods to parameter optimization attacks unexplored.
What evidence would resolve it: A study applying parameter-space optimization attacks similar to DiMRA against models protected by filter-based unlearning techniques.

### Open Question 2
Question: How does the semantic distance between the "alternative data" and the "retain set" impact the convergence and robustness of DiMUM?
Basis in paper: Page 5 assumes "the unlearning loss has limited impact on the convergence of the retain loss since the images in D'_u follows a similar distribution to those in D_r."
Why unresolved: The experiments primarily used semantically close alternatives, so the method's behavior with distinct or dissimilar alternative data distributions remains unverified.
What evidence would resolve it: Experiments utilizing alternative datasets with varying degrees of distributional shift from the retain set to measure convergence speed and FID degradation.

### Open Question 3
Question: How can unlearning loss functions be mathematically constrained to guarantee convergence to a new local optimum without relying on the memorization of alternative data?
Basis in paper: Page 11 recommends that "future research about MU for CDMs prioritize the convergence of the unlearning loss, rather than merely degrading the generative ability."
Why unresolved: While DiMUM solves this via memorization, the authors explicitly call for broader research into convergent loss designs that do not necessarily depend on the specific DiMUM mechanism.
What evidence would resolve it: The derivation of novel unlearning loss functions that are theoretically convergent and their validation on standard benchmarks.

## Limitations
- Generalization across model architectures remains untested; effectiveness may differ in newer diffusion models
- DiMUM's robustness critically depends on finding semantically coherent alternative data, which may not exist for many domains
- Unlearning step-count scalability is problematic; higher-resolution images require proportionally more steps

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: DiMRA's attack mechanism and effectiveness on non-convergent unlearning losses
- **Medium confidence**: DiMUM's theoretical robustness based on convergent loss design and experimental results on CIFAR-10 and UnlearnCanvas
- **Low confidence**: Generalization of convergence-robustness relationship across different diffusion architectures and unlearning objectives

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence behavior verification:** Implement all three loss types and plot training curves during unlearning; correlate loss convergence patterns with post-attack AR_DiMRA to validate the mechanism linking non-convergence to attack susceptibility
2. **Scalability test:** Apply DiMUM to a 512×512 diffusion model with an object unlearning task; measure FID and AR_DiMRA at 1K, 5K, and 10K unlearning steps to establish practical step-count requirements
3. **Architecture generalization:** Replace the DDPM backbone with a modern architecture (e.g., DPM-Solver or Latent Diffusion) and repeat the CIFAR-10 unlearning experiment; compare convergence behavior and AR_DiMRA values to test if the attack-defense dynamics transfer
