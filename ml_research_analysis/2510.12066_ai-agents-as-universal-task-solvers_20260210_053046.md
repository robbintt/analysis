# AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.12066
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066
- **Authors:** Alessandro Achille; Stefano Soatto
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Modern AI reasoning agents can function as universal task solvers capable of solving any computable problem

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes that modern AI reasoning agents, particularly LLMs with chain-of-thought capabilities, can function as universal task solvers capable of solving any computable problem. The authors formalize these agents as stochastic dynamical systems and introduce a new notion of "proper time" to measure computational effort. They demonstrate that learning in this setting is fundamentally about reducing inference time rather than improving accuracy, with speed-up factors directly related to algorithmic mutual information between training data and solutions. A key theoretical result provides a power-law scaling relationship between training time and inference time.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize AI reasoning agents as stochastic dynamical systems, introducing a notion of "proper time" to measure computational effort. They analyze the trade-off between training and inference time, showing that learning fundamentally reduces inference time rather than improving accuracy. The framework uses algorithmic mutual information to quantify the relationship between training data and solutions. They establish power-law scaling relationships and examine how scaling model size can lead to "savant" behavior where brute-force computation replaces genuine learning.

## Key Results
- Modern AI reasoning agents can function as universal task solvers capable of solving any computable problem
- Learning is fundamentally about reducing inference time rather than improving accuracy
- A power-law scaling relationship exists between training time and inference time
- Scaling model size can lead to "savant" behavior where brute-force computation replaces genuine learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's mechanism centers on treating AI agents as stochastic dynamical systems where computation unfolds over "proper time." The key insight is that learning reduces the effective computation needed during inference by compressing the search space through training. This compression is quantified by algorithmic mutual information between training data and solutions. The framework treats complex reasoning tasks as Pandora's box problems, where optimal stopping points during computation determine when to halt further reasoning to maximize efficiency.

## Foundational Learning

**Stochastic Dynamical Systems**: Why needed - to model the sequential decision-making process of AI agents during reasoning. Quick check - verify the Markov property holds for agent state transitions.

**Algorithmic Mutual Information**: Why needed - to quantify the relationship between training data and solutions, measuring how much information compression occurs. Quick check - confirm mutual information calculations are consistent across different problem instances.

**Proper Time**: Why needed - to provide a unified measure of computational effort that accounts for both sequential and parallel computation. Quick check - validate proper time correlates with actual wall-clock time across different hardware configurations.

**Pandora's Box Problems**: Why needed - to frame optimal stopping decisions during complex reasoning tasks. Quick check - test whether the framework correctly predicts optimal stopping points in controlled environments.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Training data -> Algorithmic Mutual Information Calculation -> Model Parameterization -> Inference Engine -> Proper Time Measurement -> Output

**Critical Path**: Data preprocessing → Model training → Inference computation → Time measurement → Solution generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. inference speed (primary), model size vs. savant behavior risk, training time vs. inference efficiency

**Failure Signatures**: Degenerate solutions from insufficient training, savant behavior where models memorize rather than learn, improper time scaling leading to inefficient computation

**First Experiments**:
1. Measure inference time reduction versus accuracy improvement across different model scales
2. Test savant behavior prediction by examining whether larger models shift from learning to brute-force computation
3. Implement and evaluate the Pandora's box framework for determining optimal stopping points

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework may not directly translate to practical systems
- Power-law scaling relationship lacks sufficient experimental validation
- "Savant behavior" observation is based on theoretical arguments rather than systematic empirical evidence
- Pandora's box framework lacks concrete algorithmic implementations

## Confidence

**High confidence claims**:
- AI agents as universal task solvers
- Learning reduces inference time rather than improving accuracy
- Power-law scaling relationship between training and inference time

**Medium confidence claims**:
- Algorithmic mutual information relationship to speed-up
- "Savant behavior" at scale
- Pandora's box framework for optimal stopping

**Low confidence claims**:
- Practical implementation of time-efficient optimization
- Direct translation of theoretical framework to real-world systems

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic empirical studies comparing inference time reduction versus accuracy improvements across different model scales to validate the learning-as-speedup hypothesis.

2. Design benchmark tasks specifically to test the "savant behavior" prediction and measure whether larger models indeed shift from learning to brute-force computation.

3. Develop and evaluate concrete algorithmic implementations of the Pandora's box framework for determining optimal stopping points in complex reasoning tasks.
