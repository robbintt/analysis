# Modeling Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding with the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System: A Machine Psychology Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.00611
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00611
- Reference count: 24
- One-line primary result: This paper presents a theoretical demonstration of modeling Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding (AARR) within the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS).

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a theoretical demonstration of modeling Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding (AARR) within the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS). By integrating Relational Frame Theory (RFT) with NARS's adaptive reasoning mechanisms, the study shows how key properties of AARR—mutual entailment, combinatorial entailment, and transformation of stimulus functions—can emerge from NARS's inference rules and memory structures. Two theoretical experiments are presented: one modeling stimulus equivalence and transfer of function, and another modeling complex relational networks involving opposition frames. In both cases, NARS logically derives untrained relations and context-sensitive transformations of stimulus significance, mirroring established human cognitive phenomena. The results suggest that AARR, long considered uniquely human, can be conceptually captured by suitably designed AI systems, highlighting the value of integrating behavioral science insights into artificial general intelligence research.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a theoretical demonstration rather than an empirical implementation. The authors integrate Relational Frame Theory (RFT) with NARS's adaptive reasoning mechanisms through conceptual modeling. They show how NARS's inference rules and memory structures can produce key AARR phenomena including mutual entailment, combinatorial entailment, and transformation of stimulus functions. The approach involves mapping RFT concepts onto NARS's architecture and demonstrating logical consistency in how relational networks emerge from NARS's reasoning processes.

## Key Results
- NARS's inference rules can theoretically produce mutual entailment, combinatorial entailment, and transformation of stimulus functions
- Theoretical experiments demonstrate NARS deriving untrained relations and context-sensitive transformations of stimulus significance
- The approach suggests AARR phenomena can be conceptually captured by AI systems, bridging behavioral science and AGI research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that NARS's adaptive reasoning mechanisms can capture the core properties of Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding through its inference rules and memory structures. By mapping Relational Frame Theory concepts onto NARS's architecture, the authors show how mutual entailment (if A relates to B, then B relates to A), combinatorial entailment (combining relations to form new ones), and transformation of stimulus functions (how relational networks change the significance of stimuli) can emerge from NARS's logical operations. The system's ability to handle context-sensitivity and derive novel relations from limited training data mirrors the flexibility and creativity observed in human relational learning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Relational Frame Theory (RFT)**: A behavioral psychology framework explaining how humans derive relations between stimuli based on contextual cues - needed to understand the psychological phenomena being modeled; quick check: can you explain mutual entailment and combinatorial entailment?
- **Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS)**: An AGI architecture designed for reasoning under uncertainty and resource constraints - needed as the computational framework for modeling AARR; quick check: can you describe NARS's key inference mechanisms?
- **Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding (AARR)**: The human ability to derive relations between stimuli based on contextual cues rather than physical properties - needed as the target phenomenon; quick check: can you provide an example of stimulus equivalence and transfer of function?
- **Mutual entailment**: If stimulus A is related to B, then B is related to A in the same way - needed to understand one of the core properties of relational learning; quick check: can you give an example of mutual entailment in a relational network?
- **Combinatorial entailment**: Deriving new relations by combining existing ones - needed to understand how complex relational networks form; quick check: can you explain how combining "same" and "opposite" relations creates new relational possibilities?
- **Transformation of stimulus functions**: How relational networks change the psychological significance of stimuli - needed to understand the behavioral impact of relational learning; quick check: can you describe how a relational network can change a stimulus from positive to negative?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: RFT concepts -> NARS inference rules -> AARR phenomena

**Critical Path**: Stimulus presentation → NARS inference processing → Derived relational network → Transformation of stimulus functions → Behavioral output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The theoretical approach prioritizes conceptual integration over empirical validation, choosing to demonstrate logical consistency rather than implement and test the model. This allows for elegant mapping of psychological concepts onto AI architecture but sacrifices empirical verification.

**Failure Signatures**: Without implementation, failure modes cannot be empirically identified. Theoretical failures would manifest as logical inconsistencies between RFT predictions and NARS inference outcomes, or as inability to derive key AARR phenomena from the proposed mechanisms.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Implement the theoretical models as executable NARS code and test whether the system actually produces the predicted relational responses and stimulus function transformations with realistic training data.
2. Design behavioral experiments comparing NARS outputs with human AARR data to validate that the model captures the same contextual sensitivity and relational network dynamics observed in psychological studies.
3. Test the model's performance across different relational frames (same, opposite, more-than, less-than) and examine whether the proposed mechanisms generalize beyond the specific equivalence and opposition cases presented in the theoretical demonstration.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical demonstration relies entirely on conceptual modeling without empirical implementation or experimental validation.
- No actual simulations, code, or empirical tests are presented to verify the claims about NARS producing AARR phenomena.
- The connection between NARS's theoretical mechanisms and actual behavioral data remains speculative.

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework: Medium
- Practical feasibility: Low
- Generality claims: Low

## Next Checks
1. Implement the theoretical models as executable NARS code and test whether the system actually produces the predicted relational responses and stimulus function transformations with realistic training data.

2. Design behavioral experiments comparing NARS outputs with human AARR data to validate that the model captures the same contextual sensitivity and relational network dynamics observed in psychological studies.

3. Test the model's performance across different relational frames (same, opposite, more-than, less-than) and examine whether the proposed mechanisms generalize beyond the specific equivalence and opposition cases presented in the theoretical demonstration.
