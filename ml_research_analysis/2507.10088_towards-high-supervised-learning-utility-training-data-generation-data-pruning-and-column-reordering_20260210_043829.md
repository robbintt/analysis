# Towards High Supervised Learning Utility Training Data Generation: Data Pruning and Column Reordering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.10088
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10088
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** PRRO pipeline improves synthetic data SL utility by 26.74% (replacement) and 6.13% (append)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of low supervised learning (SL) utility in synthetic tabular data through a novel pre-processing pipeline called Pruning and ReOrdering (PRRO). The authors identify two core problems: synthetic generators exaggerate class imbalance and fail to model SL-specific data relationships. PRRO introduces Signal-based Data Pruning to balance class distributions by focusing on high signal-to-noise ratio observations, and Column Conditional ReOrdering to align generator assumptions with SL model requirements. Extensive experiments on 22 diverse datasets demonstrate that PRRO significantly improves SL utility, particularly excelling with imbalanced datasets where it achieves 43% improvement in class distribution similarity.

## Method Summary
The PRRO pipeline tackles low SL utility in synthetic tabular data through two complementary modules. The Signal-based Data Pruning module addresses class imbalance by calculating a "signal" score for each observation based on the ratio of between-class distance to within-class distance for the response variable. Observations with higher signal scores are preferentially retained during downsampling, ensuring that the pruned dataset maintains informative examples while achieving balanced class distributions. The Column Conditional ReOrdering module addresses the mismatch between generator assumptions and SL requirements by reordering predictor features based on their conditional dependence relationships with the response variable. This ordering strategy forces synthetic generators to model highly dependent features with more constraints, improving the preservation of SL-relevant relationships. The pipeline can be applied as either a pre-processing step before synthetic data generation or as a post-processing step to improve existing synthetic datasets.

## Key Results
- Signal-based Data Pruning improves synthetic data utility by 26.74% in replacement scenarios and 6.13% in appendant scenarios
- PRRO achieves 43% improvement in class distribution similarity for imbalanced datasets
- The pipeline maintains high fidelity metrics (TVD, Corr, KL divergence) while significantly improving SL utility
- Improvements are most pronounced on datasets with severe class imbalance (e.g., 99.7% vs 0.3% class distribution)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The PRRO pipeline works by addressing fundamental mismatches between synthetic data generation assumptions and supervised learning requirements. The Signal-based Data Pruning module identifies and retains observations that provide the most discriminative information for classification tasks, measured through signal-to-noise ratios. By focusing on high-signal observations, the pruned dataset better represents the decision boundaries that SL models need to learn. The Column Conditional ReOrdering module exploits the sequential nature of many synthetic generators by ordering features to match their conditional dependencies on the response variable. This forces the generator to model strongly predictive features with more constraints, preserving the statistical relationships that SL models rely upon. Together, these mechanisms ensure that synthetic data better captures the underlying patterns necessary for accurate classification while maintaining realistic data distributions.

## Foundational Learning

**Signal-to-noise ratio in classification:** Measures the discriminative power of observations by comparing between-class to within-class variance. Why needed: Core metric for identifying informative data points in imbalanced datasets. Quick check: Compute SNR for each observation and verify higher values correspond to clearer class separation.

**Permutation importance:** Quantifies feature importance by measuring performance drop when feature values are randomly shuffled. Why needed: Enables ordering features by their predictive relevance for the Column Conditional ReOrdering module. Quick check: Calculate permutation importance for each feature and confirm ranking matches domain knowledge.

**Total variation distance (TVD):** Measures distributional similarity between real and synthetic data. Why needed: Standard metric for evaluating synthetic data fidelity. Quick check: Compute TVD for marginal distributions and verify values are below 0.1 for acceptable fidelity.

**Conditional dependence ordering:** Arranges features based on their dependency relationships with the target variable. Why needed: Critical for the Column Conditional ReOrdering algorithm to work effectively. Quick check: Verify that highly dependent features are positioned later in the sequence for constrained modeling.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Signal-based Data Pruning -> Column Conditional ReOrdering -> Synthetic Data Generation -> SL Utility Evaluation

**Critical path:** Data Preprocessing (Pruning + ReOrdering) → Synthetic Generation (CTAB-GAN) → Utility Evaluation (Classification Performance)

**Design tradeoffs:** The pipeline trades some marginal distribution fidelity for improved SL utility, accepting minor deviations in individual feature distributions to better preserve class-discriminatory relationships.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance when: (1) dataset has very few observations (<1000), (2) features are nearly independent of response variable, or (3) class imbalance is extreme (>99% vs <1%).

**Three first experiments:**
1. Apply Signal-based Data Pruning alone to imbalanced datasets and measure SL utility improvement
2. Test Column Conditional ReOrdering with random feature ordering as baseline
3. Evaluate PRRO pipeline performance across different synthetic generation algorithms (beyond CTAB-GAN)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does ordering features by permutation importance score (placing high-importance features last) improve generator performance in the presence of multicollinearity?
- Basis in paper: The authors propose an extension of the Column Conditional ReOrdering algorithm (Algorithm 3) in Section 5 and Appendix A.3 to handle real-life multicollinearity.
- Why unresolved: The paper hypothesizes that placing important features later in the sequence forces the generator to model them with "more constraints" (less randomness), but this specific algorithm was not implemented or tested in the main results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing synthetic data utility when features are ordered by importance (vs. random/original order) on datasets known to exhibit high multicollinearity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the inherent position bias of Large Language Models (LLMs) be leveraged constructively to weight column relationships rather than merely mitigated?
- Basis in paper: In Section 5, the authors suggest a future direction of "utilizing the bias" to improve model performance, rather than treating position bias solely as an error to be eliminated.
- Why unresolved: Current works generally focus on mitigating position bias; the paper suggests but does not demonstrate a mechanism to transform this bias into a beneficial weight allocation for tabular data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study showing that specific column orderings, aligned with LLM positional attention mechanisms, yield statistically significant improvements in synthetic data utility over unbiased or randomized orderings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do alternative tabular encodings (beyond textual sentence conversion) provide better alignment between data structure and LLMs for the PRRO pipeline?
- Basis in paper: Section 5 notes that "other works seek to effectively encode tables" and suggests developing model structures that study both column-wise and row-wise relationships.
- Why unresolved: The experiments relied exclusively on textual encoding (converting rows to sentences); the efficacy of the PRRO pipeline on alternative encoding methods remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the PRRO pipeline to LLMs using specialized tabular encoders (e.g., serialized HTML or markdown tables) compared to the standard textual baseline.

## Limitations

- Experimental scope limited to 22 relatively small datasets, raising questions about scalability to real-world production scenarios
- Heavy reliance on a single synthetic data generation framework (CTAB-GAN) without validation across multiple approaches
- Lack of ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of Signal-based Data Pruning versus Column Conditional ReOrdering modules
- Potential overfitting to specific SL models used in evaluation, with results primarily reported for Random Forest, MLP, and Logistic Regression classifiers

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The core claim about PRRO's effectiveness on imbalanced datasets, given the explicit focus on class balancing through the Signal-based Data Pruning module and demonstrated 43% improvement in class distribution similarity.

**Medium confidence:** The overall utility improvements (26.74% replacement, 6.13% append) due to sound methodology but limited experimental scope and single-framework dependency.

**Medium confidence:** The specific contribution of Column Conditional ReOrdering mechanism, as the paper lacks ablation studies to isolate its impact from the pruning module.

## Next Checks

1. Test PRRO's effectiveness across multiple synthetic data generation frameworks beyond CTAB-GAN to verify robustness of improvements across different synthetic generation approaches.

2. Conduct experiments on larger-scale datasets (minimum 100K rows) to assess real-world applicability and scalability of the PRRO pipeline to production scenarios.

3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of Signal-based Data Pruning versus Column Conditional ReOrdering modules to overall utility gains, isolating each component's impact.
