# Causal Sensitivity Identification using Generative Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.01352
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01352
- Reference count: 4
- The paper proposes a novel generative method for identifying causal impact in prediction tasks through interventional and counterfactual analysis.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for identifying causally sensitive features that influence predictions using generative learning. The approach leverages a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to detect causal relationships through interventional and counterfactual analysis without requiring prior causal graph knowledge. The method identifies features that act as confounders and evaluates how changes in causes affect their effects. Experiments on both synthetic (Asia Bayesian network) and real-world (GeoLife trajectory) datasets demonstrate the framework's ability to recover known causal dependencies and improve predictive performance by conditioning on identified causally sensitive features.

## Method Summary
The framework trains two CVAE models - one on factual data (GP-F) and one on intervened data (GP-I) where candidate features are altered. Causally sensitive features are identified when interventional accuracy exceeds factual accuracy, indicating the feature previously acted as a confounder. Counterfactual analysis generates predictions from altered test data to evaluate how cause changes affect effects. The final predictor conditions on identified causally sensitive features to improve accuracy. The CVAE uses LSTM encoders/decoders with attention mechanisms, and the entire pipeline is validated on both synthetic Bayesian network data and real-world trajectory prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- Successfully recovers known causal dependencies on Asia Bayesian network dataset by identifying causally sensitive features and associated causal paths
- Achieves competitive accuracy (32.0% Acc@1) and MRR compared to state-of-the-art methods on GeoLife human trajectory dataset
- Demonstrates improved predictive performance when conditioning on identified causally sensitive features like start time

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Interventional comparison identifies causally sensitive features (FCS) that confound prediction. Two models are trained—GP-F on factual data and GP-I on intervened data where candidate features are altered via do(X = Xaltered). If prediction accuracy improves under intervention (ΔAcc = Accinterventional − Accfactual > 0), the altered feature is flagged as causally sensitive, indicating it previously acted as a confounder along backdoor paths (X ← Z → Y). Blocking this path via intervention enables the model to learn the direct causal relationship. Core assumption: The training data contains confounding structures where identified features influence both input and output.

### Mechanism 2
Counterfactual latent comparison reveals causal paths from input to output. The factual encoder produces ZFC from unaltered test data. A counterfactual latent ZCF is generated from altered test data (Xtest altered) using the same encoder. The factual decoder generates predictions from both latents. If counterfactual accuracy drops relative to factual (ΔAcc = Acccounterfactual − Accfactual < 0), this indicates a causal path X → Y exists, as changing the cause meaningfully changes the effect. Core assumption: The encoder captures causal structure in its latent space such that alterations to causal inputs produce distinguishable latent shifts.

### Mechanism 3
Conditioning prediction on identified causally sensitive features improves generative prediction accuracy. Once FCS is identified, the CVAE decoder conditions on these features during prediction. This guides the generative model along true causal relations rather than spurious correlations. In GeoLife, conditioning on Smin (start minute) yields the best performance, confirming its causal role in trajectory prediction. Core assumption: Identified FCS are genuine causal drivers and not artifacts of dataset-specific correlations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework uses CVAE as the generative predictor, encoding input-target pairs into latent space and decoding conditioned predictions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a CVAE differs from a standard VAE in terms of conditioning and generation?

- **Concept: Pearl's Ladder of Causation (Intervention and Counterfactual)**
  - Why needed here: The method explicitly uses do-calculus interventions (rung 2) and counterfactual reasoning (rung 3) to identify causal features and paths.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes interventional queries (do(X=x)) from counterfactual queries (what if X had been x')?

- **Concept: Confounding and Backdoor Paths**
  - Why needed here: The method identifies confounders by detecting backdoor paths that bias prediction; interventions block these paths.
  - Quick check question: Given a causal graph X ← Z → Y, what happens to the X→Y estimate when Z is not controlled versus when Z is intervened upon?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Encoder (CVAE): LSTM (60 hidden units) → Dropout (0.3) → Self-attention (sigmoid) → LSTM (40 hidden units) → Latent mean/log-variance → Reparameterized sample Z
  - Decoder (CVAE): Z repeated across sequence length → Concatenate with conditional input X → LSTM (40 units) → Dropout → Self-attention → LSTM (60 units) → Dense (cmax units, softmax) → Y prediction
  - Generative Predictor (GP-F/GP-I): Two training paths—factual (original data) and interventional (altered data)—produce separate models for comparison
  - Counterfactual path: Same GP-F encoder used on altered test data to produce ZCF, decoded for counterfactual predictions

- **Critical path:**
  1. Preprocess data → Extract features (e.g., LS, Smin, W, DS)
  2. Train GP-F on factual (Xtrain, Ytrain); train GP-I on intervened Xtrain altered
  3. Identify FCS by comparing Accfactual vs. Accinterventional (Algorithm 1)
  4. Encode test data → ZFC and ZCF → Decode both → Compare ΔAcc
  5. Final prediction conditions on identified FCS (Algorithm 2)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Latent dimension (50): Balances representational capacity vs. overfitting; no ablation reported for this dimension
  - KL annealing (start=10, annealtime=20): Mitigates KL vanishing but delays latent regularization
  - Sequence modeling choice (LSTM + attention): Captures spatiotemporal dependencies but adds computational cost vs. simpler baselines
  - No explicit acyclicity constraint: Unlike NOTEARS, this method does not enforce DAG structure during learning, which may limit causal discovery guarantees

- **Failure signatures:**
  - ΔAcc ≈ 0 across interventions → Candidate features are not causally sensitive or intervention strategy is ineffective
  - Counterfactual predictions identical to factual → Encoder fails to disentangle causal factors; latent space may collapse
  - Conditioning on FCS degrades accuracy → Identified features may be dataset-specific confounders rather than generalizable causes
  - KL divergence dominates loss early → KL annealing schedule may need adjustment

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate Asia dataset causal discovery: Train CVAE on Asia, intervene on `either`, `bronc`, `smoke`, and verify recovered causal paths (bronc → dysp, either → dysp) match Table 2
  2. Ablate conditioning features on GeoLife subset: Train GP-F with and without conditioning on Smin, W, DS; confirm Acc@1 and MRR changes per Table 5
  3. Visualize latent space separation: Compute t-SNE of ZFC vs. ZCF for altered location sequences; verify measurable divergence (JSD ≈ 0.42 as reported)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How can the framework automate the discovery of causally sensitive features in high-dimensional settings without manual candidate selection?**
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The methodology relies on manually selecting candidate features (e.g., start time, weekday) to create "altered" datasets for intervention, rather than performing an automated search over the entire feature space.
  - Why unresolved: The current approach requires training separate models (GP-F, GP-I) for each intervention scenario, which is computationally prohibitive for datasets with hundreds or thousands of potential causal features.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An experiment demonstrating the method's efficacy on a dataset with >100 features where sensitive features are identified automatically without prior manual filtering.

- **How can causal relationships be rigorously validated in real-world applications where the ground-truth causal graph is unknown?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state: "the GeoLife dataset does not have a ground-truth causal graph available for validation," limiting the ability to confirm structural discovery.
  - Why unresolved: While the Asia experiment validates against a known graph, the GeoLife results rely on predictive accuracy (Acc@1), which does not guarantee the recovery of true causal paths versus spurious correlations.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful validation on a synthetic dataset with a hidden complex causal structure, or domain-expert verification of the identified paths in GeoLife.

- **Does the method maintain its causal identification capabilities when applied to static, non-sequential prediction tasks?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion claims the approach is "extendable to a wide range of applications involving... classification," yet the primary architecture and experiments focus heavily on sequential data (trajectories, LSTM-based CVAE).
  - Why unresolved: The specific mechanisms, such as "start minute" and trajectory sequences, leverage temporal dependencies; it is unclear if the interventional logic holds for static features without the temporal ordering constraints present in the GeoLife dataset.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results applying the Generative Causally Sensitive Prediction (GCSP) framework to standard static tabular benchmarks (e.g., non-temporal healthcare or financial data).

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness depends critically on the intervention strategy, which may not generalize to all datasets or feature types
- Computational cost scales poorly with the number of candidate features due to requiring separate model training for each intervention
- The method cannot guarantee causal discovery without ground-truth causal graphs for validation, limiting confidence in real-world applications

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The CVAE architecture specifications and experimental results on the GeoLife dataset (accuracy@MRR values) are well-documented and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: The causal identification mechanism via ΔAcc thresholds is theoretically sound but depends on effective intervention strategies that are not fully specified for all datasets.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of identified causally sensitive features across different domains remains uncertain, as validation is limited to two specific datasets.

## Next Checks

1. **Intervention strategy robustness**: Test the method with multiple intervention types (not just "most frequent to third most frequent") on both datasets to verify that causally sensitive features are consistently identified.
2. **Latent space disentanglement validation**: Compute quantitative metrics (e.g., modularity scores, intervention effectiveness) to verify that the CVAE latent space actually separates causal factors as claimed.
3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Apply the complete pipeline to a third, structurally different dataset (e.g., a medical diagnosis dataset) to test whether the identified causal features and paths generalize beyond the two validation datasets.
