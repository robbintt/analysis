# H-SPLID: HSIC-based Saliency Preserving Latent Information Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20627
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20627
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: H-SPLID achieves 58.9% PGD attack accuracy on COCO (vs 34.2% baseline) and 76.7% on ImageNet-9 (2.7% improvement)

## Executive Summary
H-SPLID is a novel algorithm for learning salient feature representations by decomposing the latent space into task-relevant and task-irrelevant subspaces. The method combines dimensionality reduction of the salient space with HSIC-based regularization to promote learning low-dimensional, task-relevant features. Theoretical analysis proves that expected prediction deviation under input perturbations is bounded by the dimension of the salient subspace and the HSIC between inputs and representations.

## Method Summary
H-SPLID operates by jointly learning a dimensionality reduction for the salient space and using HSIC regularization to encourage the model to focus on task-relevant features. The algorithm decomposes the latent space into salient (task-relevant) and non-salient components, with the HSIC measure serving as a regularizer that quantifies dependence between inputs and learned representations. This approach ensures that the model learns representations that are robust to perturbations of irrelevant features like image backgrounds while maintaining predictive performance on salient components.

## Key Results
- On COCO dataset: 58.9% accuracy under PGD attack versus 34.2% for vanilla network
- On ImageNet-9: 76.7% accuracy, outperforming vanilla baseline by 2.7%
- Models primarily rely on salient input components, showing reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
H-SPLID works by explicitly separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant information in the latent space through HSIC-based regularization. By minimizing the dependence between inputs and non-salient representations while maximizing dependence for salient components, the method forces the model to learn robust features that focus on what matters for the task. The dimensionality reduction in the salient space ensures compact, efficient representations that are less sensitive to irrelevant variations.

## Foundational Learning
- HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion): Measures statistical dependence between random variables; needed to quantify and regularize the relationship between inputs and learned representations
- Latent space decomposition: Separating feature representations into task-relevant and irrelevant components; required for targeted regularization and robustness
- Dimensionality reduction: Compressing salient feature representations; helps prevent overfitting to irrelevant features and improves generalization

Quick check: Verify that the HSIC computation is correctly implemented and that the decomposition effectively separates salient from non-salient components through ablation studies.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input -> Encoder -> Latent Decomposition -> HSIC Regularization -> Classifier

Critical path: The encoder produces latent representations that are decomposed into salient and non-salient subspaces. The HSIC regularization term ensures the salient subspace captures task-relevant information while the non-salient subspace remains independent of inputs. The classifier operates on the salient subspace for prediction.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades some representational capacity for improved robustness and interpretability. The choice of salient subspace dimension is critical - too small loses information, too large reduces regularization effectiveness.

Failure signatures: Poor performance on datasets where task-relevant features are distributed across the entire input space rather than localized; sensitivity to hyperparameter choices for HSIC weight and salient dimension; computational overhead from HSIC computation.

First experiments:
1. Test on synthetic data where ground truth salient features are known
2. Evaluate perturbation robustness on controlled synthetic datasets
3. Compare with standard adversarial training baselines on COCO

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Restricted to synthetic data experiments and single real-world dataset (COCO), limiting generalizability
- Theoretical analysis assumes existence of latent variable capturing task-relevant components, which may not hold in practice
- Does not address computational efficiency or scalability concerns for high-resolution images or large-scale datasets

## Confidence
- High confidence: Experimental results showing improved accuracy on COCO and ImageNet-9 are reproducible and well-documented
- Medium confidence: Theoretical analysis of prediction deviation bounds is mathematically rigorous but relies on assumptions that may not hold in practice
- Low confidence: Generalizability across different domains and tasks is uncertain due to limited experimental scope

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate H-SPLID on diverse datasets including medical imaging, natural language processing, and tabular data to assess generalizability across different modalities and task types

2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of dimensionality reduction versus HSIC regularization, and test the method's sensitivity to hyperparameter choices

3. Compare H-SPLID's robustness against state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods using multiple attack types and threat models to validate the claimed improvements
