core_contribution: This paper introduces MSE-Adapter, a lightweight plugin that enables
  large language models (LLMs) to perform multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion
  recognition without sacrificing their original generalization capabilities. The
  adapter uses a Text-Guide-Mixer module with Hadamard product to align non-textual
  and textual modalities at the feature level, and a Multi-Scale Fusion module for
  early fusion of non-textual features.

# MSE-Adapter: A Lightweight Plugin Endowing LLMs with the Capability to Perform Multimodal Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.12478
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12478
- Reference count: 29
- MSE-ChatGLM3-6B achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal sentiment analysis tasks

## Executive Summary
MSE-Adapter introduces a lightweight plugin architecture that enables large language models to perform multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition without compromising their original generalization capabilities. The adapter achieves this through a Text-Guide-Mixer module that uses Hadamard product for feature alignment between non-textual and textual modalities, combined with a Multi-Scale Fusion module for early fusion of non-textual features. Tested across four English and Chinese datasets (MOSEI, SIMS-V2, MELD, CHERMA) using consumer-grade GPUs and open-source LLMs (Qwen-1.8B, ChatGLM3-6B-base, LLaMA2-7B), the adapter demonstrates effective performance while adding only 2.6-2.8M trainable parameters. The approach preserves LLM intrinsic capabilities while enabling multimodal task performance through autoregressive sentiment label generation.

## Method Summary
The MSE-Adapter architecture consists of two main components: the Text-Guide-Mixer module and the Multi-Scale Fusion module. The Text-Guide-Mixer employs Hadamard product operations to align non-textual and textual modalities at the feature level, ensuring coherent integration of multimodal information. The Multi-Scale Fusion module performs early fusion of non-textual features, enabling effective feature extraction before integration with textual data. The adapter uses autoregressive generation to produce sentiment labels, allowing the LLM to maintain its language modeling capabilities while performing multimodal analysis. The lightweight design introduces only 2.6-2.8M trainable parameters, preserving the original LLM's generalization capabilities while extending its functionality to multimodal tasks.

## Key Results
- MSE-Adapter enables LLMs to perform multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with MSE-ChatGLM3-6B on tested datasets
- Introduces only 2.6-2.8M trainable parameters while preserving LLM generalization capabilities
- Validated across four English and Chinese datasets (MOSEI, SIMS-V2, MELD, CHERMA) using consumer-grade GPUs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MSE-Adapter's effectiveness stems from its dual-module architecture that addresses key challenges in multimodal sentiment analysis. The Text-Guide-Mixer uses Hadamard product for precise feature alignment between textual and non-textual modalities, ensuring that information from different sources is properly synchronized at the feature level. The Multi-Scale Fusion module captures hierarchical non-textual features through early fusion, allowing the model to extract relevant patterns before integration. The autoregressive generation approach for sentiment labels leverages the LLM's natural language capabilities, enabling seamless transition between multimodal understanding and sentiment expression. The lightweight parameter footprint ensures that the adapter can be efficiently trained and deployed without overwhelming computational resources or compromising the base LLM's performance on other tasks.

## Foundational Learning

**Hadamard Product for Feature Alignment**
- Why needed: Enables element-wise multiplication for precise synchronization between different modality features
- Quick check: Verify that aligned features maintain semantic consistency across modalities

**Multi-Scale Feature Fusion**
- Why needed: Captures hierarchical patterns in non-textual data at multiple resolution levels
- Quick check: Ensure fused features preserve both local and global information

**Autoregressive Sentiment Generation**
- Why needed: Leverages LLM's language modeling capabilities for coherent sentiment label production
- Quick check: Validate that generated labels maintain contextual relevance with input modalities

**Lightweight Parameter Efficiency**
- Why needed: Minimizes computational overhead while extending LLM capabilities
- Quick check: Compare parameter count and training time against baseline approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input Modalities (Text, Non-Text) -> Text-Guide-Mixer -> Multi-Scale Fusion -> LLM Encoder -> Autoregressive Decoder -> Sentiment Labels

**Critical Path**
Text-Guide-Mixer and Multi-Scale Fusion modules operate in parallel on non-textual and textual inputs, followed by integration and LLM processing for final sentiment generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Lightweight design (2.6-2.8M parameters) vs. potential performance gains from larger adapters
- Autoregressive generation vs. direct classification approaches
- Early fusion of non-textual features vs. later integration strategies

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor alignment in Text-Guide-Mixer may cause modality mismatch
- Insufficient feature extraction in Multi-Scale Fusion can lead to information loss
- Autoregressive generation may struggle with complex sentiment expressions

**First Experiments**
1. Test Hadamard product alignment on synthetic multimodal data with known relationships
2. Evaluate Multi-Scale Fusion performance on individual non-textual modalities before integration
3. Benchmark autoregressive sentiment generation against direct classification on simple datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the source material.

## Limitations

- Evaluation scope limited to four English and Chinese datasets, potentially restricting generalizability to other languages and multimodal formats
- Computational efficiency gains relative to alternative methods need more thorough benchmarking
- State-of-the-art performance claims require independent verification across diverse datasets
- Methodology may not generalize to more complex multimodal scenarios beyond tested domains

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Adapter architecture and implementation details, parameter efficiency metrics
**Medium confidence**: Performance claims on four tested datasets, lightweight design benefits
**Low confidence**: Generalization to languages beyond English/Chinese, scalability to complex multimodal scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Test MSE-Adapter on additional languages and multimodal formats (e.g., medical imaging with text, social media posts with diverse media types)
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of Text-Guide-Mixer and Multi-Scale Fusion modules
3. Compare MSE-Adapter's computational efficiency and performance against alternative multimodal adapters on resource-constrained devices beyond tested consumer-grade GPUs
