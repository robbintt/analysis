# Autonomous Source Knowledge Selection in Multi-Domain Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.14710
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14710
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: AutoS achieves 82.9% average accuracy on OfficeHome while selecting only 1-2 relevant source domains

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AutoS, an autonomous source knowledge selection method for multi-domain adaptation that addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge from massive, potentially irrelevant source domains to a target task. AutoS employs a density-driven selection strategy to identify and retain high-confidence source and target samples while progressively removing irrelevant source domains during training. The method uses federated learning to combine source models and leverages pseudo-labels from a frozen multimodal foundation model to enhance self-supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in transfer accuracy while requiring fewer source domains and less computational resources.

## Method Summary
AutoS is an autonomous source knowledge selection framework for multi-domain adaptation that uses density-driven selection to identify relevant source domains and samples. The method employs a federated learning approach to combine multiple source models, progressively removing irrelevant domains during training based on density metrics. It leverages pseudo-labels from a frozen multimodal foundation model to enhance self-supervision, enabling the system to autonomously determine which source knowledge is most relevant to the target task. The approach focuses on maintaining high-confidence samples while filtering out noise from irrelevant domains, resulting in improved transfer accuracy with reduced computational overhead.

## Key Results
- Achieves 82.9% average accuracy on OfficeHome dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art methods
- Selects only 1-2 relevant source domains compared to using all available sources
- Reduces computational resources required while maintaining or improving transfer performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AutoS works by combining density-driven selection with federated learning to autonomously identify and utilize the most relevant source domains for a target task. The method uses density metrics to measure the relevance of source samples and domains, progressively filtering out irrelevant sources during training. By leveraging pseudo-labels from a frozen multimodal foundation model, AutoS enhances self-supervision without requiring additional labeled data. The federated learning approach allows for efficient combination of multiple source models while maintaining the autonomy of the selection process. This integrated approach ensures that only high-confidence, relevant knowledge is transferred, reducing noise and improving overall adaptation performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Density-driven selection**: Measures sample and domain relevance using density metrics; needed to filter irrelevant sources and maintain high-confidence knowledge; quick check: verify density metrics correlate with transfer performance
- **Federated learning**: Combines multiple source models in a decentralized manner; needed to efficiently aggregate knowledge from diverse sources; quick check: measure communication overhead vs. performance gains
- **Pseudo-labeling with frozen foundation models**: Generates self-supervised labels for target domain samples; needed to enhance supervision without additional labeled data; quick check: evaluate pseudo-label quality impact on adaptation accuracy
- **Progressive domain filtering**: Iteratively removes irrelevant source domains during training; needed to maintain focus on relevant knowledge; quick check: track domain removal rate vs. performance stability
- **Confidence-based sample selection**: Retains high-confidence samples while filtering low-confidence ones; needed to ensure reliable knowledge transfer; quick check: analyze confidence threshold sensitivity
- **Multi-domain knowledge integration**: Combines knowledge from multiple heterogeneous sources; needed to leverage diverse source domains; quick check: measure performance with varying numbers of source domains

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> Density Analyzer -> Domain Filter -> Federated Model Trainer -> Pseudo-label Generator -> Output Model

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves density analysis to filter domains, followed by federated training of source models, and finally pseudo-label generation for self-supervision. This sequence ensures that only relevant domains are processed and that self-supervision is enhanced with high-quality pseudo-labels.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades off between computational efficiency (by selecting fewer domains) and potential loss of useful knowledge (from filtered domains). It also balances the accuracy of pseudo-labels against the risk of propagating incorrect labels through the system.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include over-aggressive domain filtering leading to loss of useful knowledge, poor density metric selection resulting in irrelevant domain retention, and low-quality pseudo-labels degrading adaptation performance. The system may also struggle with heterogeneous feature spaces across domains.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Validate density metric effectiveness by comparing domain selection accuracy with ground truth relevance
2. Test federated learning convergence with varying numbers of source domains
3. Evaluate pseudo-label quality impact on self-supervision performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability to extremely large-scale source domains (>100 domains) remains untested
- Performance across diverse domain types beyond tested datasets is uncertain
- Reliance on frozen multimodal foundation models may limit generalization to certain domains

## Confidence
- **High**: Transfer accuracy improvements (82.9% on OfficeHome) and resource efficiency gains
- **Medium**: Scalability to large-scale domains and robustness across diverse domain types
- **Medium**: Computational resource reduction claims lack detailed trade-off analysis

## Next Checks
1. Test AutoS on datasets with significantly more source domains (e.g., 100+ domains) to evaluate scalability limits
2. Evaluate performance when source domains have heterogeneous feature spaces or fundamentally different data distributions
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of density-driven selection, federated learning, and pseudo-labeling to overall performance
