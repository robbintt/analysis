# AI-Powered Detection of Inappropriate Language in Medical School Curricula

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19883
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19883
- Reference count: 17
- Small language models (SLMs) outperformed large language models (LLMs) in detecting inappropriate language in medical curricula

## Executive Summary
This study develops AI models to detect inappropriate language in medical school curricula, focusing on six categories of linguistic bias. The research compares small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned on labeled data with large language models (LLMs) using few-shot prompting across a dataset of over 500 documents and 12,000 pages. Results demonstrate that SLMs achieve superior performance in identifying inappropriate language, with multilabel classifiers showing the best results on annotated data. The study introduces a novel approach of incorporating negative examples from non-flagged excerpts, which improved specific classifiers' AUC by up to 25%, establishing them as the most effective models for mitigating harmful language in medical education materials.

## Method Summary
The study developed AI models to detect inappropriate language in medical school curricula by focusing on six categories of linguistic bias. Researchers fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) on labeled data and compared their performance with large language models (LLMs) using few-shot prompting. The evaluation was conducted on a dataset comprising 500+ documents and 12,000+ pages of medical curricula. A key innovation was the addition of negative examples from non-flagged excerpts to improve specific classifiers' performance. The multilabel classifier performed best on annotated data, while specific classifiers showed the highest effectiveness when trained with extracted negative examples, achieving up to 25% improvement in AUC scores.

## Key Results
- SLMs outperformed LLMs in detecting inappropriate language across all evaluated categories
- Multilabel classifier achieved the highest performance on annotated data
- Specific classifiers trained with negative examples from non-flagged excerpts showed up to 25% AUC improvement
- Small language models demonstrated superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to few-shot prompting with LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of small language models stems from their ability to be fine-tuned on domain-specific labeled data, allowing them to capture nuanced patterns of inappropriate language in medical contexts. Unlike LLMs that rely on few-shot prompting, SLMs can be trained with both positive examples (inappropriate language) and negative examples (appropriate language), creating more discriminative decision boundaries. The addition of negative examples from non-flagged excerpts provides the model with clearer contrasts between acceptable and unacceptable language, significantly improving classification performance. The multilabel approach effectively handles cases where multiple types of inappropriate language co-occur, while specific classifiers excel at detecting individual categories when properly trained with diverse examples.

## Foundational Learning

**Linguistic Bias Detection** - Understanding how language can perpetuate stereotypes and discrimination in educational materials. Why needed: Forms the foundation for identifying what constitutes inappropriate content. Quick check: Can you identify examples of gender, racial, and disability-related bias in sample medical text?

**Machine Learning Classification** - Binary and multilabel classification techniques for categorizing text. Why needed: Core methodology for distinguishing appropriate from inappropriate language. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between binary and multilabel classification and when each is appropriate?

**Model Fine-tuning vs. Few-shot Learning** - Techniques for adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks. Why needed: Critical for understanding why SLMs outperformed LLMs in this context. Quick check: Can you describe the advantages of fine-tuning versus few-shot prompting for domain-specific tasks?

**Performance Metrics (AUC)** - Area Under the Curve as a measure of classification effectiveness. Why needed: Primary metric for evaluating model performance in this study. Quick check: Can you calculate and interpret AUC scores from a confusion matrix?

**Expert-in-the-Loop Systems** - Integration of human expertise with automated classification systems. Why needed: Proposed deployment framework for real-world application. Quick check: Can you outline the benefits and challenges of human-AI collaboration in content moderation?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Preprocessing -> Model Training (SLMs vs LLMs) -> Evaluation (AUC, Precision, Recall) -> Expert-in-the-Loop Framework

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is data preprocessing → model fine-tuning → evaluation, as the quality of labeled data and the effectiveness of fine-tuning directly determine model performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: SLMs offer better performance and efficiency but require more labeled training data, while LLMs need less labeled data but perform worse with few-shot prompting. The choice between multilabel and specific classifiers depends on whether intersectional bias detection or focused category detection is prioritized.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance occurs when negative examples are insufficient, when inappropriate language patterns are highly context-dependent, or when intersectional biases are not properly addressed. Models may also fail when encountering novel forms of inappropriate language not represented in training data.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Compare SLM fine-tuning with different learning rates on a subset of the data to optimize performance
2. Test the impact of varying negative example ratios on specific classifier AUC scores
3. Evaluate model performance on a held-out test set from different medical specialties to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the intersectionality of different bias types (e.g., gender misuse overlapping with outdated terminology) impact the performance discrepancies between specific binary classifiers and multilabel models?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors state, "We do not yet account for the intersectionality of bias and inappropriate use of language."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study evaluates models on distinct subcategories and simple co-occurrences but does not analyze how overlapping or intersecting identities complicate the classification boundaries or model confidence.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study measuring model performance on specifically curated intersectional examples versus isolated examples, analyzing error rates where multiple IUL types coexist.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can explainable AI (XAI) techniques be integrated into the high-performing specific binary classifiers without degrading the AUC gains achieved by training on extracted negative examples?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors note, "The models do not provide explanations for their classifications... Future work should explore integrating explainable AI techniques."
- **Why unresolved:** While the specific classifiers achieved high AUC using hard negatives, transformer-based models remain opaque, and it is unclear if highlighting specific tokens (e.g., "retarded" vs. "retardation") aligns with the model's decision boundary or if XAI would introduce latency.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation of attention visualization or LIME on the specific classifiers to verify that feature importance aligns with expert definitions of IUL without reducing inference speed.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the prioritization of high recall in the proposed expert-in-the-loop framework affect expert reviewer fatigue and efficiency in live clinical deployment?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors propose "evaluating system performance in real-world expert-in-the-loop settings" and prioritize recall to minimize missed content.
- **Why unresolved:** Maximizing recall typically increases false positives (low precision), which may overwhelm human reviewers in a practical setting, potentially leading to alert fatigue that negates the efficiency gains of the automated system.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal user studies tracking expert review time, accuracy, and reported fatigue when using the tool compared to standard manual review workflows.

## Limitations

- Lack of explicit hypotheses and detailed methodology descriptions makes it difficult to assess robustness of model comparisons
- Performance metrics reported without clear baseline comparisons or statistical significance testing
- Study focuses on six categories of linguistic bias without providing details on how these categories were defined or validated
- Dataset characteristics (diversity of medical curricula, cultural context) not discussed, limiting external validity

## Confidence

- Major claim: SLMs outperform LLMs in detecting inappropriate language - **Medium**
- Specific claim: Multilabel classifiers perform best on annotated data - **Medium**
- Specific claim: Adding negative examples improves AUC by up to 25% - **Medium**

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a statistical significance test to compare the performance of small language models (SLMs) and large language models (LLMs) in detecting inappropriate language.
2. Perform a cross-cultural validation of the models using medical curricula from diverse educational systems to assess generalizability.
3. Develop a standardized framework for defining and validating categories of linguistic bias to ensure consistency and reliability in future studies.
