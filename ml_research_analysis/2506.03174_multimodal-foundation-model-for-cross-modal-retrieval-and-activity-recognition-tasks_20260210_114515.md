# Multimodal Foundation Model for Cross-Modal Retrieval and Activity Recognition Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03174
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03174
- Authors: Koki Matsuishi; Kosuke Ukita; Tsuyoshi Okita
- Reference count: 23
- AURA-MFM outperforms IMU2CLIP in both retrieval and activity recognition tasks, achieving 0.6226 F1-score and 0.7320 accuracy in zero-shot classification versus IMU2CLIP's 0.0747 F1-score and 0.1961 accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AURA-MFM, a multimodal foundation model that integrates four modalities—third-person video, motion capture, IMU, and text—for improved human activity understanding. The model employs a Transformer-based IMU encoder and cross-modal contrastive learning to align representations across modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that AURA-MFM outperforms the existing IMU2CLIP method in both retrieval and activity recognition tasks, particularly showing strong zero-shot classification performance on the Ego-Exo4D dataset.

## Method Summary
AURA-MFM uses cross-modal contrastive learning with frozen CLIP encoders for text and video modalities. The model employs Transformer-based encoders for IMU and motion capture data, converting raw sensor signals into token-like representations through patch embedding and positional encoding. Training follows a progressive approach: first training the IMU encoder against CLIP modalities, then jointly training IMU and mocap encoders. The objective uses InfoNCE loss computed bidirectionally across modality pairs, with all inputs synchronized within 5-second sliding windows.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot classification F1-score of 0.6226 and accuracy of 0.7320, significantly outperforming IMU2CLIP's 0.0747 F1-score and 0.1961 accuracy
- Strong performance in fine-tuning and transfer learning settings on Ego-Exo4D dataset
- Cross-modal retrieval metrics showing improved alignment quality with Transformer-based IMU encoding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Replacing RNN-based IMU encoding with Transformer-based encoding improves cross-modal alignment quality by capturing long-range temporal dependencies through self-attention, reducing vanishing-gradient issues and enabling richer representations that align better with CLIP's semantic space. Core assumption: IMU signals contain global temporal structure relevant to semantic understanding. Evidence: Abstract mentions Transformer-based IMU encoder enhances performance; section 3.2 explains Transformers capture long-range dependencies; corpus shows neighboring papers adopt attention-based architectures. Break condition: If IMU sequences are short (<1 second) or activities are purely local transient gestures, RNNs may match Transformers with lower compute.

### Mechanism 2
Cross-modal contrastive learning against frozen CLIP encoders transfers rich semantic structure to IMU and motion-capture representations by minimizing InfoNCE loss between sensor data embeddings and pre-trained CLIP text/video embeddings. Core assumption: Pre-trained CLIP latent space contains activity-relevant semantics reachable from sensor representations through learned projection. Evidence: Abstract mentions cross-modal contrastive learning aligns representations; section 3.1 explains frozen CLIP ensures rich semantic structures are retained; corpus shows IMU2CLIP uses same strategy but with RNN encoding. Break condition: If downstream activities are semantically distant from CLIP's training distribution, alignment quality degrades.

### Mechanism 3
Adding third-person video and motion capture modalities provides full-body spatial context that first-person video lacks by capturing limb trajectories and environmental interactions invisible to egocentric cameras. Core assumption: Activities of interest involve full-body motion patterns partially observable from any single viewpoint/sensor. Evidence: Abstract mentions third-person video and motion capture enable detailed multidimensional understanding; section 1 explains first-person videos' limitations; corpus shows growing interest in multi-perspective HAR but no direct ablation was found. Break condition: If deployment constraints only permit first-person or single-sensor input, multi-modal advantage cannot be realized at inference time.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive Learning (InfoNCE Loss)
  - Why needed here: The entire training objective relies on distinguishing positive modality pairs from negatives within a batch. Without understanding how contrastive losses shape embedding spaces, the alignment mechanism is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given a batch of 64 IMU-text pairs, can you sketch how InfoNCE computes loss for one IMU query against all text embeddings?

- Concept: Frozen Pre-trained Encoders (CLIP)
  - Why needed here: The text and video encoders are fixed, not fine-tuned. This anchors the latent space but limits adaptability. Understanding this tradeoff is critical for debugging representation mismatches.
  - Quick check question: If IMU embeddings cluster well but zero-shot classification fails, is the problem more likely in the IMU encoder or the frozen CLIP space?

- Concept: Temporal Encoding for Sensor Signals
  - Why needed here: IMU and mocap are time-series; the Transformer patch embedding must convert raw signals into token-like representations. Understanding patch size, stride, and positional encoding choices is essential for preprocessing new datasets.
  - Quick check question: For 200Hz IMU data over 5 seconds, how many patches result if patch size is 20 samples with stride 10?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: IMU Encoder -> Mocap Encoder -> Text/Video Encoders -> Contrastive Head
- Critical path:
  1. Data synchronization: IMU, mocap, video, and text must be temporally aligned within the 5-second sliding window. Misalignment creates false negative pairs.
  2. Resampling consistency: IMU downsampled to 200Hz, mocap at 10FPS. Verify that timestamps match across modalities.
  3. Patch embedding dimensionality: Must match Transformer hidden size; output projection must map to CLIP's 512-dim space.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frozen vs. fine-tuned CLIP: Freezing preserves semantic structure but prevents domain adaptation. Fine-tuning risks collapsing the shared space.
  - RNN vs. Transformer encoder: Transformer scales better for long sequences but requires more data and compute. RNN is cheaper but may underfit complex motions.
  - Modality pairing strategy: Training IMU against each modality separately vs. joint multi-modal contrastive learning. Current paper uses pairwise; simultaneous training is proposed as future work.
- Failure signatures:
  - Zero-shot accuracy near random (<0.25): IMU encoder not aligning to CLIP space—check learning rate, batch size, or data preprocessing.
  - High R@50 but low R@1: Embeddings are in the right neighborhood but not fine-grained—consider increasing model capacity or training duration.
  - Transfer learning worse than random init: Negative transfer from pre-training—domain gap too large (as seen in PAMAP2 zero-shot).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce IMU→Text retrieval baseline on Ego-Exo4D subset: Use published hyperparameters; verify R@1 and MRR match paper before modifying architecture.
  2. Ablate encoder type (RNN vs. Transformer) on single modality pair: Isolate IMU↔Text, keep all else constant, measure R@1 difference.
  3. Test zero-shot generalization on held-out activity class: Hold out one activity (e.g., "Dance") from training, evaluate classification accuracy on that class only to probe true zero-shot capability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can simultaneous training of all four modalities improve representation alignment compared to the progressive pairwise contrastive learning approach used in AURA-MFM? The authors state the current approach limited itself to one-on-one cross-modal learning and suggest simultaneous training could more effectively utilize interaction between modalities.

- How can AURA-MFM's cross-domain generalization be improved for datasets with different sensor placements, sampling rates, and activity distributions? The authors note evaluations on PAMAP2 show room for improvement in generalization capability due to domain differences including sensor placement (chest vs. head), sampling rates, and limited activity overlap.

- Can incorporating additional synchronized multimodal datasets during pretraining enhance AURA-MFM's generalization capability? The authors state that since cross-modal contrastive pretraining uses only Ego-Exo4D dataset, incorporating multiple datasets from different domains could potentially improve generalization performance, but comprehensive multimodal datasets remain scarce.

- How can the model better distinguish semantically similar fine-grained actions (e.g., outside-trap vs. inside-trap in soccer) that produce similar IMU and motion capture signatures? The authors note difficulty distinguishing similar actions based on skeletal diagrams and IMU signals, suggesting a need for different evaluation methods for fine-grained actions.

## Limitations
- Architecture hyperparameters (Transformer depth, hidden size, attention heads) are undisclosed, blocking exact reproduction
- Strong performance on Ego-Exo4D contrasts with limited success on PAMAP2, suggesting sensitivity to domain shift
- Ablation studies isolating third-person video's contribution are missing, leaving its added value unproven

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Transformer-based IMU encoder outperforms RNN baseline in cross-modal retrieval (supported by direct ablation against IMU2CLIP)
- Medium Confidence: Cross-modal contrastive learning to CLIP space enables zero-shot generalization (mechanism plausible but PAMAP2 results show break conditions)
- Low Confidence: Third-person video and mocap modalities significantly improve understanding (stated benefit lacks ablation evidence)

## Next Checks

1. Encoder architecture ablation: Retrain with RNN-based IMU encoder on same Ego-Exo4D subset; measure R@1 difference to isolate architectural impact
2. Zero-shot robustness test: Hold out one activity class during training; evaluate classification accuracy on that class alone to assess true zero-shot generalization
3. Cross-dataset alignment study: Quantify domain shift between Ego-Exo4D and PAMAP2 (sensor placement, activity vocabularies); correlate with performance drop to identify generalization bottlenecks
