## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.10850
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10850
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Transfer learning via pre-trained DEC autoencoders improves NIDS accuracy to 0.983 on ACI-IoT-2023 when trained on ≥50% data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving network intrusion detection systems by leveraging transfer learning within a neurosymbolic AI framework. The proposed ODXU model combines a deep embedded clustering (DEC) autoencoder for feature extraction with an XGBoost classifier for attack recognition, enhanced by uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. Transfer learning is applied to adapt pre-trained models to new cybersecurity datasets, improving adaptability and scalability in dynamic threat environments. Experimental results on the ACI-IoT-2023 dataset show that transfer learning models outperform traditional neural-based models (FcNN and 1D-CNN) when trained on at least 50% of the data, achieving a multiclass accuracy of 0.983. The best configuration uses a pre-trained autoencoder, fine-tuned classifier, and trained clustering module. UQ methods, particularly MetaUQSHAP, demonstrate superior performance in detecting misclassifications and unknown attacks, with AUROC scores of 0.926 and 0.938, respectively.

## Method Summary
The ODXU framework uses a neurosymbolic architecture where a DEC autoencoder extracts 12-dimensional latent features from 1500-byte network payloads, which are then classified by an XGBoost model. Transfer learning is implemented by pre-training the DEC on the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset and adapting it to the ACI-IoT-2023 dataset through various configurations: keeping the autoencoder as-is, fine-tuning the classifier, or retraining clustering components. UQ methods including MetaUQSHAP, MetaUQProb, and Confidence Scoring are trained to detect misclassification and unknown attacks. The best-performing configuration (Case 6) uses a pre-trained autoencoder, fine-tuned classifier, and trained clustering module, achieving 0.983 multiclass accuracy on the target dataset.

## Key Results
- Transfer learning outperforms traditional neural models (FcNN and 1D-CNN) when trained on at least 50% of the target dataset
- Best transfer learning configuration achieves 0.983 multiclass accuracy using pre-trained autoencoder, fine-tuned classifier, and trained clustering
- MetaUQSHAP achieves AUROC of 0.926 for misclassification detection and 0.938 for unknown attack detection
- OSR performance significantly exceeds probability-based UQ methods by more than 10% AUROC

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Transfer learning via a pre-trained Autoencoder (AE) allows the system to adapt to new threat environments with higher accuracy than neural baselines, conditional on the availability of sufficient fine-tuning data (approx. 16,000 samples).
- **Mechanism:** The model leverages feature representations learned from a large source dataset (CIC-IDS-2017) to initialize the target model (ACI-IoT-2023). By freezing or fine-tuning the AE and retraining the clustering layer, the system converges faster and generalizes better than training from scratch.
- **Core assumption:** The latent features learned from the source dataset (generic network traffic patterns) remain relevant and transferable to the target IoT environment.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Transfer learning is applied to adapt pre-trained models... outperforming traditional neural-based models... when trained on at least 50% of the data." [section 5.1] "Case 6 (AE: As is, clustering: Train, and classifier: FT) provides the highest accuracy... [approx.] .9845."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Separating feature extraction (DEC) from classification (XGBoost) increases detection robustness and interpretability compared to end-to-end neural networks.
- **Mechanism:** The Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) model reduces raw payloads to 12-dimensional latent representations. XGBoost then operates as a symbolic reasoner on these compressed features. This neurosymbolic split prevents the gradient-based fragility often seen in pure deep learning models.
- **Core assumption:** The 12-dimensional latent space is sufficiently rich to separate complex attack classes that XGBoost can subsequently distinguish via decision boundaries.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 1] "The symbolic component... implemented through models such as XGBoost, leverages rule-based decision-making, thereby enhancing the overall robustness." [section 5.1] "Case 6... outperform[s] the FcNN baseline (.9808) [with] .9834 accuracy."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Metamodel-based Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)—specifically using SHAP values—provides a superior signal for detecting unknown attacks (Open Set Recognition) compared to simple probability scores.
- **Mechanism:** A secondary "metamodel" is trained to predict the correctness of the base classifier. By feeding it SHAP values (feature contributions) rather than just prediction probabilities, the metamodel identifies when the base model is effectively "guessing" or applying logic to unfamiliar patterns.
- **Core assumption:** Incorrect or unknown predictions exhibit distinct feature attribution patterns (SHAP vectors) that differ structurally from correct predictions.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "MetaUQSHAP, demonstrate[s] superior performance in detecting... unknown attacks, with [AUROC]... 0.938." [section 5.2] "MetaUQSHAP exceeds the second-highest method... by more than 10% [in OSR detection]."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transfer Learning (Domain Adaptation)**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand why Case 6 (pre-trained AE + trained clustering) outperforms Case 1 or baselines. You must grasp how low-level features (edges/shapes in vision, packet bytes in NIDS) are often transferable, while high-level classifiers are task-specific.
  - **Quick check question:** If the target dataset had a completely different packet structure (e.g., encrypted vs. unencrypted headers), which component would fail first: the pre-trained AE or the XGBoost classifier?

- **Concept: Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the "Neuro" bridge. Unlike standard autoencoders, DEC jointly optimizes reconstruction loss and cluster purity. Understanding this helps explain why the latent space is structured specifically for the XGBoost symbolic step.
  - **Quick check question:** In the DEC phase, does the encoder update its weights to minimize reconstruction error, cluster assignment loss, or both? (Hint: Check Section 3/Phase II).

- **Concept: SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)**
  - **Why needed here:** This drives the "best in class" UQ mechanism (MetaUQSHAP). You need to know that SHAP values represent the contribution of each feature to the change in model output to understand why they help a metamodel detect uncertainty.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a metamodel perform better using SHAP values (feature contributions) rather than just the raw probability output of the classifier?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Payload-Byte -> DEC Autoencoder -> Clustering Module -> XGBoost -> MetaUQ (Metamodel)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Pre-train AE on CIC-IDS-2017 (Source)
  2. Load AE weights to Target; Train Clustering on ACI-IoT-2023
  3. Fine-tune XGBoost on the new latent representations (Case 6 configuration)
  4. Train Metamodel using specific data balancing (5:1 Correct:Incorrect ratio)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Accuracy vs. Speed:** Case 6 (Best Acc) requires fine-tuning. "As is" AE is faster but less accurate (Table 3)
  - **UQ Complexity:** MetaUQSHAP is highly accurate for unknowns but computationally expensive due to SHAP calculation; Confidence Scoring is fast but less reliable for OSR
  - **Early Stopping:** Aggressive stopping (low η, high δ) reduces training time but risks under-fitting (Table 4)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Metamodel Collapse:** The metamodel predicts "high certainty" for everything. Cause: Imbalanced training data (Section 4.2). Fix: Subsample correct predictions to 5x the incorrect ones
  - **Negative Transfer:** Accuracy < FcNN baseline. Cause: Insufficient target data (< 50%) or incompatible source domain
  - **Stagnation:** Loss stops decreasing. Fix: Check early stopping thresholds (δ) and learning rates

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Run FcNN and 1D-CNN on the target dataset to establish the performance floor (approx. 0.96-0.98 accuracy)
  2. **Transfer Ablation:** Implement the 6 Cases defined in Table 1. Verify that Case 6 (AE: As is, Cluster: Train, Classifier: FT) yields the highest multiclass accuracy
  3. **OSR Stress Test:** Hold out "Slowloris" attacks as the "unknown" class. Train MetaUQSHAP and verify it achieves > 0.90 AUROC on the mixed test set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the ODXU transfer learning framework maintain its performance when applied to datasets with different traffic distributions, such as CIC IoT 2023 or UM-NIDS?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion explicitly lists applying the transfer learning model to these specific datasets as the primary focus of future work.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study validates the framework only on the ACI-IoT-2023 dataset.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results (accuracy, AUROC) from training the model on the CIC IoT 2023 and UM-NIDS datasets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Are the relative performance rankings of the UQ methods (particularly MetaUQSHAP) consistent across different intrusion detection tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion states that UQ results "may differ depending on the datasets or tasks used."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper evaluates UQ methods on a single dataset, leaving their generalizability unconfirmed.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative benchmark of UQ techniques across multiple, diverse cybersecurity datasets.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the 5:1 subsampling ratio of correct-to-incorrect predictions universally optimal for training the UQ metamodel?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 4.2 mentions this specific ratio was determined through experimentation to address poor performance, implying it is a heuristic rather than a theoretical standard.
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if this ratio is a dataset-specific artifact or a general requirement for the metamodel.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study on metamodel training sets with varying class imbalance ratios.

## Limitations
- Single dataset validation limits generalizability across diverse network environments
- Critical implementation details for XGBoost and UQ metamodel are underspecified
- 50% data threshold for transfer learning success is not validated across varying dataset sizes or architectures

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The neurosymbolic framework (DEC + XGBoost) outperforms pure neural baselines (FcNN, 1D-CNN) in the specific ACI-IoT-2023 dataset
- **Medium Confidence:** Transfer learning significantly improves accuracy only when using at least 50% of the target dataset
- **Medium Confidence:** MetaUQSHAP demonstrates superior OSR performance (AUROC 0.938) compared to probability-based methods

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Dataset Generalization:** Apply the ODXU framework with transfer learning to a different network traffic dataset (e.g., CIC-IDS-2018 or UNSW-NB15) to verify that the 50% threshold holds across domains
2. **Critical Component Ablation:** Systematically disable each UQ method (MetaUQSHAP, MetaUQProb, Confidence Scoring) on the OSR task to quantify the exact contribution of SHAP-based feature attribution versus probability scoring
3. **Data Efficiency Analysis:** Conduct experiments with progressively smaller fine-tuning datasets (10%, 25%, 40%, 50%) to precisely map the transfer learning performance curve and identify the minimum viable data threshold
