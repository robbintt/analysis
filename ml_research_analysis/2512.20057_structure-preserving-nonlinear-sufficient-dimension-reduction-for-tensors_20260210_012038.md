# Structure-Preserving Nonlinear Sufficient Dimension Reduction for Tensors

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20057

- Primary result: Introduces two nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction methods for tensor-valued predictors that preserve tensor structure

## Executive Summary
This paper presents two novel nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) methods for tensor-valued predictors that extend linear tensor SDR frameworks to nonlinear settings. The proposed Tucker-form and CP-form NTSDR methods leverage reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces defined on tensor singular vectors to achieve nonlinear dimensionality reduction while preserving the inherent tensor structure. The methods demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing linear and nonlinear SDR techniques in both simulation studies and a real-world image quality assessment application.

## Method Summary
The authors develop two structure-preserving nonlinear SDR methods for tensor predictors. The Tucker-form NTSDR generalizes dimension folding to the nonlinear case by incorporating nonlinear representations through kernel functions on tensor singular vectors. The CP-form NTSDR extends linear tensor SDR frameworks to nonlinear settings while maintaining model parsimony through reduced parameter counts. Implementation uses iterative least-squares steps for Tucker-form and singular value decompositions for CP-form. The methods establish Fisher consistency at the population level and prove consistency and convergence rates for CP-form, with both methods successfully recovering true sufficient predictors in various simulation settings.

## Key Results
- Simulation studies show NTSDR methods achieve distance correlations of 0.609-0.876 compared to 0.313-0.797 for existing methods across four different predictor designs
- NTSDR methods consistently recover true sufficient predictors with distance correlations typically above 0.8 in simulations
- In image quality assessment application, CP-NTSDR achieves Pearson correlations of 0.407-0.935 with ground-truth DMOS values, outperforming GSIR on 24 of 30 images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methods work by extending linear tensor SDR frameworks to nonlinear settings through kernel representations that preserve tensor structure. By defining reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces on tensor singular vectors, the methods capture nonlinear relationships while maintaining the interpretability of tensor modes. The structure-preserving approach ensures that dimensionality reduction respects the multi-way nature of tensor data, leading to more accurate and interpretable reduced representations.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Tensor algebra and decompositions** (Tucker and CP forms)
   - Why needed: Essential for understanding the structure-preserving approach and how tensor modes are handled
   - Quick check: Can you explain the difference between Tucker and CP decompositions?

2. **Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)**
   - Why needed: Core to the nonlinear representation framework
   - Quick check: Understand the representer theorem and kernel trick applications

3. **Sufficient dimension reduction theory**
   - Why needed: Foundation for understanding SDR objectives and Fisher consistency
   - Quick check: Can you derive the central subspace condition?

4. **Fisher consistency**
   - Why needed: Theoretical guarantee for population-level performance
   - Quick check: Understand the relationship between Fisher consistency and finite-sample behavior

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Tensor data -> Linear SDR (Tucker/CP) -> Nonlinear extension via RKHS -> Reduced sufficient predictors

Critical path: Data preprocessing -> Tensor decomposition selection -> Kernel function specification -> Iterative optimization (least-squares or SVD) -> Sufficient predictor extraction

Design tradeoffs:
- Tucker-form: More flexible structure but computationally intensive iterative steps
- CP-form: More parsimonious parameters but potentially less flexible
- Kernel choice: Balance between expressiveness and computational tractability

Failure signatures:
- Poor performance with inappropriate kernel selection
- Computational instability with high-dimensional tensor modes
- Loss of interpretability when kernel functions are too complex

First experiments:
1. Apply both methods to synthetic tensor data with known sufficient predictors
2. Compare computational time vs accuracy tradeoff between Tucker and CP forms
3. Test sensitivity to different kernel function choices (Gaussian, polynomial, etc.)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework for Tucker-form NTSDR lacks rigorous consistency proofs compared to CP-form
- Simulation studies limited to specific predictor distributions that may not represent all real-world scenarios
- Computational complexity concerns for very large tensors or high-dimensional modes not fully addressed

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Fisher consistency at population level, basic implementation framework
**Medium Confidence**: Simulation results showing superior performance, real data application results
**Low Confidence**: Scalability guarantees, performance in truly high-dimensional tensor settings

## Next Checks

1. Conduct simulation studies with additional tensor structures (e.g., sparse tensors, tensors with missing data) to assess method robustness
2. Perform computational complexity analysis and benchmark against existing methods for large-scale tensors
3. Validate CP-NTSDR performance on a larger image dataset (minimum 100-200 samples) to confirm scalability of real-world applications
