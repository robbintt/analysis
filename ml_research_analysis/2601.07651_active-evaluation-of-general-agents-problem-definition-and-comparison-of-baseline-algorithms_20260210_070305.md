- Primary result: Formalizes active evaluation framework for general agents across multiple tasks, proposing algorithms that iteratively select tasks and agents to sample scores from and update rankings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a formal framework for actively evaluating general agents across multiple tasks, addressing the challenge of ranking agents when both agents and tasks are diverse and numerous. The authors propose an online evaluation setting where algorithms must iteratively decide which agent-task pairs to sample scores from, with the goal of accurately identifying top-performing agents while minimizing evaluation cost. The framework introduces the Average Generalized Ranking Error (AGRE) metric that balances the identification of top-k agents with overall ranking accuracy.

The paper compares multiple baseline algorithms including Batch Elo, Batch Soft Condorcet Optimization, and various online variants on both synthetic data (using Mallows and Plackett-Luce models) and real Atari agent data. Results demonstrate that Batch Elo provides reliable performance across scenarios, particularly when task variation is low, while Batch Soft Condorcet Optimization shows superior performance on real-world data. The study highlights the importance of domain-specific considerations in score aggregation and reveals that simple baselines can perform well in synthetic settings but fail to generalize to complex real-world scenarios.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize active evaluation as an iterative process where at each round, an algorithm selects an agent-task pair to sample from, observes the resulting score, and updates its internal ranking estimates. The framework assumes pairwise comparisons between agents on individual tasks, with scores representing relative performance. The core challenge is to minimize evaluation cost while maintaining accurate rankings, particularly for identifying top-performing agents.

The proposed algorithms include batch and online variants of Elo-based methods, Condorcet optimization approaches, and simple baselines like uniform sampling and UCB-style exploration. Batch methods process all available data at once to compute rankings, while online methods update rankings incrementally after each observation. The evaluation uses both synthetic data generated from parametric ranking models (Mallows and Plackett-Luce) and real data from Atari agent evaluations, allowing controlled comparisons and real-world validation.

## Key Results
- Batch Elo demonstrates consistent reliability across different scenarios, particularly excelling in low task variation settings
- Batch Soft Condorcet Optimization and its online variant achieve comparable performance on synthetic data and significantly outperform Batch Elo on real Atari evaluation tasks
- In high task variation scenarios, proportional representation-based methods achieve faster ranking error reduction
- Simple baselines like Uniform Averaging and Basic UCB perform well on synthetic data but poorly on real Atari data, highlighting domain-specific challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the structure of pairwise comparisons to iteratively build accurate agent rankings while minimizing evaluation cost. The key insight is that active selection strategies can prioritize informative comparisons that maximally reduce uncertainty about agent rankings, rather than uniformly sampling all possible agent-task pairs. This selective evaluation approach allows algorithms to focus computational resources on the most valuable comparisons for ranking accuracy.

The effectiveness of different algorithms depends on the underlying task distribution and score characteristics. Batch Elo's reliability stems from its ability to handle sparse data and provide stable updates, while Soft Condorcet methods excel when the true ranking has clear Condorcet winners across tasks. The framework's flexibility in handling various score aggregation methods allows adaptation to different evaluation scenarios and agent types.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Active Evaluation Loop -> Agent Selection -> Task Selection -> Score Sampling -> Ranking Update -> Error Evaluation

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves selecting the most informative agent-task pair, obtaining the score, and updating the ranking estimates. This loop must balance exploration (trying new pairs to reduce uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling pairs that are likely to improve current rankings).

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Batch vs. Online Processing: Batch methods can optimize globally but require storing all data and recomputing rankings, while online methods update incrementally but may converge more slowly. The tradeoff involves memory requirements versus computational efficiency and ability to adapt to new data.

Exploration vs. Exploitation: Algorithms must balance trying new agent-task pairs to discover better rankings against confirming current top agents. Too much exploration wastes samples on uninformative comparisons, while too much exploitation may miss better agents.

**Failure Signatures:**
Poor Top-k Identification: Indicates insufficient exploration of diverse task types or failure to discover consistently high-performing agents. May require increased exploration or better task selection strategies.

Slow Convergence: Suggests inefficient sampling strategies or inappropriate score aggregation methods. May benefit from adaptive exploration rates or alternative ranking algorithms.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare Batch Elo versus Uniform Sampling on synthetic data with known ground truth to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate online versus batch variants on Atari data to assess computational efficiency trade-offs
3. Test proportional representation methods on high task variation synthetic data to verify theoretical advantages
