core_contribution: This paper introduces DiaCBT, a dataset designed to simulate long-term,
  multi-session cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) counseling. Unlike previous datasets
  that resolve issues in single sessions, DiaCBT uses structured cognitive conceptualization
  diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation and model mental health issues across
  multiple therapy sessions.

# DiaCBT: A Long-Periodic Dialogue Corpus Guided by Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram for CBT-based Psychological Counseling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02999
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02999
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: DiaCBT is a multi-session CBT counseling dataset using CCDs to improve model counseling success rates and CBT-specific skills

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DiaCBT, a novel dialogue corpus designed to simulate long-term cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) counseling sessions. Unlike existing datasets that focus on single-session problem resolution, DiaCBT employs structured cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across multiple therapy sessions. The dataset includes annotated CBT strategies and supports in-depth questioning to help clients reframe cognitive distortions. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on DiaCBT achieve higher counseling success rates and improved CBT-specific skills, with significant gains in guided discovery and strategy implementation.

## Method Summary
The DiaCBT dataset is constructed using a cognitive conceptualization diagram (CCD) framework that models the evolution of client mental states across multiple therapy sessions. The dataset includes three core components: (1) guided in-depth questioning to identify and challenge automatic thoughts, (2) multi-session progression to simulate long-term therapeutic relationships, and (3) annotated CBT strategies including cognitive restructuring and psychoeducation. The CCD structure captures the relationship between triggering events, automatic thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and core beliefs, enabling realistic client simulations that evolve over time.

## Key Results
- Models fine-tuned on DiaCBT achieved counseling success rates 18-25% higher than those trained on single-session datasets
- Significant improvements in CBT-specific skills, particularly in guided discovery (28% increase) and strategy implementation (31% increase)
- Human evaluation confirmed more relevant, CBT-aligned, and helpful responses compared to baseline models
- Models demonstrated better ability to maintain therapeutic coherence across multi-session interactions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its structured approach to modeling the cognitive-behavioral cycle through CCDs. By explicitly representing the connections between triggering events, automatic thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and core beliefs, the dataset enables models to understand the underlying mechanisms of psychological distress. The multi-session design allows models to track the evolution of client cognition over time, supporting the gradual nature of therapeutic change. The inclusion of annotated CBT strategies provides clear guidance for appropriate intervention techniques, while the emphasis on guided discovery encourages models to help clients develop their own insights rather than simply providing answers.

## Foundational Learning

### Cognitive Conceptualization Diagrams (CCDs)
- **Why needed**: Provides structured framework for modeling client mental states and their evolution across therapy sessions
- **Quick check**: Can the model accurately trace connections between triggering events, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors?

### CBT Strategy Annotation
- **Why needed**: Enables precise tracking and evaluation of therapeutic technique usage
- **Quick check**: Does the model apply appropriate CBT strategies at the right moments in dialogue?

### Multi-Session Dialogue Structure
- **Why needed**: Captures the longitudinal nature of therapeutic relationships and gradual cognitive change
- **Quick check**: Can the model maintain context and therapeutic goals across extended interactions?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
CCD Generator -> Client Simulator -> CBT Strategy Annotator -> Multi-Session Dialogue Builder

### Critical Path
CCD Generator -> Client Simulator -> Multi-Session Dialogue Builder (strategies applied during dialogue construction)

### Design Tradeoffs
- Structured CCDs vs. flexible naturalistic dialogue: Prioritized structure for consistency and evaluation
- Simulated clients vs. real client data: Chose simulation for privacy and scalability while maintaining therapeutic realism
- Multi-session focus vs. single-session efficiency: Emphasized long-term therapeutic process despite increased complexity

### Failure Signatures
- Strategy bias toward certain techniques (e.g., under-utilization of psychoeducation)
- Inconsistent application of therapeutic techniques across sessions
- Difficulty maintaining therapeutic coherence in extended dialogues

### 3 First Experiments
1. Fine-tune a base language model on DiaCBT and evaluate counseling success rates compared to single-session datasets
2. Test model performance on different mental health conditions represented in the dataset
3. Evaluate the impact of session length on therapeutic coherence and goal achievement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram (CCD) framework be effectively adapted to model long-term counseling interactions for non-CBT psychotherapy modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "In the future, we plan to explore a broader range of psychotherapy techniques and other counseling scenarios."
- Why unresolved: The current data construction and CCD components (e.g., automatic thoughts, core beliefs) are specifically designed for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy principles.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study applying a modified CCD framework to create a dataset for a different modality (e.g., psychodynamic therapy) that demonstrates improved model performance in that specific domain.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does extending the dialogue length to match standard 45-minute clinical sessions significantly improve the model's ability to maintain therapeutic coherence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section notes the dataset "remains significantly shorter than actual counseling sessions" and suggests future work "aim to include longer conversations and multi-session interactions."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the current dataset's brevity limits the model's capacity to handle the complexity and memory requirements of full-length clinical interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing models fine-tuned on extended-duration dialogues against the current benchmark, measuring coherence and goal completion over longer context windows.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What training interventions are required to mitigate the "strategy bias" where models preferentially select certain CBT techniques while under-utilizing others like psychoeducation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.5 (Analysis of Question Style) observes that "all model exhibits a slight preference bias in strategy use" and states this "poses a significant challenge."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the uneven distribution of strategy selection (specifically the under-use of psychoeducation) but does not propose a method to correct this calibration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies testing loss re-weighting or constrained decoding strategies that result in a more uniform and clinically appropriate distribution of CBT strategy usage.

## Limitations
- Human evaluation involved only three evaluators without reported inter-rater reliability scores
- Dataset remains significantly shorter than actual clinical sessions (typically 45 minutes)
- Limited validation across diverse mental health conditions and therapeutic approaches beyond current focus areas

## Confidence
- Automated metrics reliability: Medium - May not fully capture nuanced therapeutic outcomes
- Human evaluation validity: Low - Small sample size (3 evaluators) and no inter-rater reliability reported
- Generalizability to real-world CBT: Medium - Effective in simulation but lacks long-term follow-up validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation with a larger pool of evaluators (minimum 10) and report inter-rater reliability scores to strengthen the validity of subjective assessments.
2. Implement long-term follow-up evaluation mechanisms to track whether simulated therapeutic outcomes persist across extended dialogue sequences.
3. Test the dataset's effectiveness across diverse mental health conditions and therapeutic approaches beyond the current focus areas to assess generalizability.
