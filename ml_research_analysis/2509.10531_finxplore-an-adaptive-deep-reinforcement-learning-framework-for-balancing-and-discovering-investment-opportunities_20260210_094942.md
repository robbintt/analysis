# FinXplore: An Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Balancing and Discovering Investment Opportunities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.10531
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10531
- Reference count: 20
- One-line result: Dual-agent DRL framework that integrates asset allocation with exploration of new investment opportunities, significantly outperforming benchmarks on NIFTY and DJIA (2022-2024).

## Executive Summary
FinXplore introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that enhances portfolio optimization by combining continuous asset allocation with exploration of new investment opportunities. The framework employs two specialized agents: one for optimizing portfolio weights within an existing universe using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and another for exploring and recommending new assets from an extended universe using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). These agents collaborate, with the exploration agent incentivized to improve the portfolio's Sharpe Ratio by suggesting beneficial assets. Evaluated on major global stock markets over 2022-2024, FinXplore demonstrates superior risk-adjusted returns compared to benchmark strategies, achieving higher cumulative and annualized returns with better Sharpe and Calmar ratios while maintaining lower maximum drawdowns.

## Method Summary
The framework models portfolio management as a Markov Decision Process where Agent 1 (PPO) handles continuous weight allocation over an existing universe of stocks, while Agent 2 (DQN) performs discrete selection from an extended universe of commodities. The state representation includes OHLCV data, 8 technical indicators, and covariance matrices for both universes. Agent 1 proposes initial weights, Agent 2 suggests an asset to explore, and the portfolio is re-optimized to include the suggestion if it improves the Sharpe Ratio. A fixed exploration budget (κ = 10%) caps downside exposure to poor suggestions. The system is trained on data from 2011-2021 and tested on 2022-2024, with Hyperopt used to tune hyperparameters across broad ranges.

## Key Results
- Significantly outperformed benchmark strategies on both NIFTY and DJIA, achieving higher cumulative and annualized returns
- Demonstrated superior risk-adjusted performance with improved Sharpe and Calmar ratios
- Maintained lower maximum drawdowns while balancing exploration and exploitation
- Showed consistent outperformance across different market conditions during the test period (2022-2024)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing portfolio optimization into two specialized agents improves risk-adjusted returns compared to single-agent DRL approaches.
- Mechanism: Agent 1 (PPO) handles continuous weight allocation over the existing universe while Agent 2 (DQN) performs discrete selection from the extended universe. This separation allows each agent to specialize in a compatible action space rather than forcing a single algorithm to handle both.
- Core assumption: The optimal asset to add and the optimal weights for those assets can be learned through separate but coupled optimization processes.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "One agent allocates assets within the existing universe, while another assists in exploring new opportunities in the extended universe"; section III describes the dual-agent collaboration process.
- Break condition: If the extended universe assets are highly correlated with the existing universe, Agent 2's marginal contributions diminish and the coordination overhead outweighs benefits.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Rewarding Agent 2 on marginal Sharpe improvement (ΔSR = SR_new − SR_current) incentivizes diversification-aware exploration.
- Mechanism: The Sharpe ratio embeds both return and volatility. Agent 2 receives positive reward only when the suggested asset improves risk-adjusted performance after re-optimization, not merely when the asset has high standalone returns.
- Core assumption: Re-optimizing weights after adding a candidate asset reliably indicates whether that asset belongs in the portfolio.
- Evidence anchors: Section III states "Agent 2 gets a reward based on the marginal improvement of the portfolio's Sharpe Ratio: R_DQN = ΔSR = SR_new − SR_current".
- Break condition: If transaction costs or estimation error in SR_new dominate, the marginal signal becomes noisy and Agent 2 learns unstable selection policies.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reserving a fixed exploration budget (κ = 10%) caps downside from poor suggestions while retaining upside from successful discoveries.
- Mechanism: By limiting capital flow into explored assets, the system bounds the damage from Agent 2 errors. Agent 1 allocates the remaining 90% to the known universe.
- Core assumption: The optimal exploration budget is approximately constant across market regimes.
- Evidence anchors: Table I lists "κ 10%" as a fixed parameter; section III describes the 10% allocation mechanism.
- Break condition: In regimes where the extended universe substantially outperforms the core universe, κ = 10% constrains upside; conversely, in hostile regimes, even 10% may be excessive.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation for portfolio optimization
  - Why needed here: The entire framework models portfolio management as an MDP tuple (s, a, p, r, γ). Without this, the agent-environment loop and reward signal are unintelligible.
  - Quick check question: Can you write the state representation s_t and explain why the covariance matrix is included?

- Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) clipped objective
  - Why needed here: Agent 1 uses PPO for continuous action output. Understanding the clipping mechanism (ε = 0.2) explains why training is stable despite the non-stationary financial environment.
  - Quick check question: What happens to policy updates if the probability ratio J_t(θ) exceeds 1 + ε?

- Concept: Deep Q-Learning with target network
  - Why needed here: Agent 2 uses DQL with a frozen target network to stabilize Q-value estimation. The discrete action space corresponds to selecting one asset from the extended universe.
  - Quick check question: Why does the target network freeze for several steps before updating?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Environment (Existing Universe) -> Agent 1 (PPO) -> Portfolio weights w_t
  - Environment (Extended Universe) -> Agent 2 (DQN) -> Asset selection a*
  - Coordinator -> Re-optimization -> Portfolio update
  - Reward calculation -> Agent updates

- Critical path:
  1. Observe s_t from existing universe and c_t from extended universe
  2. Agent 1 outputs weight vector a_U over existing universe
  3. Compute SR_current from a_U
  4. Agent 2 observes (s_t + c_t) and selects a* from extended universe
  5. Re-optimize weights to include a*, compute SR_new
  6. If SR_new > SR_current: accept, allocate κ to a*, update w ← a_E. Else: reject, w ← a_U
  7. Compute rewards: R_PPO = SR_current, R_DQN = ΔSR
  8. Update both agents using respective loss functions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exploration budget κ: Higher κ increases potential upside but also exposure to bad suggestions
  - Extended universe composition: The paper uses only 5 commodities; broader universes increase DQL action space and sample complexity
  - Sharpe window (60 days): Longer windows smooth noise but delay feedback; shorter windows are noisier

- Failure signatures:
  - Agent 2 reward (ΔSR) consistently near zero or negative → exploration not improving diversification, check correlation structure
  - Agent 1 weights converge to near-uniform regardless of state → PPO underfitting or reward signal too weak
  - SR_new calculation unstable across episodes → re-optimization step not converging or covariance estimates noisy

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation with κ = 0% (no exploration): Should replicate "Without Exploration" baseline; confirms dual-agent contribution
  2. Vary κ ∈ {5%, 10%, 20%} on held-out validation period: Identifies sensitivity to exploration budget
  3. Replace extended universe commodities with random stocks from same index: Tests whether diversification benefit is from asset class difference or simply expanded universe size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: Would incorporating asymmetric risk measures like Value at Risk (VaR) or Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) into the reward function provide better downside protection than the current Sharpe Ratio-based reward?
- **Question**: Can the integration of unstructured data, specifically sentiment analysis and financial reports, enhance the agent's decision-making capabilities beyond the current technical indicators?
- **Question**: How does the framework's performance and stability change when subjected to complex real-world regulatory constraints and a wider variety of asset classes?

## Limitations
- Limited universe size and composition (18 stocks + 5 commodities) may not generalize to larger, more diverse portfolios
- Hyperparameter opacity with undisclosed final architecture and tuned parameters
- Fixed exploration budget (κ = 10%) not justified by data or theory and may be suboptimal across market regimes
- Correlation-driven diversification assumption not tested for robustness during regime changes

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the dual-agent architecture design and its theoretical soundness
- **Medium confidence** in the empirical performance claims given the short test window and unusual market conditions
- **Low confidence** in the generality of the exploration mechanism without corpus validation or ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation with κ = 0%**: Run the framework with exploration disabled (κ = 0%). This should replicate the "Without Exploration" baseline and confirm that dual-agent collaboration, not just extended universe access, drives performance gains.

2. **Exploration budget sensitivity**: Vary κ ∈ {5%, 10%, 20%} on a held-out validation period. Measure impact on Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and cumulative return to identify optimal exploration allocation and assess robustness to this critical hyperparameter.

3. **Extended universe composition swap**: Replace the 5 commodities with 5 random stocks from the same index. If performance drops significantly, this validates that diversification benefit comes from asset-class differences, not simply expanding the universe. If performance holds, the mechanism may be exploiting universe size rather than true exploration.
