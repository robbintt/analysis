core_contribution: This paper introduces Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO),
  a novel reinforcement learning framework that enhances exploration by integrating
  on-demand expert assistance during training. Unlike prior methods where policies
  reason in isolation, EAPO allows the policy model to adaptively consult external
  experts at critical steps, yielding richer reward signals and more reliable reasoning
  trajectories.

# EAPO: Enhancing Policy Optimization with On-Demand Expert Assistance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23730
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23730
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: EAPO achieves 5-point accuracy gains over baselines in mathematical reasoning benchmarks

## Executive Summary
EAPO introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework that enhances exploration through on-demand expert assistance during training. Unlike traditional approaches where policies reason in isolation, EAPO allows the policy model to adaptively consult external experts at critical steps, yielding richer reward signals and more reliable reasoning trajectories. The framework progressively encourages the policy to internalize expert knowledge, reducing consultation reliance over time. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025) demonstrate consistent performance improvements over expert-assisted workflows, expert-distilled models, and self-exploratory RL baselines.

## Method Summary
EAPO implements a reinforcement learning framework where the policy can consult external experts during training. The policy adaptively determines when expert consultation is needed at critical decision points. Expert input provides richer reward signals that guide the policy toward more reliable reasoning trajectories. A key innovation is the progressive internalization mechanism that encourages the policy to reduce reliance on expert consultation over time, effectively transferring learned knowledge from the expert to the policy. This approach contrasts with traditional RL methods that operate in isolation and with expert-distillation methods that attempt to compress expert knowledge upfront.

## Key Results
- EAPO achieves an average accuracy gain of 5 points over baseline methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks
- The framework demonstrates greater stability compared to expert-assisted workflows and self-exploratory RL approaches
- Performance improvements are consistent across AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025 benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of EAPO stems from its ability to provide targeted expert guidance precisely when the policy encounters challenging decision points. By allowing on-demand consultation rather than full expert distillation or isolation, the policy receives rich, context-specific feedback that helps it navigate complex reasoning tasks. The progressive internalization mechanism ensures that the policy doesn't become dependent on expert assistance, gradually learning to handle increasingly complex reasoning independently. This hybrid approach combines the benefits of expert knowledge with the generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning.

## Foundational Learning
- Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals: Understanding of policy optimization and reward shaping is essential, as EAPO builds upon standard RL frameworks with novel expert integration mechanisms.
- Expert-Distillation Techniques: Knowledge of how expert knowledge is typically compressed into models helps contextualize EAPO's approach as a middle ground between isolation and full distillation.
- Mathematical Reasoning Tasks: Familiarity with benchmark tasks like AIME problems provides context for evaluating EAPO's performance claims.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Policy Model -> Decision Module -> Expert Consultation Module -> Reward Processor -> Internalization Controller
Critical Path: The decision module determines when expert consultation occurs, which then feeds into the reward processor that updates the policy. The internalization controller gradually reduces consultation frequency over time.
Design Tradeoffs: The framework balances between exploration (self-reasoning) and exploitation (expert guidance), with the progressive internalization mechanism controlling this balance over training time.
Failure Signatures: Over-reliance on expert consultation indicates insufficient internalization, while poor performance suggests inadequate expert guidance during critical steps.
First Experiments:
1. Test EAPO on a simple mathematical reasoning task to verify basic functionality
2. Conduct ablation study removing expert consultation to establish baseline performance
3. Implement progressive internalization with varying rates to identify optimal configuration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains need independent replication across multiple training runs to verify statistical significance
- The methodology for determining "critical steps" for expert consultation lacks sufficient detail for exact reproduction
- Generalization to non-mathematical reasoning domains remains unproven

## Confidence
- Novel concept validity: Medium - the on-demand expert integration approach is innovative but implementation details are sparse
- Comparative claims: Medium - limited statistical validation across multiple runs reduces confidence in reported 5-point improvement
- Domain generalizability: Low - current evaluation is restricted to mathematical reasoning benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing across multiple training runs to verify the 5-point accuracy improvement is robust
2. Perform ablation studies removing the progressive internalization component to quantify its specific contribution
3. Test EAPO on non-mathematical reasoning tasks to assess domain generalizability of the on-demand expert consultation approach
