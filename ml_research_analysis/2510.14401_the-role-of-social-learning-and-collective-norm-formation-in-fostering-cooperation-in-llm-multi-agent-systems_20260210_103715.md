# The Role of Social Learning and Collective Norm Formation in Fostering Cooperation in LLM Multi-Agent Systems

## Quick Facts

- LLMs sustain cooperation longer with social learning and norm voting; larger models outperform smaller ones

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a common-pool resource (CPR) simulation framework to study how norms and cooperation emerge in LLM multi-agent systems. Unlike traditional CPR models with explicit payoffs, this framework embeds payoff-biased social learning, individual punishment, and lightweight propose-then-vote norm formation, enabling norms to emerge endogenously. The framework is validated against human behavioral studies and benchmarked across multiple LLM families under varying environmental conditions and social initializations. Results reveal systematic differences in LLM cooperation dynamics, with larger models sustaining cooperation longer and adapting more effectively than smaller ones. The study demonstrates that both social learning and explicit norm voting are critical for cooperation, providing a rigorous testbed for emergent norms in LLM societies.

## Method Summary
The framework simulates agents harvesting from a common pool with regrowth based on current stock levels. Agents choose to cooperate (harvest 1 unit), defect (harvest 2 units), or punish (costly action targeting defectors). Resource dynamics follow logistic growth: \( \Delta r = \text{rate} \times r \times (1 - r/\text{capacity}) \). Social learning allows agents to imitate higher-performing peers, and a propose-then-vote mechanism enables group norm formation. The framework is validated against human behavioral data and applied to benchmark LLM cooperation across two environmental conditions (harsh vs. rich) and two social initializations (altruistic vs. selfish). Ablation studies systematically remove social learning and norm voting to assess their impact.

## Key Results
- Larger models (e.g., Claude Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o) sustain cooperation longer and adapt more effectively than smaller ones
- In harsh environments, altruistic populations outperform selfish ones; in rich environments, selfish populations sometimes survive better
- Both social learning and explicit group norm voting are critical for cooperation; removing both leads to rapid collapse

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Social learning enables agents to adopt successful strategies through imitation, creating positive feedback loops where cooperative behaviors spread when they prove sustainable. The propose-then-vote norm formation mechanism provides a structured pathway for collective agreement on acceptable behaviors, with the voting process creating commitment to norms that agents subsequently follow. Together, these mechanisms create a dual reinforcement system: social learning provides adaptive pressure toward successful strategies while norm voting establishes stable expectations that guide behavior even when short-term defection might seem attractive.

## Foundational Learning
- **Payoff-biased social learning**: Agents imitate higher-performing peers to adopt successful strategies
- **Propose-then-vote norm formation**: Lightweight collective decision-making enables group norms to emerge endogenously
- **Resource dynamics (logistic growth)**: Resource stock evolves based on current level, creating feedback loops between cooperation and resource sustainability
- **Individual punishment**: Costly actions targeting defectors help maintain cooperation
- **Environmental harshness**: Resource growth rate affects the stability of cooperation strategies

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:**
- Environment (resource pool with logistic growth) -> Agents (harvest/punish decisions) -> Social Learning (imitate high performers) -> Norm Formation (propose-then-vote) -> Updated agent strategies

**Critical Path:**
1. Resource state update (logistic growth)
2. Agent action selection (cooperate/defect/punish)
- Social learning (if enabled)
- Norm formation (if enabled)
- Strategy update

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Omitting explicit payoffs forces emergent norm formation vs. direct reward maximization
- Lightweight voting vs. complex governance structures
- Fixed prompts vs. adaptive agent instructions

**Failure Signatures:**
- Resource collapse when cooperation fails
- Sticky initial norms preventing adaptation
- Rapid collapse when social learning and norm voting are both disabled

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Compare cooperation duration with/without social learning in harsh environment
2. Test norm voting impact on selfish vs. altruistic initializations
3. Measure resource stability across different LLM model sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Observed model differences may reflect implementation details or prompt engineering rather than genuine capabilities
- Environmental conditions based on single parameter settings without sensitivity analysis
- LLM simulations use fixed seeds without reporting variance across multiple runs

## Confidence
- High confidence: Necessity of social learning and norm voting for sustaining cooperation
- Medium confidence: Relative performance rankings of different LLM models
- Medium confidence: Environmental condition effects (harsh vs rich)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct parameter sweep across multiple resource growth rates and punishment costs to test robustness of environmental condition findings
2. Run each LLM simulation condition 10+ times with different random seeds to quantify variance and test if observed model differences are statistically significant
3. Test alternative prompt formulations and few-shot examples to verify that observed behaviors are not artifacts of specific prompting strategies
