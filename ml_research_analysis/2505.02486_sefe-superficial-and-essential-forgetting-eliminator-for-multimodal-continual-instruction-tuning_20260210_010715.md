# SEFE: Superficial and Essential Forgetting Eliminator for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02486
- Reference count: 40
- This paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) by proposing the SEFE method, which introduces Answer Style Diversification (ASD) and RegLoRA to mitigate superficial and essential forgetting respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CoIN benchmark.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT), where models progressively lose previously acquired knowledge while learning new tasks. The authors categorize forgetting into two distinct types: superficial forgetting (response format deviation) and essential forgetting (actual knowledge loss). To address these issues, they propose SEFE (Superficial and Essential Forgetting Eliminator), which introduces the Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm to prevent superficial forgetting by diversifying response formats during training, and RegLoRA to minimize essential forgetting by stabilizing critical parameters through regularization. Experimental results on the CoIN benchmark demonstrate that SEFE achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing forgetting across both categories and improving overall model accuracy.

## Method Summary
The SEFE method addresses catastrophic forgetting in multimodal continual instruction tuning through two complementary mechanisms. The Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm prevents superficial forgetting by training the model with diverse response formats, ensuring the model maintains consistent output structures across tasks. RegLoRA (Regularized Low-Rank Adaptation) minimizes essential forgetting by applying parameter regularization to stabilize critical model components that encode fundamental knowledge. Together, these approaches create a comprehensive solution that preserves both the structural integrity of responses and the underlying knowledge base as the model learns new multimodal instruction tasks sequentially.

## Key Results
- SEFE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoIN benchmark for multimodal continual instruction tuning
- The method significantly reduces both superficial forgetting (response format deviation) and essential forgetting (knowledge loss)
- Experimental results demonstrate measurable improvements in overall model accuracy compared to baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SEFE method works by addressing the two distinct mechanisms of catastrophic forgetting in multimodal instruction tuning. Superficial forgetting occurs when models lose the ability to maintain consistent response formats across tasks, which ASD prevents by explicitly training with format diversity. Essential forgetting happens when the model overwrites critical knowledge parameters during sequential learning, which RegLoRA mitigates through targeted regularization that preserves important parameter values. This dual approach ensures that both the surface-level response characteristics and the deep knowledge representations remain stable throughout the continual learning process.

## Foundational Learning

**Catastrophic Forgetting**: The phenomenon where neural networks lose previously learned information when trained on new tasks. Why needed: Understanding this core problem motivates the development of SEFE's dual approach. Quick check: Observe performance degradation on earlier tasks after sequential training.

**Continual Instruction Tuning**: The process of sequentially training models on instruction-following tasks across multiple modalities. Why needed: The specific challenge of MCIT requires specialized forgetting mitigation strategies. Quick check: Verify the model can follow instructions across different modalities in sequence.

**Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that decomposes weight updates into low-rank matrices. Why needed: RegLoRA builds upon LoRA principles for efficient parameter stabilization. Quick check: Confirm that parameter updates remain sparse and efficient during regularization.

**Multimodal Learning**: Training models that can process and integrate information from multiple input types (text, image, audio, etc.). Why needed: MCIT specifically deals with instruction tuning across different data modalities. Quick check: Test model performance across all modalities in the benchmark.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Modalities -> Encoder Backbone -> SEFE Module (ASD + RegLoRA) -> Decoder -> Output Responses

**Critical Path**: The most critical processing path involves the input modality encoding, SEFE module application (combining ASD diversification and RegLoRA regularization), and the decoder generation of consistent responses across tasks.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades some parameter efficiency for stability, as the regularization components add overhead compared to standard LoRA approaches. However, this tradeoff is justified by the significant reduction in forgetting and improved task retention.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include insufficient format diversity in ASD leading to superficial forgetting recurrence, or overly aggressive RegLoRA regularization causing underfitting on new tasks. The model might also struggle with extreme modality combinations not seen during training.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test format consistency across tasks after sequential training with ASD enabled vs disabled, 2) Measure knowledge retention on early tasks after training on later tasks with and without RegLoRA, 3) Evaluate performance degradation when varying the strength of regularization parameters in RegLoRA.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- The paper does not extensively validate SEFE across diverse benchmarks beyond CoIN, raising questions about generalizability
- Long-term stability of the method for extended task sequences beyond those tested is not addressed
- Potential trade-offs between mitigating superficial and essential forgetting and their impact on real-world performance are not explored

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The identification of two distinct forgetting types and their characterization as separate phenomena affecting multimodal instruction tuning.

**High Confidence**: The experimental setup and baseline comparisons on the CoIN benchmark, which demonstrate measurable improvements in reducing forgetting.

**Medium Confidence**: The generalizability of results beyond the CoIN benchmark to other multimodal continual instruction tuning scenarios.

**Medium Confidence**: The long-term stability of the proposed method for extended task sequences.

## Next Checks

1. Test SEFE on additional multimodal continual instruction tuning benchmarks beyond CoIN to assess robustness and generalizability
2. Evaluate the method's performance over extended task sequences to ensure sustained mitigation of forgetting effects
3. Measure the computational overhead introduced by ASD and RegLoRA to determine the practical feasibility of SEFE in resource-constrained environments
