# Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Tactical Decision Making for Trucks in Highway Traffic

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18783
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18783
- Reference count: 40
- This paper develops a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework for autonomous trucks that learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies balancing safety, time efficiency, and energy efficiency in highway traffic.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses tactical decision-making for autonomous trucks on highways, balancing safety, time efficiency, and energy efficiency. The authors develop a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that explicitly learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies using a GPI-based MOPPO architecture with vector-valued critics and weight-conditioned actors. Experiments in a high-fidelity traffic simulator show the method efficiently approximates the Pareto frontier across varying traffic densities, achieving zero collision failures and achieving Total Cost of Operation (TCOP) values per meter close to analytical predictions (0.0012 euros/m in zero traffic, 0.0013 euros/m in medium and high traffic), demonstrating adaptive, preference-aware control for heavy-duty vehicle applications.

## Method Summary
The approach uses Multi-Objective Proximal Policy Optimization (MOPPO) with weight-conditioned actor and critic networks. The actor outputs per-objective action logits that are scalarized by preference weights to obtain action distributions, while the critic estimates vector-valued returns for each objective. Training employs Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) with Least-Squares (GPI-LS) to iteratively select corner weights with maximum utility gaps for focused learning. A rule-based safety filter masks unsafe actions to ensure collision-free training. The method learns policies across the weight simplex that represent different trade-offs between safety, time efficiency, and energy efficiency.

## Key Results
- Zero collision failures across all traffic conditions (zero, medium, high density)
- TCOP values per meter close to analytical predictions: 0.0012 euros/m in zero traffic, 0.0013 euros/m in medium and high traffic
- Efficient approximation of Pareto frontier with only 100 training iterations
- Adaptive behavior across different traffic densities, maintaining safety while optimizing for efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multi-objective PPO (MOPPO) with weight-conditioned networks enables learning a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies by preserving objective structure during learning. The actor outputs per-objective action logits (Z ∈ ℝ^|A|×d) which are scalarized only at the loss level using weight vectors w. This allows a single network to represent policies across the preference space while maintaining objective-specific value estimates through a vector-valued critic.

### Mechanism 2
GPI-based corner weight selection accelerates Pareto frontier approximation by focusing training on weight vectors with maximum utility gap. At each iteration, corner weights (where policy preference changes) are identified from current value vectors. The algorithm trains on weights with largest gap between estimated optimal value (via GPI) and best current policy, using action logit scalarization instead of Q-values for policy-gradient compatibility.

### Mechanism 3
Rule-based action masking combined with RL enables zero collision rates by constraining exploration to kinematically safe maneuvers. Before softmax, action logits are masked (set to large negative values) for invalid actions based on gap-based safety checks: front/rear gap sufficiency in current and target lanes, plus braking feasibility for rear vehicles during lane changes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) basics
  - Why needed here: MOPPO extends PPO; understanding clipped surrogate objectives, value function learning, and entropy regularization is prerequisite
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the PPO clipping parameter ε limits policy updates and why this matters for stable learning?

- Concept: Multi-objective optimization fundamentals (Pareto dominance, convex coverage sets, scalarization)
  - Why needed here: The entire framework is built on these concepts; without them, the weight-conditioning mechanism and GPI-based selection won't make sense
  - Quick check question: If policy A achieves cost vector (2, 5) and policy B achieves (3, 4), does either dominate the other? Why or why not?

- Concept: Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) theory
  - Why needed here: GPI underlies the corner weight selection and provides theoretical justification for the multi-policy improvement approach
  - Quick check question: How does GPI enable combining information from multiple policies to estimate the optimal policy for a new weight vector?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Weight Encoder: MLP encoding preference vector w ∈ ℝ^d
  2. State Encoder: MLP encoding observation features
  3. Feature Fusion: Element-wise combination of encoded state and weight
  4. Multi-objective Actor: Network producing action logits Z ∈ ℝ^|A|×d
  5. Multi-objective Critic: Network producing value estimates V ∈ ℝ^d
  6. Action Masking: Rule-based filter setting invalid action logits to -∞
  7. Scalarization: Weight-weighted combination of logits/values
  8. Rollout Buffer: Stores transitions with weight vectors for experience reuse
  9. GPI-LS Scheduler: Selects corner weights for training iterations

- Critical path:
  1. Implement PPO with standard scalar rewards as baseline
  2. Extend to vector-valued critic (d outputs)
  3. Add weight conditioning to actor and critic
  4. Implement per-objective action logits and scalarization
  5. Add action masking based on safety constraints
  6. Implement GPI-LS weight selection loop
  7. Integrate experience reuse across weight configurations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Experience reuse vs. weight-specific optimization: Buffer stores transitions from multiple weights; improves sample efficiency but may introduce off-policy bias if weight distributions shift dramatically
  - Action masking vs. reward shaping: Masking prevents unsafe exploration directly but requires accurate safety models; reward shaping is more flexible but may still allow unsafe states during exploration
  - Vector-valued critic vs. separate critics: Single multi-output critic shares representations but may have interference between objectives; separate critics increase parameters but isolate objective learning

- Failure signatures:
  - Training instability with high entropy: If entropy coefficient c₂ is too large relative to value loss weight c₁, policies may fail to converge on specific behaviors
  - Sparse Pareto front coverage: If corner weight selection gets stuck or value estimates are poor, the learned policy set may have gaps in achievable trade-offs
  - Consistent domination of certain weights: If GPI consistently estimates low values for some weight regions, those preferences will never be trained
  - Collision despite masking: If safety filter parameters (T_safe, s_0) are too aggressive or if other vehicle behavior violates filter assumptions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Single-objective PPO baseline: Train standard PPO with scalarized reward using a fixed weight (e.g., w = [0.33, 0.33, 0.33]) to establish performance baseline and validate environment integration. Measure success rate, average speed, and total cost
  2. MOPPO with fixed weight set: Train weight-conditioned networks using a predetermined set of weight vectors (e.g., 5-10 evenly spaced weights) without GPI-LS selection. Verify that the architecture can learn different behaviors for different weights and that vector-valued critic provides reasonable estimates
  3. Full GPI-LS loop with reduced iterations: Run the complete algorithm for N=20 iterations (vs. 100 in paper) on zero-traffic scenario to validate corner weight selection and Pareto front emergence before scaling to dense traffic. Compare TCOP per meter against analytical baseline (0.0012 €/m)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the MOPPO framework transfer directly from simulation to real-world trucking operations without significant performance degradation? The paper states the results "open up new possibilities for deploying adaptive... policies in real-world logistics operations," but validation was exclusively in SUMO microscopic simulation with no physical experiments performed.

### Open Question 2
Can the divergence between the learned policy costs and the analytical optimal cost be minimized in high-density traffic scenarios? The paper notes that as traffic density increases, the "relationship between average speed and cost deviates increasingly from the analytical curves," but does not propose methods to close this specific efficiency gap.

### Open Question 3
Is the agent capable of learning safe lane-changing behaviors intrinsically, without the reliance on a hard-coded rule-based safety filter? The methodology relies on a "rule-based safety filter" to mask invalid actions, ensuring safety but limiting the agent's ability to learn boundaries via exploration. The paper does not ablate the safety filter to determine if reward shaping alone is sufficient to guarantee zero collision rates.

## Limitations
- Architecture specifics (network sizes, activation functions) are unspecified, creating significant implementation ambiguity
- Critical PPO hyperparameters and GPI-LS sampling parameters are missing, potentially affecting reproducibility
- Simulator fidelity details are unclear, including exact traffic models, noise parameters, and vehicle dynamics

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Safety mechanism effectiveness (zero collisions reported) and overall TCOP metric validity
- **Medium confidence**: Pareto front approximation quality and adaptive behavior claims (based on simulation results but limited traffic scenarios)
- **Low confidence**: Real-world applicability and performance under edge cases not covered in simulation (e.g., sudden traffic disruptions, mixed traffic types)

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture ablation study**: Systematically vary network sizes and activation functions to identify minimum viable configurations that achieve similar TCOP performance
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Test the impact of PPO and GPI-LS parameters on Pareto front quality across different traffic densities
3. **Cross-scenario generalization**: Evaluate learned policies on traffic scenarios with different vehicle mixes (e.g., higher truck percentages) and dynamic traffic conditions not seen during training
