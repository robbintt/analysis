# SynGen-Vision: Synthetic Data Generation for training industrial vision models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.04894
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04894
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: mAP50 score of 0.87 on real industrial images using synthetic data

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SynGen-Vision, a pipeline that uses Generative AI to synthetically generate and annotate rust conditions on industrial objects for training computer vision models. The approach combines vision language models with 3D simulation and rendering to create synthetic datasets for varying rust conditions. The pipeline achieves superior performance compared to baselines by generating realistic textures through style transfer and domain randomization, enabling effective sim-to-real transfer for rust detection in industrial settings.

## Method Summary
The pipeline consists of four main steps: texture generation from user prompts using Stable Diffusion, texture synthesis with style transfer to preserve structural fidelity, intelligent texture application on 3D models via UV mapping in Blender, and generation of annotated synthetic images through multi-variation rendering. The synthetic dataset (2000 samples) trains a YOLOv5 model for rust detection, evaluated on ~100 manually tagged real industrial images.

## Key Results
- mAP50 score of 0.87 on real industrial images
- Precision of 1.0 and Recall of 0.91 on real test set
- Outperforms baseline approaches: GenAI alone (mAP50 0.279) and GenAI + style transfer without filtering (mAP50 0.451)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Style transfer preserves structural fidelity of original textures while injecting wear patterns
- Core assumption: The content image contains meaningful structural information worth preserving, and the style image captures the target degradation pattern without introducing artifacts
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.2 states the approach retains original texture details; Table 1 shows GenAI + style transfer achieves mAP50 of 0.451 vs 0.279 for GenAI alone

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Noise filtering improves training signal quality by removing unusable generated textures
- Core assumption: Noise artifacts are detectable via image processing heuristics, and their removal does not inadvertently exclude valid textures
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.3 describes using image processing techniques to filter noisy textures; Table 1 shows full pipeline achieves mAP50 of 0.872 vs 0.451 for approach b, with precision improving from 0.583 to 1.0

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain randomization through 3D rendering variation enables sim-to-real transfer
- Core assumption: The synthetic environment approximates the geometric and photometric statistics of real industrial settings
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.4 describes generating multiple variations through changing camera angles, viewpoints, and lighting; abstract states the model outperforms other approaches with mAP50 of 0.87

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stable Diffusion / Latent Diffusion Models
  - Why needed here: Core engine for text-to-texture generation; understanding prompt engineering (keywords like "texture," "surface") is critical for controlling output quality
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why adding "texture" to a prompt reduces background noise in generated images?

- Concept: Neural Style Transfer
  - Why needed here: Enables synthesis of wear patterns while preserving base texture structure; requires understanding of content vs. style loss functions
  - Quick check question: What happens to logo/label fidelity if you apply GenAI rust textures directly without style transfer?

- Concept: UV Mapping in 3D Graphics
  - Why needed here: Mechanism for applying 2D textures onto 3D model surfaces; precise UV unwrapping determines texture alignment
  - Quick check question: How would a poorly constructed UV map affect the appearance of rust streaks on a cylindrical tank?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt Engineering Layer → Stable Diffusion → Raw rust textures → Style Transfer Layer → Content (base) + Style (rust) → Synthesized textures → Noise Filtering Layer → Image processing → Validated textures → 3D Application Layer → UV mapping in Blender → Textured 3D models → Rendering Layer → Camera/lighting variation → Annotated synthetic images → Training Layer → YOLOv5 → Rust detection model

- Critical path: Prompt quality → Texture realism → Noise filtering effectiveness → UV mapping accuracy → Render diversity → Model generalization. Failures cascade downstream.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt specificity vs. diversity: Highly specific prompts yield cleaner textures but less variation
  - Filtering aggressiveness: Stricter filters improve precision but may reduce recall due to fewer training samples
  - Render complexity: More variations increase training robustness but raise computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Low mAP on real data despite high synthetic accuracy → Likely domain gap; increase render diversity or improve texture realism
  - Text/watermarks appearing in textures → Filtering step misconfigured; tune noise detection thresholds
  - Lost logos/labels on textured models → Style transfer weight imbalance; increase content loss weighting

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline prompt ablation: Test prompts with/without "texture" keyword; measure noise rate in generated textures
  2. Style transfer weight sweep: Vary content vs. style loss ratio; evaluate structural preservation vs. rust realism
  3. Render variation impact: Train models with 500, 1000, and 2000 samples across varying camera angles; plot mAP50 vs. sample count to identify saturation point

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the pipeline effectively simulate continuous stages of ageing for predictive maintenance rather than discrete static states?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states that SynGen-Vision can be used to "simulate various stages of ageing, wear and tear analysis and predictive maintenance"
- Why unresolved: The current study validates the model on three discrete classes (default, streaks, complete) and does not demonstrate the ability to model temporal progression or predict remaining useful life
- What evidence would resolve it: A study showing high correlation between the synthetic "age" progressions generated by the pipeline and real-world time-lapse degradation data of industrial equipment

### Open Question 2
- Question: How effectively does the pipeline transfer to non-corrosion defect types, such as cracks, dents, or oil leaks?
- Basis in paper: The authors claim the approach is "customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear and tear detection scenarios" beyond rust
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides quantitative results for rust detection; other defect types may involve geometric deformations or translucent materials that "texture generation" cannot capture
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative mAP50 scores on real-world datasets for diverse defect types (e.g., cracks, dents) generated via the same texture-transfer pipeline

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the quality of the generated texture depend on manual prompt engineering versus the underlying generative model?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.1 notes that generic prompts produce "background noise" and that specific keywords (e.g., "texture," "surface") must be manually appended to generate clean data
- Why unresolved: The reliance on manually discovered "keywords" suggests the pipeline may not be fully automated and might struggle with novel objects without human trial-and-error
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study testing automated prompt generation versus manual prompt refinement to measure the rate of "noisy texture" rejection and final model accuracy

## Limitations

- The approach relies heavily on manual prompt engineering, suggesting the pipeline may not be fully automated for novel objects
- Limited empirical validation of generalizability to other wear patterns beyond rust, despite claims of easy extension
- The synthetic-to-real domain gap remains unquantified, with no ablation studies showing how much domain randomization contributes to the reported mAP50 of 0.87

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core pipeline architecture (GenAI texture generation → style transfer → 3D rendering → model training) is technically sound and well-motivated by related work
- Medium confidence: The reported mAP50 of 0.87 on real images is promising, but the limited test set size and lack of cross-validation raise questions about robustness
- Low confidence: Claims about ease of extension to other wear patterns and industrial scenarios are speculative without empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Domain gap quantification: Conduct controlled experiments comparing model performance when trained on synthetic data with/without domain randomization, and measure degradation when tested on real images
2. Texture quality ablation: Systematically vary Stable Diffusion prompt engineering and style transfer parameters, measuring their impact on downstream detection accuracy
3. Generalizability test: Apply the pipeline to a different wear pattern (e.g., corrosion, scratches) and evaluate whether similar performance gains are achieved without architectural changes
