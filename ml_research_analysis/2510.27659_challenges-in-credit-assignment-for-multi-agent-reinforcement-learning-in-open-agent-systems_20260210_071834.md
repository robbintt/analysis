# Challenges in Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Agent Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.27659
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27659
- **Reference count**: 38
- **Primary result**: Openness in MARL environments systematically violates core credit assignment assumptions, causing significant performance degradation across both temporal and structural credit assignment methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how openness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments—characterized by dynamic agent populations, tasks, and agent types—fundamentally challenges credit assignment. Through both conceptual analysis and empirical evaluation, the authors demonstrate that traditional credit assignment methods fail when key assumptions (stationary environment, fixed agent set, stable rewards, Markov property, consistent action-outcome mapping) are violated by openness events. The empirical results show that both Deep Q-Networks (temporal credit assignment) and Multi-Agent PPO (structural credit assignment) experience significant performance degradation under various openness conditions, with the worst performance occurring when all openness types are combined.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates DQN and MAPPO in a wildfire domain (WS1 configuration from MOASEI) across five experimental conditions: no openness, agent openness, task openness, type openness, and full openness. The authors use observation padding and action masking to handle variable observation sizes and dynamic action spaces. DQN serves as the temporal credit assignment method while MAPPO handles structural credit assignment through centralized critics. Training runs for 160,000 episodes with evaluation over 250 independent runs using fixed random seed 42. The wildfire domain features a 3x3 grid with fire suppression tasks and dynamic fire creation.

## Key Results
- Both DQN and MAPPO show significant performance degradation under all openness conditions compared to the closed environment baseline.
- Agent openness and task openness cause greater reward reduction than type openness.
- Combined openness (all three types simultaneously) produces the worst performance, violating all five core credit assignment assumptions.
- DQN experiences unstable loss functions with elevated variance under openness, while MAPPO shows noisy actor-critic losses and slower convergence.
- Performance degradation is monotonic across openness types, with all openness yielding the lowest rewards.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Temporal credit assignment fails when environmental dynamics change mid-episode because TD learning cannot disentangle policy errors from environmental shifts.
- **Mechanism**: DQN propagates rewards backward through time using bootstrapped value targets. When an action's outcome changes due to openness (e.g., task disappears), the TD-error signal attributes the reward change to the policy rather than the environmental shift, causing misattribution.
- **Core assumption**: Stationary transition dynamics and consistent action-outcome mappings hold across episodes.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation"; [Page 6] "DQN cannot differentiate whether loss stems from a bad policy or an altered environment".
- **Break condition**: Agent turnover or task turnover introduces non-stationarity that violates the Markov property, causing Q-value oscillations and elevated loss variance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Structural credit assignment via centralized critics degrades when team composition or task structures change dynamically.
- **Mechanism**: MAPPO's centralized critic learns a joint value function V(s) assuming stable team structure. When agents enter/leave or tasks change, the state representation changes, but the critic's learned value mappings become stale, producing inaccurate advantage estimates for policy gradient updates.
- **Core assumption**: Fixed agent set and stable team coordination patterns during training.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Page 6-7] "The noisy actor-critic losses demonstrate the centralized critic's inability to produce a consistent advantage function when the team's structure is in flux"; [Page 3] Table 1 shows agent turnover breaks assumptions (1), (3), and (5).
- **Break condition**: Agent absence/return or type changes cause gradient instability; the critic cannot reliably attribute joint outcomes to individual contributions when structural relationships shift.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Combined openness creates compounding assumption violations that exceed the sum of individual openness effects.
- **Mechanism**: Each openness type violates distinct assumptions: agent openness → fixed agent set; task openness → stationary reward function; type openness → consistent action-outcome mapping. When combined, these violations interact—e.g., an agent with changed capabilities (type) working on a new task (task) with missing teammates (agent) creates cascading credit propagation failures.
- **Core assumption**: Violations compound multiplicatively rather than additively because each broken assumption corrupts different stages of the credit propagation pipeline.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Page 6] "The most severe degradation occurs under All Openness...simultaneously violates all five key assumptions"; [Page 5] Figure 2 shows combined openness yields lowest rewards across both DQN and MAPPO.
- **Break condition**: When ≥3 assumptions are violated simultaneously, credit signals become too noisy for meaningful policy updates; both temporal and structural pathways fail together.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Credit Assignment Problem (CAP)**
  - Why needed here: Core framework distinguishing temporal (when credit is due) from structural (which agent deserves credit) assignment; the paper shows openness breaks both.
  - Quick check question: If an agent suppresses a fire at t=5 but the fire was cancelled at t=3, does TCA or SCA fail first?

- **Concept: CTDE (Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution)**
  - Why needed here: MAPPO uses centralized critics during training; understanding this clarifies why structural changes during training (not execution) cause critic instability.
  - Quick check question: Why does a centralized critic become unreliable when agents leave mid-training but not necessarily mid-execution?

- **Concept: Five CAP Assumptions (Stationary Environment, Fixed Agents, Stable Rewards, Markov Property, Consistent Action-Outcome)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's diagnostic framework maps each openness type to specific assumption violations; essential for debugging failure modes.
  - Quick check question: Which assumption does "agent capability change" violate that "agent departure" does not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Environment generates observation → padding normalizes shape → Policy network outputs action logits → masking removes invalid actions → Environment returns reward + next state → openness events may modify mid-episode → For DQN: TD-target computed → loss backpropagated → For MAPPO: Centralized critic computes advantage → actor updates via policy gradient

- **Critical path**: 1. Environment generates observation → padding normalizes shape; 2. Policy network outputs action logits → masking removes invalid actions; 3. Environment returns reward + next state → openness events may modify mid-episode; 4. For DQN: TD-target computed → loss backpropagated (instability if dynamics shifted); 5. For MAPPO: Centralized critic computes advantage → actor updates via policy gradient (instability if team structure changed)

- **Design tradeoffs**: Padding/masking enables standard MARL algorithms but bounds the problem artificially; truly unbounded openness would require different architectures; Centralized critics improve coordination in static settings but increase sensitivity to structural changes; DQN's value-based approach is more sample-efficient but less robust to non-stationarity than policy gradient methods (though both fail here)

- **Failure signatures**: DQN: Elevated, high-variance loss that fails to converge; Q-values oscillate rather than stabilize; MAPPO: Actor loss becomes noisy; critic loss shows high variance; convergence takes ~1.2x longer; Both: Average episode reward drops significantly; coordination collapses (fires burn uncontrolled)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. **Baseline validation**: Run DQN and MAPPO in PistonBall (closed environment) to verify implementation matches published baselines; 2. **Isolated openness ablation**: Test agent-openness-only, task-openness-only, type-openness-only separately to quantify individual degradation; expect task openness > agent openness > type openness in reward impact; 3. **Combined openness stress test**: Enable all three openness types; measure loss variance, convergence time, and final reward; verify "All Openness" produces worst performance as paper claims.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can TCA mechanisms like eligibility traces or discount factors be adapted to dynamically recalibrate credit propagation under non-stationary environments?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 5 states that traditional TCA fails to connect actions to rewards when agents enter or leave, suggesting a need to investigate "adaptive eligibility traces, dynamically adjusted discount factors, and context-sensitive bootstrapping techniques."
- **Why unresolved**: Current methods assume stable environmental dynamics, which are violated by agent and task openness.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A modified TCA algorithm that maintains stable loss convergence and credit accuracy in environments with dynamic transition probabilities.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can dynamic graph-based or attention-based architectures effectively realign structural credit attribution in real-time during agent turnover or task absence?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 5 identifies a gap in SCA regarding the inability to attribute outcomes to changing agent sets and proposes "dynamic graph-based methods" and "attention mechanisms" as potential solutions.
- **Why unresolved**: Current SCA methods rely on fixed agent compositions and task structures, leading to misattribution when structures evolve.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Demonstration of an SCA method that dynamically updates its decomposition structure without suffering from the gradient instability observed in MAPPO under openness.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can credit assignment methods be designed to handle true unboundedness in observation and action spaces without relying on artificial padding or masking?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 4.1 and 4.4 note that the authors used padding and masking as a "workaround" because "no existing implementation of DQN or MAPPO can handle truly unbounded observation or action spaces," yet true unboundedness remains a "fundamental challenge."
- **Why unresolved**: Standard neural network architectures require fixed input dimensions, failing when the number of agents or tasks is not artificially constrained.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An algorithm that operates natively on variable-sized inputs (e.g., sets or graphs) without conversion to fixed-size vectors, maintaining performance as agent counts fluctuate.

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: What benchmark architectures are necessary to accurately represent complex openness scenarios for validating CAP methods beyond simplified environments?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 5 highlights an "evaluation gap," noting that "existing benchmarks typically reflect simplified or artificially bounded openness scenarios."
- **Why unresolved**: Current benchmarks limit the validity of CAP evaluations because they do not fully capture the complexity of open agent systems (OASYS).
- **What evidence would resolve it**: The creation and adoption of a standardized benchmark suite that includes simultaneous agent, task, and type openness with unbounded parameters.

## Limitations
- The paper relies on unspecified implementation details including hyperparameters, openness event frequencies, and complete reward functions.
- The conceptual framework assumes five core CAP assumptions but doesn't empirically validate which violations most impact performance.
- The claim that combined openness effects exceed additive combinations lacks quantitative support through controlled experiments.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Temporal credit assignment fails under environmental non-stationarity (DQN loss instability observed).
**Medium confidence**: Structural credit assignment degrades with dynamic team composition (MAPPO performance drops under agent openness).
**Low confidence**: Combined openness creates multiplicative rather than additive degradation effects (claimed but not empirically separated).

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled ablation studies isolating each openness type while measuring individual and combined assumption violations.
2. Implement robustness tests varying openness event frequencies to determine sensitivity thresholds.
3. Develop diagnostic metrics to quantify which specific CAP assumptions are violated most severely under each openness condition.
