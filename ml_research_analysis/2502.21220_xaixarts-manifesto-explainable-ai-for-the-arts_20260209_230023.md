- One-line primary result: Co-created manifesto integrating artistic perspectives into XAI to promote ethical, inclusive, and interdisciplinary AI practices.

## Executive Summary
The XAIxArts Manifesto addresses the challenge of making AI models understandable beyond technocentric explanations by integrating artistic practices and perspectives into explainable AI (XAI). Through collaborative workshops and discussions, the authors developed a living manifesto emphasizing themes such as empowerment, inclusion, fairness, artistic practice, hacking, glitches, and openness. This manifesto serves as a framework for fostering innovation and understanding at the intersection of AI and the Arts while promoting ethical AI practices and equitable access.

## Method Summary
The methodology employed a World Café style workshop with 39 participants from diverse backgrounds including HCI researchers, AI engineers, and practicing artists. Participants engaged in hybrid brainstorming sessions organized around four core themes: Empowerment, Inclusion, and Fairness; Valuing Artistic Practice; Hacking and Glitches; and Openness. Discussions were captured through a collaborative mind map (Excalidraw) and synthesized into manifesto text over two days. The process included a public poster session for annotations followed by online collaborative editing (Miro) to create a living document that invites ongoing community engagement.

## Key Results
- Successfully co-created a living manifesto that integrates artistic perspectives into XAI discourse
- Identified four core themes that move beyond technocentric explanations toward inclusive, artistic, and critical approaches
- Established a framework for interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers and artists
- Created mechanisms for ongoing community engagement and refinement of the manifesto

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The manifesto works by reframing XAI through artistic lenses rather than purely technical ones, creating space for alternative forms of explanation that prioritize human experience, creativity, and critical engagement. By bringing together diverse practitioners in structured dialogue and making the manifesto "living" through ongoing community input, it creates a dynamic framework that can evolve with both technological and artistic developments.

## Foundational Learning
- **World Café methodology** - why needed: Enables structured cross-disciplinary dialogue; quick check: Does each table have clear thematic focus and rotation protocol?
- **Mind mapping for synthesis** - why needed: Visual organization of diverse perspectives; quick check: Are all key discussion points captured in the visual structure?
- **Living document principles** - why needed: Ensures manifesto remains relevant and evolves; quick check: Are there clear mechanisms for community contribution and version tracking?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** World Café Workshop -> Mind Map Capture -> Text Synthesis -> Public Annotation -> Online Editing -> Living Manifesto
- **Critical path:** Workshop facilitation -> Synthesis accuracy -> Community engagement mechanisms
- **Design tradeoffs:** Depth of artistic exploration vs. technical precision; structured process vs. organic discussion
- **Failure signatures:** Technocentric drift in synthesized text; low community engagement with living document
- **First experiments:** 1) Test facilitation prompts with small artist group; 2) Pilot mind map synthesis with subset of discussions; 3) Deploy initial living document version for 2-week engagement trial

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can artistic practices provide alternative, non-technocentric forms of explanation for AI systems that are effective for diverse audiences?
- How can glitches and AI errors be systematically repurposed as explainable artistic elements that reveal inner workings of AI systems?
- What mechanisms can effectively reduce barriers to equitable access to XAI tools for artists from diverse backgrounds and with diverse abilities?
- How do sustained, longitudinal artistic engagements with AI models generate unique forms of explainability that differ from one-time interactions?

## Limitations
- Specific facilitation prompts and synthesis heuristics are not fully specified, making faithful reproduction difficult
- The "living" aspect remains theoretical without evidence of sustained community engagement
- Potential conflicts between artistic and technical perspectives are acknowledged but not addressed in methodology

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The four core themes identified are well-established in XAI ethics literature
- **Medium Confidence:** The World Café methodology can generate meaningful cross-disciplinary dialogue
- **Low Confidence:** The sustainability and community adoption of the "living manifesto" concept

## Next Checks
1. Obtain and test the specific World Café prompts and facilitation guidelines used to ensure consistent non-technocentric outputs
2. Deploy a publicly accessible version of the manifesto and track engagement metrics over a 6-month period
3. Conduct blind review categorizing synthesized manifesto excerpts to verify maintenance of non-technocentric focus
