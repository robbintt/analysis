# Learning Pareto manifolds in high dimensions: How can regularization help?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.08849
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08849
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Two-stage multi-objective learning framework that separates parameter estimation from scalarized optimization, achieving optimal rates by leveraging low-dimensional structure in distributional parameters.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-objective learning (MOL) in high-dimensional regimes where data is costly to label. While regularization techniques are well-understood for single-objective learning with low-dimensional structure like sparsity, their application to MOL with multiple competing objectives remains largely unexplored. The authors propose a two-stage MOL framework that successfully leverages such low-dimensional structure. The method first estimates distributional parameters (which may exhibit structure like sparsity) using efficient estimators, then optimizes the scalarized objective using these estimated parameters. Theoretical analysis provides upper bounds showing how estimation errors of distributional parameters propagate to estimation errors of the Pareto set, with matching lower bounds demonstrating optimality under mild conditions. The approach is validated experimentally on multi-distribution learning and fairness-risk trade-off problems, showing improved performance compared to direct regularization approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed two-stage framework addresses multi-objective learning by first estimating distributional parameters using efficient estimators that exploit low-dimensional structure (like sparsity), then performing scalarized optimization using these estimated parameters. Stage 1 uses techniques like Lasso to estimate sparse parameters β_k and sample covariance estimation using both labeled and unlabeled data to estimate Σ_k. Stage 2 solves the scalarized optimization problem min_λ Σ λ_k ||Σ_k^(1/2)(ϑ-β_k)||² using the estimated parameters. This separation allows the method to leverage the sparsity of β_k without requiring the Pareto-optimal solutions ϑ_λ themselves to be sparse, which would be impossible since they are convex combinations of individual minimizers.

## Key Results
- Direct regularization approaches cannot leverage the sparsity of distributional parameters β_k and incur sample complexity linear in dimension d
- The two-stage estimator achieves optimal error rates with dependence on sparsity s rather than full dimension d
- Unlabeled data is theoretically necessary for high-dimensional MOL when estimating covariance matrices
- The framework provides both upper bounds on Pareto set estimation error and matching lower bounds demonstrating optimality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Separating parameter estimation from scalarized optimization preserves the benefits of low-dimensional structural inductive biases (like sparsity), whereas applying regularization directly to the scalarized loss fails.
- **Mechanism:** In single-objective learning, regularization (e.g., Lasso) works because the optimal parameter θ_k shares the structure of the data (e.g., sparsity). However, in multi-objective learning, the Pareto-optimal points ϑ_λ are typically convex combinations of individual minimizers. Even if individual minimizers β_k are sparse, their combinations (Pareto points) are generally dense. A two-stage approach first efficiently estimates the sparse parameters θ̂ and then solves the optimization, avoiding the need for the Pareto points themselves to be sparse.
- **Core assumption:** The distributional parameters (e.g., ground truths β_k) possess low-dimensional structure (sparsity), but the resulting Pareto-optimal solutions ϑ_λ do not.
- **Break condition:** If the Pareto set itself were sparse (e.g., specific covariance structures), direct regularization might remain viable.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The estimation error of the Pareto set is linearly bounded by the estimation error of the distributional parameters under strong convexity.
- **Mechanism:** The paper utilizes optimization stability theory (Implicit Function Theorem). If the objective functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz gradients, the map from distributional parameters θ to the optimal solution ϑ_λ is Lipschitz continuous. Therefore, minimizing the parameter estimation error ||θ̂-θ|| in Stage 1 guarantees a proportional bound on the Pareto set error ||θ̂_λ-ϑ_λ|| in Stage 2.
- **Core assumption:** At least one objective must be strongly convex (μ > 0), and gradients must be locally Lipschitz continuous.
- **Break condition:** If objectives are non-convex or lack Lipschitz gradients, the stability guarantee may degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Unlabeled data is theoretically necessary to recover the Pareto set in high dimensions because accurate covariance estimation is a prerequisite for identifying Pareto-optimal trade-offs.
- **Mechanism:** The Pareto solution depends on both the ground truth vectors β_k and the covariance matrices Σ_k. While β_k can be estimated using sparse labels, estimating Σ_k accurately in high dimensions requires sample sizes proportional to dimension d. Labeled data is often scarce (n << d), so unlabeled data (N) provides the necessary signal to reduce the covariance estimation error component of the total risk.
- **Core assumption:** The covariance matrices Σ_k are unknown and the dimension d is large relative to labeled sample size n.
- **Break condition:** If covariance matrices are known a priori or if n >> d, unlabeled data would not provide additional statistical benefit.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) via Scalarization**
- **Why needed here:** The paper maps the vector-valued loss problem to a scalar problem to find Pareto points. Understanding linear vs. Chebyshev scalarization is required to implement Stage 2.
- **Quick check question:** Can you explain why minimizing a weighted sum (linear scalarization) might fail to find non-convex parts of a Pareto front?

**Concept: High-Dimensional Statistics (Lasso)**
- **Why needed here:** Stage 1 relies on efficiently estimating sparse parameters β_k from limited data. Understanding restricted eigenvalue conditions helps explain why the two-stage estimator achieves log(d)/n rates.
- **Quick check question:** Why does the ℓ₁ norm induce sparsity in linear regression, and what is the sample complexity for recovering an s-sparse vector?

**Concept: Strong Convexity & Lipschitz Stability**
- **Why needed here:** These are the mathematical glue connecting parameter error to Pareto set error.
- **Quick check question:** If a function is not strongly convex, does a small change in the function's input parameters guarantee a small change in the location of the function's minimum?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Labeled datasets D_k and Unlabeled datasets U_k -> Sparse Estimator (Lasso) + Covariance Estimator (Sample covariance) -> Estimated parameters (θ̂_β, θ̂_Σ) -> Scalarized Optimization Solver -> Estimated Pareto manifold θ̂_λ

**Critical path:** The estimation of θ̂_Σ using unlabeled data. If this is inaccurate, the geometry of the trade-off is wrong, and the Pareto set is misidentified.

**Design tradeoffs:** 
- *Direct Regularization:* Simpler, but fails to generalize in high dimensions because it incorrectly assumes the Pareto manifold is sparse.
- *Two-Stage:* Requires solving for θ first, but provably achieves optimal rates by decoupling the sparsity of θ from the geometry of the Pareto set.

**Failure signatures:**
- High estimation error in high-d settings when using direct regularization
- Large variance in Pareto front estimates when unlabeled data N is insufficient relative to dimension d

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Toy High-Dimensional Regression:** Compare direct regularization vs. two-stage on sparse linear regression with varying d (e.g., d=50 vs d=500) to verify the "curse of dimensionality" gap.
2. **Unlabeled Data Ablation:** Vary the amount of unlabeled data N while holding n fixed to demonstrate the improvement in Pareto set recovery (error should scale with d/(n+N)).
3. **Fairness-Risk Trade-off:** Apply the two-stage method to a dataset like "Communities and Crime" to show improved Pareto front estimation over baselines, particularly in the interior of the front where λ values are balanced.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: Can minimax lower bounds be derived for multi-objective learning without relying on the identifiability assumption?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly state in the conclusion, "We leave it as future work to derive a more general framework for obtaining lower bounds in the MOL setting beyond identifiability."
- Why unresolved: The current minimax lower bound strictly depends on the Lipschitz identifiability condition to link parameter estimation errors to Pareto set errors.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof establishing minimax lower bounds under conditions that do not require the mapping from parameters to gradients to be injective.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: Can results from the optimization stability literature be used to relax the strong convexity requirements of the proposed framework?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion suggests that "other results from the stability literature could relax the convexity in Assumption 2."
- Why unresolved: The theoretical guarantees for the upper bounds currently require at least one objective to be strongly convex to ensure Lipschitz continuity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical extensions of the two-stage estimator bounds to non-convex or weakly convex settings using uniform stability or algorithmic robustness arguments.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: How generally does the presence of unlabeled data improve the estimation of the Pareto front?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that "the seemingly important role of unlabeled data in multi-objective learning deserves to be investigated further."
- Why unresolved: While Proposition 5 proves the necessity of unlabeled data for estimating covariance matrices in linear regression, the paper does not provide a comprehensive theory for its role across general MOL settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical characterization of the sample complexity reduction provided by unlabeled data in a broader class of MOL problems, or counter-examples where it provides no benefit.

**Open Question 4**
- Question: Can the proposed two-stage estimation framework successfully manage the trade-off between robustness and accuracy?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion identifies "robustness-accuracy trade-off" as a specific example of other objectives where the theory could be applied.
- Why unresolved: The paper validated the method on multi-distribution learning and fairness-risk trade-offs, but did not theoretically or empirically analyze the robustness setting.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the two-stage estimator to robust optimization objectives (e.g., adversarial risk) with derivations of the corresponding estimation error bounds.

## Limitations
- The framework relies on strong convexity of at least one objective and Lipschitz continuity of gradients, limiting applicability to general non-convex learning problems
- Semi-supervised requirement (unlabeled data scaling with dimension) creates practical constraints when unlabeled data is unavailable
- Benefits are most pronounced when distributional parameters exhibit structure that Pareto solutions lack, which may not generalize to all multi-objective problems

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The two-stage approach fundamentally outperforms direct regularization when distributional parameters have low-dimensional structure but Pareto solutions do not. The mechanism separating parameter estimation from optimization is mathematically sound under stated assumptions.
- **Medium Confidence:** The theoretical bounds accurately characterize the performance gap between methods in the linear sparse regression setting. The experimental validation supports the theory but uses relatively small-scale problems.
- **Low Confidence:** The extension to non-linear models and deep learning architectures, while promising, requires additional theoretical justification beyond the current convex analysis framework.

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization to Deep Models:** Implement the two-stage framework for a deep multi-task learning problem (e.g., fairness-accuracy trade-offs in image classification) and verify whether the estimation error bounds still provide meaningful guidance for hyperparameter selection.

2. **Non-Strongly Convex Objectives:** Test the framework on problems with weakly convex or non-convex objectives (e.g., logistic regression with non-separable data) to understand when the Lipschitz stability assumption breaks down and whether alternative analysis techniques are needed.

3. **Covariance Estimation Efficiency:** Systematically vary the ratio of unlabeled to labeled data in high-dimensional settings to empirically validate the theoretical requirement that N must scale with dimension d, and explore whether alternative covariance estimation techniques (e.g., sparse covariance estimation) can relax this requirement.
