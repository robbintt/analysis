# Terrarium: Revisiting the Blackboard for Multi-Agent Safety, Privacy, and Security Studies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.14312
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14312
- Reference count: 23
- Introduces Terrarium, a modular framework for studying MAS safety, privacy, and security

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Terrarium, a modular framework for studying multi-agent system (MAS) safety, privacy, and security. It repurposes the blackboard architecture to create a configurable testbed where LLM-driven agents collaborate on instruction-augmented distributed constraint optimization problems. The framework supports diverse attack vectors including misalignment, data stealing, and denial-of-service, enabling systematic evaluation of vulnerabilities. Experiments across three domains (Meeting Scheduling, Personal Assistant, Smart Home) show that agents achieve solid utility performance, while also demonstrating the feasibility of targeted attacks. The modular design allows rapid prototyping and iteration on defenses, accelerating research toward trustworthy MAS deployment.

## Method Summary
Terrarium employs a blackboard architecture where LLM-driven agents collaborate to solve instruction-augmented distributed constraint optimization problems. The framework is modular, allowing researchers to configure different attack vectors and test scenarios. Agents communicate through a shared blackboard interface, and the system supports various MAS domains including Meeting Scheduling, Personal Assistant, and Smart Home applications. The framework enables systematic evaluation of safety, privacy, and security vulnerabilities by allowing controlled injection of attacks such as misalignment, data stealing, and denial-of-service scenarios.

## Key Results
- Agents achieve solid utility performance across three domains (Meeting Scheduling, Personal Assistant, Smart Home)
- Demonstrates feasibility of targeted attacks including misalignment, data stealing, and denial-of-service
- Modular design enables rapid prototyping and iteration on defenses for trustworthy MAS deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Terrarium leverages the blackboard architecture's natural ability to facilitate agent communication and coordination while providing a controlled environment for systematic vulnerability analysis. The instruction-augmented distributed constraint optimization problems create realistic collaboration scenarios where safety, privacy, and security concerns naturally emerge. By using LLM-driven agents, the framework can model complex agent behaviors and interactions that are representative of real-world multi-agent systems.

## Foundational Learning
- Blackboard Architecture: A shared knowledge space where agents can read, write, and coordinate - needed to understand the core communication mechanism; quick check: can you trace how information flows between agents?
- Distributed Constraint Optimization: Agents work together to optimize shared objectives with local constraints - needed to grasp the problem formulation; quick check: can you identify the trade-offs between individual and collective utility?
- LLM-Driven Agents: Large language models serve as autonomous decision-making agents - needed to understand agent capabilities and limitations; quick check: can you explain how agent autonomy affects system predictability?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Domain Configurator -> Blackboard Manager -> Agent Controllers -> LLM Models -> Attack Injector -> Utility Evaluator

**Critical Path:**
1. Domain configuration defines the constraint optimization problem
2. Blackboard manager initializes shared workspace
3. Agent controllers instantiate LLM-driven agents
4. Agents read/write to blackboard and negotiate solutions
5. Attack injector (optional) introduces vulnerabilities
6. Utility evaluator measures system performance

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Modularity vs. Performance: Highly modular design allows flexibility but may introduce overhead
- LLM Autonomy vs. Predictability: Greater agent autonomy enables complex behaviors but reduces system predictability
- Attack Realism vs. Control: More realistic attacks are harder to control and reproduce

**Failure Signatures:**
- Communication breakdowns when agents cannot coordinate effectively
- Utility degradation when attacks successfully disrupt agent collaboration
- Deadlocks when agents reach conflicting conclusions about shared constraints

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Baseline utility performance across all three domains without attacks
2. Single-attack vector injection (e.g., misalignment) to measure impact on utility
3. Multi-attack scenario combining different vulnerability types to test system resilience

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic evaluation environment may not fully capture real-world multi-agent deployment complexity
- Limited validation beyond controlled experimental conditions for real-world applicability
- Attack vectors explored represent only a subset of potential vulnerabilities in distributed multi-agent systems

## Confidence

**Framework Design and Architecture:** High - The modular blackboard-based approach is well-articulated and technically sound
**Attack Feasibility Demonstrations:** Medium - Proof-of-concept attacks are demonstrated but not comprehensively validated across diverse scenarios
**Utility Performance Claims:** High - Quantitative results are presented with appropriate statistical measures
**Real-world Applicability:** Low - Limited validation beyond controlled experimental conditions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct stress tests with increased agent count and network complexity to evaluate scalability and emergent behaviors not observable in the current three-domain setup
2. Implement and evaluate defense mechanisms within Terrarium to assess whether identified vulnerabilities can be effectively mitigated
3. Compare Terrarium-generated attack patterns and system responses against empirical data from deployed multi-agent systems to validate ecological validity
