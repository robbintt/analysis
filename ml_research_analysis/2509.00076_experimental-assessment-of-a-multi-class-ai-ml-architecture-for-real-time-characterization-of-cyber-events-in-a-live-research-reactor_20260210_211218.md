# Experimental Assessment of a Multi-Class AI/ML Architecture for Real-Time Characterization of Cyber Events in a Live Research Reactor

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.00076
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00076
- Reference count: 12
- Multi-class AI/ML architecture achieved 99.7% F1 scores using Random Forest for real-time cyber event characterization in a live research reactor

## Executive Summary
This study presents a multi-class AI/ML architecture for real-time characterization of cyber events in nuclear reactor control systems, specifically targeting the PUR-1 research reactor. The architecture integrates operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) data streams to identify and characterize various cybersecurity events including false data injections, denial-of-service attacks, and operational anomalies. The system employs a three-level binary classifier approach that achieves near-perfect classification performance across six distinct event types using Random Forest algorithms trained on over 13.8 million multi-variate data points.

The experimental results demonstrate the architecture's robustness in distinguishing between normal operations, cyber attacks, and other operational issues in a real nuclear research reactor environment. While the system shows excellent performance for known attack patterns, with F1 scores reaching 100% for most classifiers, challenges remain in handling novel attack types and ensuring real-time synchronization between OT and IT data streams during complex cyber events.

## Method Summary
The architecture employs a three-level binary classifier system that processes both OT (67 signals) and IT (11 signals) data streams using Random Forest algorithms. Data preprocessing includes sliding window segmentation (20s windows, 1s step), standard scaling, and balanced training (20:1 normal:abnormal ratio). The system processes 14 system states across normal and abnormal conditions, with Level 1 classifying normal vs abnormal OT data, Level 2 detecting DoS events in IT data, and Level 3 distinguishing FDI from other anomalies in OT abnormal data. Hyperparameter tuning evaluated over 5,000 combinations to optimize performance metrics including F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Key Results
- Random Forest achieved F1 scores of 99.7% (Level 1), 100% (Level 2), and 100% (Level 3) on test data
- The three-level architecture successfully differentiated among six event types with near-perfect classification accuracy
- Combining OT and IT data streams improved overall classification accuracy compared to single-stream approaches
- Level 3 FDI classification performance degraded significantly (F1 dropped to 34%) for falsification types not seen during training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The architecture leverages the complementary strengths of OT and IT data streams to capture both physical process states and network-level anomalies. By using a three-level binary classification approach rather than attempting direct multi-class classification, the system can more effectively isolate and characterize different types of cyber events through progressive refinement. The sliding window approach with temporal context (20-second windows) enables the detection of temporal patterns and anomalies that may not be apparent in individual data points.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-class vs Binary Cascade Classification**: Binary classifiers are easier to train and more robust than direct multi-class approaches; quick check: compare F1 scores between direct 6-class vs 3-level cascade approaches
- **OT-IT Data Fusion**: Combining operational and network data provides complementary views of system state; quick check: measure performance improvement when adding IT signals to OT-only models
- **Sliding Window Time Series Processing**: Temporal context is crucial for anomaly detection in sequential data; quick check: vary window size and observe impact on detection latency and accuracy
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Balancing normal vs abnormal samples prevents bias toward majority class; quick check: test different balancing ratios and their effect on false negative rates
- **Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic search across >5,000 combinations optimizes classifier performance; quick check: compare performance across different n_estimators and max_depth values
- **Multi-stream Synchronization**: Temporal alignment of OT and IT streams is critical during cyber events; quick check: measure classification accuracy when streams are artificially desynchronized

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
OT Data Stream -> Level 1 Classifier (Normal/Abnormal) -> Level 3 Classifier (FDI/Other) -> 6-Class Output
IT Data Stream -> Level 2 Classifier (DoS/No-DoS) -> 6-Class Output

Critical Path:
OT -> Level 1 -> Level 3 -> Final Classification

Design Tradeoffs:
- Window size vs. detection latency: 20s windows provide good accuracy but increase detection delay
- Training balance ratio vs. false negatives: Higher ratio reduces false positives but may miss subtle anomalies
- Single vs. multi-class classification: Binary cascade approach provides better robustness at cost of architectural complexity

Failure Signatures:
- High false negatives in Level 1 (6 observed) indicate insufficient training balance or inadequate feature representation
- Poor FDI classification (F1=34% for unseen types) suggests overfitting to training attack patterns
- Synchronization issues between OT and IT streams during attacks indicate timing alignment problems

First Experiments:
1. Train Level 1 classifier on balanced OT data and evaluate confusion matrix to identify false negative patterns
2. Test Level 2 DoS detection on IT data with various attack intensities to establish detection thresholds
3. Evaluate Level 3 FDI classifier on out-of-sample attack patterns to assess generalization capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study did not specify exact signal names from the 2,000+ available signals, limiting exact reproduction capability
- Random Forest hyperparameters were tuned but final values were not reported, requiring re-tuning for faithful replication
- The 20-second window length may not capture all cyber event dynamics, particularly for rapid attacks
- Level 3 FDI classification showed significant performance degradation for certain falsification types not seen during training

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Multi-class architecture design, Random Forest as primary classifier, 6-class event differentiation capability
- Medium Confidence: Overall system performance metrics (99.7% F1 scores), generalization to unseen cyber events
- Low Confidence: Real-time implementation feasibility, robustness against novel attack types, and handling of concurrent cyber-physical events

## Next Checks
1. Test the trained architecture on a completely new dataset with novel FDI signal falsifications not present in the original training data to assess true generalization capability
2. Implement the three-level classifier pipeline on streaming data to verify real-time performance claims and identify any latency issues
3. Conduct stress testing with simultaneous DoS and FDI attacks to evaluate the architecture's ability to distinguish and characterize concurrent cyber events
