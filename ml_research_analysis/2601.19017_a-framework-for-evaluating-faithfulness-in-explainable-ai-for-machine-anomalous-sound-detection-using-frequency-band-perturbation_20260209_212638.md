# A Framework for Evaluating Faithfulness in Explainable AI for Machine Anomalous Sound Detection Using Frequency-Band Perturbation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.19017
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19017
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Occlusion method shows highest faithfulness correlation (0.884) in evaluating ASD XAI explanations, while gradient-based methods like SmoothGrad perform weaker (0.400)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating the faithfulness of explainable AI (XAI) methods for machine anomalous sound detection (ASD). While current ASD XAI methods primarily rely on qualitative inspection of saliency maps, this work introduces a quantitative framework that systematically perturbs frequency bands in spectrograms and measures resulting changes in model predictions. By establishing a functional ground truth for frequency importance through band removal experiments and correlating these changes with XAI attribution scores using Spearman correlation, the framework provides objective validation of whether explanations accurately reflect model behavior. Testing four widely used XAI methods on the DCASE2023 Task 2 dataset reveals significant differences in faithfulness, with Occlusion demonstrating superior performance. The study also identifies that low-frequency bands (0-1600 Hz) are most critical for model performance across machine types.

## Method Summary
The framework evaluates XAI faithfulness by systematically removing frequency bands from input spectrograms and measuring changes in model predictions to establish a functional ground truth. The DCASE2023 Task 2 dataset (14 machine types, 16kHz audio) is converted to magnitude spectrograms using STFT with Hamming window. Five frequency bands (0-1600, 1600-3200, 3200-4800, 4800-6400, 6400-8000 Hz) are defined, and each band is independently zeroed. The Wilkinghoff et al. FeatEx self-supervised convolutional encoder serves as the ASD backbone. Four XAI methods (Integrated Gradients, Occlusion, Grad-CAM, SmoothGrad) are applied to generate attribution maps. For each sample and band, mean relevance scores are correlated with ΔPrediction using Spearman correlation, with Fisher z-transformation aggregating correlations across samples.

## Key Results
- Occlusion method achieves the highest overall faithfulness correlation (0.884) compared to other methods
- SmoothGrad shows the weakest performance with overall correlation of 0.400
- Low-frequency bands (0-1600 Hz) are most critical for model performance, with removing band 1 reducing AUC from 73.5% to 63%
- High-frequency content (6400-8000 Hz) can introduce detrimental noise, as removing band 5 improves AUC to 76.8%
- Grad-CAM demonstrates highly variable behavior, ranging from strong correlations to negative or insignificant correlations across machine types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Frequency-band perturbation establishes a functional ground truth for spectral importance in ASD models.
- Mechanism: By systematically zeroing specific frequency intervals in spectrograms and retraining/re-evaluating the model, the change in anomaly detection performance directly quantifies how much the model depends on each band. Large performance drops indicate critical bands; minimal changes suggest redundancy.
- Core assumption: The model's dependence on a frequency band for prediction reflects genuine reliance rather than training artefacts or noise correlation.
- Evidence anchors: Removing band 1 (0-1600 Hz) causes AUC to drop from 73.5% to 63%; removing band 5 (6400-8000 Hz) improves AUC to 76.8%.
- Break condition: If frequency bands contain interdependent information, removing one band may affect how the model uses remaining bands.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Spearman correlation between XAI relevance scores and prediction changes quantifies explanation faithfulness.
- Mechanism: For each frequency band, compute mean relevance from an XAI attribution map and the observed prediction change (ΔPred) when that band is removed. Spearman rank correlation (ρs) measures whether bands ranked highly by XAI also produce larger prediction shifts when ablated—without assuming linearity.
- Core assumption: Faithful explanations should rank frequency bands similarly to their actual functional contribution.
- Evidence anchors: Occlusion achieves overall ρ=0.884; SmoothGrad achieves ρ=0.400.
- Break condition: If XAI methods and perturbation analysis share structural biases, correlation may overstate faithfulness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Occlusion-based attribution aligns most closely with functional ground truth because both operate via local input perturbation.
- Mechanism: Occlusion systematically masks input patches and measures output changes—operationally similar to the frequency-band removal used to establish ground truth. This structural similarity yields high correlation even if Occlusion is not inherently more "correct" about model internals.
- Core assumption: The evaluation framework's perturbation approach is an appropriate proxy for true spectral importance.
- Evidence anchors: Grad-CAM shows "highly variable behaviour, ranging from strong correlations to negative or insignificant correlations."
- Break condition: If the functional ground truth itself is flawed, then high correlation with Occlusion may reflect shared methodological bias.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and magnitude spectrograms
  - Why needed here: The ASD model operates on spectrograms; understanding how audio is converted to time-frequency representations is essential for interpreting frequency-band perturbations and attribution maps.
  - Quick check question: Given a 16 kHz audio signal with FFT size 512 and hop size 256, how many time frames result from a 1-second clip, and what is the frequency resolution in Hz?

- Concept: Attribution methods for neural networks (gradient-based vs. perturbation-based)
  - Why needed here: The paper compares four XAI methods with fundamentally different mechanisms; understanding their strengths and limitations is prerequisite to interpreting why Occlusion outperforms gradient-based methods.
  - Quick check question: Why does Integrated Gradients require a baseline input, and how does the choice of baseline (e.g., zero spectrogram vs. noise) affect attribution results?

- Concept: Rank correlation (Spearman) and Fisher z-transformation
  - Why needed here: Faithfulness is quantified via Spearman correlation aggregated across samples; understanding non-parametric correlation and proper averaging of correlation coefficients is necessary to interpret the reported metrics.
  - Quick check question: If three samples yield Spearman correlations of 0.7, 0.5, and 0.9, why is it incorrect to report the mean as 0.7, and what transformation should be applied first?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Audio preprocessing: Raw audio (16 kHz) → STFT → magnitude spectrogram
  2. ASD model: Self-supervised FeatEx convolutional encoder (Wilkinghoff et al.), embedding-based anomaly scoring
  3. XAI methods: Integrated Gradients, Occlusion, Grad-CAM, SmoothGrad applied to spectrograms
  4. Frequency-band perturbation: Five bands (0-1600 Hz, 1600-3200 Hz, 3200-4800 Hz, 4800-6400 Hz, 6400-8000 Hz); each band zeroed independently, model retrained and evaluated
  5. Faithfulness evaluation: Mean relevance per band ↔ ΔPred correlation (Spearman, Fisher z-aggregation)

- Critical path:
  1. Train baseline ASD model on full-spectrum spectrograms
  2. Apply each XAI method to test samples, extract band-level mean relevance
  3. Retrain five perturbed models (one per frequency band removal)
  4. Compute ΔPred for each sample/band combination
  5. Correlate relevance vs. ΔPred per XAI method; aggregate via Fisher z

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Linear frequency bands vs. perceptual scales: 1600 Hz linear bands are analytically simple but may not align with psychoacoustic relevance
  - Occlusion's high correlation may reflect methodological similarity: The paper acknowledges Occlusion is advantaged because the evaluation mirrors its mechanism
  - Computational cost: Occlusion and perturbation-based retraining are expensive; gradient-based methods are faster but show weaker faithfulness

- Failure signatures:
  - Negative or near-zero correlation (e.g., Grad-CAM on bearing: ρ=-0.054) indicates XAI method highlights bands irrelevant or counter to model behaviour
  - High variance across machine types (e.g., Grad-CAM ranging from -0.253 to 0.922) suggests method is unstable or architecture-dependent
  - Performance improvement from band removal (e.g., band 5 removal improving Dev AUC to 76.8%) signals that high-frequency content may be introducing noise or spurious cues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline correlations: Implement the framework on a single machine type using publicly available DCASE2023 Task 2 data; verify Occlusion achieves highest Spearman correlation
  2. Ablate perturbation band granularity: Test whether narrower bands (e.g., 800 Hz width) or overlapping bands change faithfulness rankings
  3. Test on alternative architecture: Apply the framework to a transformer-based ASD model to assess whether faithfulness rankings are architecture-dependent

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Does incorporating perceptually-motivated frequency scales (Bark or ERB) improve the alignment between XAI explanations and domain expert interpretation in industrial machine sound diagnostics?
  - Basis in paper: The authors state that integrating psychoacoustic principles such as Bark or ERB scaling "may yield explanations that better align with how domain experts reason about sound" and that this "could be especially valuable in industrial settings where human operators must interpret model behaviour in conjunction with their own diagnostic expertise."
  - Why unresolved: The current framework uses linear frequency bands rather than perceptually informed scales, limiting its applicability to human-centred diagnostic workflows.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating XAI faithfulness using Bark/ERB-scaled frequency bands versus linear bands, combined with domain expert evaluation of explanation interpretability.

- **Open Question 2**: How does the faithfulness of different XAI methods change when applied to transformer-based or diffusion-based ASD architectures compared to the convolutional encoder evaluated in this study?
  - Basis in paper: The authors note that "As ASD models increasingly shift toward transformer-based or diffusion-based architectures with richer attention mechanisms, it will be necessary to revisit how XAI methods behave under these new paradigms and whether perturbation-based faithfulness evaluations require adaptation."
  - Why unresolved: The study evaluated only a single convolutional architecture, and XAI method performance may not generalize to architectures with different internal representations and attention mechanisms.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Applying the same faithfulness evaluation framework to transformer-based and diffusion-based ASD models trained on the DCASE2023 Task 2 dataset.

- **Open Question 3**: Can XAI explanations be validated against known physical fault signatures (harmonics, sidebands, modulation patterns) to verify that models rely on physically meaningful acoustic cues rather than spurious correlations?
  - Basis in paper: The authors state that "Aligning attribution maps with known fault signatures such as harmonics, sidebands, or modulation patterns could improve the practical usefulness of XAI for maintenance engineers and acoustic diagnosticians."
  - Why unresolved: The current framework validates faithfulness through perturbation-based prediction changes but does not assess whether the detected spectral cues correspond to physically interpretable fault mechanisms.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A study correlating XAI-attributed frequency bands with expert-annotated fault signatures across a dataset containing labeled mechanical faults.

## Limitations

- **Ground Truth Validity**: The perturbation-based functional ground truth assumes frequency bands are independent, but if bands contain interdependent spectral information, the interpretation of "importance" may conflate true causal reliance with indirect effects.
- **Methodological Similarity Bias**: Occlusion's superior correlation may partly reflect its structural similarity to the perturbation evaluation itself, rather than inherent faithfulness, raising questions about whether high correlation measures genuine alignment with model internals.
- **Architecture Dependency**: Results are based on a single self-supervised FeatEx convolutional architecture, and the high variance in Grad-CAM performance across machine types suggests method faithfulness may be architecture-dependent.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The quantitative framework for evaluating XAI faithfulness is sound and reproducible. The correlation-based approach is methodologically rigorous and addresses a genuine gap in ASD XAI evaluation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific faithfulness rankings (Occlusion > Integrated Gradients > Grad-CAM > SmoothGrad) are likely correct for the tested architecture, but may not generalize to other model families without further validation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The finding that low-frequency bands (0-1600 Hz) are most critical for model performance is supported by the data, but the functional interpretation (critical for decision-making vs. correlated with training distribution) requires additional causal validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Test Generalization Across Architectures**: Apply the framework to a transformer-based ASD model and alternative convolutional architectures to determine whether faithfulness rankings are architecture-dependent or generalizable.

2. **Validate Perceptual Frequency Binning**: Re-run the evaluation using psychoacoustic scales (Bark or ERB bands) instead of linear 1600 Hz bands to assess whether the ground truth and faithfulness rankings change meaningfully.

3. **Causal Attribution Analysis**: Perform controlled experiments where critical frequency bands are selectively amplified vs. removed to distinguish between correlation-based and causal importance in the model's decision-making.
