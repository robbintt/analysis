## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07412
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07412
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of operating rooms enabling centimeter-level accurate embodied AI simulation with zero-shot transfer of vision foundation models.

## Executive Summary
TwinOR addresses the challenge of developing embodied AI for intelligent surgical systems by creating photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of operating rooms. The method reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. These components are fused into an immersive 3D environment supporting controllable simulation and embodied exploration. Experimental results show centimeter-level geometric accuracy and photorealistic visual fidelity. For geometric perception, FoundationStereo achieved EPE of 0.378 px and Bad-2px of 1.5% on synthetic OR data. For visual localization, ORB-SLAM3 achieved ATE of 0.12 m and RPE of 0.066 m on OR-A sequences. These results demonstrate sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization tasks, validating TwinOR as a reliable platform for developing and benchmarking embodied AI in surgical environments.

## Method Summary
TwinOR reconstructs static OR geometry using Neuralangelo from handheld pre-scan videos (~20 minutes per room), producing textured meshes simplified to 20k-40k faces. Dynamic elements—humans and equipment—are captured via a 4-camera ZED-X stereo rig synchronized with PTP. Humans are detected with a fine-tuned detector, keypointed with ViTPose+, triangulated across views, and fitted with SMPL parameters via EasyMocap. Equipment is segmented with SAM2, back-projected via stereo, and aligned to CAD models using FPFH matching and color ICP refinement. The fused assets are imported into Blender, rendered to produce synthetic RGB-D streams with known ground truth for training and evaluating embodied AI models.

## Key Results
- TwinOR achieved mean chamfer distances of 14.1 mm (OR-A) and 22.7 mm (OR-B), corresponding to centimeter-level spatial accuracy.
- FoundationStereo achieved EPE of 0.378 px and Bad-2px of 1.5% on synthetic OR data, matching real-world indoor benchmarks.
- ORB-SLAM3 achieved ATE of 0.12 m and RPE of 0.066 m on OR-A sequences, confirming sensor-level realism for localization tasks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Neural surface reconstruction from casual handheld video produces centimeter-accurate static geometry suitable for simulation.
- **Mechanism:** Neuralangelo recovers dense implicit neural surfaces from RGB pre-scan videos (~20 minutes for rooms, ~2 minutes for equipment). These neural fields are then converted to textured meshes via surface extraction and texture baking, enabling efficient rendering while preserving geometric fidelity.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-scan video provides sufficient multi-view coverage, and surfaces are not dominated by severe reflectivity or texturelessness that would cause reconstruction artifacts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 2.3]: "Reconstruction required approximately 40–50 hours per room on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 GPU... resulting meshes were simplified to 20k–40k faces and textured at 2K resolution."
  - [section 3.2]: "TwinOR achieved mean chamfer distances of 14.1 mm (OR-A) and 22.7 mm (OR-B), corresponding to centimeter-level spatial accuracy."
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus support for this specific reconstruction pipeline; neighbor papers focus on Gaussian splatting alternatives rather than Neuralangelo-based approaches.
- **Break condition:** Incomplete spatial coverage during scanning produces geometric holes; aggressive mesh decimation below stated thresholds degrades visual fidelity below perception thresholds.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Multi-view triangulation combined with parametric model fitting enables accurate 3D human and equipment pose estimation in cluttered OR environments.
- **Mechanism:** A top-down pipeline first detects humans via fine-tuned detectors, estimates 2D keypoints with ViTPose+, triangulates across calibrated views for 3D joint locations, then fits SMPL parameters through multi-stage optimization enforcing temporal smoothness. Equipment poses follow a similar pattern: SAM2 segmentation, stereo back-projection, and CAD model alignment via FPFH matching + color ICP refinement.
- **Core assumption:** The four-camera setup provides sufficient overlapping coverage, sub-millisecond synchronization is maintained via PTP, and reprojection errors remain below ~0.5 px.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 2.2]: "Temporal alignment across all devices was hardware-maintained via Precision Time Protocol, achieving sub-millisecond synchronization... mean reprojection error of multi-camera calibration was 0.44 px for OR-A."
  - [section 3.2]: "TwinOR achieved a mean 3D Percentage of Correct Parts (PCP3D@0.5) of 98.34%, and a Mean Per Joint Position Errors (MPJPE) of 3.52 cm... equipment achieved mean translational and rotational errors of 9.12 cm and 4.57°."
  - [corpus]: Neighbor paper "RoHan: Robust Hand Detection in Operation Room" addresses related detection challenges in OR settings, suggesting domain transfer remains non-trivial.
- **Break condition:** Severe occlusion (>50% of body parts) or rapid motion causing tracking failures; equipment without pre-existing CAD models cannot be pose-estimated.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The fused digital twin environment renders sensor-realistic outputs that allow zero-shot transfer of vision foundation models without domain adaptation.
- **Mechanism:** Blender-based rendering of the combined static mesh and dynamic human/equipment assets produces RGB-D streams with known ground-truth poses. The photometric consistency (SSIM 0.72–0.82 after mesh conversion) and geometric accuracy preserve the visual features that pre-trained models like FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 rely on.
- **Core assumption:** The texture baking from neural fields to meshes retains sufficient photometric detail for feature extraction; temporal coherence is maintained across dynamic sequences.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets."
  - [section 3.3–3.4]: "FoundationStereo achieved EPE of 0.378 px and Bad-2px of 1.5%... ORB-SLAM3 achieved ATE of 0.12 m and RPE of 0.066 m... These values fall within the typical error range reported for real-world indoor SLAM benchmarks."
  - [corpus]: "GS-SDF" paper notes Gaussian splatting struggles with geometric consistency, suggesting alternative representations face different tradeoffs.
- **Break condition:** If dynamic objects move outside the calibrated camera volume, pose estimation degrades; small/deformable objects (fingers, tools, tissue) are not modeled and break fine-grained interaction realism.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Neural Surface Reconstruction (NeRF/Neuralangelo)**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how implicit neural representations convert to explicit meshes informs expectations about reconstruction time, quality tradeoffs, and failure modes.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why neural fields require surface extraction before use in physics engines?

- **Concept: Multi-view Geometry and Triangulation**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire dynamic perception pipeline depends on calibrated camera extrinsics and triangulation accuracy.
  - **Quick check question:** Given 4 cameras with 0.5 px reprojection error, what is the theoretical 3D uncertainty at 3 meters depth?

- **Concept: Parametric Body Models (SMPL)**
  - **Why needed here:** Human pose estimation outputs SMPL parameters, not raw keypoints; understanding this representation is essential for downstream use.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the three types of parameters in SMPL, and which one captures body shape variation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** [Pre-scan Video] → Neuralangelo → [Static Mesh + Textures] → [Multi-view RGB Cameras] → 2D Detection → Triangulation → [SMPL Params / 6-DoF Poses] → [Blender Environment] ← Ground-truth Pose Export → [Synthetic RGB-D Streams] → Vision Models (FoundationStereo, ORB-SLAM3)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Calibrate multi-camera rig (wand-based, sub-pixel reprojection required)
  2. Capture and process pre-scan videos (40–50 hours GPU compute per room)
  3. Validate dynamic perception on sample sequences before full workflow capture
  4. Import assets into Blender and verify rendering output matches real images (SSIM > 0.7)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Neural fields vs. textured meshes: Neural provides higher fidelity (SSIM 0.90 vs. 0.72) but cannot render in real-time; mesh conversion is mandatory for simulation.
  - Offline vs. real-time perception: Current pipeline is offline; real-time would require perception model optimization and potential accuracy loss.
  - Equipment pre-scanning: Every movable object needs a pre-scanned model; ad-hoc items cannot be integrated.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Black/missing geometry patches → insufficient pre-scan coverage
  - Human pose jitter/teleportation → triangulation failure due to occlusion; check multi-view visibility
  - Equipment pose drift → ICP convergence to wrong local minimum; verify initial RANSAC alignment
  - SLAM tracking loss in simulation → texture degradation from mesh decimation; increase texture resolution

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Calibration validation:** Verify wand-based calibration achieves <0.5 px mean reprojection error before any dynamic capture.
  2. **Static reconstruction sanity check:** Render novel views from the reconstructed mesh and compute SSIM against held-out real images; target >0.70.
  3. **Zero-shot perception test:** Run FoundationStereo on 100 synthetic stereo pairs; confirm EPE <0.5 px as proxy for sensor-level realism before committing to larger experiments.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the framework be extended to model fine-grained interactions, such as finger-level manipulation or tool–tissue contact?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "The current system lacks fine-grained modeling of small, deformable, or articulated objects... Detailed interactions, such as finger-level manipulation or tool–tissue contact, are not yet represented."
- **Why unresolved:** The current pipeline relies on pre-scanned assets and rigid-body pose estimation (SMPL, ICP), which cannot capture high-frequency deformations or articulate unmodeled tools.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Integrating deformable body physics or real-time novel view synthesis of hands/tools that preserves geometric fidelity during manipulation tasks.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can embodied AI policies trained within TwinOR successfully transfer to physical robots in real operating rooms?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper validates perception/localization realism (FoundationStereo, ORB-SLAM3) and claims the platform enables "embodied policy learning," but does not demonstrate actual sim-to-real transfer of control policies.
- **Why unresolved:** Visual fidelity does not guarantee that control policies learned in simulation will handle the dynamics, latency, or noise of physical hardware.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study benchmarking a robot trained in TwinOR to perform a physical task (e.g., instrument handover) in a real OR environment.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can real-time perception be achieved to enable closed-loop interaction within the digital twin?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note, "All reconstruction and perception processes were performed offline," and suggest "Extending the framework with... real-time perception" as a future direction.
- **Why unresolved:** The current computational cost (e.g., 40–50 hours for reconstruction, offline optimization for SMPL) prevents the system from serving as a live, reactive mirror for real-time robotic control.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation of a streamlined pipeline capable of updating the dynamic state of the digital twin at frequencies sufficient for closed-loop robot control (e.g., >10 Hz).

## Limitations
- The current system cannot model fine-grained interactions such as finger-level manipulation or tool-tissue contact due to reliance on pre-scanned rigid assets and SMPL parameterization.
- Offline computational requirements (40–50 hours per room for reconstruction, offline SMPL fitting) prevent real-time closed-loop interaction.
- Generalizability to new OR environments is uncertain, as the pipeline has only been validated on two specific rooms with domain-specific customizations.

## Confidence
- **Neural surface reconstruction accuracy (centimeter-level):** High confidence
- **Multi-view human/equipment pose estimation (98.34% PCP3D@0.5, 9.12 cm equipment translation):** High confidence
- **Zero-shot transfer of vision foundation models:** Medium confidence (based on benchmark alignment rather than real-to-sim transfer)
- **Real-time simulation capability:** Low confidence (no real-time performance data provided)

## Next Checks
1. **Calibration robustness test:** Measure 3D triangulation error at various depths and view configurations to verify the claimed 0.44 px reprojection error translates to acceptable 3D uncertainty (target: <2 cm at 3 m depth).

2. **Cross-environment generalization:** Apply the complete pipeline to a new OR environment not in the original dataset; measure geometric and pose estimation accuracy to assess scalability beyond the two original rooms.

3. **Real-to-synthetic domain transfer:** Evaluate a subset of TwinOR-synthesized data on a real OR dataset using FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 to directly measure zero-shot transfer performance rather than relying on benchmark alignment.
