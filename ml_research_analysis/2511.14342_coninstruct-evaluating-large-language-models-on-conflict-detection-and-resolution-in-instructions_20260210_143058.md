# ConInstruct: Evaluating Large Language Models on Conflict Detection and Resolution in Instructions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.14342
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14342
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proprietary LLMs achieve strong conflict detection (up to 91.5% F1-score for DeepSeek-R1) but rarely notify users of conflicts or seek clarification (only 36% of the time for Claude-4.5-Sonnet)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ConInstruct, a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models' ability to detect and resolve conflicting constraints within instructions. The authors constructed a dataset covering six NLP tasks and six constraint types, introducing diverse intra- and inter-constraint conflicts. Experiments showed that proprietary LLMs, especially Claude models, achieve strong conflict detection (up to 91.5% F1-score for DeepSeek-R1 and 87.3% for Claude-4.5-Sonnet), while most open-source models struggle except for DeepSeek-R1. However, despite good detection, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users of conflicts or seek clarification—only 36% of the time for Claude-4.5-Sonnet. The findings highlight a gap in conflict-aware instruction-following and suggest a need for future improvements.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed ConInstruct by generating instruction sets with conflicting constraints using rule-based methods across six NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, machine translation, question answering, text summarization, text simplification, and text classification). They introduced six types of constraints: length (L), format (F), content (C), domain (D), perspective (P), and style (S). The benchmark evaluates both detection (identifying whether constraints conflict) and resolution (modifying instructions to resolve conflicts) capabilities. Evaluation metrics include F1-score for detection and various conflict resolution metrics including perplexity-based measures and oracle constraint comparisons.

## Key Results
- Proprietary LLMs achieve high conflict detection performance (91.5% F1-score for DeepSeek-R1, 87.3% for Claude-4.5-Sonnet)
- Open-source models generally struggle with conflict detection except for DeepSeek-R1
- Despite strong detection, LLMs rarely notify users of conflicts (only 36% for Claude-4.5-Sonnet)
- Conflict resolution capabilities remain limited across all models tested

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to generating controlled conflict scenarios across multiple constraint types and tasks, allowing for rigorous evaluation of model capabilities in a standardized framework.

## Foundational Learning
- Conflict detection metrics (F1-score, precision, recall) - why needed: To quantify model ability to identify conflicting constraints; quick check: Compare detection rates across constraint types
- Constraint classification (length, format, content, domain, perspective, style) - why needed: To systematically categorize different types of potential conflicts; quick check: Validate constraint boundaries through human annotation
- Perplexity-based evaluation - why needed: To measure naturalness and coherence of conflict resolution outputs; quick check: Compare perplexity scores across different resolution strategies

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Rule-based generation -> Conflict injection -> Instruction-Constraint pairs -> Model inference -> Detection/Resolution evaluation

### Critical Path
1. Generate base instructions for six NLP tasks
2. Apply constraint generation rules to create conflicting pairs
3. Input to LLMs for conflict detection and resolution
4. Evaluate outputs using F1-score and resolution metrics

### Design Tradeoffs
- Rule-based generation ensures controlled experiments but may lack real-world complexity
- Focus on six constraint types provides structure but may miss other conflict categories
- Oracle constraints enable evaluation but may not reflect user preferences

### Failure Signatures
- High detection but low notification rates indicates models identify conflicts but fail to communicate them
- Low performance on specific constraint types suggests domain-specific weaknesses
- Large gaps between open-source and proprietary models highlight data/scale advantages

### First Experiments
1. Test model performance on single-constraint vs multi-constraint scenarios
2. Evaluate detection accuracy across different constraint type combinations
3. Compare resolution quality when models are explicitly prompted to seek clarification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Rule-based generation may not capture real-world complexity of conflicting instructions
- Benchmark focuses on six specific constraint types and six NLP tasks, limiting generalizability
- Evaluation relies on perplexity-based metrics and oracle constraints that may not align with natural user interactions

## Confidence
- Detection performance claims: Medium (well-supported by metrics but influenced by benchmark construction)
- Conflict notification rates: Medium (supported by quantitative data but may not reflect all interaction scenarios)
- Open-source model performance gap: Medium (valid observation but methodology-dependent)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with human annotators to validate that generated conflicting instructions reflect realistic scenarios and that evaluation metrics align with human judgment
2. Expand the benchmark to include additional constraint types and real-world instruction examples from diverse domains beyond the six NLP tasks
3. Test model performance on instructions with multi-turn dialogues and contextual dependencies to assess generalization to complex interaction scenarios
