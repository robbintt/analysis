# Comparative Analysis of FOLD-SE vs. FOLD-R++ in Binary Classification and XGBoost in Multi-Category Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.18139
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18139
- Reference count: 21
- This study shows FOLD-SE can outperform both rule-based (FOLD-R++) and black-box (XGBoost) models in accuracy while generating far fewer, more interpretable rules.

## Executive Summary
This study compares FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++ in binary classification and FOLD-SE with XGBoost in multi-category classification. FOLD-SE demonstrated equal or better accuracy than FOLD-R++ while generating significantly fewer rules, improving interpretability. In multi-category classification, FOLD-SE outperformed XGBoost in both accuracy and processing time across all datasets tested, achieving complete accuracy on two datasets where XGBoost could not. The model also produced compact, interpretable rule sets. These findings challenge the traditional accuracy-explainability tradeoff, showing that rule-based models like FOLD-SE can simultaneously improve accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. FOLD-SE proves to be a viable alternative to black-box models, especially in high-stakes domains requiring transparent decision-making.

## Method Summary
The study compared FOLD-SE against FOLD-R++ for binary classification and against XGBoost for multi-category classification. Binary datasets (8 total) were obtained from the FOLD-R++ GitHub repository, while multiclass datasets (7 total) came from Kaggle and UCI repositories. FOLD-R++ was run locally on a MacBook Air M2, FOLD-SE via a web API with default hyperparameters, and XGBoost via Google Colab with 80/20 train-test split and 5-fold grid search CV. The study measured accuracy, F1 score, processing time (in milliseconds), and number of base/exception rules for interpretability assessment.

## Key Results
- FOLD-SE achieved equal or better accuracy than FOLD-R++ in binary classification while generating 2-13 rules versus FOLD-R++'s 5-13 base rules plus additional exception rules
- FOLD-SE outperformed XGBoost in multiclass classification on all 7 datasets, achieving 100% accuracy on two datasets where XGBoost failed
- FOLD-SE processing time was consistently lower than XGBoost across all multiclass datasets tested
- FOLD-SE generated compact rule sets (3-6 rules) compared to FOLD-R++'s more extensive rule bases, improving interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Rule Condensation Through Generalization
FOLD-SE generates significantly fewer rules than FOLD-R++ while maintaining comparable or superior accuracy by identifying more generalizable decision boundaries. The algorithm consolidates decision logic into broader rules that cover more instances, rather than creating numerous specific rules for edge cases. For example, on the Adult dataset, FOLD-SE produced 2 rules versus FOLD-R++'s 13 rules (5 base + 8 exception), while achieving nearly identical accuracy (84.7% vs 84.1%).

### Mechanism 2: s(CASP) Answer Set Programming Integration
FOLD-SE's foundation in s(CASP) enables rule-based classification through logical predicate satisfaction rather than gradient-based optimization. s(CASP) provides constraint solving and answer set computation, allowing FOLD-SE to express classification decisions as logical rules with interpretable conditions (e.g., `label(X,'<=50K') :- marital-status(X,'Married-civ-spouse'), capital-gain(X,N1), N1=<5013.0`).

### Mechanism 3: Hierarchical Rule Structure (Base + Exceptions)
FOLD-SE employs a two-tier rule structure—base rules and exception rules—that balances compactness with precision. Base rules capture primary decision patterns, while exception rules handle cases that deviate from the general pattern. This allows the model to maintain accuracy without proliferating base rules.

## Foundational Learning

- **Answer Set Programming (ASP) and s(CASP)**: FOLD-SE is built on s(CASP); understanding its declarative logic programming paradigm is essential to comprehend how rules are generated and how predictions are derived. *Quick check: Can you explain how s(CASP) differs from Prolog in handling negation and constraint solving?*

- **The Accuracy-Explainability Tradeoff (Traditional View)**: The paper explicitly positions itself as challenging this tradeoff; understanding the baseline assumption helps contextualize why the results matter. *Quick check: Why do ensemble methods like XGBoost and neural networks typically sacrifice interpretability for accuracy?*

- **Rule-Based Classification and Decision Boundaries**: FOLD-SE's output is a set of human-readable rules; understanding how rules partition feature space clarifies how predictions are made. *Quick check: How would a rule like `label(X,'<=50K') :- capital-gain(X,N1), N1=<6849.0` partition the feature space?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - s(CASP) Engine -> FOLD-SE Algorithm -> Rule Generator -> Prediction Module -> FOLD-SE Web API / Local Implementation

- **Critical path**:
  1. Preprocess data (CSV format, feature naming, ID column)
  2. Submit to FOLD-SE (via web API or local implementation)
  3. Set hyperparameters (train-test ratio, exception level, tail ratio—defaults used in study)
  4. Rule induction generates base rules + exception rules
  5. Evaluate on test set; retrieve accuracy, F1, and rule set
  6. Inspect rules for interpretability and domain validity

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Rule compactness vs. precision: Fewer rules improve interpretability but may underfit complex patterns
  - Processing time vs. rule complexity: FOLD-SE was slower than FOLD-R++ on 6/8 binary datasets (~50% slower), suggesting rule condensation has computational overhead
  - Default hyperparameters vs. tuning: The study used default hyperparameters; performance on custom configurations is unknown
  - Platform variability: FOLD-R++ ran locally (MacBook Air M2), FOLD-SE via web API, XGBoost on Google Colab—processing times are not directly comparable

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Rule explosion: If exception rules proliferate (high exception counts in output), the dataset may be poorly suited for rule-based approaches
  - Accuracy drop on binary classification: While generally comparable, FOLD-SE underperformed FOLD-R++ on Autism (84.4% vs 93.6%)—watch for similar patterns on imbalanced or highly specific datasets
  - Processing time blowout: If training time significantly exceeds baseline, consider dataset size or feature dimensionality reduction

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce one binary dataset comparison: Load the Adult or Kidney dataset, run both FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++ with identical train-test splits, and verify rule counts and accuracy match reported values
  2. Reproduce one multiclass comparison: Load the Iris or Wine dataset, train FOLD-SE and XGBoost with the same 80/20 split, compare accuracy, F1, and rule interpretability
  3. Stress test on a high-dimensional dataset: Apply FOLD-SE to a dataset with >50 features (e.g., from UCI or Kaggle) to observe rule count scaling and processing time, comparing against the paper's low-dimensional results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Cross-platform timing validation**: Does the processing time advantage of FOLD-SE over XGBoost and FOLD-R++ persist when benchmarked on strictly uniform computational hardware? The experiments ran FOLD-R++ locally (MacBook), XGBoost on Google Colab (GPU), and FOLD-SE via a Web API, making direct time comparisons potentially biased by infrastructure differences.

- **Real-world data performance**: How does FOLD-SE perform in practical settings with unorganized or noisy data compared to the clean datasets used in this study? The study utilized cleaned datasets from repositories (Kaggle, UCI), which may not represent the noise and inconsistencies found in real-world industrial data.

- **Hybrid approaches**: Can hybrid approaches integrating FOLD-SE with other machine learning techniques improve performance on complex classification tasks? The current study only evaluated FOLD-SE as a standalone classifier against XGBoost and FOLD-R++, without testing ensemble or hybrid configurations.

## Limitations

- The study used different execution environments for different models (FOLD-R++ local, FOLD-SE via web API, XGBoost on Colab), introducing platform-dependent timing variability that may affect processing time comparisons
- Only binary and low-dimensional multiclass datasets were tested, leaving performance on high-dimensional or regression tasks unknown
- The FOLD-SE web API availability and potential format changes since paper submission may affect reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: FOLD-SE's superior accuracy and interpretability on multiclass datasets (accuracy of 100% on two datasets, rule count of 3-6 rules vs XGBoost's black-box)
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about accuracy-explainability tradeoff challenge are valid but limited by narrow dataset scope and execution environment differences
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to high-dimensional datasets and processing time comparisons due to platform variability and lack of hyperparameter tuning

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-platform timing validation**: Run FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++ on identical hardware with controlled timing measurements to verify reported speed differences
2. **High-dimensional stress test**: Apply FOLD-SE to a dataset with >50 features to assess rule count scaling and identify potential rule explosion failure modes
3. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary FOLD-SE's exception level and tail ratio parameters to determine optimal configurations for different dataset types
