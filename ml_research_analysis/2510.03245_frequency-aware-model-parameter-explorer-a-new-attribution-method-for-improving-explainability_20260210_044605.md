core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of improving explainability
  in deep neural networks (DNNs) by introducing a novel attribution method called
  Frequency-Aware Model Parameter Explorer (FAMPE). The core method leverages a new
  class of transferable adversarial attacks, termed transferable frequency-aware attacks,
  which explore both high- and low-frequency components of input data to generate
  robust adversarial samples.

# Frequency-Aware Model Parameter Explorer: A new attribution method for improving explainability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.03245
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03245
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: 13.02% average improvement in Insertion Score over AttEXplore across multiple architectures

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FAMPE, a novel attribution method for improving explainability in deep neural networks by leveraging transferable frequency-aware adversarial attacks. The method explores both high- and low-frequency components of input data to generate robust adversarial samples, enhancing attribution map precision. FAMPE demonstrates significant performance gains over existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly on image classification tasks, with consistent improvements across multiple architectures.

## Method Summary
FAMPE employs a novel class of transferable adversarial attacks called transferable frequency-aware attacks to explore frequency components in input data. By modulating noise through a tunable parameter α, the method generates adversarial samples that enhance attribution map quality. The approach integrates frequency analysis with model parameter exploration to produce more precise and interpretable explanations of DNN decisions.

## Key Results
- Achieves 13.02% average improvement in Insertion Score over AttEXplore
- Attains 0.4802 Insertion Score and 0.0595 Deletion Score on Inception-v3
- Reaches 0.5744 Insertion Score and 0.1015 Deletion Score on MaxViT-T
- Ablation studies show optimal performance with α < 0.4 for high-frequency exploration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FAMPE's effectiveness stems from its ability to modulate adversarial noise across different frequency components, allowing for more comprehensive exploration of model decision boundaries. By focusing on high-frequency components (α < 0.4), the method captures subtle yet critical features that traditional attribution methods might miss. The transferable nature of the attacks ensures robustness across different models and datasets, while the frequency-aware modulation prevents over-reliance on low-frequency patterns that can obscure important decision-making features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Frequency domain analysis**: Understanding how signal components at different frequencies contribute to model decisions is crucial for targeted exploration. Quick check: Verify frequency decomposition produces expected energy distribution across bands.
- **Adversarial attack transferability**: Knowledge of how adversarial perturbations generalize across models enables robust attribution. Quick check: Test attack effectiveness across architectures.
- **Insertion/Deletion metrics**: These evaluation metrics quantify attribution quality by measuring how perturbations affect model performance. Quick check: Ensure consistent metric computation across experiments.
- **Model parameter sensitivity**: Understanding how model parameters respond to different inputs guides effective exploration strategies. Quick check: Validate sensitivity analysis captures meaningful parameter variations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input -> Frequency decomposition -> Noise modulation (α) -> Adversarial generation -> Model evaluation -> Attribution map

**Critical path**: Frequency decomposition → Noise modulation → Adversarial generation → Attribution computation

**Design tradeoffs**: The tunable α parameter balances high-frequency exploration against computational efficiency, with lower values improving attribution quality but potentially increasing processing time.

**Failure signatures**: Poor attribution quality when α > 0.9 indicates over-reliance on low-frequency components; degraded performance on non-image modalities suggests limited generalizability.

**First experiments**:
1. Test baseline attribution performance across α ∈ [0, 1] to establish optimal frequency balance
2. Compare FAMPE against traditional methods (Grad-CAM, LIME) on simple binary classification tasks
3. Evaluate transferability by applying FAMPE-generated attributions across different model architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Performance validation limited to synthetic benchmarks without real-world deployment testing
- No computational overhead analysis compared to baseline methods
- Security implications of frequency-aware attacks remain unexplored

## Confidence
- Performance improvement claims: High
- Ablation study findings: Medium

- Security implications: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing with confidence intervals across multiple random seeds for all reported metrics
2. Test FAMPE on non-image domains (text, tabular data) to verify cross-modal applicability
3. Measure computational overhead (runtime, memory) compared to baseline attribution methods under identical hardware conditions
