# Real, Fake, or Manipulated? Detecting Machine-Influenced Text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.15350
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15350
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: HERO outperforms state-of-the-art by 2.5-3 mAP on average for fine-grained machine-influenced text detection

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting fine-grained categories of machine-influenced text, extending beyond binary human-vs-machine classification to include machine-generated, machine-paraphrased, machine-humanized, and machine-translated text from multiple source languages. The authors introduce HERO, a hierarchical detector that uses length-specialist models and Subcategory Guidance modules to improve discrimination between similar fine-grained categories without increasing test-time computational cost. Extensive experiments across five LLMs and six domains show HERO outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.5-3 mAP on average, with especially strong performance on out-of-domain generators and on identifying translated text from different source languages.

## Method Summary
HERO uses a DistilBERT backbone with length-specialist models (128/256/512 tokens) and Subcategory Guidance modules. During training, separate loss functions are computed over subsampled logits for related categories (e.g., all translation subcategories) to encourage separation. Length cropping with probability p_crop provides robustness to varying input lengths. The final loss combines main cross-entropy with auxiliary losses weighted by λ=0.01. At inference, experts can be ensembled or selected by closest length. Data is generated using Llama-3 and other LLMs across eight categories including human-written, machine-generated, paraphrased, humanized, and translated text from Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and French.

## Key Results
- HERO achieves 2.5-3 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art across five LLMs
- Length-specialist models show consistent performance gains across all tested token lengths
- Training with explicit language-specific translation subcategories improves overall translation detection by ~3 mAP
- HERO maintains advantage even when subcategories are collapsed to binary classes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Subcategory Guidance modules
The Subcategory Guidance module encourages separation of semantically similar text categories without increasing inference cost. During training, separate loss functions are computed over subsampled logits from only related categories, forcing the shared encoder to learn features that separate similar classes. The guidance modules are discarded at test time.

### Mechanism 2: Length-specialist models
Length-specialist models address information asymmetry between short and long documents by training experts optimized for specific maximum token lengths. Each expert learns to detect signals from limited context, with length cropping during training providing robustness. This is critical because short documents have inherently weaker authorship signals.

### Mechanism 3: Translation language-specific training
Training with explicit language-specific translation subcategories improves overall translation detection. Including source language labels forces the model to learn translation-specific artifacts rather than relying on spurious correlations, yielding better translation vs. non-translation discrimination when aggregated at inference.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-class classification with imbalanced/hierarchical labels:** FG-MGT has 8 categories with varying similarity and potential class imbalance. Quick check: Can you explain why cross-entropy alone might fail when two classes share most features?

- **Auxiliary loss functions for representation learning:** Subcategory Guidance is an auxiliary loss that shapes features without changing inference. Quick check: How does adding a loss term on a subset of logits differ from training a separate classifier?

- **Mixture-of-experts / ensemble strategies:** Length specialists can be combined or selected at inference based on input properties. Quick check: What are the tradeoffs between selecting one expert vs. averaging all experts at test time?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Shared encoder (DistilBERT) → Main classifier head (8-class) → Subcategory Guidance heads (2-class generated vs humanized, 4-class translation languages) → Length expert wrapper (M copies with different max lengths)

- **Critical path:** Input text → tokenize (max 512 tokens) → route to length expert(s) based on token count → forward pass through encoder + classifier + applicable guidance heads → aggregate losses, backprop → at inference: ensemble or select expert, aggregate logits

- **Design tradeoffs:** More experts provide better length coverage but increase memory/training time; higher λ strengthens separation but risks over-regularization (optimal λ=0.01); ensemble is more robust but slower than selection

- **Failure signatures:** Confusion between generated and humanized text; sharp performance drop on out-of-domain generators; poor performance on very short texts (<50 tokens)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce Tab. 4 ablation: baseline DistilBERT, add Subcategory Guidance, add length specialists; 2) Vary λ on validation set to confirm 0.01 is optimal; 3) Train on Llama-3 only, evaluate on Qwen-1.5/ChatGLM-3 to measure out-of-domain degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How can the performance gap between in-domain and out-of-domain generators be effectively minimized without requiring retraining on specific new LLMs?

2. Does the round-trip translation data generation strategy introduce artifacts that artificially inflate detection performance compared to human translation or standard one-way machine translation?

3. To what extent can fine-grained detection accuracy be maintained for extremely short texts (e.g., <50 tokens) where information content is minimal?

4. Do the fine-grained production categories (e.g., machine-polished vs. machine-generated) map reliably to user intent (benign vs. malicious) in real-world scenarios?

## Limitations
- Performance gap remains between in-domain and out-of-domain generators
- Round-trip translation strategy may introduce detection artifacts
- Significant performance drop for very short texts (<50 tokens)
- No validation of production method vs. actual malicious intent correlation

## Confidence
- Subcategory Guidance mechanism: Medium (ablation shows improvement but mechanism relies on auxiliary losses)
- Length-specialist models: High (consistent performance gains across domains)
- Translation language training benefit: Medium (strong in-domain results but lacks external validation)
- State-of-the-art superiority: High (multiple baselines outperformed across five LLMs)

## Next Checks
1. Train HERO on Llama-3 data and evaluate on unseen LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) to measure domain shift impact and compare mAP drop to baseline models

2. Systematically vary λ ∈ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5} on a held-out validation set to confirm the optimal value (0.01) and test for over-regularization at higher values

3. Create a test set of high-quality human-written text that intentionally mimics machine-generated patterns and measure HERO's false positive rate to check for reliance on superficial cues
