# Intelligent Scientific Literature Explorer using Machine Learning (ISLE)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12760
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12760
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: End-to-end scientific literature exploration system combining hybrid retrieval, topic modeling, and dynamic knowledge graph construction

## Executive Summary
ISLE is a machine learning-based scientific literature explorer that addresses the limitations of existing literature review tools by providing an integrated platform for hybrid document retrieval, query-conditioned topic modeling, and dynamic knowledge graph construction. The system combines BM25 lexical search with semantic embedding search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion, applies topic modeling on retrieved results using either BERTopic or NMF depending on computational resources, and constructs interpretable knowledge graphs linking papers, authors, institutions, countries, and topics. The architecture is evaluated through a qualitative case study on machine translation literature, demonstrating its capability to provide comprehensive analytics and structured exploration of scientific corpora.

## Method Summary
ISLE implements an end-to-end scientific literature exploration pipeline that integrates hybrid retrieval, topic modeling, and knowledge graph construction. The system uses PostgreSQL for structured storage of papers, authors, and citations, while Elasticsearch handles the hybrid search index with dense vector embeddings. Retrieval combines BM25 lexical search with k-NN semantic search using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings, fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60). Topic modeling is applied to retrieved documents using either BERTopic (GPU) or NMF (CPU) with TF-IDF preprocessing. A query-conditioned knowledge graph is constructed from retrieved papers, linking entities across six node types and six edge types. The system is trained on arXiv (cs.*, physics.* categories) and OpenAlex metadata covering approximately 1.73 million papers from 1939-2025.

## Key Results
- Hybrid retrieval architecture improves relevance by combining BM25 lexical search with embedding-based semantic search
- Query-specific topic modeling produces interpretable thematic structures with NPMI coherence scores ranging from 0.60-0.72
- Dynamic knowledge graph construction enables structured exploration of papers, authors, institutions, countries, and topics
- System successfully processes large-scale queries (e.g., 5,000 papers) while maintaining interpretability
- GPU-enabled BERTopic and CPU-efficient NMF provide resource-adaptive topic modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hybrid retrieval combining BM25 lexical search with semantic embedding search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion improves retrieval relevance over either method alone.
- Mechanism: BM25 captures exact terminology matches critical for scientific jargon; semantic embeddings capture conceptual similarity despite lexical variation. RRF aggregates ranked lists without requiring score normalization across different scoring scales.
- Core assumption: Scientific queries require both precise term matching and conceptual understanding; neither paradigm alone suffices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A hybrid retrieval architecture fuses BM25 lexical search with embedding-based semantic search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion."
  - [section 3.2] "Dense neural retrieval consistently outperforms BM25 on conceptually rich scientific queries... whereas lexical search remains superior for matching precise technical terms."
  - [corpus] Related systems (HySemRAG, WisPaper) similarly adopt hybrid retrieval patterns, suggesting this is a convergent design choice, though direct comparative validation for ISLE specifically is not available.
- Break condition: If user queries are exclusively either pure keyword lookups OR purely conceptual explorations, one retrieval path may dominate and fusion adds computational overhead without relevance gains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Query-conditioned topic modeling on retrieved document subsets produces more interpretable and relevant thematic structures than corpus-wide topic modeling.
- Mechanism: Topic modeling (BERTopic or NMF) operates only on documents returned by retrieval for a specific query, reducing noise and focusing thematic clusters on the user's immediate information need.
- Core assumption: The retrieved document set is sufficiently large and thematically diverse for meaningful topic induction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Topic modeling is performed on retrieved results using BERTopic or non-negative matrix factorization depending on computational resources."
  - [section 3.3] "ISLE addresses this gap by performing query-specific topic modeling on retrieved documents using BERTopic when GPU resources are available and NMF as a CPU-efficient alternative."
  - [corpus] SciTopic and related work apply LLM-based topic discovery, but no direct benchmark comparison with query-conditioned approaches exists.
- Break condition: Narrowly scoped queries returning few documents may produce degenerate or overly granular topics; very broad queries may reintroduce noise the approach aims to avoid.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic, query-conditioned knowledge graph construction enables interpretable multi-relational exploration without the computational overhead of maintaining static global knowledge graphs.
- Mechanism: For each query, the system builds a heterogeneous graph linking papers, authors, institutions, countries, topics, and citations from the retrieved set only, enabling structured navigation and impact analysis.
- Core assumption: Users benefit from relational context (author networks, institutional hubs, citation patterns) specific to their query rather than global scholarly structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A knowledge graph unifies papers, authors, institutions, countries, and extracted topics into an interpretable structure."
  - [section 3.4.5] "Because graph construction is conditioned on Dq, the size and density of Gq vary with the user query... This query-scoped design significantly reduces noise, improves interpretability."
  - [corpus] PubGraph and OpenAlex provide static global knowledge graphs; ISLE's dynamic construction differs but lacks direct benchmark comparison.
- Break condition: If users require cross-query relational persistence (e.g., tracking author networks across multiple searches), the per-query isolation becomes a limitation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism for hybrid retrieval; requires understanding rank aggregation vs. score fusion.
  - Quick check question: Given two ranked lists with documents at different positions, can you compute the RRF score using k=60?

- Concept: **Dense vector retrieval and cosine similarity**
  - Why needed here: Semantic search path relies on embedding queries and documents, then computing nearest neighbors.
  - Quick check question: Why does cosine similarity measure directional alignment rather than magnitude, and when does this matter?

- Concept: **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) vs. neural topic models (BERTopic)**
  - Why needed here: System switches between approaches based on resource availability; understanding tradeoffs is essential.
  - Quick check question: What does the k parameter in NMF control, and how does topic coherence guide its selection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Query -> BM25 + KNN Semantic Search -> RRF Fusion -> Top-N Documents -> Topic Modeling (BERTopic/NMF) -> Knowledge Graph Construction -> Analytics Dashboard
- Critical path:
  1. Query preprocessing and optional filtering
  2. Parallel lexical/semantic retrieval execution
  3. RRF fusion and top-N document selection
  4. Topic modeling on retrieved set (BERTopic if GPU, else NMF)
  5. Knowledge graph instantiation from retrieved papers + metadata + topics
  6. Visualization and interactive exploration
- Design tradeoffs:
  - BERTopic yields higher coherence but requires GPU; NMF is CPU-efficient but less semantically granular
  - Query-conditioned graphs reduce noise but lack cross-query persistence
  - arXiv + OpenAlex integration prioritizes CS/Physics coverage at the cost of disciplinary breadth
- Failure signatures:
  - Empty or near-empty retrieval: query may be too narrow or filter constraints too restrictive
  - Degenerate topics (single-document clusters): retrieved set too small for meaningful topic induction
  - Knowledge graph visualization overload: very large retrieved sets (>10K papers) may require summarization or abstraction
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a known-domain query (e.g., "transformer architectures") with both BERTopic and NMF; compare topic coherence scores and inspect semantic granularity.
  2. Execute the same query with and without structured filters (year range, author); measure impact on retrieved set size and graph structure.
  3. Compare retrieval results from BM25-only, semantic-only, and hybrid RRF modes; qualitatively assess whether fusion captures documents missed by either single approach.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ISLE's hybrid retrieval performance compare to baselines on a standardized benchmark with ground-truth relevance labels?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that "large-scale quantitative evaluation of retrieval effectiveness is constrained by the absence of comprehensive, query-level relevance judgments."
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation relies on qualitative case studies and general literature citations rather than a systematic, quantitative benchmark specific to the implemented pipeline.
- What evidence would resolve it: Retrieval metrics (e.g., NDCG, Mean Reciprocal Rank) calculated on a dataset like LitSearch or TREC-COVID using the complete ISLE pipeline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust is the topic modeling component when applied to narrowly scoped queries that return small or thematically uniform document sets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in the Limitations that "topic modeling quality remains sensitive to the size and thematic diversity of the retrieved document set, particularly for narrowly scoped queries."
- Why unresolved: The provided case study ("machine translation") utilized a broad query retrieving 5,000 papers, leaving the system's behavior on smaller, fragmented result sets untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Topic coherence scores (e.g., NPMI) calculated for retrieved sets of varying sizes (e.g., 50, 100, 500 documents) and thematic specificity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent would integrating citation-aware embeddings (e.g., SPECTER) improve the semantic clustering accuracy compared to the current general-purpose MiniLM model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion lists "citation-aware embeddings" as a specific direction for future work to enhance the system.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for efficiency, but the paper acknowledges in Related Works that citation-informed models capture semantics that general embeddings might miss.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing cluster purity or topic coherence between the current MiniLM-based pipeline and a SPECTER-based pipeline on the same corpus subset.

## Limitations

- Quantitative retrieval evaluation is absent; claims of improved relevance over single-modality search rest on qualitative case study and architectural reasoning rather than measured precision/recall/F1
- Topic coherence results are reported only as NPMI ranges (0.60-0.72) without baseline comparisons or statistical significance testing
- The system's scalability to queries returning >10K papers is unproven; no summarization or abstraction mechanisms are described for large result sets
- Cross-disciplinary coverage is limited to arXiv CS/Physics; generalizability to other domains is unknown

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the hybrid retrieval mechanism (RRF fusion is well-established and the described configuration aligns with best practices)
- **Medium confidence** in topic modeling efficacy (NMF/BERTopic choices are sound, but no comparative validation against alternatives like LDA or SciBERT-based models)
- **Medium confidence** in knowledge graph interpretability (query-conditioned construction is logical, but lack of cross-query persistence may limit longitudinal analysis)
- **Low confidence** in overall system performance without quantitative benchmarks or ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct quantitative retrieval evaluation: measure precision@k, recall@k, and nDCG for BM25-only, semantic-only, and hybrid modes on a held-out query set with relevance judgments
2. Compare topic coherence: run ISLE's NMF/BERTopic pipelines against LDA and SciBERT-based topic models on identical retrieved document sets; report statistical significance
3. Stress-test scalability: execute queries designed to return 5K, 10K, and 20K+ papers; measure topic modeling runtime, memory usage, and knowledge graph visualization performance; document failure points
