# Human Guided Learning of Transparent Regression Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15992
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15992
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Human-guided transparent regression achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters than neural baselines

## Executive Summary
HuGuR introduces a human-in-the-loop approach for transparent regression on permutation data, where users interactively refine models through interpretable binary features derived from order constraints. The method employs gradient boosting to build linear models that can be modified in real-time by adding, removing, or refining constraints. A user study with 21 participants compared HuGuR against multiple baselines including naive prediction, one-hot encoding with MLP, graph encoding, and LSTM-based sequence encoding.

The results show that on small datasets, HuGuR outperformed all baselines, and overall performed on par with the most complex neural network method while maintaining transparency. The best five user-built models achieved particularly strong results. Notably, HuGuR models had at least one order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters than neural network baselines, enhancing interpretability. The study found that higher learning rates and more constraints per step correlated with better performance, and hyperparameter tuning contributed to improved results.

## Method Summary
HuGuR uses interpretable binary features derived from human-understandable order constraints to build transparent regression models. The approach employs gradient boosting to construct a linear model where users can interactively refine the model by adding, removing, or refining constraints while coefficients are computed in real-time. This human-in-the-loop system allows for the creation of models that are both performant and interpretable, contrasting with black-box neural network approaches that require large numbers of parameters.

## Key Results
- On small datasets, HuGuR outperformed all baselines including naive prediction, one-hot encoding with MLP, graph encoding, and LSTM-based sequence encoding
- HuGuR achieved overall performance on par with the most complex neural network method while maintaining transparency
- HuGuR models had at least one order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters than neural network baselines, enhancing interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HuGuR leverages human expertise through interpretable order constraints that directly encode domain knowledge into the model. By using binary features derived from these constraints and applying gradient boosting, the system creates models that are both accurate and transparent. The interactive refinement process allows users to iteratively improve the model based on their understanding of the data, while the linear structure ensures interpretability. The gradient boosting approach effectively combines multiple weak constraints into a strong predictive model.

## Foundational Learning
1. Gradient Boosting - Why needed: To combine multiple weak order constraints into a strong predictive model
   Quick check: Verify that each boosting iteration reduces training error on held-out data

2. Interpretable Binary Features - Why needed: To translate human-understandable order constraints into model inputs
   Quick check: Ensure binary features correctly capture the intended order relationships

3. Permutation Data Handling - Why needed: To work with data where sequence order matters but absolute positions don't
   Quick check: Confirm that model predictions are invariant to input permutations

4. Linear Model Interpretability - Why needed: To ensure model coefficients can be understood by humans
   Quick check: Validate that coefficient magnitudes align with domain knowledge

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User Interface -> Constraint Processor -> Feature Generator -> Gradient Booster -> Linear Model

Critical path: User adds constraint → Constraint validation → Feature generation → Model update → Real-time coefficient computation

Design tradeoffs:
- Transparency vs. performance: Linear models are interpretable but may be less powerful than deep networks
- User effort vs. model quality: More constraints improve performance but require more user input
- Real-time computation vs. model complexity: Immediate feedback limits model sophistication

Failure signatures:
- Poor performance: Insufficient or incorrect constraints, or inappropriate learning rate
- User confusion: Overly complex constraint language or unclear feedback mechanisms
- System slowdown: Excessive constraint complexity or computational demands

Three first experiments:
1. Test constraint addition with simple order relationships on synthetic permutation data
2. Evaluate real-time coefficient updates with varying constraint complexity
3. Compare performance degradation when removing constraints from a well-performing model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The user study involved only 21 participants, limiting generalizability and potentially missing diverse user behaviors across expertise levels
- The comparison focuses on synthetic or controlled permutation data, leaving questions about real-world applicability where data may not be perfectly permutation-based
- The study does not fully explore how different user expertise levels affect model quality or whether the learning curve for constraint specification is manageable for non-experts

## Confidence
High confidence in the core finding that HuGuR achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters than neural baselines.
Medium confidence in the transparency benefits due to the limited user study size.
Low confidence in generalizability to real-world applications given the synthetic nature of the permutation data used.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with a larger, more diverse participant pool (minimum 50 participants) across different expertise levels to validate the learning patterns and constraint refinement behaviors
2. Test HuGuR on real-world datasets with imperfect permutation structures to evaluate robustness and practical utility beyond controlled environments
3. Conduct a longitudinal study measuring user efficiency and accuracy improvements over multiple sessions to assess the learning curve and long-term usability of the constraint specification interface
