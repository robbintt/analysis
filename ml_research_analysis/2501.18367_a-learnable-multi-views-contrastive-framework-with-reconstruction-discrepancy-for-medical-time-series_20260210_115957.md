# A Learnable Multi-views Contrastive Framework with Reconstruction Discrepancy for Medical Time-Series

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.18367
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18367
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: LMCRD achieves up to 94.67% accuracy on AD with only 10% labeled data, significantly outperforming seven baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LMCRD, a two-stage framework addressing overfitting in medical time-series disease diagnosis caused by limited labeled data and single-center biases. The framework first extracts prior knowledge from external normal samples using AE-GAN to reconstruct target data discrepancies as disease probabilities. The second stage employs a Learnable Multi-views Contrastive Framework (LMCF) that adaptively learns diverse temporal representations through multi-head attention and inter/intra-view contrastive learning, eliminating the need for manual positive/negative sample design. Experiments demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance across Alzheimer's, myocardial infarction, and Parkinson's datasets.

## Method Summary
LMCRD is a two-stage framework that first uses AE-GAN to extract prior knowledge from external normal samples, reconstructing target data discrepancies as disease probabilities. The second stage introduces LMCF, which employs multi-head attention to adaptively learn diverse temporal representations and uses inter/intra-view contrastive learning to eliminate the need for manual positive/negative sample design. This approach addresses overfitting in medical time-series diagnosis caused by limited labeled data and single-center biases.

## Key Results
- Achieved 94.67% accuracy on Alzheimer's disease dataset with only 10% labeled data
- Demonstrated consistent state-of-the-art performance across three medical conditions
- Outperformed seven baseline methods in disease diagnosis tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LMCRD addresses overfitting by combining external knowledge extraction with adaptive multi-view contrastive learning. The AE-GAN component learns to reconstruct healthy patterns from external normal samples, creating a reference for detecting deviations in target data. The LMCF then learns diverse temporal representations through multi-head attention, capturing different aspects of the time-series patterns. The inter/intra-view contrastive learning automatically identifies positive and negative pairs without manual design, making the framework more generalizable across different medical conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- **AE-GAN (Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network)**: Needed to extract prior knowledge from external normal samples; quick check: verify reconstruction quality on held-out normal data
- **Multi-head Attention**: Needed to capture diverse temporal patterns; quick check: visualize attention weights for different disease states
- **Contrastive Learning**: Needed to learn representations without manual sample labeling; quick check: evaluate learned representations using nearest neighbor analysis
- **Temporal Representation Learning**: Needed to capture disease-specific patterns over time; quick check: compare representations across different disease stages
- **Two-stage Framework**: Needed to separate knowledge extraction from representation learning; quick check: ablation study removing either stage
- **Discrepancy Reconstruction**: Needed to quantify disease probability; quick check: correlate reconstruction error with clinical severity scores

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: External Normal Samples -> AE-GAN -> Target Data Reconstruction -> LMCF -> Multi-head Attention -> Inter/Intra-view Contrastive Learning -> Disease Diagnosis
- **Critical Path**: The AE-GAN stage is critical for establishing baseline healthy patterns, while the LMCF stage is essential for learning discriminative representations
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balances external knowledge utilization with internal representation learning, but requires access to external normal samples
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on datasets lacking external normal samples, or when disease patterns significantly differ from healthy patterns
- **Three First Experiments**:
  1. Validate AE-GAN reconstruction quality on held-out normal samples
  2. Test multi-head attention diversity through attention weight analysis
  3. Compare performance with and without external normal samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on external normal samples may limit applicability when such data is unavailable
- Effectiveness of multi-head attention in generating diverse representations without introducing noise needs validation
- Claim of eliminating manual sample design requires empirical validation across diverse medical conditions

## Confidence
- **High**: Experimental results showing improved accuracy on three medical datasets with limited labeled data
- **Medium**: State-of-the-art performance claims relative to seven baselines; generalizability to other conditions needs validation
- **Low**: Lack of computational efficiency analysis; robustness to noise and missing data not thoroughly examined

## Next Checks
1. Test LMCRD on at least three additional medical time-series datasets with different characteristics to assess generalizability
2. Conduct systematic ablation study removing inter-view or intra-view contrastive learning components
3. Measure training time, inference latency, and memory usage for different time-series lengths and batch sizes
