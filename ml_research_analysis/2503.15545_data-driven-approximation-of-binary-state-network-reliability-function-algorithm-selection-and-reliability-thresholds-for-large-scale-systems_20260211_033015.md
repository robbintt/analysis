# Data-Driven Approximation of Binary-State Network Reliability Function: Algorithm Selection and Reliability Thresholds for Large-Scale Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.15545
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15545
- **Reference count**: 37
- **Key outcome**: Large-scale networks with arc reliability ≥0.9 exhibit near-unity system reliability, enabling computational simplification; ANN excels with limited data (< m²), while Polynomial Regression achieves superior accuracy in data-rich environments (≥ m²)

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates 20 machine learning methods for approximating binary-state network reliability functions across three reliability regimes. The research establishes a dataset-scale-driven paradigm for algorithm selection: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) excel with limited data (size < m²), while Polynomial Regression (PR) achieves superior accuracy in data-rich environments (size ≥ m²). The findings demonstrate ANN's Test-MSE of 7.24E-05 at 30,000 samples and PR's optimal performance (5.61E-05) at 40,000 samples, outperforming traditional Monte Carlo simulations. These insights provide actionable guidelines for balancing accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency in reliability engineering.

## Method Summary
The study employs Binary-State All-Terminal (BAT-MCS) simulations to generate labeled datasets of arc reliability vectors and corresponding system reliability estimates for 20 benchmark networks. An 80/20 train-test split with 5-fold cross-validation evaluates 20 candidate algorithms including ANN, Polynomial Regression, and tree-based methods. The ANN uses two hidden layers (10,5 neurons) with ReLU activations and Adam optimizer, while Polynomial Regression uses degree-2 polynomials. Performance is measured across three reliability regimes (0.0-1.0, 0.9-1.0, 0.99-1.0) using Test MSE, MAE, and CV Score.

## Key Results
- Large-scale networks with arc reliability ≥0.9 exhibit near-unity system reliability (exactly 1.0 for all 10,000 samples in high-reliability intervals)
- ANN achieves Test-MSE of 7.24E-05 at 30,000 samples, outperforming other methods in data-limited regimes
- Polynomial Regression achieves optimal performance (5.61E-05 Test-MSE) at 40,000 samples, surpassing ANN in data-rich environments
- The m² threshold (dataset size relative to number of arcs) determines optimal algorithm selection between ANN and PR

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large-scale networks with arc reliability ≥0.9 converge to near-unity system reliability, enabling computational simplification.
- Mechanism: Structural redundancy in complex networks creates multiple parallel paths between source and target nodes. When individual arcs have high reliability (≥0.9), the probability of simultaneous path failures approaches zero, causing system reliability to converge toward 1.0 regardless of specific topology.
- Core assumption: Networks have sufficient topological redundancy (multiple disjoint paths) rather than single-point-of-failure architectures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We demonstrate that large-scale networks with arc reliability ≥0.9 exhibit near-unity system reliability, enabling computational simplifications."
  - [section 4.3.1] For the DM-LC network (39 nodes, 170 arcs), all 10,000 samples in high-reliability intervals [0.9-1.0] and [0.99-1.0] yielded network reliability of exactly 1.0.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus corroboration found; this appears to be a network-topology-specific empirical observation.
- Break condition: Sparse networks with low path redundancy may not exhibit this convergence even with high arc reliability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ANN outperforms other methods with limited data (samples < m²) because neural networks can learn compact nonlinear representations through weight sharing.
- Mechanism: The MLP architecture with two hidden layers (10 and 5 neurons) uses ReLU activations and Adam optimizer to learn a compressed mapping from arc reliability vectors to system reliability. This parameter efficiency allows generalization from fewer samples compared to methods requiring explicit polynomial basis expansion.
- Core assumption: The reliability function has smooth, learnable structure rather than discontinuous or chaotic behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) excel with limited data (size < m²)"
  - [section 4.3.2, Table 9] ANN ranked #1 at 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 samples; Test-MSE of 7.24E-05 at 30,000 samples.
  - [corpus] Shallow neural network approximation properties in Barron spaces (arxiv:2510.18388) provide theoretical grounding for why ANNs can approximate functions efficiently.
- Break condition: Extremely high-dimensional input spaces or highly irregular reliability surfaces may require more data than this threshold suggests.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Polynomial Regression (PR) surpasses ANN when dataset size ≥ m² due to stable estimation of O(m²) polynomial coefficients.
- Mechanism: Degree-2 polynomial regression requires estimating m(m+1)/2 coefficients for all pairwise interaction terms. Once sample count exceeds this parameter count by sufficient margin, least-squares estimation stabilizes, and PR's explicit modeling of arc interactions captures reliability dependencies more accurately than ANN's implicit feature learning.
- Core assumption: Second-order polynomial terms adequately capture the reliability function; higher-order interactions are negligible.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Polynomial Regression (PR) achieves superior accuracy in data-rich environments (size ≥ m²)"
  - [section 4.3.2, Table 10] At 40,000 samples, PR achieved Test-MSE of 5.61E-05 versus ANN's 5.66E-05.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation for the m² threshold specifically.
- Break condition: Networks where reliability depends on higher-order arc interactions (3+ arcs) may require polynomial degrees >2, changing the threshold.

## Foundational Learning

- **Binary-State Network Reliability**
  - Why needed here: The entire paper models infrastructure as graphs where arcs (edges) are either working (1) or failed (0). System reliability is the probability source connects to target.
  - Quick check question: For a 5-arc network, how many possible state vectors exist? (Answer: 2⁵ = 32)

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE) as Loss Function**
  - Why needed here: All 20 algorithms are compared using Train MSE, Test MSE, and CV Score. Understanding why MSE is appropriate for regression (vs. classification metrics) is essential.
  - Quick check question: If predicted reliability is 0.85 and true reliability is 0.90, what is the squared error? (Answer: 0.0025)

- **Overfitting and Cross-Validation**
  - Why needed here: The study uses 80/20 train-test splits with 5-fold CV. The performance gap between train and test MSE indicates generalization capability.
  - Quick check question: If Train MSE is 1E-06 but Test MSE is 1E-02, what problem does this indicate? (Answer: Overfitting)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  BAT-MCS -> Data Generation -> 20 ML Algorithms -> Evaluation (MSE, MAE, CV Score)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define network topology G(V,E) with source and target nodes
  2. Sample arc reliability vectors from target regime (e.g., [0.9-1.0])
  3. Compute approximate reliability using BAT-MCS with Nsim simulations
  4. Train ML model on 80% of samples, validate on 20%
  5. Select model based on Test MSE and dataset size threshold

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **ANN vs PR**: ANN offers accuracy with limited data but is less interpretable; PR provides coefficient-level interpretability but requires ≥m² samples
  - **Simulation count (Nsim)**: Higher Nsim improves BAT-MCS accuracy but increases data generation cost (study used Nsim=10,000)
  - **Reliability regime focus**: Narrower ranges (0.99-1.0) yield lower variance but may not generalize to degraded conditions

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Test MSE >> Train MSE indicates overfitting (seen in Decision Tree: Train MSE=0, Test MSE=0.001-0.002)
  - Reliability estimates stuck at 1.0 in high-reliability regimes indicates network has excessive redundancy for that regime
  - PR ranking drops dramatically at small sample sizes (rank 6 at 10,000 samples → rank 1 at 40,000) indicates insufficient data for coefficient estimation

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation**: Replicate Table 4 results on a small network (e.g., Fig.3(1), 4 nodes, 5 arcs) with 10,000 samples across all three regimes to verify PR and ANN rankings.
  2. **Threshold sensitivity**: Test the m² boundary by generating datasets at 0.5m², 1.0m², and 1.5m² samples to observe the ANN-to-PR performance crossover point.
  3. **Topology stress test**: Apply the framework to a network with known bottlenecks (single-bridge topology) to verify whether the ≥0.9 convergence threshold still holds or breaks down.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Multi-state network reliability analysis**: Future work will extend this framework to multi-state reliability analysis, addressing time-dependent degradation and heterogeneous performance levels.

## Limitations
- The m² rule for algorithm selection lacks theoretical grounding and may vary with network topology complexity.
- The convergence behavior at arc reliability ≥0.9 is empirical and may not hold for networks with critical bottlenecks or low path redundancy.
- BAT-MCS simulation count (Nsim=10,000) introduces approximation error that propagates through all comparisons.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The ANN vs PR performance hierarchy across dataset sizes is well-supported by systematic testing across 20 benchmark networks.
- **Medium confidence**: The specific m² threshold for algorithm selection is empirical and may require adjustment for networks with different structural properties.
- **Low confidence**: The convergence behavior at arc reliability ≥0.9 may not generalize to all network topologies, particularly those with single points of failure.

## Next Checks
1. **Topology Stress Test**: Apply the framework to networks with known bottlenecks (e.g., single-bridge topology) to verify whether the ≥0.9 convergence threshold still holds or breaks down, measuring the exact arc reliability value where system reliability drops below 1.0.

2. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis**: Generate datasets at fractional m² intervals (0.5m², 0.75m², 1.0m², 1.25m²) and measure the exact crossover point where PR overtakes ANN in Test MSE, documenting how this threshold varies across different network topologies.

3. **Simulation Accuracy Verification**: Compare BAT-MCS reliability estimates with exact analytical solutions for small networks (where available) to quantify the approximation error introduced by Nsim=10,000, then assess how this error propagates through the ML model rankings.
