# How AI Fails: An Interactive Pedagogical Tool for Demonstrating Dialectal Bias in Automated Toxicity Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06676
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06676
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: unitary/toxic-bert scores AAE text 1.8× more toxic and 8.8× higher for identity hate than SAE

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates systematic bias in automated toxicity detection against African-American English (AAE). Using the unitary/toxic-bert model, AAE text was found to be scored as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for "identity hate" compared to Standard American English (SAE). To make these biases tangible, the author developed an interactive pedagogical tool that allows users to adjust a sensitivity threshold and directly observe how biased model scores combined with human-set policies lead to discriminatory outcomes. The tool includes dialectally matched sentence pairs and demonstrates that at any given threshold, AAE text is more likely to be incorrectly flagged as toxic, illustrating the real-world impact of algorithmic bias in content moderation.

## Method Summary
The study benchmarks dialectal bias by comparing model scores on African-American English (AAE) versus Standard American English (SAE) text using the unitary/toxic-bert model. The TwitterAAE dataset (12GB) was filtered to 10,000 high-confidence samples each for AAE (p_aa > 0.8) and SAE (p_white > 0.8). Text preprocessing removed URLs, @handles, hashtags, special characters, newlines, and extra whitespace. The model was run via transformers pipeline with sigmoid activation, returning scores for six toxicity labels. False Positive Rate (FPR) was computed across classification thresholds 0.0-1.0. An interactive Flask-based pedagogical tool was built with a threshold slider to demonstrate how biased model scores lead to discriminatory outcomes.

## Key Results
- AAE text scored 1.8× more toxic than SAE text
- AAE text scored 8.8× higher for identity hate than SAE text
- At any given threshold, AAE text is more likely to be incorrectly flagged as toxic

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The unitary/toxic-bert model was trained on datasets that likely underrepresent AAE, leading to systematic scoring differences. When model outputs are combined with human-set classification thresholds in moderation systems, these inherent biases translate into discriminatory outcomes against AAE speakers. The interactive tool makes this mechanism visible by allowing users to adjust thresholds and observe how AAE text is disproportionately flagged across all settings.

## Foundational Learning
- Dialectal variation in NLP: Understanding that language varieties like AAE have systematic linguistic differences from SAE, requiring specialized handling in NLP systems. Why needed: Models trained primarily on SAE data will naturally perform worse on AAE. Quick check: Verify model performance drops on AAE test sets.
- False Positive Rate analysis: Measuring the proportion of benign samples incorrectly classified as toxic. Why needed: Shows how bias manifests in practical deployment when samples are assumed benign. Quick check: Compute FPR across threshold range for both dialects.
- Text preprocessing standardization: Removing URLs, handles, hashtags, and special characters to ensure consistent model input. Why needed: Ensures preprocessing doesn't introduce additional bias. Quick check: Confirm preprocessing doesn't remove dialect-specific markers.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Dataset (TwitterAAE) -> Preprocessing -> Model (unitary/toxic-bert) -> Scores -> Analysis/FPR -> Interactive Tool

Critical path: Dataset loading → preprocessing → model inference → score analysis → FPR computation → interactive visualization

Design tradeoffs: The binary filtering (p_>0.8) simplifies analysis but may exclude dialectally ambiguous samples that could moderate observed bias. The choice of unitary/toxic-bert provides a specific case study but may not generalize to all toxicity models.

Failure signatures: Memory errors when loading 12GB dataset, score mismatches from preprocessing differences, inconsistent results across runs due to lack of random seed specification.

First experiments:
1. Load and preprocess a small subset (100 samples) of both AAE and SAE to verify filtering works correctly
2. Run model inference on preprocessed subset to confirm output format matches expectations
3. Compute mean scores for a single label to validate basic pipeline functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The exact preprocessing regex patterns are not specified, which could shift mean scores by ~0.1-0.3
- Binary p_>0.8 filtering may exclude dialectally ambiguous samples that could moderate the observed bias
- No inter-run score variance is reported, leaving open the possibility of modest fluctuation in the 1.8×/8.8× metrics

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core claim about systematic bias (1.8× more toxic, 8.8× higher for identity hate) is well-specified and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The FPR analysis depends on the assumption that all samples are benign, which is reasonable but unverified
- Low confidence: The interactive tool's effectiveness in conveying bias to users is not empirically validated with user studies

## Next Checks
1. Run inference with the exact preprocessing and filtering as specified; compare mean scores to reported 1.8×/8.8× ratios within ±0.2 tolerance
2. Perform 5 independent runs with different random seeds; report score mean and standard deviation for each dialect to bound inter-run variance
3. Conduct a small pilot user study (n=10-20) using the interactive tool to assess whether users can correctly identify the bias after interacting with the threshold slider
