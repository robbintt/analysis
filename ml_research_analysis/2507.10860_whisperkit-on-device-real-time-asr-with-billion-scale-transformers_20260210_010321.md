## Executive Summary
WhisperKit is an on-device real-time automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that achieves state-of-the-art performance by combining architectural modifications, hardware acceleration, and model compression. The system matches the lowest latency at 0.46 seconds while achieving the highest accuracy at 2.2% word error rate (WER), outperforming leading cloud-based systems including OpenAI's gpt-4o-transcribe, Deepgram's nova-3, and Fireworks' large-v3-turbo. By modifying Whisper's architecture for streaming inference with block-diagonal attention masks, the audio encoder latency is reduced by 65% while maintaining WER within 1% of the original model. The system leverages Apple's Neural Engine for native acceleration, achieving near-peak hardware utilization with 75% reduction in energy consumption, and employs a novel compression technique called Outlier-Decomposed Mixed-Bit Palletization that reduces the model size from 1.6GB to 0.6GB while preserving accuracy within 1% of the uncompressed model.

## Method Summary
WhisperKit achieves its performance through three key optimizations. First, the Whisper architecture is modified for streaming inference by implementing block-diagonal attention masks that reduce audio encoder latency by 65% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the original model. Second, the system is reimplemented for native acceleration on Apple's Neural Engine, achieving near-peak hardware utilization and reducing energy consumption by 75%. Third, a new compression technique called Outlier-Decomposed Mixed-Bit Palletization is applied, reducing the model size from 1.6GB to 0.6GB while preserving accuracy within 1% of the uncompressed model. These optimizations enable deployment of billion-scale transformers on edge devices with real-time performance, achieving 2.2% WER at 0.46s latency on iOS devices.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2.2% WER, the highest accuracy among evaluated systems
- Matches lowest latency at 0.46s, significantly faster than cloud-based alternatives
- Reduces model size from 1.6GB to 0.6GB while preserving accuracy within 1%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
WhisperKit's performance gains stem from three complementary optimizations that address the fundamental challenges of deploying large-scale ASR models on edge devices. The streaming inference modification with block-diagonal attention masks enables real-time processing by reducing the computational burden of the audio encoder, which is typically the bottleneck in streaming ASR systems. The hardware acceleration through Apple's Neural Engine exploits the specialized processing capabilities of modern mobile chips, achieving near-peak utilization while dramatically reducing energy consumption. The compression technique addresses the memory constraints of edge devices by reducing the model footprint without sacrificing accuracy, making it feasible to deploy billion-parameter models on devices with limited storage and RAM. Together, these optimizations create a synergistic system that overcomes the traditional trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and resource efficiency in on-device ASR.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Block-diagonal attention masks**: Restrict attention to local context in streaming ASR to reduce latency
   - Why needed: Full attention requires access to future tokens, incompatible with real-time processing
   - Quick check: Verify that WER degradation stays within 1% threshold

2. **Apple Neural Engine acceleration**: Specialized hardware for neural network inference on Apple Silicon
   - Why needed: General-purpose processors cannot achieve the performance and efficiency required for real-time ASR
   - Quick check: Confirm 75% energy reduction and near-peak utilization metrics

3. **Outlier-Decomposed Mixed-Bit Palletization**: Novel compression technique combining mixed-precision quantization with outlier decomposition
   - Why needed: Standard quantization degrades accuracy significantly on large models; this method preserves performance while achieving aggressive compression
   - Quick check: Validate that 0.6GB compressed model maintains <1% WER degradation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Audio input -> Block-diagonal attention encoder -> Neural Engine acceleration -> Mixed-bit quantized decoder -> Text output

**Critical path**: Audio preprocessing -> Streaming encoder with block-diagonal masks -> Hardware-accelerated inference -> Compressed decoder inference -> Output streaming

**Design tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs latency (achieved through streaming modifications), model size vs performance (addressed through compression), energy efficiency vs computational throughput (optimized through hardware acceleration)

**Failure signatures**: Increased WER indicates attention mask configuration issues; latency spikes suggest Neural Engine underutilization; accuracy degradation may indicate compression artifacts

**First experiments**: 1) Benchmark baseline Whisper latency with full attention, 2) Test block-diagonal mask configurations for optimal WER-latency trade-off, 3) Profile Neural Engine utilization across different batch sizes and model partitions
