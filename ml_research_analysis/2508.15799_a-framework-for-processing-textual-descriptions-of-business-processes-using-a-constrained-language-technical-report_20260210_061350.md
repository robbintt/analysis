# A Framework for Processing Textual Descriptions of Business Processes using a Constrained Language -- Technical Report

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.15799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15799

- One-line primary result: BeePath is a framework that enables non-experts to model business processes by writing structured natural language descriptions.

## Executive Summary
BeePath is a framework designed to simplify business process modeling by allowing non-experts to describe processes using structured natural language. It leverages a constrained grammar based on workflow patterns and uses large language models to convert unstructured text into this structured form. The framework ensures deterministic and hallucination-free model generation by translating descriptions into formal models like Petri nets and DECLARE. This approach aims to make process modeling more accessible while maintaining accuracy and consistency.

## Method Summary
BeePath uses a constrained grammar derived from workflow patterns to enable structured natural language descriptions of business processes. It employs large language models to convert unstructured text into this structured form, ensuring deterministic and hallucination-free model generation. The framework translates these descriptions into formal models such as Petri nets and DECLARE, which are used to represent and analyze business processes. The implementation includes a web tool with ANTLR-based parsing and Graphviz visualization, providing a user-friendly interface for process modeling.

## Key Results
- BeePath enables non-experts to model business processes using structured natural language descriptions.
- The framework supports both basic and extended workflow patterns, including parallelism, choice, synchronization, and repetition.
- It guarantees consistency by enforcing a closed-world assumption and explicit activity connections.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BeePath works by constraining the natural language used to describe business processes, making it easier for large language models to parse and convert into formal models. The constrained grammar, based on workflow patterns, ensures that the descriptions are structured and unambiguous. This structure allows the framework to generate deterministic and hallucination-free models, which are then translated into formal representations like Petri nets and DECLARE. The use of a closed-world assumption and explicit activity connections further ensures consistency and accuracy in the generated models.

## Foundational Learning
- **Constrained Grammar**: A grammar that restricts the natural language used to describe processes, making it easier for LLMs to parse and convert into formal models. This is needed to ensure structured and unambiguous descriptions.
  - Quick check: Verify that the grammar supports all required workflow patterns.
- **Workflow Patterns**: A set of patterns that describe common control-flow structures in business processes, such as sequence, parallelism, choice, synchronization, and repetition. These patterns are used to define the constrained grammar.
  - Quick check: Ensure that the framework supports both basic and extended workflow patterns.
- **Petri Nets**: A formal modeling language used to represent and analyze business processes. Petri nets are generated from the structured descriptions to ensure deterministic and accurate process models.
  - Quick check: Validate that the Petri nets generated from the descriptions accurately represent the intended processes.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: User Input -> Constrained Grammar Parser -> LLM Conversion -> Formal Model Generator -> Petri Net/DECLARE Model -> Graphviz Visualization
- **Critical Path**: User Input -> Constrained Grammar Parser -> LLM Conversion -> Formal Model Generator
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The use of a constrained grammar simplifies parsing but may limit the expressiveness of the descriptions. The reliance on LLMs for conversion introduces potential errors but improves accessibility.
- **Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent models may result from ambiguous descriptions or unsupported workflow patterns. The framework should handle these cases gracefully and provide clear error messages.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test the framework's ability to model simple business processes with basic workflow patterns.
  2. Evaluate the accuracy of the generated Petri nets and DECLARE models.
  3. Assess the framework's performance with complex descriptions involving multiple workflow patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The constrained grammar may not fully capture complex real-world business processes.
- The framework's reliance on a closed-world assumption and explicit activity connections may limit flexibility in modeling scenarios with implicit dependencies.
- The current implementation does not support nested subprocesses or resource modeling.

## Confidence
- **High**: The framework's ability to convert structured natural language into formal models like Petri nets and DECLARE is well-demonstrated.
- **Medium**: The effectiveness of the constrained grammar in supporting both basic and extended workflow patterns is supported, but its applicability to more complex scenarios is uncertain.
- **Low**: The framework's limitations in handling implicit dependencies, nested subprocesses, and resource modeling are clearly stated but not fully explored.

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework's ability to model complex real-world business processes with implicit dependencies and nested subprocesses.
2. Evaluate the scalability of the framework when processing large volumes of textual descriptions.
3. Assess the accuracy of the formal models generated by the framework in representing the intended business processes.
