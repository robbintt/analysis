# Using Vision Language Models as Closed-Loop Symbolic Planners for Robotic Applications: A Control-Theoretic Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07410
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07410
- Reference count: 39
- The paper investigates using vision-language models as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotic applications, finding closed-loop planning consistently outperforms open-loop despite VLM inference errors.

## Executive Summary
This paper examines the effectiveness of vision-language models (VLMs) as closed-loop symbolic planners in robotic applications. Through controlled experiments across four task environments and three different VLMs, the authors compare open-loop and closed-loop planning approaches while varying control horizons and warm-starting conditions. The study reveals that closed-loop planning consistently outperforms open-loop methods even in static environments, primarily due to VLM inference errors. Warm-starting proves to be a robust technique that enhances both geometric and logical reasoning capabilities, while control horizon length shows minimal impact on performance.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted controlled experiments comparing open-loop and closed-loop VLM planners across four task environments using three different VLM models. They systematically varied the control horizon (how many steps the planner looks ahead) and tested warm-starting (providing partial plans as context). The experiments measured task completion rates and plan execution quality, focusing on both geometric reasoning (object manipulation) and logical reasoning (task planning). The closed-loop approach involved iteratively updating the plan based on observed states, while open-loop planners executed fixed plans without updates.

## Key Results
- Closed-loop planning consistently outperforms open-loop planning across all tested environments and VLM models
- Warm-starting significantly improves both geometric and logical reasoning capabilities in VLMs
- Control horizon length has minimal impact on planning performance, contrary to typical control-theoretic expectations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superiority of closed-loop planning stems from its ability to correct for VLM inference errors through iterative feedback. When VLMs generate incorrect or suboptimal plans in open-loop mode, these errors compound over time, leading to task failure. Closed-loop planning mitigates this by continuously observing the environment and adjusting plans accordingly. The warm-starting mechanism provides additional context that helps VLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge more effectively, reducing the cognitive load required for each planning decision and improving overall reasoning accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision-Language Models (VLMs): Multimodal models that process both visual and textual information
  * Why needed: Essential for interpreting visual sensor data and generating symbolic plans
  * Quick check: Verify the VLM can accurately describe observed scenes and objects

- Closed-loop Control: Systems that use feedback to adjust behavior
  * Why needed: Enables correction of planning errors through environmental observation
  * Quick check: Ensure the system can accurately detect state deviations from expected outcomes

- Warm-starting: Initializing planning with partial or contextual information
  * Why needed: Reduces cognitive load and leverages pre-trained knowledge effectively
  * Quick check: Confirm that providing context improves plan quality and reasoning accuracy

- Symbolic Planning: Generating abstract task representations rather than low-level actions
  * Why needed: Allows for more generalizable and interpretable planning decisions
  * Quick check: Verify that symbolic plans can be successfully translated to executable actions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
VLM Input -> VLM Processing -> Plan Generation -> Action Execution -> Environment Feedback -> Plan Update

Critical Path:
Environment Observation → VLM Processing → Plan Generation → Action Execution → Success Evaluation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational cost vs. planning accuracy (closed-loop requires more iterations)
- Plan horizon length vs. adaptability (longer horizons may reduce flexibility)
- Warm-start context complexity vs. planning efficiency (more context may slow inference)

Failure Signatures:
- Open-loop: Cumulative planning errors leading to task failure
- Closed-loop: Failure to correct errors due to inaccurate environmental observations
- Warm-starting: Overfitting to initial context, reducing adaptability

Three First Experiments:
1. Compare plan quality with and without warm-starting using identical initial conditions
2. Test error correction capability by introducing deliberate perturbations in the environment
3. Evaluate planning performance with varying levels of visual noise in observations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to simple tabletop manipulation tasks with static environments
- Does not address computational efficiency trade-offs between planning approaches
- Limited exploration of alternative warm-starting strategies or VLM architectures

## Confidence
- Closed-loop planning superiority: Medium confidence - findings consistent in controlled experiments but may not generalize to complex scenarios
- Warm-starting benefits: High confidence - robust positive impact across different tasks and VLMs
- Control horizon effects: Low confidence - lack of significant findings may be task-dependent

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the closed-loop versus open-loop performance gap in a more complex environment with dynamic obstacles and longer task horizons
2. Test the warm-starting approach with more sophisticated context incorporation methods, such as iterative refinement or hierarchical planning
3. Conduct a computational efficiency analysis comparing inference times and planning success rates across different control horizon lengths in a real-time robotic application
