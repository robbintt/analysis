# Evaluating Arabic Large Language Models: A Survey of Benchmarks, Methods, and Gaps

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.13430
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13430
- **Reference count**: 30
- **Key outcome**: First systematic review of Arabic LLM benchmarks analyzing 40+ evaluation benchmarks across NLP tasks, knowledge domains, cultural understanding, and specialized capabilities

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive systematic review of Arabic Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks, analyzing over 40 evaluation benchmarks across multiple dimensions including NLP tasks, knowledge domains, cultural understanding, and specialized capabilities. The authors propose a taxonomy organizing benchmarks into four categories: Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture and Dialects, and Target-Specific evaluations. The analysis reveals significant progress in benchmark diversity while identifying critical gaps in temporal evaluation, multi-turn dialogue assessment, and cultural misalignment in translated datasets.

The survey examines three primary approaches for benchmark creation: native collection, translation, and synthetic generation, discussing their trade-offs regarding authenticity, scale, and cost. This work serves as a comprehensive reference for Arabic NLP researchers, providing insights into benchmark methodologies, reproducibility standards, and evaluation metrics while offering recommendations for future development.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic review methodology to analyze Arabic LLM benchmarks, examining over 40 evaluation benchmarks across multiple dimensions. The authors developed a taxonomy organizing benchmarks into four categories: Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture and Dialects, and Target-Specific evaluations. The analysis includes examination of benchmark methodologies, evaluation metrics, reproducibility standards, and approaches to benchmark creation including native collection, translation, and synthetic generation. The survey also identifies critical gaps in the field through qualitative analysis of existing benchmark coverage and capabilities.

## Key Results
- Survey provides first systematic review of Arabic LLM benchmarks analyzing 40+ evaluation benchmarks
- Proposes taxonomy organizing benchmarks into four categories: Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture and Dialets, and Target-Specific evaluations
- Identifies critical gaps: limited temporal evaluation, insufficient multi-turn dialogue assessment, and cultural misalignment in translated datasets
- Examines three primary benchmark creation approaches: native collection, translation, and synthetic generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to analyzing the rapidly evolving field of Arabic LLM evaluation. By examining over 40 benchmarks across multiple dimensions, the authors establish a comprehensive baseline understanding of current capabilities and limitations. The proposed taxonomy provides a structured framework for organizing and comparing different benchmark types, while the analysis of benchmark creation methods offers practical insights into the trade-offs researchers face. The identification of critical gaps helps direct future research efforts toward areas of highest impact.

## Foundational Learning

**Arabic NLP Benchmarks**: Understanding existing evaluation frameworks for Arabic language processing is essential for assessing LLM capabilities in this domain. Quick check: Review existing Arabic NLP benchmark databases and their task coverage.

**Cross-Cultural Dataset Alignment**: Knowledge of how cultural nuances affect language model performance across different linguistic contexts. Quick check: Compare performance differences between natively collected and translated Arabic datasets.

**Synthetic Data Generation**: Understanding methods for creating training and evaluation data programmatically to scale benchmark development. Quick check: Evaluate quality metrics for synthetic versus human-collected Arabic text.

**Temporal Evaluation Methods**: Familiarity with techniques for assessing model performance over time and detecting concept drift. Quick check: Review temporal analysis methods used in other NLP domains.

**Multi-turn Dialogue Assessment**: Understanding frameworks for evaluating conversational AI systems across multiple interaction turns. Quick check: Examine existing multi-turn dialogue evaluation protocols in Arabic.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Benchmark Creation -> Taxonomy Organization -> Gap Analysis -> Recommendations
- Data Collection: Gathering 40+ Arabic LLM benchmarks across multiple sources
- Benchmark Creation: Examining native collection, translation, and synthetic generation methods
- Taxonomy Organization: Categorizing benchmarks into Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture/Dialects, Target-Specific
- Gap Analysis: Identifying limitations in temporal evaluation, multi-turn dialogue, cultural alignment
- Recommendations: Providing future development guidance for Arabic NLP researchers

**Critical Path**: Taxonomy development -> Benchmark analysis -> Gap identification -> Method evaluation -> Recommendations formulation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The survey balances comprehensiveness with analytical depth, choosing breadth across multiple benchmark types while providing detailed analysis of critical gaps. This approach enables broad coverage but may sacrifice depth in individual benchmark analysis.

**Failure Signatures**: Incomplete benchmark coverage may lead to missed gaps; over-reliance on published descriptions may miss unpublished developments; qualitative cultural misalignment assessments may lack empirical validation.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate taxonomy structure by applying it to newly discovered Arabic LLM benchmarks
2. Conduct empirical comparison between natively collected and translated benchmark datasets
3. Implement longitudinal tracking of benchmark usage and model performance over time

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Rapidly evolving field may result in incomplete coverage of recent developments
- Taxonomy proposed may not capture all relationships between benchmark types
- Analysis relies heavily on published descriptions rather than empirical validation
- Cultural misalignment assessments are qualitative rather than systematically validated

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The taxonomy structure and general categorization of benchmark types are well-supported by the analyzed data

**Medium confidence**: Conclusions about gaps in temporal evaluation and multi-turn dialogue assessment are based on observed patterns but may not capture all existing work

**Medium confidence**: Recommendations for future development are grounded in identified gaps but depend on assumptions about research priorities

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic search for unpublished or recently released Arabic LLM benchmarks to assess completeness of the current survey coverage

2. Perform empirical comparison studies between natively collected and translated benchmark datasets to validate claims about cultural misalignment and authenticity differences

3. Implement longitudinal tracking of benchmark usage and model performance over time to validate the identified gap in temporal evaluation capabilities
