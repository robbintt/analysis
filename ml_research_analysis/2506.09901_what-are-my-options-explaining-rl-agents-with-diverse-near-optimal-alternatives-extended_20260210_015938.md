# "What are my options?": Explaining RL Agents with Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (Extended)

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.09901
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09901
- **Reference count:** 39
- **Primary result:** DNA generates diverse near-optimal trajectory options through corridor-based state partitioning and reward shaping, achieving 48.6% and 72.6% experimental success rates for two corridors in gridworld tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (DNA), a method for explaining reinforcement learning agents by generating diverse near-optimal trajectory options. DNA partitions the state space into corridors and trains local policies to navigate each corridor while optimizing for distinct behaviors. The method uses reward shaping in modified Q-learning problems to produce policies with guaranteed ϵ-optimality. In experiments on a gridworld task, DNA successfully generated qualitatively different policies from a starting state, with experimental success rates of 48.6% and 72.6% for two corridors compared to much lower performance from Quality Diversity methods.

## Method Summary
DNA works by first partitioning the state space into distinct corridors that represent different behavioral paths. Within each corridor, a local policy is trained using a modified Q-learning algorithm that incorporates reward shaping to encourage diversity while maintaining near-optimal performance. The reward shaping mechanism introduces auxiliary rewards that guide the policy toward corridor-specific behaviors without compromising the ϵ-optimality guarantee. The method provides theoretical bounds on trajectory success probability within each corridor, offering both explanation and safety guarantees. The approach is demonstrated on a gridworld task where DNA successfully generates multiple distinct policy options from a starting state.

## Key Results
- DNA achieved 48.6% and 72.6% experimental success rates for two corridors in gridworld tasks
- DNA outperformed Quality Diversity methods, which achieved only 1.4% and 8.3% success rates for the same corridors
- The method generated qualitatively different policies that represent distinct behavioral options from the same starting state
- DNA provides theoretical bounds on trajectory success probability within corridors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DNA leverages corridor-based state partitioning to create natural behavioral boundaries that encourage diversity. The modified Q-learning algorithm with reward shaping effectively balances the exploration of different behavioral patterns while maintaining performance guarantees. By training local policies within well-defined corridors, the method can focus on generating distinct behaviors without the interference that would occur in a unified state space. The ϵ-optimality guarantee ensures that all generated policies remain near-optimal while being sufficiently diverse to serve as meaningful alternatives.

## Foundational Learning
- **Corridor-based state partitioning**: Divides the state space into distinct regions to encourage behavioral diversity. Needed to create natural boundaries for different policy behaviors. Quick check: Verify corridor definitions cover relevant state space without overlap.
- **Reward shaping**: Modifies the reward function to guide policies toward specific behaviors. Needed to encourage diversity while maintaining performance. Quick check: Ensure shaping rewards don't compromise ϵ-optimality.
- **Modified Q-learning**: Adapts standard Q-learning to incorporate corridor constraints and reward shaping. Needed to train policies that respect corridor boundaries. Quick check: Verify convergence to near-optimal policies.
- **ϵ-optimality guarantees**: Provides theoretical bounds on policy performance relative to optimal. Needed to ensure all generated alternatives are high-quality. Quick check: Validate theoretical bounds match empirical performance.
- **Trajectory success probability**: Measures the likelihood of successfully navigating a corridor. Needed to provide safety guarantees. Quick check: Compare theoretical bounds with experimental success rates.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** State space -> Corridor partitioner -> Local policy trainers (per corridor) -> Policy selector -> Trajectory success probability estimator

**Critical Path:** Corridor definition → Reward shaping design → Modified Q-learning training → Policy evaluation → Success probability estimation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational complexity (training multiple local policies) for improved diversity and explanation quality. Corridor design complexity increases with state space dimensionality.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor corridor design leads to overlapping behaviors; inadequate reward shaping results in similar policies across corridors; computational constraints limit the number of corridors that can be effectively trained.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Validate corridor partitioning on simple gridworld with known optimal paths
2. Test reward shaping sensitivity by varying shaping weights
3. Compare diversity metrics across different corridor configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Corridor-based partitioning may struggle in high-dimensional state spaces where defining meaningful corridors becomes challenging
- The method's reliance on ϵ-optimality guarantees assumes reward shaping can effectively separate policy behaviors without compromising performance bounds
- The relatively simple gridworld environment limits generalizability to more complex real-world scenarios

## Confidence
**High:** Theoretical framework for corridor-based policy generation and ϵ-optimality guarantees
**Medium:** Experimental results demonstrating diversity generation in gridworld tasks
**Low:** Scalability claims to high-dimensional continuous control tasks

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability Test:** Evaluate DNA's performance on high-dimensional continuous control tasks (e.g., MuJoCo locomotion environments) to assess corridor definition and policy generation capabilities beyond gridworld settings.

2. **Robustness Analysis:** Test the sensitivity of DNA's diversity guarantees to variations in corridor design parameters and reward shaping weights across multiple random seeds and environment configurations.

3. **Real-World Application:** Apply DNA to explain policies in a safety-critical domain (e.g., autonomous driving simulations) to validate both the explanation quality and the practical utility of the trajectory success probability bounds.
