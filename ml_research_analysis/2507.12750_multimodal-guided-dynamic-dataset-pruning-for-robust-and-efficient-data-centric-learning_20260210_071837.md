# Multimodal-Guided Dynamic Dataset Pruning for Robust and Efficient Data-Centric Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.12750
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12750
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Dynamic dataset pruning improves training efficiency and accuracy by adaptively selecting high-quality samples based on task loss and cross-modality semantic consistency

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a dynamic dataset pruning framework that enhances data-centric learning by adaptively selecting high-quality samples during training. The method leverages both task-specific loss and cross-modality semantic consistency, using CLIP-based supervision to filter noisy or inconsistent samples. By optimizing a selection score through dual-supervision, the framework dynamically adjusts data composition, achieving higher accuracy with fewer samples. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with the approach being lightweight, scalable, and robust to noisy data.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a dynamic dataset pruning strategy that combines task-specific loss with cross-modality semantic consistency for sample selection. It uses CLIP-based semantic supervision to filter out noisy or inconsistent samples, addressing limitations of static pruning methods. During training, the model maintains a selection score for each sample, which is optimized through dual-supervision (task loss and semantic consistency). This adaptive mechanism allows the model to adjust data composition in real-time, focusing on high-quality samples that contribute most to learning. The approach is designed to be lightweight and scalable, suitable for resource-constrained scenarios.

## Key Results
- Consistent accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-1k
- Achieves higher accuracy with fewer samples through adaptive selection
- Demonstrates robustness to noisy data and scalability across different dataset sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by dynamically balancing two supervision signals: task-specific loss (ensuring samples are relevant to the learning objective) and cross-modality semantic consistency (ensuring samples align with multimodal semantic representations from CLIP). This dual-supervision approach allows the model to identify and prioritize high-quality samples while filtering out noisy or inconsistent ones. The adaptive nature of the selection mechanism ensures that the data composition evolves with the training process, focusing computational resources on the most informative samples.

## Foundational Learning
- **CLIP-based semantic supervision**: Understanding how CLIP's multimodal representations can be used for quality assessment. Quick check: Verify CLIP embeddings capture semantic similarity across modalities for your dataset.
- **Dynamic sample selection**: Learning how to implement adaptive data pruning during training. Quick check: Monitor selection score distributions to ensure meaningful discrimination between samples.
- **Dual-supervision optimization**: Grasping the balance between task loss and semantic consistency objectives. Quick check: Ablate each supervision signal to quantify individual contributions.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Input data → Task loss computation → CLIP semantic embedding → Selection score optimization → Filtered dataset → Model training
**Critical path**: The selection score optimization is the critical component, as it directly determines which samples are included in training and must be computed efficiently at each iteration.
**Design tradeoffs**: Balances computational overhead of dynamic selection against improved sample quality; requires careful tuning of the relative weights between task loss and semantic consistency.
**Failure signatures**: Poor sample discrimination (selection scores not varying meaningfully), slow convergence due to excessive pruning, or degradation when CLIP representations don't align with task semantics.
**First experiments**: 1) Run baseline training without pruning to establish performance floor. 2) Implement static pruning with fixed thresholds to compare against dynamic selection. 3) Perform ablation study removing CLIP supervision to isolate its contribution.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate performance on domain-specific datasets (medical imaging, satellite imagery) where CLIP representations may be suboptimal
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the exact contribution of multimodal supervision versus task-specific loss alone
3. Measure wall-clock time and memory overhead across different hardware configurations to validate efficiency gains in practical deployment scenarios
