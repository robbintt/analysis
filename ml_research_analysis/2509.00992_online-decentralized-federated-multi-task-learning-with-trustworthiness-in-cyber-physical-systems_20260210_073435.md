# Online Decentralized Federated Multi-task Learning With Trustworthiness in Cyber-Physical Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.00992
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00992
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Introduces online decentralized federated multi-task learning algorithm achieving model personalization and Byzantine resilience when Byzantine clients dominate

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of robust model personalization in online decentralized federated learning systems under Byzantine attacks, where malicious clients may outnumber honest participants. The authors propose a novel algorithm that leverages cyber-physical properties, such as received signal strength or other side information, to dynamically assess the trustworthiness of received model updates. By integrating trust probabilities into a regularized Lagrangian optimization framework, the algorithm enables honest clients to learn personalized models while mitigating the impact of Byzantine clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates sublinear regret and constraint violation, establishing asymptotic convergence performance close to a Byzantine-free setting.

## Method Summary
The proposed algorithm operates in an online decentralized federated learning setting where clients learn personalized models through local optimization and neighbor communication. At each time step, clients receive model updates from their neighbors and calculate trust probabilities based on cyber-physical properties, such as received signal strength or other side information. These trust probabilities are then incorporated into a regularized Lagrangian optimization problem, which balances the original learning objective with a regularization term that accounts for potential Byzantine behavior. The algorithm solves this optimization problem to update the client's local model, with the regularization term effectively reducing the impact of untrusted model updates. The process repeats at each time step, allowing honest clients to dynamically adapt their trust assessments and learn personalized models while maintaining Byzantine resilience.

## Key Results
- Achieves sublinear regret and constraint violation under Byzantine attacks
- Demonstrates asymptotic convergence performance close to Byzantine-free setting
- Effective model personalization even when Byzantine clients dominate the federation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties to assign trust probabilities to received model updates, enabling honest clients to distinguish between trusted and malicious neighbors dynamically. By integrating these trust probabilities into a regularized Lagrangian optimization framework, the algorithm mitigates the impact of Byzantine clients while allowing honest clients to learn personalized models. The regularization term in the optimization problem effectively reduces the influence of untrusted model updates, ensuring robust convergence even under Byzantine attacks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical assumptions about trust metric properties and bounded gradients need real-world validation
- Simulation results demonstrate effectiveness in controlled settings, but generalizability to diverse CPS environments is unclear
- Computational overhead of trust probability calculation and regularized optimization may be prohibitive for resource-constrained devices

## Confidence
- **High**: Sublinear regret and constraint violation bounds (theoretical proof provided)
- **Medium**: Byzantine resilience when Byzantine clients dominate (proof relies on trust metric assumptions)
- **Medium**: Integration of cyber-physical properties for trust assessment (simulation validated but real-world testing limited)

## Next Checks
1. Test algorithm performance under realistic CPS conditions with varying signal-to-noise ratios and different types of physical side information
2. Evaluate computational overhead and scalability on resource-constrained devices in large-scale federated networks
3. Assess robustness against sophisticated Byzantine attacks that target the trust metric itself, such as collaborative manipulation of received signal strength measurements
