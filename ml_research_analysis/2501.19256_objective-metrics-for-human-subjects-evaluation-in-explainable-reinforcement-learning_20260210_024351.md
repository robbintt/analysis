# Objective Metrics for Human-Subjects Evaluation in Explainable Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.19256
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19256
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Proposes objective behavioral metrics for XRL evaluation focusing on observable actionability rather than subjective self-reports

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for objective human-centered evaluation in explainable reinforcement learning (XRL). The authors argue that traditional subjective metrics like confidence and understanding provide only opinions about explanation quality, not practical effectiveness. Instead, they propose a framework of objective behavioral metrics that measure what users can actually do with explanations. These metrics are organized around two primary use cases: debugging agent behavior and supporting human-agent teaming. The framework includes next action prediction, goal prediction, sub-goal prediction, counterfactual policy identification, and performance-based teaming metrics.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes objective metrics for XRL evaluation based on observable human behavior. For debugging, metrics include next action prediction accuracy, goal prediction accuracy, sub-goal prediction accuracy, counterfactual policy identification, and time taken to answer questions. For human-agent teaming, metrics include task completion scores, inter-agent conflict measurement, and time taken. The framework requires training multiple policies with different reward functions to enable goal prediction evaluation. A novel grid-based "mini-world" environment with farmers, soldiers, and skeletons serves as an illustrative example, though implementation details are not fully specified.

## Key Results
- Objective behavioral metrics provide more reliable evaluation than subjective self-reports
- Explanation evaluation must match temporal scale to intended purpose (action → sub-goal → goal)
- Different explanation goals (debugging vs. teaming) require context-appropriate metrics
- Users can feel confident about explanations while being unable to use them effectively ("placebic" explanations)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Objective behavioral metrics provide more reliable evaluation of explanation effectiveness than subjective self-reports.
- Mechanism: Replace self-reported confidence/understanding with observable, measurable behavioral outcomes (e.g., prediction accuracy, task completion). This grounds evaluation in what users can *do* with an explanation rather than what they *say* about it.
- Core assumption: Observable behavior reflects actual explanation utility; users can accurately report preferences but may lack metacognitive awareness of explanation effectiveness.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Explanation evaluation must match the temporal scale (action → sub-goal → goal) to the explanation's intended purpose.
- Mechanism: Select evaluation granularity based on what users need to understand—immediate actions, intermediate objectives, or overall purpose. Next Action Prediction for low-level debugging; Sub-Goal Prediction for sequential decision-making; Goal Prediction for high-level intent verification.
- Core assumption: Different stakeholders require different temporal resolution of understanding; a single explanation cannot effectively span all scales.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Effective explanation evaluation requires explicit alignment between explanation goal (debugging vs. teaming) and metric selection.
- Mechanism: First identify the use case—debugging (pre/post-deployment verification, fault investigation) or teaming (coordination, trust, accountability)—then select metrics from the appropriate category. Debugging uses prediction tasks; teaming uses performance/conflict measures.
- Core assumption: The same explanation cannot serve all purposes; evaluation validity depends on context-appropriate metric selection.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Reinforcement learning primitives (policy π, state s, reward function R)**
  - Why needed here: All proposed metrics reference these constructs; understanding that policies map states to actions and agents optimize reward functions is prerequisite for interpreting any XRL evaluation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why "goal prediction" requires multiple trained policies with different reward functions?

- Concept: **Experimental design for human-subjects research**
  - Why needed here: The paper critiques poor experimental practices (survey design errors, statistical bias); implementing these metrics requires understanding control conditions, baseline comparisons, and confound management.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper recommend including a "No Explanation" baseline condition?

- Concept: **Counterfactual reasoning**
  - Why needed here: Counterfactual Policy Identification requires understanding minimal state changes that alter agent behavior; this is conceptually distinct from predicting what the agent *will* do.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between "what action will the agent take?" and "what would need to change for the agent to take a different action?"

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
```
Explanation Goal
    ├── Debugging
    │   ├── Next Action Prediction (accuracy)
    │   ├── Goal Prediction (accuracy)
    │   ├── Sub-Goal Prediction (accuracy)
    │   ├── Counterfactual Policy (identification)
    │   └── Time Taken (seconds)
    └── Human-Agent Teaming
        ├── Task Completion (score/reward)
        ├── Inter-Agent Conflict (count)
        └── Time Taken (seconds)
```

- Critical path:
  1. Define explanation goal (debugging or teaming) and target audience
  2. Select 2-3 appropriate metrics from corresponding category
  3. Implement measurement methodology with "No Explanation" baseline
  4. Collect both objective metrics AND subjective self-reports for correlation analysis
  5. Verify objective-subjective alignment (users' confidence should match their actual performance)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Easy-to-implement vs. informative**: Next Action Prediction is simple but has limited explanatory value for long-horizon tasks
  - **Objective-only vs. holistic**: Pure objective metrics miss user preferences; the paper recommends combining both
  - **Standardized vs. context-specific**: Standard benchmarks enable comparison but may not match your deployment context

- Failure signatures:
  - Objective performance at random-chance levels → explanation provides no actionable information
  - High subjective ratings with low objective performance → "placebic" explanations (users feel good but can't use them)
  - High variance in Time Taken metric → inconsistent comprehension or poorly designed task interface
  - No improvement over "No Explanation" baseline → explanation mechanism ineffective

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline calibration**: Implement Next Action Prediction with and without explanations in a simple grid environment to establish whether your explanation mechanism provides any signal above random guessing
  2. **Metric correlation study**: Run a study measuring both objective metrics (prediction accuracy) and subjective ratings (self-reported understanding) to identify misalignment—this tests the paper's claim that subjective metrics alone are insufficient
  3. **Cross-context comparison**: Test the same explanation mechanism with debugging metrics vs. teaming metrics to validate the claim that different goals require different evaluation approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do correlations exist between objective explanation performance (e.g., accuracy) and subjective user beliefs (e.g., confidence)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly ask, "Is the user’s debugging accuracy correlated with their confidence?" and suggest researchers investigate if "explanation helpfulness correlate[s] with a human-agent team’s speed or accuracy."
- Why unresolved: Current work often relies on subjective metrics that reflect opinions rather than practical effectiveness, leaving the relationship between perceived understanding and actionable performance unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical data from human-subject studies that simultaneously measure task performance (e.g., prediction accuracy) and self-reported metrics to identify statistical dependencies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can an agent's "true" sub-goal be objectively determined for evaluation without relying on manual annotation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Regarding Sub-Goal Prediction, the paper states, "we are unaware of an objective method for determining an agent’s 'true' sub-goal," noting that researchers currently must handpick states.
- Why unresolved: Objective evaluation is hindered by the lack of a universally agreed definition for intermediate sub-goals, unlike final goals or immediate next actions.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of an automated, principled algorithm for identifying sub-goals that aligns with human intuition without requiring manual labeling.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the field establish standardized benchmarks to enable effective comparison between different XRL explanation mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that the "lack of standardised benchmarks... prevent comparisons between research even if objective metrics are used" and call for future work to utilize common evaluation cases.
- Why unresolved: Without shared environments and metrics, researchers cannot effectively compare the strengths and weaknesses of various explanation mechanisms, hindering reproducibility.
- What evidence would resolve it: The creation and broad adoption of a shared evaluation suite or "grand challenge" where XRL methods are tested against the same objective metrics.

## Limitations

- The framework lacks empirical validation of metric discriminative power across domains
- Implementation details of the illustrative mini-world environment are unspecified
- Training N separate policies for different reward functions may be computationally prohibitive for complex domains
- Limited guidance on handling subjective-objective metric misalignment

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core argument that objective behavioral metrics are more informative than subjective self-reports for XRL evaluation. The framework's structural logic (matching temporal scale to explanation purpose, separating debugging vs. teaming metrics) is internally consistent and aligns with established human-subjects research principles.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that these specific metrics will generalize beyond the illustrative grid environment. While the metric definitions are sound, their practical utility depends heavily on implementation quality and domain characteristics.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that objective metrics alone can fully capture explanation effectiveness. The paper acknowledges this limitation but provides limited guidance on integrating subjective and objective measures beyond correlation analysis.

## Next Checks

1. **Baseline implementation validation**: Implement the mini-world environment and baseline "No Explanation" condition to verify that proposed metrics can distinguish between explanation mechanisms with known performance differences (e.g., saliency maps vs. natural language explanations).

2. **Cross-domain metric applicability**: Test whether the same set of objective metrics (next action prediction, goal prediction, etc.) performs consistently across different XRL environments (gridworld, Atari, continuous control) to assess generalizability.

3. **Subjective-objective alignment study**: Conduct a human-subjects study measuring both subjective understanding ratings and objective prediction accuracy to quantify the extent of "placebic" explanations and identify thresholds where subjective confidence becomes decoupled from actual behavioral performance.
