# MRI Embeddings Complement Clinical Predictors for Cognitive Decline Modeling in Alzheimer's Disease Cohorts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.14601
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14601
- **Reference count:** 19
- **Primary result:** Clinical and volumetric features achieved highest AUCs (~0.70) for mild/severe progression; transformer-derived MRI embeddings best for stable class (AUC 0.71)

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates how different data modalities contribute to predicting cognitive decline trajectories in Alzheimer's disease. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for identifying mild and severe progression, while transformer-derived MRI embeddings were most effective for detecting stable trajectories, with an AUC of 0.71. Convolutional network baselines underperformed transformer-based models on stable classes and showed limited gains for moderate and severe groups. All approaches struggled with the moderate progression group, highlighting its heterogeneity. The results indicate that clinical features capture global risk patterns, whereas transformer-based imaging representations better identify subtle stability signatures, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for more robust AD progression modeling.

## Method Summary
The study uses ADNI1 MRI data (503 T1 scans) and ADNI-Merge tabular data with CSF, PET, cognitive scores, and brain volumetrics. Longitudinal CDR-SB trajectories are clustered into four classes (stable, mild, moderate, severe) using DTW-based k-means (k=4). A 3D ViT-V-Net encoder is pretrained via reconstruction (200 epochs, MSE loss), then embeddings are reduced via PCA (15 components, ~95% variance) and classified with XGBoost. This is compared against autoencoder+XGBoost on tabular features and fine-tuned CNN baselines (ResNet-Med3D, ResNet-MONAI).

## Key Results
- Clinical and volumetric features achieved AUCs of ~0.70 for mild and severe progression groups
- Transformer-derived MRI embeddings achieved 0.71 AUC for distinguishing cognitively stable individuals
- All methods struggled with moderate progression group (AUC 0.37-0.53), highlighting inherent heterogeneity
- CNN baselines underperformed transformer models on stable class detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transformer-derived MRI embeddings capture subtle structural signatures associated with cognitive stability that clinical predictors miss
- Mechanism: The 3D ViT encoder learns anatomy-preserving representations through unsupervised reconstruction. The self-attention mechanism aggregates global spatial relationships across volumetric patches, enabling detection of distributed structural patterns that distinguish stable from declining trajectories—patterns too subtle for handcrafted volumetrics
- Core assumption: Structural brain configurations at baseline contain predictive signal for near-term cognitive stability that can be extracted without explicit disease labels
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71"; [section] Table 2 shows ViT + FC achieving 0.71 AUC for stable class vs. 0.58 for brain volumetrics
- Break condition: If reconstruction pretraining does not preserve task-relevant anatomy, or if stability signatures are not structurally encoded at baseline, this mechanism fails

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Clinical and volumetric tabular features excel at identifying progression extremes because they aggregate established risk markers and atrophy patterns already associated with disease severity
- Mechanism: Cognitive scores, CSF biomarkers, and brain volumetrics provide direct measurements of disease-relevant pathology. When compressed via autoencoders and classified with XGBoost, these features capture global decline trajectories—particularly for patients already showing clear clinical signal at either extreme
- Core assumption: Progressive subgroups (mild/severe) exhibit distinguishable biomarker profiles that reflect accumulated disease burden
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression"; [section] Table 1 shows cognitive scores achieving 0.75 AUC for mild and 0.77 for severe progression
- Break condition: If extreme groups do not have differentiated biomarker signatures, or if autoencoder compression removes discriminative information, performance degrades

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The moderate progression group resists classification across all modalities due to inherent clinical and biological heterogeneity
- Mechanism: Moderate decline represents a boundary state where patients exhibit mixed or ambiguous signals—some with slow-but-detectable change, others with rapid transition from mild. Neither global risk patterns (tabular) nor subtle structural signatures (imaging) consistently separate this group from neighbors
- Core assumption: The moderate cluster defined by DTW k-means captures genuinely heterogeneous patients rather than a coherent subtype
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "all approaches struggled with the moderate progression group, highlighting its heterogeneity"; [section] Table 2 shows all methods achieving 0.37-0.53 AUC for moderate class
- Break condition: If moderate heterogeneity is an artifact of clustering parameters (k=4 choice) rather than true clinical diversity, different trajectory definitions could improve separation

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for trajectory clustering**
  - Why needed here: Patients have irregular follow-up schedules; DTW aligns trajectories of varying length and timing to identify homogeneous progression patterns
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why standard Euclidean distance fails for aligning two CDR-SB sequences with visits at months 6, 18, 36 versus months 12, 24?

- **Concept: Unsupervised representation learning via reconstruction**
  - Why needed here: Direct supervised training on limited MRI data risks overfitting; reconstruction pretraining forces the encoder to learn anatomy-preserving features without progression labels
  - Quick check question: What property must the pretext task (reconstruction) have for the learned embeddings to transfer usefully to the downstream task (progression classification)?

- **Concept: Modality complementarity in multimodal prediction**
  - Why needed here: Different data types capture different aspects of disease—tabular for global risk, imaging for subtle structural change—motivating fusion rather than single-modality reliance
  - Quick check question: If tabular features achieve 0.70 AUC for severe decline and ViT embeddings achieve 0.71 for stable, what fusion strategy would preserve both strengths?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Preprocessed T1 MRI + tabular features → DTW k-means clustering → trajectory labels → ViT encoder (reconstruction pretraining) → PCA reduction → XGBoost classifier; parallel path: tabular autoencoder → XGBoost

- **Critical path:** 1) Harmonize and augment MRI data (FreeSurfer pipeline + artifact simulation); 2) Pretrain ViT-V-Net encoder via reconstruction (unsupervised); 3) Extract embeddings, apply PCA; 4) Train downstream classifier on trajectory labels; 5) Compare against tabular autoencoder+XGBoost and CNN baselines

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Frozen encoder vs. fine-tuning: Paper freezes ViT and trains only FC head; fine-tuning could improve performance but risks overfitting on small dataset
  - PCA dimensionality: 15 components balance variance retention (~95%) vs. overfitting; may lose task-relevant features
  - k=4 clusters: Chosen for clinical interpretability; different k could change group definitions and classification difficulty

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low AUC on moderate class across all methods (0.37-0.53) → likely intrinsic heterogeneity, not model failure
  - CNN baselines underperforming ViT on stable class → suggests global attention captures distributed patterns CNNs miss
  - ViT underperforming tabular on severe class → suggests reconstruction pretraining does not emphasize atrophy severity

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce trajectory clustering: Apply DTW k-means to ADNI-Merge CDR-SB scores; verify k=4 elbow plot and cluster distributions match paper
  2. Ablate PCA components: Test 10, 15, 25, 50 components to assess information loss vs. overfitting tradeoff
  3. Implement simple fusion: Concatenate tabular autoencoder output with ViT embeddings before XGBoost; evaluate whether complementary strengths combine constructively

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can multimodal fusion strategies effectively combine tabular predictors with transformer-derived MRI embeddings to leverage their complementary strengths?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion motivates "multimodal fusion strategies" because clinical features capture global risk while embeddings capture stability signatures
- Why unresolved: This study evaluated modalities independently and only proposed integration as future work
- What evidence would resolve it: A fused model achieving higher AUCs than unimodal baselines across all progression groups

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can class-aware learning or multimodal integration resolve the classification difficulties associated with the heterogeneous moderate progression group?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that all approaches struggled with the "heterogeneous moderate group" and suggest "class-aware learning" as a remedy
- Why unresolved: The heterogeneity of the moderate class resulted in low performance across all tested models
- What evidence would resolve it: Significant performance gains specifically for the moderate class using the proposed methods

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does dimensionality reduction via PCA obscure predictive imaging features for progressive decline trajectories?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors hypothesize that the lower performance of ViT embeddings on progressive groups might reflect "information loss from dimensionality reduction"
- Why unresolved: The study utilized PCA to mitigate overfitting, potentially trading off predictive power for stability
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing PCA-reduced embeddings against the full latent space or alternative compression techniques

## Limitations
- Moderate progression class inherently heterogeneous, limiting classification performance across all modalities (AUC 0.37-0.53)
- Key architectural details underspecified (tabular autoencoder architecture, XGBoost hyperparameters, ViT-V-Net implementation)
- Frozen encoder approach may leave performance gains unrealized; PCA dimensionality reduction could discard task-relevant features

## Confidence
- **High:** Clinical features capturing established risk patterns for progression extremes (mild/severe AUC ~0.70-0.77); moderate class heterogeneity limiting all approaches
- **Medium:** Transformer embeddings capturing subtle stability signatures (stable AUC 0.71); CNN baselines underperforming ViT on stable class
- **Low:** Specific claims about reconstruction pretraining preserving anatomy-relevant features; fusion benefits not experimentally validated

## Next Checks
1. Replicate trajectory clustering to verify k=4 produces same class definitions and distributions
2. Systematically ablate PCA components (10, 15, 25, 50) to quantify information retention vs. overfitting tradeoff
3. Implement simple multimodal fusion (concatenate tabular and ViT features before classification) to test complementarity claims
