# A Research Roadmap for Augmenting Software Engineering Processes and Software Products with Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.26275
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26275
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Presents a systematic roadmap for understanding how generative AI augments software engineering, classifying augmentation into four forms (Copilot, GenAIware, Teammate, Robot) and identifying key research challenges.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a structured framework for analyzing how generative AI (GenAI) transforms software engineering. By classifying GenAI augmentation into four distinct forms based on whether it augments processes or products and its level of autonomy, the study provides a systematic approach to understanding current capabilities and future research directions. The roadmap identifies specific challenges including prompt engineering, traceability, quality assurance, and human-AI collaboration, while offering ten predictions for software engineering by 2030.

## Method Summary
The research employs a three-cycle Design Science Research approach, beginning with collaborative workshop insights and rapid literature reviews across four GenAI categories. For each category, the team applies McLuhan's tetrads (Enhance, Reverse, Retrieve, Obsolesce) to systematically analyze impacts on software development. The resulting roadmap is validated through multiple review cycles and cross-validation, creating a transparent framework for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

## Key Results
- Four distinct forms of GenAI augmentation identified: Copilot (Process/Passive), GenAIware (Product/Passive), Teammate (Process/Active), and Robot (Product/Active)
- Systematic application of McLuhan's tetrads reveals non-obvious side effects including skill erosion and historical revivals
- Specific research challenges mapped across accountability, quality assurance, legal aspects, and cross-cutting systemic risks
- Ten predictions for software engineering transformation by 2030, including major shifts in developer roles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structural Disambiguation via Dimensions
A two-dimensional classification (Process vs. Product, Passive vs. Active) reduces ambiguity in analyzing GenAI's role. By forcing categorization into one of four forms, researchers avoid conflating distinct technical challenges like confusing tooling support (Copilot) with autonomous agents (Teammate).

### Mechanism 2: Prospective Impact Analysis via McLuhan's Tetrads
Applying McLuhan's tetrads systematically exposes non-obvious side effects. Instead of focusing solely on productivity gains, this framework forces identification of negative externalities (e.g., loss of accountability) and historical revivals (e.g., return to formal methods).

### Mechanism 3: Gap Consolidation via Rapid Literature Reviews
Synthesizing evidence through Rapid Literature Reviews allows timely identification of research gaps without the latency of full systematic reviews. This pragmatic approach aggregates fragmented state-of-the-art evidence and cross-validates with peers to derive specific challenges.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Agency and Autonomy Continuum**
  - **Why needed here**: Distinguishes between "Passive" (human-triggered) and "Active" (goal-driven, autonomous) AI, which is prerequisite for selecting the correct roadmap segment.
  - **Quick check**: Does the AI wait for user input to act (Passive), or does it initiate actions to achieve a goal (Active)?

- **Concept**: **McLuhan's Tetrad of Media Effects**
  - **Why needed here**: This is the analytical engine of the paper. "Reverse" means what a technology flips into when pushed to extremes (e.g., cars leading to traffic jams).
  - **Quick check**: If a GenAI Copilot enhances coding speed, what does it "Reverse" or "Obsolesce" in the developer's workflow?

- **Concept**: **Traceability and Provenance in AI Artifacts**
  - **Why needed here**: The roadmap identifies "Traceability, provenance, rationale" as a key challenge. Understanding that generated code lacks inherent authorship history is vital for accountability challenges.
  - **Quick check**: Can you trace a specific line of AI-generated code back to the prompt or training data that influenced it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: The core architecture is the 2x2 Matrix: GenAI Copilot (Process/Passive), GenAIware (Product/Passive), GenAI Teammate (Process/Active), and GenAI Robot (Product/Active). Roadmap components (A-D, X) are modules attached to these quadrants.

- **Critical path**:
  1. **Classify**: Place the target system into the 2x2 matrix
  2. **Analyze**: Apply the McLuhan Tetrad to the specific form
  3. **Map**: Consult the Roadmap Tables to identify specific challenges
  4. **Synthesize**: Check "Cross-form Aspects" for systemic risks

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Speed vs. Control (Process)**: Moving from Copilot to Teammate increases automation speed but drastically increases coordination and accountability costs
  - **Flexibility vs. Reliability (Product)**: GenAIware allows flexible functionality but introduces stochastic reliability issues
  - **Novelty vs. Obsolescence**: GenAI Robots obsolesce natural language AI-to-AI communication in favor of efficiency

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **"The Overtrust Loop"**: Treating a GenAI Teammate as merely a smarter Copilot, failing to implement necessary supervisory architectures
  - **"The Compliance Blindspot"**: Developing GenAIware without guardrails, assuming the model behaves deterministically

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Classification Audit**: Take 3 existing AI tools and rigorously classify them using the 2x2 matrix
  2. **Tetrad Stress Test**: For a selected tool, explicitly write down the "Reverse" quadrant
  3. **Challenge Mapping**: Identify a specific pain point and map it to the Roadmap tables to see if the proposed opportunity is applicable

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Rapid Literature Reviews may miss emerging or niche developments due to their speed-focused nature
- Subjective application of McLuhan's tetrads introduces interpretive variability in identifying "Reverse" and "Retrieve" effects
- Framework assumes clean classification into four forms, which may not hold for hybrid systems exhibiting multiple characteristics

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Structural classification framework is well-defined and internally consistent | High |
| Identification of specific research challenges is grounded in current literature | Medium |
| Predictions for 2030 are speculative and highly dependent on future developments | Low |

## Next Checks
1. **Framework Stress Test**: Apply the 2x2 classification to 5-10 existing GenAI tools and assess whether any consistently resist clean categorization
2. **Tetrad Interpretation Audit**: Have 3-5 independent reviewers apply McLuhan's tetrads to the same GenAI case study and compare resulting "Reverse" effects
3. **RLR Coverage Analysis**: Compare RLR results with a full systematic review of a smaller subset to quantify potential gaps in coverage
