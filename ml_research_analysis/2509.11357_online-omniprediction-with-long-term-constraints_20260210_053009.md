## Executive Summary
This paper introduces online omniprediction with long-term constraints, extending omniprediction to settings where decision makers face cumulative constraints across time. The framework enables a forecaster to make predictions that allow each downstream agent to maintain feasible action sets through an elimination process based on constraint violations, while playing constrained best responses. The key innovation is providing simultaneous regret and constraint violation guarantees for multiple agents with different utility and constraint functions, applicable to arbitrary collections of subsequences.

## Method Summary
The method involves a forecaster using a calibrated forecasting algorithm to make predictions that ensure unbiasedness conditional on agents' decisions. Each agent maintains a feasible action set through an elimination process where actions are removed if they violate constraints. Agents then play a constrained best response from their remaining feasible set. The framework simultaneously handles multiple agents with different utility functions and constraints, achieving O(√T) regret and O(1) cumulative constraint violation against two different benchmark classes—one requiring constraints to be satisfied every round, and another requiring satisfaction in expectation.

## Key Results
- Achieves O(√T) regret and O(1) cumulative constraint violation for multiple agents
- Guarantees hold simultaneously for agents with different utility and constraint functions
- Results extend to arbitrary collections of subsequences
- Predictions are produced using a calibrated forecasting algorithm ensuring unbiasedness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by combining calibrated forecasting with a careful elimination process. The calibrated forecaster ensures that predictions remain unbiased conditional on agents' decisions, which is crucial for maintaining the theoretical guarantees. The elimination process allows each agent to progressively remove actions that violate constraints while preserving the regret guarantees. By having agents play constrained best responses from their remaining feasible sets, the framework balances constraint satisfaction with utility maximization.

## Foundational Learning

**Calibrated forecasting** - Why needed: Ensures predictions are unbiased conditional on agents' decisions, maintaining theoretical guarantees
Quick check: Verify calibration error bounds hold in practice with synthetic data

**Regret minimization** - Why needed: Provides the O(√T) performance guarantee relative to benchmark classes
Quick check: Implement standard regret minimization algorithms and verify scaling

**Constraint satisfaction** - Why needed: Ensures agents maintain feasible action sets through the elimination process
Quick check: Test constraint violation rates on simple linear constraint functions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Calibrated forecaster -> Elimination process -> Constrained best response -> Multiple agents with different utilities

Critical path: The calibrated forecaster must produce predictions before the elimination process can begin. The elimination process must complete before agents can determine their constrained best response. All components must work in real-time as the online game progresses.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational complexity (maintaining and updating feasible sets) for strong theoretical guarantees. Using a black-box calibrated forecaster simplifies the design but may limit optimization opportunities.

Failure signatures: Poor calibration leads to biased predictions and broken guarantees. Inefficient elimination processes can cause computational bottlenecks. Incorrect constraint functions may eliminate too many or too few actions.

First experiments:
1. Implement the framework with a single agent and linear constraints to verify basic functionality
2. Test with multiple agents having different utility functions but shared constraints
3. Evaluate performance with non-linear constraint functions to assess computational tractability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational complexity of the elimination process for many agents remains unclear
- Limited empirical validation in realistic scenarios
- Practical scalability with complex constraint functions is uncertain

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical framework and regret bounds are well-established
- **Medium confidence**: Extension to multiple agents appears sound but requires careful implementation
- **Medium confidence**: Guarantees for arbitrary collections of subsequences follow from main results but may have implementation challenges

## Next Checks
1. Implement the elimination process for 5-10 agents with varying utility functions to empirically verify O(√T) regret scaling
2. Test the framework with non-linear constraint functions to assess computational tractability and constraint satisfaction
3. Evaluate the impact of prediction errors in the calibrated forecasting algorithm on overall performance guarantees
