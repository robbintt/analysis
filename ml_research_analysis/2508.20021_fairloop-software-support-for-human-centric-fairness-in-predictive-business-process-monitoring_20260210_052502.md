# FairLoop: Software Support for Human-Centric Fairness in Predictive Business Process Monitoring

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.20021
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20021
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: FairLoop is a human-in-the-loop tool for bias mitigation in neural network-based predictive business process monitoring

## Executive Summary
FairLoop addresses the challenge of unfair predictions in predictive business process monitoring by providing a software tool that enables human-guided bias mitigation. The tool works by distilling interpretable decision trees from neural networks, allowing users to inspect and modify biased decision logic. Through an iterative distill-alter-tune cycle, FairLoop fine-tunes the original model to produce fairer predictions while preserving context-specific positive biases. The approach offers a middle ground between automated bias removal and manual inspection, enabling selective bias mitigation based on human judgment.

## Method Summary
FairLoop implements a human-in-the-loop approach to fairness in predictive business process monitoring. The tool first distills a decision tree from a neural network prediction model, then provides a graphical interface for users to inspect and modify biased decision paths. After human-guided modifications to the decision tree, the original neural network is fine-tuned using the modified tree as guidance. This process can be iterated multiple times to progressively improve fairness. The tool focuses on sensitive attributes like gender or age that may introduce bias, allowing users to selectively remove negative bias while preserving positive bias based on context-specific knowledge.

## Key Results
- FairLoop enables interactive exploration and modification of decision trees extracted from neural networks
- The tool displays performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall) for comparison after each iteration
- FairLoop addresses the limitation of uniform sensitive attribute removal by enabling context-aware bias mitigation through human involvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FairLoop works by leveraging the interpretability of decision trees to expose the decision logic of neural networks. When a neural network makes predictions based on process data, the underlying decision logic may contain biases related to sensitive attributes. By distilling this logic into a decision tree, FairLoop makes these biases visible and modifiable. The human-guided modification phase allows domain experts to identify and correct unfair decision paths while preserving legitimate patterns. The fine-tuning phase then updates the original neural network to incorporate these fairness-aware modifications, creating a more equitable prediction model.

## Foundational Learning
- **Decision tree distillation**: Converting neural network decision logic into interpretable tree structures - needed to make complex neural decisions inspectable by humans - quick check: verify tree accurately represents neural network predictions
- **Human-in-the-loop bias mitigation**: Combining automated model analysis with human judgment for fairness decisions - needed because context-specific knowledge is crucial for distinguishing harmful vs. beneficial bias - quick check: compare human vs. automated bias removal outcomes
- **Iterative model refinement**: Multiple cycles of modification and fine-tuning to progressively improve fairness - needed because initial modifications may introduce new biases or reduce model performance - quick check: track fairness metrics across iterations

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Neural network model -> Decision tree distiller -> Graphical interface -> Modified tree -> Fine-tuning module -> Updated neural network
- **Critical path**: Data input -> Neural network prediction -> Decision tree distillation -> Human modification -> Fine-tuning -> Fair predictions
- **Design tradeoffs**: Interpretability vs. model complexity, human judgment vs. automation, iterative improvement vs. computational overhead
- **Failure signatures**: Poor decision tree accuracy indicates distillation issues; unchanged fairness metrics suggest ineffective modifications; significant performance degradation indicates overcorrection
- **First experiments**: 1) Test distillation accuracy with simple neural networks, 2) Evaluate human modification effectiveness on known biased datasets, 3) Measure fairness improvement across multiple iterative cycles

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns with large, complex neural networks and high-dimensional process data
- Heavy reliance on user expertise with potential for user bias in decision tree modifications
- Unclear generalizability beyond business process monitoring to other domains

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation of distillation and fine-tuning approach
- Medium confidence in practical effectiveness for bias mitigation
- Low confidence in generalizability claims to other domains and contexts

## Next Checks
1. Test FairLoop's performance with deep neural networks (5+ layers) and high-dimensional process data to assess scalability limitations
2. Conduct user studies with stakeholders of varying technical expertise to evaluate the tool's usability and effectiveness in identifying and modifying biased decision logic
3. Perform extensive fairness evaluation using multiple fairness metrics (demographic parity, equal opportunity, disparate impact) across diverse protected attribute combinations to validate the tool's bias mitigation claims
