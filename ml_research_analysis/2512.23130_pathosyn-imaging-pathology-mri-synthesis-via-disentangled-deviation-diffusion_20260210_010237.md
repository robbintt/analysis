# PathoSyn: Imaging-Pathology MRI Synthesis via Disentangled Deviation Diffusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23130
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23130
- Reference count: 0
- Introduces a disentangled additive deviation framework for realistic pathological MRI synthesis

## Executive Summary
PathoSyn introduces a novel framework for generating realistic pathological MRI images by explicitly disentangling anatomical structure from disease-related variation. The method employs a deviation-space diffusion model that learns conditional distributions of pathological residuals, enabling controlled synthesis of lesion heterogeneity while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 brain tumor dataset, PathoSyn demonstrates significant improvements over holistic and mask-conditioned baselines in perceptual realism, anatomical fidelity, and downstream clinical task performance.

## Method Summary
The framework operates by separating anatomical content from pathological deviation through a disentangled additive approach. The model first extracts subject-specific anatomical information, then learns to generate disease-related variations as residuals in a dedicated deviation space. A conditional diffusion model is trained to synthesize these pathological residuals, which are then added back to the anatomical base to produce the final pathological image. This architecture allows the model to localize generative uncertainty to the lesion space while maintaining anatomical coherence. The training process utilizes paired healthy and pathological MRI data, with the deviation model learning the distribution of disease-related changes conditioned on both the anatomical context and disease characteristics.

## Key Results
- Achieves Dice score of 0.845 for tumor segmentation on BraTS 2020
- Improves classification AUROC to 0.915 for pathology detection
- Reduces feature-space distance to real pathology distributions, demonstrating improved perceptual realism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The disentangled additive deviation framework succeeds by explicitly separating the stable anatomical structure from the variable pathological components. This separation allows the diffusion model to focus specifically on learning the distribution of disease-related changes without being distracted by anatomical variations. By localizing generative uncertainty to the lesion space, the model can better capture the complex heterogeneity within tumors while maintaining the integrity of surrounding healthy tissue. The conditional nature of the deviation model enables controlled synthesis that respects both the anatomical context and disease characteristics, leading to more realistic pathological images with coherent boundaries.

- Anatomical disentanglement: Why needed - separate stable structures from disease-related changes; Quick check - grasp the concept of latent space separation
- Conditional generation: Why needed - control synthesis based on disease characteristics; Quick check - understand conditioning mechanisms in generative models
- Residual learning: Why needed - focus on disease-specific variations; Quick check - understand additive deviation frameworks
- Perceptual quality metrics: Why needed - evaluate realism of synthetic medical images; Quick check - understand FID and similar metrics
- Anatomical fidelity preservation: Why needed - ensure synthetic images maintain realistic tissue relationships; Quick check - understand segmentation-based evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Anatomical Encoder -> Anatomical Decoder -> Deviation Space -> Conditional Diffusion Model -> Residual Addition -> Final Synthesis

**Critical Path:** The most critical components are the anatomical encoder/decoder pair that establishes the base anatomy, and the conditional deviation diffusion model that generates disease-specific residuals. The success of the framework depends on the quality of this anatomical foundation and the accuracy of the deviation synthesis.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The explicit disentanglement approach trades computational complexity for improved control and interpretability. While more complex than holistic approaches, it provides better localization of generative uncertainty and more realistic pathology synthesis. The reliance on ground truth pathology masks during training provides supervision but may limit applicability in scenarios where such annotations are unavailable.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor anatomical preservation manifests as unrealistic tissue boundaries or structural distortions in the synthesized images. Insufficient deviation modeling appears as overly uniform or unrealistic pathology patterns. Training instability in the diffusion model can lead to artifacts or mode collapse in the generated lesions.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Validate anatomical preservation by comparing synthesized healthy images against real healthy scans using segmentation metrics
2. Test deviation synthesis quality by generating synthetic pathologies and evaluating their distribution against real pathological cases
3. Assess controlled synthesis by varying disease characteristics and measuring the corresponding changes in generated pathology

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges several open questions regarding the generalizability of the disentangled deviation framework to other anatomical regions and pathologies beyond brain tumors. The evaluation primarily on the BraTS 2020 dataset raises questions about performance across diverse clinical scenarios. The claim of controlled synthesis of internal lesion heterogeneity requires validation across varying tumor types and imaging protocols. The dependency on ground truth pathology masks for training presents practical limitations for clinical deployment. The perceptual realism improvements need larger-scale human reader studies for clinical validation, and the computational efficiency for real-time applications remains unaddressed.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability to pathologies beyond brain tumors and may not capture diverse disease presentations
- Dependency on ground truth pathology masks for training restricts applicability in data-scarce clinical settings
- Claims of controlled synthesis require validation across multiple tumor types and imaging protocols
- Perceptual realism improvements need larger human reader studies to confirm clinical utility
- Computational efficiency for real-time clinical applications is not addressed

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Technical implementation of the disentangled deviation framework and its superiority over baseline methods on the tested dataset

**Medium confidence:**
- Improvements for segmentation and classification metrics, pending external validation
- Anatomical fidelity preservation claims, as current evaluation relies on established metrics rather than comprehensive clinical validation

**Low confidence:**
- Generalization claims to other pathologies and imaging modalities

## Next Checks
1. External validation on multi-institutional datasets with diverse tumor types and imaging protocols
2. Clinical reader study comparing synthetic pathology images against real cases for diagnostic utility
3. Assessment of model performance when trained without ground truth pathology masks, using unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches
