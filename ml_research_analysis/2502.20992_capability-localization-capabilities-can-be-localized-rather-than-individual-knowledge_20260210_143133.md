# Capability Localization: Capabilities Can be Localized rather than Individual Knowledge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.20992
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20992
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Data commonalities, rather than individual knowledge, can be localized in LLMs

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the conventional approach of localizing individual knowledge within large language models by demonstrating that existing methods fail to consistently identify the same knowledge across different prompts. Through extensive fidelity and reliability experiments, the authors show that traditional localization techniques produce unreliable results. Instead, they propose that data commonalities - shared attributes across data points - can be successfully localized. To support this claim, they introduce the Commonality Neuron Localization (CNL) method, which identifies neurons corresponding to these shared attributes. The approach achieves a 96.42% neuron overlap rate on the GSM8K dataset and demonstrates that these commonality neurons are linked to model capabilities, potentially enhancing performance across datasets.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces the Commonality Neuron Localization (CNL) method as an alternative to traditional knowledge localization approaches. CNL focuses on identifying neurons that correspond to shared data attributes rather than attempting to locate individual pieces of knowledge. The method works by analyzing patterns of neuron activation across similar data points to identify commonalities. These commonality neurons are then evaluated for their impact on model capabilities. The authors validate their approach through experiments on the GSM8K dataset, demonstrating high consistency in neuron identification across different prompts and showing that these neurons are associated with enhanced model performance. The CNL method represents a shift from attempting to localize specific knowledge to identifying general capabilities based on data commonalities.

## Key Results
- Existing knowledge localization methods fail to consistently identify the same knowledge across different prompts
- CNL achieves 96.42% neuron overlap rate on the GSM8K dataset
- Identified commonality neurons are linked to model capabilities and can enhance performance across datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper argues that traditional knowledge localization fails because individual knowledge pieces are too ephemeral and context-dependent to be reliably localized in neural networks. Instead, the authors propose that capabilities emerge from patterns of activation across similar data points - what they call "commonalities." These commonalities represent stable features that the model consistently uses across different contexts. The CNL method leverages this insight by identifying neurons that activate consistently for shared attributes rather than attempting to track individual knowledge instances. This approach works because neural networks naturally develop representations that capture statistical regularities in the training data, and these regularities manifest as consistent activation patterns that can be identified and localized.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge localization**: The process of identifying specific neurons or components responsible for particular pieces of information in a model. Needed to understand why traditional approaches fail. Quick check: Can you explain why individual knowledge localization is unreliable across prompts?
- **Neuron activation patterns**: How neurons respond to different inputs and how these responses can be analyzed. Needed to understand how CNL identifies commonality neurons. Quick check: Can you describe what makes a neuron a "commonality neuron"?
- **Capability vs. knowledge**: The distinction between specific facts/information (knowledge) and general abilities (capabilities). Needed to understand the paper's core argument. Quick check: Can you explain why the authors believe capabilities are more localizable than individual knowledge?
- **Fidelity and reliability experiments**: Methods for testing whether localization techniques consistently identify the same neurons across different conditions. Needed to understand the evaluation framework. Quick check: Can you describe what makes a localization method "reliable"?
- **Data commonalities**: Shared attributes or patterns across multiple data points. Needed to understand the core concept behind CNL. Quick check: Can you provide an example of a data commonality in a language task?
- **Neuron overlap rate**: A metric measuring how consistently the same neurons are identified across different runs or conditions. Needed to evaluate localization methods. Quick check: Can you calculate overlap rate given two sets of identified neurons?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input data → Neuron activation analysis → Commonality identification → Capability assessment → Performance evaluation

**Critical path**: The critical path involves analyzing neuron activations across similar data points to identify commonality neurons, then testing whether these neurons correlate with and enhance model capabilities. This path is essential because it directly addresses the paper's core claim that capabilities (not individual knowledge) can be localized.

**Design tradeoffs**: The paper trades the granularity of individual knowledge localization for the reliability of capability-based localization. This means accepting that we cannot pinpoint specific facts but can identify general abilities. The tradeoff is justified by the empirical demonstration that individual knowledge localization is unreliable, while capability localization shows high consistency and practical utility.

**Failure signatures**: If CNL fails, it would manifest as low neuron overlap rates across different prompts, inability to identify neurons that consistently correlate with capabilities, or failure to demonstrate performance enhancement when manipulating identified neurons. These failures would indicate that either the commonality concept doesn't capture stable model features or that the relationship between commonalities and capabilities is weaker than proposed.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test CNL on multiple diverse datasets beyond GSM8K to verify generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing identified commonality neurons to assess causal impact
3. Compare CNL performance against established capability localization methods on benchmark tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The relationship between "commonality" and "capability" needs clearer theoretical grounding - while the paper demonstrates correlation, causation remains to be established
- The methodology's reliance on a single dataset (GSM8K) for demonstrating the 96.42% neuron overlap rate limits generalizability
- The claim that these neurons "enhance performance across datasets" requires more rigorous cross-dataset validation to establish true capability transfer rather than dataset-specific adaptation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The failure of existing localization methods to consistently identify individual knowledge across prompts is well-demonstrated
- **Medium confidence**: The CNL method successfully identifies consistent neurons for data commonalities within tested datasets
- **Low confidence**: The claim that identified neurons represent general capabilities that enhance performance across datasets

## Next Checks
1. Test CNL-identified neurons across multiple diverse datasets (beyond GSM8K) to verify capability generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies removing identified commonality neurons to assess their causal impact on model capabilities
3. Compare CNL performance against established capability localization methods on benchmark tasks to establish relative effectiveness
