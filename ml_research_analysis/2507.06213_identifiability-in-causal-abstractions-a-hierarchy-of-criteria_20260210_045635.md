# Identifiability in Causal Abstractions: A Hierarchy of Criteria

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06213
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06213
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Formalizes a hierarchy of identifiability criteria for causal abstractions, proving that identifiability by common graphical criteria is equivalent to identifiability by common do-calculus.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a formal hierarchy of identifiability criteria for causal queries within collections of causal diagrams (causal abstractions). The framework ranges from the most restrictive criterion—requiring a common do-calculus proof across all graphs—to the most permissive—allowing identifiability given knowledge of the true observational density. A key theoretical contribution is proving that identifiability by common graphical criteria is equivalent to identifiability by common do-calculus, and that both imply weaker forms of identifiability. The paper also demonstrates that for any collection of causal diagrams, it suffices to check identifiability only on the maximal graphs under inclusion, providing a significant computational simplification. An open conjecture remains regarding whether a gap exists between the most permissive and intermediate criteria.

## Method Summary
The paper formalizes identifiability criteria using acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) and Pearl's do-calculus. It defines four key notions: identifiability by common graphical criteria (ICGC), identifiability by common do-calculus (ICD), identifiability through graphs (IG), and identifiability knowing the true observational density (IGP). The authors prove the equivalence of ICGC and ICD, and establish a hierarchy of implications among all four criteria. A central computational result shows that for any collection of causal diagrams, checking identifiability on the maximal elements under graph inclusion is sufficient, reducing the verification burden.

## Key Results
- Proved equivalence between identifiability by common graphical criteria (ICGC) and identifiability by common do-calculus (ICD)
- Established hierarchy: ICGC ⇔ ICD ⇒ IG ⇒ IGP
- Demonstrated computational simplification: checking only maximal graphs under inclusion is sufficient
- Identified an open conjecture: whether IG is strictly stronger than ICD (i.e., whether there exists a class where IG holds but ICD fails)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Maximal Graph Reduction
- Claim: Identifiability across a collection of causal diagrams can be determined by examining only the maximal elements of that collection under graph inclusion.
- Mechanism: Subgraph relationships preserve graphical independence. If a causal estimand, do-calculus proof, or graphical criterion is valid for a graph G1, it remains valid for any of its subgraphs G2 (where V2 ⊆ V1 and E2 ⊆ E1). Therefore, to find a common solution for an entire class C, it suffices to validate the solution against the subset of maximal elements C_max, as all other graphs are subgraphs of these.
- Core assumption: The identifiability criterion is purely graphical (e.g., IG, ICD, ICGC) and relies solely on conditional independence constraints implied by the graph structure.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "A key property is that for any collection of causal diagrams, it suffices to consider only the maximal graphs under inclusion, simplifying identifiability checks." [section] Theorem 2: "P(y | do(x), z) is identifiable in C if and only if [it] is identifiable in C_max."

### Mechanism 2: Equivalence of Graphical Criteria and Do-Calculus
- Claim: Identifiability by a common graphical criterion (ICGC) and identifiability by common do-calculus (ICD) are formally equivalent.
- Mechanism: A "graphical criterion" is defined by a set of conditional independence conditions. A "do-calculus proof" consists of a sequence of rules, each requiring a specific conditional independence. The paper argues that if a query is identifiable by common do-calculus, the conjunction of conditions from the proof steps constitutes a common graphical criterion. Conversely, the independence conditions of any common graphical criterion can be mapped to the rules of do-calculus.
- Core assumption: The equivalence relies on standard Pearl do-calculus rules and assumes "graphical criteria" are fundamentally based on checking d-separation conditions.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The paper proves that identifiability by common graphical criteria is equivalent to identifiability by common do-calculus..." [section] Theorem 3 states "ICGC ⇔ ICD".

### Mechanism 3: Hierarchy of Identifiability Criteria
- Claim: More relaxed identifiability criteria can succeed where stricter ones fail, forming a hierarchy of logical implications.
- Mechanism: The criteria form a hierarchy based on the constraints imposed. ICD is strict because it requires a single proof (and thus a single estimand form) for all graphs. IG is more relaxed, allowing different proofs for different graphs as long as the final estimand is identical. IGP is the most relaxed (easiest to satisfy) because it constrains the compatible SCMs further by requiring their observational distribution to match the known P*, providing disambiguating information.
- Core assumption: The hierarchy is strict, meaning there exist cases where a weaker criterion succeeds and a stronger one fails. The separation between IG and ICD is currently an open conjecture.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "...identifiability by common do-calculus... imply identifiability through graphs, which in turn implies identifiability knowing the true observational density." [section] Example 2 demonstrates a case where a query is not IG (and thus not ICD) but becomes IGP when P* is known and implies independence.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMGs) and D-separation
- Why needed here: The framework is built on causal diagrams formalized as ADMGs, which include both directed (→) and dashed-bidirected (↔) edges. Understanding d-separation is required to grasp the graphical independence conditions used in do-calculus rules and graphical criteria.
- Quick check question: In an ADMG with X → Y ← Z, is X d-separated from Z?

### Concept: Pearl's Do-Calculus
- Why needed here: Key identifiability notions (ICD) are defined based on the existence of a valid do-calculus proof. Knowing the three rules is essential to understand what a "common proof" entails.
- Quick check question: What does Rule 2 of do-calculus allow you to convert P(y|do(x), z) into?

### Concept: Graphical Inclusion and Subgraphs
- Why needed here: This is the core of the paper's main computational simplification. Understanding that G2 ⊆ G1 implies conditional independence relationships are preserved is critical.
- Quick check question: If G2 ⊆ G1, does an independence relationship that holds in G1 also hold in G2?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input (collection C, query Q) -> Abstraction Engine (compute C_max) -> Identifiability Checker (test IG, ICD, ICGC) -> Knowledge Integrator (apply IGP if P* known)

### Critical Path
1. Start with a set of plausible causal graphs C
2. Compute C_max by removing all non-maximal graphs
3. Attempt to find a single do-calculus proof that holds in every graph in C_max. Success yields ICD (and thus ICGC)
4. Failure at step 3 does not mean IG fails. One must then check if different, valid proofs for each graph in C_max yield the same estimand

### Design Tradeoffs
- Checking only C_max vs. all of C: Checking C_max is more efficient but relies on the correctness of Lemma 1 for graphical criteria
- ICD vs. IG: Aiming for ICD is computationally more tractable (finding one proof) but is a stronger condition. IG is more general but may require checking each graph and comparing results

### Failure Signatures
- A query is not ICD if a do-calculus step's required d-separation condition fails in even one graph in C_max
- A query is not IG if two graphs in C_max yield different valid estimands

### First 3 Experiments
1. Implement the subgraph reduction on a collection of sample ADMGs to confirm it correctly identifies C_max
2. Build a simple do-calculus prover and test it on a known class of graphs (e.g., from Example 1) to verify ICD
3. Construct a case study based on Example 2: create a collection C={X→Y, X←Y}, show IG fails, then introduce a distribution P* where X⊥Y and show IGP succeeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does there exist a class of causal diagrams and a causal query such that the query is identifiable through graphs (IG) but is not identifiable by common do-calculus (ICD)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 (titled "IG VS ICD CONJECTURE") and the Abstract state this as an open conjecture
- Why unresolved: The authors have not found a concrete example of a class where IG holds but ICD fails, nor have they proven that such a class cannot exist
- What evidence would resolve it: Providing two causal diagrams and valid do-calculus proofs that yield the same identification formula but share no single common proof (proving the conjecture), or demonstrating a uniform procedure that derives a common do-calculus proof for any IG-query (disproving it)

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the algorithmic complexity associated with verifying the different notions of identifiability (IG, ICD, ICGC)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 (Conclusion) states it is "essential to rigorously classify the algorithmic complexity associated with each identifiability notion"
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on formalizing the definitions and logical hierarchy (implications) between criteria rather than analyzing the computational cost of verification
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal complexity analysis (e.g., NP-hardness proofs) or the derivation of efficient verification algorithms for specific graph classes

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can one systematically construct or identify causal abstractions that minimize the number of maximal elements to ensure tractable identifiability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.1 and Corollary 1 suggest that designing abstractions with few maximal elements is a "good practice" for computational tractability, implying a need for methods to achieve this
- Why unresolved: While the paper proves that one only needs to check maximal elements (Theorem 2), it does not provide methodology for designing abstractions that result in a small set of such elements
- What evidence would resolve it: Algorithms or theoretical constraints that guarantee a resulting collection of diagrams C has a bounded number of maximal elements under inclusion

## Limitations

- The open conjecture about the gap between IG and ICD remains unresolved, potentially limiting the claimed strict hierarchy
- The paper provides theoretical framework but lacks empirical validation through extensive case studies or synthetic experiments
- Computational efficiency claims regarding maximal graph reduction are proven but not empirically demonstrated

## Confidence

- **High**: The equivalence between ICGC and ICD (Theorem 3) is well-supported by the paper's definitions and proof structure
- **Medium**: The hierarchy of implications (ICGC ⇔ ICD ⇒ IG ⇒ IGP) is logically sound within the paper's framework, but the strictness of the hierarchy (particularly between IG and ICD) is contingent on the unresolved conjecture
- **Low**: The computational efficiency claim regarding checking only maximal graphs (Theorem 2) is proven but its practical performance impact is not empirically demonstrated

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Validation of the Hierarchy**: Construct a diverse set of synthetic causal diagrams and queries to test the practical implications of the hierarchy. Specifically, seek to find or refute a case where IG holds but ICD does not, directly addressing the open conjecture.

2. **Algorithmic Efficiency Testing**: Implement the maximal graph reduction algorithm and benchmark its performance against a brute-force approach for collections of varying sizes and complexities. Measure the computational savings and identify any edge cases where the reduction might be less effective.

3. **Cross-Formalisms Application**: Attempt to map the paper's identifiability criteria to a different causal inference framework (e.g., potential outcomes) to assess the generality of the hierarchy and the computational simplifications.
