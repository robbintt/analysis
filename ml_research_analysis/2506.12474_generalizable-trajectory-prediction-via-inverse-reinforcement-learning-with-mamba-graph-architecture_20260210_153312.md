# Generalizable Trajectory Prediction via Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Mamba-Graph Architecture

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.12474
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12474
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Primary result**: Achieves 2.3× higher cross-scenario generalization than other IRL-based methods for trajectory prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel inverse reinforcement learning framework for trajectory prediction that combines Mamba blocks with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents. The method learns diverse reward functions from human demonstrations, enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability in complex urban environments. Experimental results demonstrate superior prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, achieving results competitive with fine-tuning methods without requiring ground truth data from target scenarios.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence modeling with graph attention networks to capture spatial interactions among multiple traffic agents. The method employs inverse reinforcement learning to infer reward functions from human driving demonstrations, allowing the system to adapt to diverse driving scenarios without requiring scenario-specific training data. The architecture processes sequential trajectory data while maintaining computational efficiency, addressing the challenge of accurate driving behavior modeling in complex urban environments.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2.3× higher generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other IRL-based methods
- Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in prediction accuracy on urban intersections and roundabouts
- Demonstrates competitive results with fine-tuning approaches while eliminating the need for ground truth data from target scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of Mamba blocks with graph attention networks enables efficient processing of long sequences while capturing complex spatial relationships between traffic agents. Mamba's selective state spaces provide computational advantages over transformers for long-horizon predictions, while graph attention networks effectively model the pairwise interactions and dependencies among multiple agents in dynamic environments. The inverse reinforcement learning component allows the system to learn generalizable reward functions from demonstrations, facilitating adaptation to new scenarios without requiring extensive retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)**: Learns reward functions from expert demonstrations rather than directly imitating actions; needed because it enables generalization to new scenarios by capturing underlying driving preferences rather than memorizing specific trajectories
- **Mamba Architecture**: Uses selective state spaces for efficient sequence modeling; needed because it provides computational advantages over transformers for long sequences while maintaining modeling capacity
- **Graph Attention Networks**: Models spatial relationships between multiple agents; needed because it captures complex interaction patterns that are critical for accurate multi-agent trajectory prediction

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Raw trajectory data -> Mamba blocks -> Graph attention networks -> Reward function learning -> Trajectory prediction

**Critical Path**: Input sequences are processed through Mamba blocks for efficient temporal modeling, then passed through graph attention layers to capture agent interactions, before being used to infer reward functions that guide final trajectory predictions

**Design Tradeoffs**: Mamba blocks trade some modeling flexibility for computational efficiency, particularly beneficial for long sequences; graph attention networks add spatial modeling capability at the cost of increased complexity in multi-agent scenarios

**Failure Signatures**: Poor generalization when training demonstrations lack diversity in driving behaviors; degraded performance on scenarios with significantly different agent interaction patterns than training data

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare prediction accuracy with and without Mamba blocks while keeping graph attention constant
2. Test generalization performance across different urban scenario types
3. Evaluate the impact of varying the number of attention heads in the graph attention network

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation focuses primarily on structured urban environments, potentially limiting generalizability to unstructured scenarios
- Claims about complex urban environment performance lack validation across varied environmental conditions
- Computational efficiency benefits of Mamba blocks require more thorough quantification against transformer baselines

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core architectural contribution of combining Mamba blocks with graph attention networks is technically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about achieving competitive results without ground truth data are supported but could benefit from more rigorous ablation studies
- **Low Confidence**: Assertions about superior performance in complex urban environments lack comprehensive validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive testing on unstructured environments including construction zones, rural roads, and scenarios with non-standard traffic participants
2. Implement controlled experiments comparing Mamba-based efficiency against transformer baselines with identical graph attention components
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each architectural component to overall performance improvements
