# FairLRF: Achieving Fairness through Sparse Low Rank Factorization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16549
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16549
- Authors: Yuanbo Guo; Jun Xia; Yiyu Shi
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: FairLRF achieves 6.2% higher average precision, 1.1% lower equalized opportunity, and 1.5% lower equalized odds compared to baseline methods on Fitzpatrick-17k dataset

## Executive Summary
FairLRF introduces a novel framework that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to improve deep learning model fairness while maintaining high performance. The method identifies that unitary matrices from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across sensitive groups, and selectively removes bias-inducing elements to reduce group disparities. This approach processes VGG-11 models on CelebA and Fitzpatrick-17k datasets, outperforming conventional SVD methods and state-of-the-art fairness-oriented compression techniques without requiring fine-tuning or retraining.

## Method Summary
FairLRF operates by applying SVD to weight matrices in deep learning models, then analyzing the resulting unitary matrices to identify which elements contribute most to bias across sensitive groups. The framework selectively removes or modifies these bias-inducing elements while preserving model performance. Unlike traditional fairness approaches that require retraining or fine-tuning, FairLRF achieves fairness improvements through sparse low-rank factorization alone. The method demonstrates particular promise for medical applications where maintaining accuracy while reducing bias is critical.

## Key Results
- On Fitzpatrick-17k dataset: 6.2% higher average precision, 1.1% lower equalized opportunity, and 1.5% lower equalized odds compared to best baseline
- Outperforms conventional SVD methods and state-of-the-art fairness-oriented compression techniques
- Achieves fairness improvements without requiring fine-tuning or retraining
- Demonstrates effectiveness on both CelebA and Fitzpatrick-17k datasets using VGG-11 models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the observation that unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across sensitive groups. By selectively removing bias-inducing elements from these matrices while preserving the remaining structure, FairLRF can reduce group disparities without sacrificing performance. The sparse low-rank factorization allows the method to maintain computational efficiency while achieving significant fairness improvements, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained medical applications.

## Foundational Learning
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Matrix factorization technique that decomposes matrices into unitary and diagonal components. Why needed: Core mathematical foundation for identifying bias-inducing elements. Quick check: Verify understanding of how SVD decomposes weight matrices into U, Σ, and V^T components.
- **Equalized Odds/Fairness Metrics**: Statistical measures that evaluate model fairness across sensitive groups. Why needed: Quantify fairness improvements and validate effectiveness. Quick check: Understand the mathematical definitions of equalized odds and opportunity metrics.
- **Sparse Matrix Operations**: Techniques for efficiently manipulating matrices with many zero elements. Why needed: Enable computational efficiency in bias removal process. Quick check: Confirm knowledge of sparse matrix storage formats and operations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Model → SVD Decomposition → Bias Analysis → Element Removal → Output Model

**Critical Path**: The SVD decomposition and bias analysis steps form the critical path, as they determine which elements will be removed and directly impact both fairness and performance outcomes.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades off between bias reduction and performance preservation, requiring careful selection of elements to remove. The choice between aggressive bias removal (potentially harming performance) versus conservative approaches (limited fairness gains) represents a key design consideration.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor fairness improvements may indicate insufficient bias-inducing elements were identified, while significant performance degradation suggests over-aggressive element removal. The method may also fail when unitary matrices don't exhibit clear bias patterns.

**First Experiments**:
1. Apply FairLRF to a pre-trained VGG-11 model on CelebA dataset to verify basic functionality
2. Compare fairness metrics (equalized odds, opportunity) before and after FairLRF processing
3. Evaluate performance retention by measuring accuracy changes post-processing
