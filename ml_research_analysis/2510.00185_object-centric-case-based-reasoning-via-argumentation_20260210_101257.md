# Object-Centric Case-Based Reasoning via Argumentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00185
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00185
- Authors: Gabriel de Olim Gaul; Adam Gould; Avinash Kori; Francesca Toni
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SAA-CBR achieves 75.13% accuracy on CLEVR-Hans3 and 62.87% on CLEVR-Hans7, outperforming purely neural baselines while demonstrating strong generalization.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SAA-CBR, a neuro-symbolic pipeline that combines Slot Attention with Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning to perform interpretable image classification. The approach separates visual perception from logical reasoning, using Slot Attention to extract object-centric representations from images, which are then classified into attributes by MLPs. The symbolic AA-CBR layer reasons over these attributes using novel super-features, count-based partial orders, and casebase reduction via clustering. Experiments on CLEVR-Hans datasets show SAA-CBR achieves competitive performance with strong generalization across test sets.

## Method Summary
SAA-CBR is a two-stage neuro-symbolic pipeline that combines object-centric learning via Slot Attention with symbolic reasoning through Abstract Argumentation-based Case-Based Reasoning. The neural component extracts object-centric representations from images using Slot Attention and classifies them into attributes (color, shape, size) via MLPs. The symbolic component reasons over these attributes using super-features, count-based partial orders, and a reduced casebase created through clustering and uncertainty filtering. The system employs a One-Vs-Rest strategy for multi-class classification and uses Supported AA-CBR to predict image classes based on argumentative relationships between cases.

## Key Results
- SAA-CBR achieves 75.13% accuracy on CLEVR-Hans3 and 62.87% on CLEVR-Hans7 (modified) datasets
- Outperforms purely neural baselines on CLEVR-Hans datasets
- Demonstrates strong generalization across test sets
- Effectively handles unseen rule compositions through object-centric reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Separating visual perception from logical reasoning via object-centric slots allows the system to generalize to unseen rule compositions better than monolithic neural networks. The Slot Attention module creates discrete "slots" (object representations) from raw pixels, which are classified into attributes. The symbolic AA-CBR layer then reasons over these attributes rather than unstructured latent vectors, forcing the model to solve tasks based on object presence and relations rather than confounding visual variables.

### Mechanism 2
Using "super-features" and count-based partial orders enables the reasoning engine to distinguish relevant attributes and object quantities without learning scalar weights. Instead of weighting individual features, the model combines them into "super-features" (e.g., "small_metal_cube") and uses a novel partial order that compares cases based on the count of these features. Case A is considered an exception to Case B if A has at least as many of every feature type as B and strictly more of at least one.

### Mechanism 3
Clustering and uncertainty filtering act as a denoising layer, allowing the sensitive symbolic reasoner to handle neural noise and scale to larger datasets. The pipeline uses k-Means clustering and filters out low-confidence predictions to build a "casebase" of representative prototypes, reducing noise and computational load while maintaining argumentative quality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Slot Attention (SA)** - Why needed: This is the perceptual backbone that binds pixels to permutation-equivariant "slots" (objects). Quick check: Can you explain why SA uses a GRU and iterative refinement to update slot representations?

- **Concept: Abstract Argumentation (AA)** - Why needed: This is the reasoning backbone that uses "attack relations" and "grounded semantics" to determine which arguments survive. Quick check: In a graph where Argument A attacks B, and B attacks C, if A is unattacked, what is the status of C under grounded semantics?

- **Concept: Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)** - Why needed: The system classifies images by comparing them to past "cases" rather than learned weights. Understanding that "exceptionality" defines a hierarchy of rules is critical for tuning the partial order. Quick check: How does the "default argument" determine the baseline prediction in the absence of conflicting evidence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** CNN Encoder -> Slot Attention -> MLP Heads (Color/Shape/Size) -> Feature Combiner (super-features) -> AA-CBR Engine (casebase, argumentation graph, grounded extension)

- **Critical path:** The alignment between the MLP Heads and the AA-CBR Casebase. The MLPs must output attributes that match the symbols stored in the casebase. If the MLP misses an attribute, the AA-CBR engine might evaluate the case against the wrong "partial order," leading to misclassification.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Two-stage training separates neural feature extraction from symbolic reasoning during training, ensuring clean symbol grounding but preventing gradient flow from reasoning loss back to the vision encoder. The model relies on hard decisions (clustering/filtering) for interpretability but risks propagating early errors if neural classifiers are uncertain.

- **Failure signatures:** "Empty Slot" loops occur if SA produces empty slots for background that aren't correctly classified as "absence." OvR Ambiguity arises when multiple binary AA-CBR models predict "positive" for their focus class, requiring a resolution strategy.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Visualize Slot Attention: Pass CLEVR images through SA module and visualize the mask for each slot to ensure objects are properly disentangled.
  2. MLP Accuracy Check: Evaluate attribute prediction accuracy of MLP heads independently; if accuracy is below 95%, downstream argumentation will fail.
  3. Hyperparameter Sweep (Cluster Size): Run AA-CBR pipeline on validation set while varying n_clusters (e.g., 100 vs 900) and plot accuracy vs. casebase size to find the "denoising" sweet spot.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can Slot Attention and AA-CBR be trained jointly in an end-to-end manner to improve performance over the current two-stage pipeline? The authors explicitly state in the Conclusion that "Future work can explore end-to-end training of both AA-CBR and slot attention," noting that the NS-CL baseline's end-to-end training might explain its higher performance.

### Open Question 2
Can feature combinations be learned dynamically within the model rather than selected post-hoc? The paper notes on page 5 (Footnote 1) and in the Conclusion that the current approach leads to a "combinatorial number of super-features" and suggests that "future work should look at feature combination methods that can be learned with the model."

### Open Question 3
Does constructing representative samples based on downstream argumentation context outperform generic k-means clustering for casebase reduction? The Conclusion suggests that "improvements to constructing representative samples that consider the downstream argumentation process may prove more effective than using k-means clustering."

## Limitations
- Performance variability across datasets with different spatial relationship requirements
- Heavy dependence on cluster quality for casebase construction, with potential for under-clustering or over-clustering
- Opaqueness in conflict resolution mechanism for the One-Vs-Rest multi-class strategy

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core neuro-symbolic pipeline (SA + AA-CBR) is technically sound and the integration of super-features with count-based partial orders is a novel and well-motivated contribution.
- **Medium confidence**: Generalization claims are supported by CLEVR-Hans experiments, but extent of real-world data transfer remains unclear.
- **Low confidence**: Impact of casebase reduction via clustering is asserted but not empirically validated with ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Cluster sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary `n_clusters` and distance metrics in k-Means to quantify their impact on AA-CBR accuracy and casebase representativeness.

2. **Failure case visualization**: For a subset of misclassified images, visualize SA slots, MLP attribute predictions, and the corresponding argumentation graph to pinpoint where the reasoning chain breaks.

3. **Spatial relationship extension**: Modify the partial order to include discretized positional features (e.g., "left_of", "right_of") and test on CLEVR-Hans7 to assess performance on spatially-dependent rules.
