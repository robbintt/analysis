# Streaming Multi-agent Pathfinding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.09472
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09472

- Key outcome: ASCBS outperforms traditional MAPF solvers in runtime for long working hours while maintaining solution quality

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces streaming multi-agent pathfinding (S-MAPF), a variant designed for scenarios with periodic agent arrivals and long working hours, such as assembly lines. In S-MAPF, agents form streams with periodic start times and share the same action sequence. The authors propose Agent Stream Conflict-Based Search (ASCBS), a two-level algorithm that resolves conflicts between agent streams using cyclic vertex and edge constraints. ASCBS incorporates disjoint splitting and employs A* as the low-level solver.

## Method Summary
ASCBS operates as a two-level algorithm where the high-level component identifies conflicts between agent streams and the low-level component (A*) finds individual agent paths within the constraints imposed by stream conflicts. The algorithm uses cyclic vertex and edge constraints to prevent conflicts between streams with different periodicities. When conflicts arise, disjoint splitting is employed to find alternative paths that satisfy all constraints.

## Key Results
- ASCBS outperforms traditional MAPF solvers in runtime for long working hours
- The algorithm maintains solution quality comparable to non-streaming approaches
- A* variant proves more efficient than IDA* in practice

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ASCBS leverages the structural regularity of streaming scenarios where agents follow periodic patterns. By treating streams as atomic units and applying cyclic constraints, the algorithm reduces the search space compared to traditional MAPF approaches. The two-level design allows for efficient conflict resolution while maintaining optimality through disjoint splitting when necessary.

## Foundational Learning
- Cyclic vertex constraints: Why needed - Prevent agents from occupying the same vertex at the same time across different cycles; Quick check - Verify constraint periodicity matches agent stream periodicity
- Cyclic edge constraints: Why needed - Prevent agents from traversing the same edge in opposite directions simultaneously; Quick check - Ensure bidirectional edge conflicts are properly detected
- Disjoint splitting: Why needed - Resolve conflicts by finding alternative paths that maintain stream integrity; Quick check - Confirm split paths remain within the same stream family
- Two-level search: Why needed - Separate stream-level conflict resolution from agent-level pathfinding; Quick check - Validate high-level conflicts correctly trigger low-level searches

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Agent streams -> Conflict detection -> Constraint application -> Low-level pathfinding -> Solution assembly

### Critical Path
1. Stream initialization and periodic schedule generation
2. High-level conflict detection between streams
3. Constraint propagation and application
4. Low-level A* pathfinding within constraints
5. Solution validation and output

### Design Tradeoffs
The algorithm trades off generality for efficiency by assuming homogeneous action sequences within streams. This assumption enables more aggressive constraint propagation but limits applicability to scenarios where agents can follow identical paths. The two-level design adds implementation complexity but provides better scalability for long working hours.

### Failure Signatures
- Inability to resolve stream conflicts within the constraint system
- Excessive computational overhead when streams have vastly different periodicities
- Path infeasibility due to overly restrictive cyclic constraints

### First 3 Experiments to Run
1. Baseline comparison with traditional MAPF solvers on identical streaming scenarios
2. Stress test with varying stream arrival rates and periodicities
3. Performance evaluation across different map topologies and obstacle densities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The assumption of identical action sequences within streams may limit applicability to heterogeneous scenarios
- Performance evaluation is based on a specific set of benchmark scenarios
- Limited exploration of varying stream arrival rates and periodicities

## Confidence
- Optimality and completeness claims: High
- Runtime improvement claims: Medium
- Applicability to diverse scenarios: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ASCBS performance across a wider range of stream arrival rates and periodicities to assess robustness
2. Test the algorithm on diverse map topologies, including those with varying obstacle densities and corridor widths
3. Implement and compare alternative low-level solvers beyond A* to quantify the impact on overall performance
