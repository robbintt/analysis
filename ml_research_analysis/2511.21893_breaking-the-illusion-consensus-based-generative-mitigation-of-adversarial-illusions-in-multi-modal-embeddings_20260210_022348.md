# Breaking the Illusion: Consensus-Based Generative Mitigation of Adversarial Illusions in Multi-Modal Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21893
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21893
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Reduces adversarial illusion attack success rates to near-zero while improving cross-modal alignment and task accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses adversarial illusions in multi-modal embeddings, where imperceptible perturbations disrupt cross-modal alignment and mislead downstream tasks. The authors propose a task-agnostic mitigation mechanism that reconstructs perturbed inputs using generative models like VAEs or DMs, projecting them back onto the natural data manifold to restore alignment. A consensus-based sampling strategy with majority voting over multiple reconstructions further enhances robustness. Experiments on ImageBind show the method reduces illusion attack success rates to near-zero, improves cross-modal alignment (cosine similarity from 0.11 to 0.82 for perturbed inputs), and increases Top-1/Top-5 accuracy from 32%/56% to 43%/68%. The approach is post-hoc, model-agnostic, and effective across modalities without retraining.

## Method Summary
The defense reconstructs perturbed inputs through generative models (VAEs, DMs, or AEs) that map adversarial inputs into low-dimensional latent spaces and decode them back to the natural input domain. This process suppresses high-frequency, off-manifold perturbations that cause embedding misalignment. The method generates N=10 stochastic reconstructions per input through noise injection in the latent space, then aggregates predictions via majority voting across these samples. The approach requires no retraining of the target multi-modal encoder and works as a post-hoc defense layer. Best performance is achieved with VAE + Sampling configuration, achieving 43% Top-1 and 68% Top-5 accuracy on perturbed inputs while reducing target label attack success rates to near-zero.

## Key Results
- Reduces adversarial illusion attack success rates from 100% to near-zero on ImageBind
- Improves cross-modal alignment: cosine similarity from 0.11 to 0.82 for perturbed inputs
- Increases Top-1/Top-5 accuracy from 32%/56% to 43%/68% on perturbed inputs
- VAE + Sampling achieves optimal balance: 0.3±0.02s latency, stable performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Generative Reconstruction as Manifold Projection
Reconstructing perturbed inputs through generative models suppresses adversarial perturbations by projecting them onto the natural data manifold. The generative model maps adversarial inputs through a low-dimensional latent space and decodes back to the input domain. This bottleneck acts as a smooth approximation of the underlying data manifold, filtering high-frequency off-manifold perturbations that induce embedding misalignment. Core assumption: adversarial perturbations lie off the natural data manifold and will be attenuated during latent compression and reconstruction. Evidence anchors: abstract states reconstruction maintains "natural alignment," Section II-B explains suppression of "off-manifold perturbations," and the method's effectiveness demonstrates manifold filtering.

### Mechanism 2: Stochastic Sampling for Diversity-Based Robustness
Multiple stochastic reconstructions create prediction diversity that reduces sensitivity to localized perturbations. Noise injection in latent or diffusion space generates N independent reconstructions, each following slightly different paths through the generative model. This causes adversarial perturbations to propagate inconsistently across samples. Core assumption: adversarial perturbations will not consistently survive across multiple stochastic reconstruction paths. Evidence anchors: abstract mentions "generative sampling strategy combined with consensus-based aggregation," Section II-B discusses "diversity of stochastic reconstructions," though corpus evidence for stochastic sampling in multi-modal defense is limited.

### Mechanism 3: Consensus-Based Aggregation via Majority Voting
Aggregating predictions across N reconstructions reduces attack success probability following a binomial distribution requiring majority agreement. Final prediction is determined by majority vote across N samples. The attack success probability reduces from η (single sample) to the sum of binomial probabilities for majority agreement. Core assumption: per-sample attack success rate η < 0.5, enabling majority voting to reject adversarial predictions. Evidence anchors: abstract mentions "consensus-based aggregation scheme," Section II-B provides the binomial reduction formula, though consensus-based optimization literature focuses on attacks rather than defense aggregation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-modal embedding spaces (CLIP, ImageBind)
  - Why needed here: The attack and defense operate in shared embedding spaces where perturbations in one modality corrupt cross-modal alignment. Understanding that embeddings are interchangeable across modalities is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why does a small image perturbation cause misalignment with its corresponding text embedding in a multi-modal encoder?

- Concept: Adversarial perturbations via PGD optimization
  - Why needed here: The threat model uses Projected Gradient Descent to iteratively maximize cosine similarity between perturbed image embeddings and attacker-chosen target text embeddings.
  - Quick check question: How does PGD differ from single-step gradient attacks, and why does iterative optimization enable stronger cross-modal misalignment?

- Concept: Generative model latent spaces (VAE bottleneck, diffusion denoising)
  - Why needed here: The defense exploits how VAEs and diffusion models compress inputs to latent representations, attenuating information that deviates from the learned manifold.
  - Quick check question: What property of VAE latent spaces causes off-manifold perturbations to be suppressed during reconstruction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Perturbed Input (x̃ = x + δ) → Generative Model Gθ (VAE/DM with stochastic sampling) → N Reconstructions (x̂₁,...,x̂ₙ) → Multi-modal Encoder f (ImageBind) → Task Head h (Classifier/Retrieval) → N Predictions → Consensus (Majority Vote) → ŷ

- Critical path: Generative reconstruction quality determines adversarial signal suppression. VAE+Sampling achieved 43%/68% Top-1/Top-5 accuracy on perturbed inputs vs. 0%/0% without mitigation.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - VAE (0.3±0.02s) vs. DM (0.11±0.18s, higher variance): VAE offers more stable latency
  - Sample count N: Performance plateaus at N≈10; more samples add linear cost with diminishing returns
  - Reconstruction fidelity vs. perturbation suppression: Stronger semantic preservation may also retain adversarial features

- Failure signatures:
  - Low consensus agreement across N samples (high prediction variance)
  - Target label accuracy >2% indicates residual adversarial alignment
  - Cosine similarity with target label >0.3; paper achieved 0.12±0.05

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run single-sample reconstruction (no consensus) with AE, VAE, DM on held-out adversarial illusions to measure individual model effectiveness before aggregation
  2. Ablate N ∈ {1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20} to validate the N≈10 plateau on your data distribution
  3. Implement adaptive attack with VAE in optimization loop (Section IV-D) to verify defense holds under white-box conditions and measure attack cost increase

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the consensus-based generative mitigation framework effectively generalize to modalities beyond image-text alignment, such as audio or video inputs in multi-modal embedding spaces? Basis: The authors acknowledge evaluating only image-text pairs and briefly mention extension to text generation tasks, but do not test audio or video modalities despite citing AudioCLIP and ImageBind's broader capabilities. Why unresolved: Experiments are limited to the adversarial image-text benchmark, and text-generation extension shows only preliminary results with single-sample evaluation. What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation on audio-image and video-text pairs using multi-modal encoders like ImageBind under adversarial illusion attacks.

### Open Question 2
How does the defense perform against adaptive white-box attacks where the adversary explicitly accounts for the generative reconstructor during perturbation optimization? Basis: The paper states evaluation occurs "under a black-box setting, where the attacker cannot optimize through or modify the generative reconstructor," leaving white-box adaptive robustness unexplored. Why unresolved: While Section IV-D shows increased attack cost when VAE is included in optimization loop, this evaluates a constrained scenario—not a fully adaptive attacker who knows and optimizes around the complete defense pipeline. What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with adaptive PGD attacks that backpropagate through both the generative model and consensus aggregation to craft perturbations that survive the complete mitigation pipeline.

### Open Question 3
Would fine-tuning the generative models (AEs, VAEs, DMs) on the target multi-modal encoder's embedding space improve alignment recovery compared to using off-the-shelf pretrained models? Basis: The authors explicitly state building the defense "on top of pretrained generative models, rather than training a new reconstructor, because these models already approximate the natural image manifold." Why unresolved: While pretrained models are practical, they may not optimally project adversarial inputs onto the specific manifold relevant to the target encoder's embedding space. What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments between off-the-shelf vs. encoder-aligned fine-tuned generative models on alignment recovery metrics under identical attack conditions.

## Limitations
- Defense relies on strong assumptions about adversarial perturbations lying off the natural data manifold
- Consensus mechanism requires N=10 samples, introducing linear computational overhead
- Evaluation limited to ImageBind architecture and ImageNet-derived datasets
- Does not validate performance against adaptive attacks during training

## Confidence
- High confidence: Cross-modal alignment restoration (cosine similarity improvement from 0.11 to 0.82 is directly measurable and substantial)
- Medium confidence: Majority voting effectiveness (binomial reduction formula is sound, but depends on unverified assumption that per-sample attack success η < 0.5)
- Medium confidence: Manifold projection hypothesis (plausible but not rigorously validated; depends on generative model's ability to distinguish adversarial vs. natural perturbations)

## Next Checks
1. Implement adaptive attack with VAE incorporated into the optimization loop (Section IV-D) to verify defense holds under white-box conditions and measure attack cost increase
2. Evaluate on alternative multi-modal architectures (CLIP, ALIGN) to test generalization beyond ImageBind
3. Conduct ablation studies on sampling noise magnitude σ and reconstruction fidelity to identify optimal tradeoff between perturbation suppression and semantic preservation
