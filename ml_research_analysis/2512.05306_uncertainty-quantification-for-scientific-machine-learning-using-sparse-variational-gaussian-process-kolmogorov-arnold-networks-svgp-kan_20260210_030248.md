# Uncertainty Quantification for Scientific Machine Learning using Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SVGP KAN)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05306
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05306
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: Introduces scalable UQ framework for KANs using sparse variational GPs with inducing point approximations, achieving quasi-linear complexity while maintaining calibrated uncertainty estimates.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a scalable uncertainty quantification framework for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) by modeling edge functions as sparse variational Gaussian processes. The method addresses the deterministic nature of standard KANs while maintaining computational efficiency through inducing point approximations. The framework enables principled Bayesian inference with analytic moment matching through the additive KAN structure and includes a variance decomposition component for robust out-of-distribution detection. Evaluated across three studies, the approach demonstrates calibrated uncertainty estimates for heteroscedastic noise, epistemic uncertainty propagation in time-series forecasting, and anomaly detection in convolutional autoencoders.

## Method Summary
The framework replaces deterministic edge functions in KANs with sparse variational Gaussian processes using inducing point approximations. Each edge function φ_{j,i} is modeled as a GP with RBF kernel, and a variational posterior q(u) is maintained over inducing variables u = φ(Z) at M inducing points Z. Uncertainty propagates through the additive KAN structure via analytic moment matching, decomposing predictive variance into projected and orthogonal components. The model is trained by maximizing an evidence lower bound (ELBO) that balances data fit against KL regularization controlled by weight λ. The approach achieves O(NM²) complexity compared to O(N³) for full GPs, enabling uncertainty quantification in larger networks.

## Key Results
- Calibration of heteroscedastic measurement noise in fluid flow reconstruction with Pearson correlation ρ=0.55 and calibration error <1%
- Epistemic uncertainty quantification in multi-step advection-diffusion forecasting showing 2.4× temporal growth and 12.7× spatial variation in prediction uncertainty
- Out-of-distribution detection in convolutional autoencoders with ROC-AUC score of 0.964 and 5.4× higher uncertainty for anomalous inputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Inducing Point Sparsification
Approximating full GP posterior with M inducing points reduces computational complexity from O(N³) to O(NM²) while retaining uncertainty quantification. Introduce pseudo-inputs Z and inducing variables u = φ(Z). Conditioning on u renders function values at different data points approximately independent, enabling factorized inference. The variational posterior q(u) = N(m, S) is optimized via ELBO. Core assumption: M inducing points provide sufficient coverage of input domain; Nyström approximation error remains acceptable.

### Mechanism 2: Analytic Moment Matching Through Additive Structure
Uncertainty propagates through KAN layers in closed form because each layer computes y_j = Σ φ_{j,i}(x_i), enabling mean-field variance decomposition. For GP edge φ with RBF kernel and Gaussian input x ~ N(μ_x, σ_x²), expected posterior mean E[μ_φ(x)] = m^T K_ZZ^{-1} ψ₁ where ψ₁ has closed form. Output variance decomposes as V[y] = Σ(E[σ²_φ(x_i)] + V[μ_φ(x_i)]). Core assumption: Layer-wise independence (mean-field approximation) holds sufficiently; input distributions remain approximately Gaussian after propagation.

### Mechanism 3: Orthogonal Variance for Out-of-Distribution Detection
Decomposing predictive variance into V_proj + V_orth ensures uncertainty reverts to prior σ_f² when test inputs lie far from inducing points, enabling OOD detection. V_proj = k_x*^T K_ZZ^{-1} Cov(u) K_ZZ^{-1} k_x* captures uncertainty within inducing subspace. V_orth = k(x*, x*) - k_x*^T K_ZZ^{-1} k_x* measures Nyström approximation error. As x* → ∞ from inducing points, k(x*, Z) → 0, so V_proj → 0 but V_orth → σ_f². Core assumption: Prior variance σ_f² represents meaningful uncertainty scale for OOD inputs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gaussian Process Regression**
  - Why needed here: Edge functions are GP-distributed; understanding posterior predictive distribution p(f*|X, y, x*) is essential.
  - Quick check question: Given RBF kernel k(x, x') = σ_f² exp(-(x-x')²/2ℓ²), what happens to predictions as test points move far from training data?

- **Variational Inference & ELBO**
  - Why needed here: Training optimizes ELBO = E_q[log p(y|φ)] - λ·KL[q(u)||p(u)]; understanding this objective is critical for debugging.
  - Quick check question: Why does minimizing KL divergence encourage the variational posterior to cover the true posterior modes?

- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - Why needed here: Explains why learnable univariate functions on edges can represent arbitrary continuous multivariate functions.
  - Quick check question: How does the KAN structure y = Σ φ_i(x_i) differ from MLP's y = σ(Wx + b)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input -> Conv encoder (Study B/C) -> GPKANLayer bottleneck -> Conv decoder (Study B/C) OR GPKANLayer output (Study A) -> Uncertainty decomposition
- Critical path: Initialize inducing points → Forward pass (compute ψ₁ statistics, aggregate means/variances) → ELBO computation (Monte Carlo expected log-likelihood + closed-form KL) → Backprop through variational parameters and kernel hyperparameters
- Design tradeoffs:
  - M (inducing points): Higher M → better approximation, O(M²) cost per edge
  - λ (KL weight): λ ∈ [0.001, 0.1]; smaller → better fit, potentially overconfident; larger → conservative, may underfit
  - Kernel choice: RBF assumes smoothness; Matérn for less smooth functions (requires re-derived KL)
- Failure signatures:
  - Variance collapse on OOD: V_orth not being accumulated → check implementation includes full variance decomposition
  - Numerical instability in K_ZZ^{-1}: Inducing points too close → add jitter (1e-6) to diagonal
  - Mode collapse: KL term dominating → reduce λ or increase training data coverage
  - Coverage miscalibration: Predicted σ doesn't match empirical error → check heteroscedastic noise model if applicable
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Synthetic 1D regression with heteroscedastic noise: Train on y = sin(x) + ε, ε ~ N(0, 0.1 + 0.5x²). Verify predicted uncertainty correlates with true noise (target ρ > 0.4).
  2. Multi-step rollout on known dynamics: Train single-step predictor on damped oscillator. Roll out 20 steps; verify ensemble spread grows (target >2× growth) while ground truth remains stable.
  3. OOD detection on MNIST subset: Train autoencoder on digit "0" only. Test on "0" vs "7"; target ROC-AUC > 0.90 using bottleneck uncertainty.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can automatic adaptation schemes dynamically adjust the KL weight λ during training based on validation set calibration metrics, and would this improve uncertainty calibration across diverse application domains?
- **Open Question 2**: How can the framework be extended to non-Gaussian likelihoods (Poisson, Bernoulli, heavy-tailed) to broaden applicability to classification, count data, and robust regression tasks?
- **Open Question 3**: Can automatic relevance determination schemes adaptively allocate inducing points based on local function complexity rather than uniform initialization?
- **Open Question 4**: How does the framework perform on functions with discontinuities or sharp transitions when using Matérn kernels or piecewise alternatives instead of the squared exponential kernel?

## Limitations
- The framework relies on inducing point coverage assumptions that may fail in high-dimensional or multimodal input spaces, potentially leading to overconfident predictions.
- The closed-form moment matching assumes approximate Gaussianity after each layer, which may break down for strongly nonlinear transformations.
- The KL weight λ requires careful tuning per dataset, with no automated selection procedure provided.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The inducing point sparsification mechanism (Mechanism 1) and its computational complexity reduction - supported by established GP literature and the paper's explicit complexity analysis.
- **Medium confidence**: The analytic moment matching through additive structure (Mechanism 2) - theoretically sound but lacks direct empirical validation in the paper's results.
- **Medium confidence**: The orthogonal variance decomposition for OOD detection (Mechanism 3) - the theoretical framework is correct, but real-world performance depends heavily on KL weight tuning and inducing point distribution.

## Next Checks
1. Test variance collapse on OOD inputs by systematically moving test points away from training data distribution while monitoring V_orth contribution
2. Evaluate performance with different inducing point initialization strategies (uniform vs k-means) to assess sensitivity to coverage
3. Benchmark against exact GP-KAN (Chen 2024) on small datasets to quantify approximation error trade-offs
