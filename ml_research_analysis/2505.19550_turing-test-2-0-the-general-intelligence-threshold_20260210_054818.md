## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for defining and testing General Intelligence (G.I.) through the distinction between Functional Information (F.I.) and Non-Functional Information (N.F.I.). The General Intelligence Threshold (G.I.T.) is proposed as a concrete metric to determine if a system has achieved Artificial General Intelligence. The framework, called Turing Test 2.0, provides three rules for constructing tests that can detect whether a system can generate new F.I. from N.F.I. without external input. When tested against popular LLMs (ChatGPT, MetaAI, xAI, and Gemini) using two visual tasks—generating clocks showing 6:30 and hexagon-shaped stop signs—all models failed to consistently produce correct outputs, demonstrating they cannot autonomously generate new functional capabilities from their own responses.

## Method Summary
The methodology tests whether LLMs can generate new Functional Information (F.I.) from Non-Functional Information (N.F.I.) without external input. The process involves two stages: first, verifying the required information exists in the model's N.F.I. set through textual description tasks; second, requesting image generation of the target concept and checking if the output correctly combines the described elements. The test uses two specific tasks: generating an analog clock showing 6:30 (testing whether the model can map verbal clock mechanics to correct visual hand positions beyond the typical 10:10 training bias) and generating a hexagon-shaped stop sign (testing whether the model can override its trained octagon-stop sign association with hexagon geometry). Models are tested both with and without prior context, and with feedback provided on failures to check for consistency across attempts.

## Key Results
- All tested LLMs (ChatGPT, xAI, Gemini, MetaAI) failed to consistently generate correct images of clocks showing 6:30
- All tested LLMs failed to consistently generate hexagon-shaped stop signs instead of standard octagonal versions
- Models showed inconsistent performance even after multiple attempts and feedback, indicating lack of genuine capability generation
- The results demonstrate that current LLMs cannot generate new F.I. from N.F.I. without external input, failing to meet the G.I.T.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information State Transitions (N.F.I. to F.I.)
The paper proposes that General Intelligence is defined by a system's capability to convert Non-Functional Information (N.F.I.) into Functional Information (F.I.) without external input. In this framework, a system in a "generating state" analyzes raw data or content it previously could not utilize (N.F.I.) and derives new rules or capabilities (F.I.) to solve novel tasks. The system moves from a static state where F is constant, to a state where F' = F ∪ i, with i being self-generated information.

### Mechanism 2: The "Rare Instance" Test Protocol
The paper argues that existing LLMs fail G.I. because they cannot synthesize functional rules for instances statistically under-represented in their training data. The test identifies a task (e.g., drawing a specific time on a clock) where the required logic exists in the model's verbal corpus (N.F.I.), but the specific visual instance (e.g., 6:30) is rare in the image training data (F.I.).

### Mechanism 3: Recursive Sustainability (Generational Test)
The paper suggests that without the ability to generate new F.I., systems trained recursively on their own outputs will suffer "model collapse" or information stagnation. A system with G.I. should be able to train a subsequent generation (G2) using only its own generated data such that G2 maintains or expands the total F.I. set (F' ⊃ F).

## Foundational Learning

**Functional vs. Non-Functional Information**: This is the core distinction in the paper. F.I. is "how-to" knowledge (executable), while N.F.I. is raw data or descriptions not yet utilized for function. Why needed: Understanding this distinction is essential to grasp how the framework defines intelligence as the ability to transform unused knowledge into functional capability. Quick check: If an LLM can recite the rules of chess but cannot play a valid game against itself, which part is likely missing or non-functional?

**The Chinese Room Argument (Searle)**: The paper uses this as the conceptual basis for F.I./N.F.I. The "man in the room" has the instruction set (F.I.) but treats the Chinese characters as N.F.I. (no understanding of meaning). Why needed: This thought experiment illustrates the difference between having functional rules and processing non-functional symbols, which is central to the paper's definition of intelligence. Quick check: In the context of this paper, does passing the Turing Test 2.0 require the system to be the "Man," the "Room," or the "Instructions"?

**Model Collapse**: Understanding why recursive training fails (loss of information entropy/diversity) motivates the paper's definition of G.I. as a generative process rather than just a retention process. Why needed: This concept explains why the ability to generate new F.I. is necessary for sustainable AI development and why current models face degradation when trained on their own outputs. Quick check: Why does training an AI on AI-generated data typically lead to degradation, and how does "generating new F.I." hypothetically prevent this?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: System M (tested entity) -> F.I. Set (existing capabilities) -> N.F.I. Set (accessible knowledge) -> Task T (challenge requiring new information)

**Critical path**:
1. Define F.I./N.F.I. boundaries: Determine what the model "knows" explicitly vs. latently (e.g., via prompting)
2. Construct Task T: Select a request where the target output relies on a combination rare in training data (Rule ii: i ∩ F = ∅)
3. Verify N.F.I. presence: Confirm the model can describe the logic of the task verbally (Rule i: i ⊆ N)
4. Execute & Isolate: Request the task without providing external examples or corrections (Rule iii)

**Design tradeoffs**:
- Data Scarcity vs. Obscurity: Choosing tasks too obscure (e.g., "draw a 7-dimensional shape") might fail because the N.F.I. is also missing. Tasks must be simple logic combinations (e.g., hexagon + stop sign) that are semantically present but statistically rare.
- Strictness of "No External Info": Allowing "pass/fail" feedback is permitted, but gradient updates or few-shot prompting are not.

**Failure signatures**:
- Hallucination of F.I.: The system confidently generates a standard training example (e.g., 10:10 clock) despite a prompt for a specific variant (6:30)
- Inconsistent Generation: The system succeeds once but fails on a retry without context, indicating it was a "lucky guess" rather than a new functional capability

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Clock Time Test: Request an image of an analog clock showing 6:30. Verify if the hour hand is on the 6 and minute hand on the 6 (not 10:10)
2. Shape Logic Test: Request an image of a "hexagonal stop sign." Check if the model applies the hexagon shape correctly to the stop sign texture
3. Recursive Generation: Ask the model to generate a solution to a novel puzzle, then feed only that solution back as a prompt to solve a variation, checking for consistency or collapse

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can an A.I. model successfully demonstrate G.I. by passing any test constructed under the Turing Test 2.0 framework? The paper explicitly states this remains an open challenge, as no model has yet achieved the G.I.T. by passing any valid test configured under the framework.

**Open Question 2**: How can the distinction between Functional Information (F.I.) and Non-Functional Information (N.F.I.) be empirically verified in closed-source or "black-box" systems? The framework relies on assumptions about training data distribution, which limits its robustness when applied to proprietary models where training data is opaque.

**Open Question 3**: Can the "Prodigy" and "Genius" methods be formalized to quantify the level of intelligence for systems that have surpassed the G.I.T.? The paper proposes measuring Super Intelligence (S.I.) via these methods but leaves their precise formalization undefined, suggesting they could potentially be used together.

## Limitations

- Test Design Ambiguity: The distinction between F.I. and N.F.I. relies on undocumented assumptions about training data composition without empirical validation of claim that 6:30 clocks and hexagonal stop signs are statistically rare
- Scalability Concerns: The proposed test framework may not generalize to future models with different training paradigms, and the distinction between retrieval and generation could become blurred as architectures evolve
- Semantic vs. Statistical Interpretation: The framework conflates semantic understanding with functional capability, assuming correct verbal descriptions should automatically enable correct visual generation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The paper successfully demonstrates that tested LLMs (ChatGPT, xAI, Gemini, MetaAI) fail to consistently generate correct images for the proposed test cases. The experimental methodology is clearly specified and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: The theoretical framework distinguishing F.I. from N.F.I. is internally coherent and provides a novel perspective on the capabilities-requirements gap in current AI systems. The conceptual link between this distinction and the generation of new functional information follows logically from the premises.

**Low Confidence**: The paper's claim that failure on these specific tests definitively proves LLMs cannot achieve General Intelligence. The tests may measure architectural limitations rather than fundamental cognitive constraints, and the assumption about training data rarity remains unverified.

## Next Checks

1. **Training Data Rarity Analysis**: Conduct systematic analysis of public image datasets (e.g., LAION-5B, COYO-700M) to quantify actual frequency of 6:30 clock positions and hexagonal stop signs, validating whether test instances genuinely represent rare combinations.

2. **Cross-Architecture Testing**: Test the proposed framework against non-transformer architectures (e.g., state-space models like Mamba, or hybrid neuro-symbolic systems) to determine whether failure patterns are specific to current LLM designs or represent more fundamental limitations.

3. **Recursive Generation Study**: Implement the proposed "Generational Test" by training a new model exclusively on outputs from an existing LLM, then testing whether the second-generation model maintains or degrades functional capabilities, directly testing the claim about necessity of G.I. for sustainable recursive training.
