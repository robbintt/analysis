core_contribution: This paper proposes a real-time video motion transfer framework

# Inference-time Stochastic Refinement of GRU-Normalizing Flow for Real-time Video Motion Transfer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04282
- Authors: Tasmiah Haque; Srinjoy Das
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: GRU-SNF improves diversity in video motion transfer with minimal latency

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitation of GRU-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) in video motion transfer, where deterministic transformations limit expressivity and multimodal coverage. The proposed solution introduces stochastic refinement during inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling guided by an energy function that balances prior plausibility and GRU consistency. This training-free approach adds minimal latency while significantly improving the diversity of future keypoint predictions without sacrificing fidelity in real-time applications.

## Method Summary
The framework extends GRU-NF by incorporating stochastic refinement at inference time through MCMC sampling. An energy function guides the sampling process, balancing between prior plausibility and maintaining consistency with the GRU predictions. This approach addresses the fundamental limitation of GRU-NF's deterministic transformations, which constrain the model's ability to generate diverse and multimodal outputs. The method operates entirely during inference, requiring no additional training, and adds minimal computational overhead suitable for real-time applications.

## Key Results
- GRU-SNF improves energy distance in keypoint space by up to ~0.14 compared to GRU-NF
- Generated videos show APD-to-MAE ratios increasing by 4-37% across different horizons
- Better gains observed at longer prediction horizons, with more diverse facial expressions in qualitative results
- Method maintains real-time performance with minimal added latency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The stochastic refinement mechanism works by introducing controlled randomness during inference through MCMC sampling. The energy function serves as a guide, ensuring that while the sampling introduces diversity, it remains grounded in plausible motion patterns learned by the GRU-NF model. This balance allows the system to explore alternative motion trajectories that the deterministic GRU-NF would otherwise miss, effectively expanding the coverage of possible future states while maintaining temporal coherence.

## Foundational Learning

**GRU-NF (Gated Recurrent Unit - Normalizing Flows)**: A sequence model that uses GRU cells combined with normalizing flows for probabilistic sequence generation. Why needed: Provides the baseline deterministic framework that the stochastic refinement builds upon. Quick check: Understand how GRUs handle temporal dependencies and how normalizing flows enable density estimation.

**MCMC Sampling**: Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for generating samples from complex probability distributions. Why needed: Enables exploration of the solution space beyond the deterministic predictions of GRU-NF. Quick check: Review Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and its variants for understanding the sampling process.

**Energy-based Models**: Models that define probability distributions implicitly through an energy function. Why needed: The energy function guides the MCMC sampling to balance diversity and plausibility. Quick check: Understand how energy functions relate to probability distributions and how they're optimized.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Video -> Keypoint Extraction -> GRU-NF Predictor -> MCMC Sampler (with Energy Function) -> Refined Keypoint Sequence -> Video Reconstruction

**Critical Path**: The inference pipeline processes video frames to extract keypoints, feeds them through the pre-trained GRU-NF model for initial predictions, then applies MCMC sampling guided by the energy function to refine these predictions before reconstructing the final video output.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades minimal additional computational overhead for significant gains in output diversity. The energy function hyperparameters represent a critical balance between exploration (diversity) and exploitation (consistency with learned patterns).

**Failure Signatures**: Over-refinement leading to unrealistic motion patterns, or under-refinement resulting in outputs indistinguishable from baseline GRU-NF. Sensitivity to energy function hyperparameters can also lead to suboptimal diversity-fidelity balance.

**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study varying MCMC step count to assess diversity-fidelity tradeoff. 2) Sensitivity analysis of energy function hyperparameters across different datasets. 3) Qualitative comparison of generated videos at different prediction horizons to verify diversity improvements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Trade-off between diversity and fidelity remains a challenge, with uncertainty about whether improved APD-to-MAE ratios translate to perceptually meaningful diversity
- Energy function hyperparameters require careful tuning and may not generalize well across different datasets without adjustment
- Dependency on pre-trained GRU-NF models means the method isn't truly training-free in practice, as it requires substantial training data and resources

## Confidence

- Methodological framework: High - Clear technical description and reproducible approach
- Quantitative improvements: Medium - Results reported relative to single baseline without statistical significance testing
- Qualitative diversity gains: Low - Subjective assessments without systematic human evaluation or perceptual metrics

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on the energy function hyperparameters to assess sensitivity and robustness across multiple datasets
2. Perform human perceptual studies to verify that the increased APD-to-MAE ratio corresponds to subjectively meaningful diversity in generated videos
3. Test the method on a broader range of motion transfer scenarios (e.g., non-facial movements, different domains) to evaluate generalizability beyond VoxCeleb and BAIR
