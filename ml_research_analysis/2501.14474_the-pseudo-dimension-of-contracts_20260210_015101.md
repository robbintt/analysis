# The Pseudo-Dimension of Contracts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.14474
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14474
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Establishes pseudo-dimension bounds for contract classes in principal-agent models, showing sample complexity scales as O((1/ε²)(log(1/ε) + log(1/δ))) for linear contracts and O((1/ε²)(m log(1/ε) + log(1/δ))) for bounded contracts.

## Executive Summary
This paper bridges contract theory and statistical learning by introducing pseudo-dimension as a measure of complexity for contract classes in principal-agent models. The authors analyze how the number of samples required to learn near-optimal contracts depends on the structure of the contract class - whether linear, bounded, or unbounded - and whether the action space is combinatorial. By connecting the piecewise linear structure of principal utilities to the concept of delineability, they derive sample complexity bounds that reveal fundamental tradeoffs between contract simplicity and optimality. The framework also extends to menus of contracts and online learning settings.

## Method Summary
The paper employs the delineability framework from learning theory, showing that contract classes are (d,k)-delineable where d represents the number of linear pieces and k the number of critical values. For linear contracts, this yields Pdim = O(log n) by leveraging the structure of indifference points where agent best responses change. For bounded contracts, the pseudo-dimension is O(m log n). The authors then construct ε-discretized contract classes (L_ε and B_ε) that replace the dependence on n with dependence on 1/ε, achieving Pdim = O(log(1/ε)). These discretized classes enable finite sample complexity guarantees via uniform convergence. The analysis requires bounded utility functions and assumes access to approximation oracles for empirical risk minimization.

## Key Results
- Linear contracts have pseudo-dimension Θ(log n), yielding sample complexity O((1/ε²)(log(1/ε) + log(1/δ)))
- Bounded contracts have pseudo-dimension Θ(m log n), yielding sample complexity O((1/ε²)(m log(1/ε) + log(1/δ)))
- Discretizing contract space replaces log n dependence with log(1/ε) in sample complexity
- Unbounded contracts have Pdim = Θ(m log n) but no learning algorithm with finite sample complexity exists
- For combinatorial actions, submodularity reduces critical values from O(n) to O(k)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Sample complexity is upper-bounded by the pseudo-dimension of the contract class
- **Mechanism:** Uses uniform convergence - if a class of functions has finite pseudo-dimension d, then O(d/ε²) samples ensure ε-approximation with probability 1-δ
- **Core assumption:** Principal's utility must be bounded (e.g., in [0,1])
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions pseudo-dimension establishing upper bounds; Theorem 3.7 links pseudo-dimension to uniform learnability; related work confirms centrality of this measure
- **Break condition:** Unbounded transfers make utility unbounded, uniform convergence fails, no learning algorithm exists (Theorem 5.12)

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pseudo-dimension scales with logarithm of critical values in agent's utility function
- **Mechanism:** Principal's utility is piecewise linear; boundaries correspond to hyperplanes where agent is indifferent between actions; delineability framework shows Pdim = O(log k) where k is number of boundaries
- **Core assumption:** Agent's production function and costs are fixed for a given type, inducing deterministic best-response structure
- **Evidence anchors:** Theorem 4.1 proves Pdim(C_linear) = O(log n) using critical values; Section 3.3 defines delineability as technical tool; no corpus link provided
- **Break condition:** Combinatorial actions without constraints can have k scaling linearly with n (Prop 6.1), reducing efficiency gains

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Discretizing contract space removes n-dependence, replacing with 1/ε-dependence
- **Mechanism:** Instead of learning over full continuous space (log n penalty), restrict to discrete grid (L_ε or B_ε) whose size depends only on 1/ε
- **Core assumption:** Optimal contract in restricted discrete class has representation error ≤ ε compared to optimal continuous contract
- **Evidence anchors:** Theorems 4.4 and 4.7 establish Pdim bounds for discretized contracts independent of n; Theorem 5.4 uses this for time-efficient algorithm; no corpus link provided
- **Break condition:** If ε < 1/n, grid size grows such that discretization offers no advantage over full class (Theorem 4.4)

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pseudo-Dimension**
  - **Why needed here:** Primary metric quantifying complexity/expressiveness of contract classes; replaces VC-dimension for real-valued utility functions
  - **Quick check question:** Can you shatter a set of agent types using thresholds on principal's utility? (If yes, class is complex and requires more samples)

- **Concept: Principal-Agent Model (Hidden Action)**
  - **Why needed here:** Defines environment where mechanism applies; principal sees outcomes but not actions, making contract design a learning problem (moral hazard)
  - **Quick check question:** Does principal know which action agent took? (No, only observes outcome distribution)

- **Concept: Critical Values**
  - **Why needed here:** For linear contracts, optimal contract determined by finite set of step points where agent's best response changes
  - **Quick check question:** As linear parameter α increases, does agent's preferred action change at discrete points? (Yes, leading to step-function reward profile)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Samples of agent types θ → Empirical Risk Minimizer → Approximation Oracle → Contract t
- **Critical path:** 1) Collect N samples of agent types 2) Construct discretized contract class (Grid) 3) For each candidate contract, compute agent's best response and principal's utility 4) Select contract with highest average utility
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Linear vs Bounded: Linear (Pdim ≈ log n) is sample-efficient but may suffer representation error; Bounded (Pdim ≈ m log n) is more expressive but requires more samples
  - Discretization (ε): Coarse grid reduces sample complexity but increases representation error; fine grid reduces error but increases learning time and sample needs
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Unbounded Utility: Algorithm fails to converge if contracts allow payments > 1 (Theorem 5.12); empirical optimizer suggests infinite payments that look good on samples but fail catastrophically
  - Small Sample Regime: If N < O(Pdim/ε²), selected contract may overfit sample types and perform poorly on true distribution
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate Pdim Scaling: Generate synthetic datasets with varying n, verify sample complexity scales logarithmically with n for linear contracts
  2. Test Representation Error: Compare utility of optimal linear vs optimal bounded contract on complex distribution to quantify representation error
  3. Stress Test Unboundedness: Implement learning algorithm on unbounded contract class to observe divergence/failure mode predicted by Theorem 5.12

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can pseudo-dimension bounds for ε-approximations of bounded contracts be tightened when representation error ε > 1/(24·m²)?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 7 states bounds are tight for ε < 1/(24·m²) but "a gap remains between our lower and upper bounds in the case where ε > 1/(24·m²)"
- **Why unresolved:** Current lower bound construction relies on specific constraints on ε relative to m
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Proof of matching upper and lower bounds for pseudo-dimension of bounded contract approximations in large ε regime

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Is the O(K·m·log(K·m·n)) pseudo-dimension upper bound for menus of bounded contracts tight?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 7 lists as open question whether pseudo-dimension upper bound for menus of contracts (Theorem 6.10) is tight
- **Why unresolved:** Paper provides upper bound via delineability but no corresponding lower bound to confirm necessity of logarithmic factors or linear dependence on K
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Shattering construction demonstrating lower bound matching upper bound dependencies on K, m, and n

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can learning algorithm guarantee constant-factor approximation using only constant number of samples (few-sample regime)?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 7 notes examining few-sample regime is significant challenge, asks "how, and under what conditions, learning algorithms can be designed to guarantee constant-factor approximation... with such limited data"
- **Why unresolved:** Current analysis focuses on additive approximation error ε with sample complexity depending on 1/ε, which tends to infinity as sample size remains constant
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Algorithm achieving multiplicative c-approximation using O(1) samples, or proof that such guarantees require ω(1) samples

## Limitations

- The idealized model assumes principal can compute agent's best response exactly and agent always responds optimally, which may not hold with cognitive or computational constraints
- Unbounded utility analysis reveals critical fragility: entire learning framework collapses if contracts allow infinite payments
- Approximation oracles required for empirical risk minimization are often assumed to exist but may not be computationally tractable for complex contract classes
- Extension to combinatorial actions provides insights but gains from submodularity depend on specific action space structure

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Pseudo-dimension bounds for linear (O(log n)) and bounded (O(m log n)) contracts are well-supported by delineability framework and critical values structure
- **Medium Confidence:** Effectiveness of discretization in replacing log n with log(1/ε) relies on assumption that optimal continuous contract can be well-approximated by discrete one
- **Medium Confidence:** Extension to combinatorial actions provides useful insights but gains from submodularity depend on specific action space structure

## Next Validation Checks

1. **Empirical Sample Complexity Validation:** Implement learning algorithm for linear contracts and empirically measure sample complexity N(ε, δ) required to achieve target accuracy on synthetic datasets with varying n. Compare to theoretical bound O((log n)/ε²).

2. **Approximation Error Quantification:** For fixed distribution of agent types, compute principal's utility for optimal linear contract, optimal bounded contract, and true unconstrained optimal contract to quantify "representation error" of linear class and potential gains from bounded class.

3. **Oracle Tractability Assessment:** For discretized bounded contract class B_ε, attempt to implement enumeration oracle O(B_ε, ρ). Measure computational time and resources required as function of m and 1/ε to assess practical feasibility.
