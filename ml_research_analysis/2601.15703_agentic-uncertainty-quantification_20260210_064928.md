# Agentic Uncertainty Quantification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.15703
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15703
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 74.3% success rate on ALFWorld (+10.7% over baseline)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a dual-process framework for uncertainty-aware agents that dynamically balances fast execution with reflective correction. The method addresses the "spiral of hallucination" problem by transforming verbalized uncertainty into active control signals. System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory) propagates confidence and semantic explanations to constrain future decisions, while System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection) uses these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted corrections only when needed.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a dual-process architecture where System 1 maintains an Uncertainty-Aware Memory that stores confidence scores and semantic explanations from past decisions, while System 2 performs Uncertainty-Aware Reflection that uses these stored explanations as rational cues to determine when reflection is needed. The key innovation is converting uncertainty from passive observation to active control signal, allowing the agent to maintain fast execution while only engaging reflection when semantic explanations indicate likely errors. This approach addresses the computational inefficiency of constant reflection and the reliability issues of purely reactive methods.

## Key Results
- Achieved 74.3% success rate on ALFWorld (+10.7% over baseline)
- Reached 42.9% success rate on WebShop (+13.6% over baseline)
- Demonstrated superior calibration and trajectory-level discrimination across multiple model families including GPT-5.1, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and open-source LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-process framework works by maintaining a memory of past decisions with associated confidence scores and semantic explanations, then using this information to make intelligent decisions about when reflection is actually needed. This prevents both the computational waste of constant reflection and the unreliability of purely reactive approaches. By grounding reflection triggers in semantic explanations rather than just confidence scores, the system can better distinguish between situations requiring correction and those where fast execution suffices.

## Foundational Learning

**Uncertainty Quantification**: The process of measuring and representing confidence in model predictions. Needed because agents must distinguish between reliable and unreliable decisions to avoid compounding errors.

**Dual-Process Theory**: The psychological framework distinguishing between fast, automatic thinking and slow, deliberative reasoning. Required to balance computational efficiency with accuracy in agent decision-making.

**Semantic Explanations**: Human-readable justifications for model decisions. Essential for grounding uncertainty signals in interpretable context rather than abstract confidence scores.

**Confidence Calibration**: The alignment between predicted confidence levels and actual error rates. Critical for ensuring uncertainty signals reliably indicate when errors are likely.

**Reflection Triggers**: Decision points where an agent chooses to re-evaluate previous actions. Needed to correct errors before they compound into larger failures.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Input -> System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory) -> System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection) -> Agent Action -> Environment Feedback -> Memory Update

**Critical Path**: The core execution path involves fast decision-making through System 1, with System 2 providing optional reflective corrections based on uncertainty signals and semantic explanations stored in memory.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades some computational overhead for improved accuracy and reliability. The key tradeoff is between the cost of reflection and the benefit of error correction, managed through intelligent trigger mechanisms.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include overly conservative reflection triggers leading to missed corrections, unreliable semantic explanations causing false reflection signals, and memory representation degradation over long trajectories.

**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing System 2 to measure baseline performance, 2) Testing with corrupted semantic explanations to evaluate robustness, 3) Evaluating on out-of-distribution tasks to assess generalization limits.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

The evaluation is constrained to synthetic and task-oriented environments without validation in open-ended or real-world agent scenarios. The claim that AUQ "fundamentally addresses" the spiral of hallucination appears Medium confidence as it relies on retrospective correction rather than prevention. The framework's effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of Uncertainty-Aware Memory representation and alignment between confidence scores and actual error rates.

## Confidence

High: Performance improvements on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks
Medium: Claims about addressing hallucination spiral and calibration across model families
Low: Generalization to open-ended tasks and real-world deployment scenarios

## Next Checks

1) Test AUQ on open-ended reasoning tasks and real-world deployment scenarios to assess generalization beyond curated benchmarks
2) Conduct ablation studies isolating contributions of System 1 vs System 2 to determine if both components are necessary
3) Evaluate framework behavior under adversarial conditions where uncertainty signals might be deliberately manipulated or when facing tasks requiring novel reasoning patterns
