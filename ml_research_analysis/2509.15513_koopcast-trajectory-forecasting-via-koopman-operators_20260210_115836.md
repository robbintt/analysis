# KoopCast: Trajectory Forecasting via Koopman Operators

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.15513
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15513
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** KoopCast achieves competitive trajectory forecasting accuracy with 93.5% faster inference than Trajectron++ on ETH/UCY, leveraging Koopman operators for stable, interpretable predictions.

## Executive Summary
KoopCast introduces a novel trajectory forecasting framework for dynamic agents such as pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists. It uses Koopman operator theory to transform nonlinear motion dynamics into a higher-dimensional linear space, enabling stable and interpretable long-term trajectory prediction. The model operates in two stages: a probabilistic neural goal estimator proposes plausible long-term targets, and a Koopman operator-based refinement module generates smooth, stable trajectories by linear propagation in the lifted space. This approach achieves competitive accuracy on standard benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, ETH/UCY) while offering interpretability through mode decomposition.

## Method Summary
KoopCast models agent trajectories by first estimating probable future goals using a probabilistic neural network, then refining these predictions with a Koopman operator learned from observed motion. The Koopman operator embeds nonlinear dynamics into a linear representation, allowing for stable, long-term prediction via linear propagation in a higher-dimensional space. The method ensures stability through spectral analysis (eigenvalues bounded by 1) and supports interpretability by decomposing trajectories into Koopman modes, revealing underlying behavioral patterns such as steering dominance during turns. The model is validated on multiple public datasets and demonstrates significant speed advantages over prior methods.

## Key Results
- **Accuracy:** minADEk=0.60m, minFDEk=1.54m on Waymo validation set; minADEk=2.50m, minFDEk=4.74m on nuScenes validation set.
- **Speed:** 93.5% faster inference than Trajectron++ on ETH/UCY.
- **Stability:** Eigenvalues of Koopman operator bounded by 1, ensuring stable long-term predictions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
KoopCast leverages Koopman operator theory to linearize nonlinear agent dynamics, enabling stable and efficient long-term trajectory forecasting. By embedding observed motion into a higher-dimensional linear space, the model can propagate trajectories linearly, which is both computationally efficient and robust to perturbations. The two-stage architecture—goal estimation followed by Koopman refinement—ensures that predictions are both plausible and dynamically consistent. The spectral properties of the Koopman operator further guarantee stability, while mode decomposition offers interpretability by revealing the contribution of different behavioral components.

## Foundational Learning
- **Koopman Operator Theory:** Transforms nonlinear dynamics into a linear framework in a higher-dimensional space, needed for stable long-term prediction; quick check: eigenvalues of operator remain bounded.
- **Probabilistic Goal Estimation:** Generates multiple plausible future goals for agents, needed to capture uncertainty in agent intent; quick check: diversity and coverage of predicted goals.
- **Trajectory Refinement via Linear Propagation:** Uses linear dynamics in lifted space for efficient, stable prediction; quick check: trajectory smoothness and consistency over long horizons.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Input Observations -> Probabilistic Goal Estimator -> Koopman Operator Module -> Refined Trajectories
- **Critical Path:** Goal hypotheses are generated first, then each is refined by the Koopman module to produce final trajectories.
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Two-stage approach improves interpretability and stability but may propagate goal estimation errors; linear propagation is fast but may oversimplify complex dynamics.
- **Failure Signatures:** Poor goal hypotheses lead to unrealistic trajectories; spectral constraints may limit expressiveness in highly interactive scenarios.
- **First Experiments:**
  1. Validate accuracy on standard benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, ETH/UCY).
  2. Test stability by evaluating long-term predictions under varying conditions.
  3. Analyze interpretability by correlating Koopman modes with agent behaviors.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Error propagation risk: poor goal hypotheses can lead to unrealistic trajectories.
- Limited expressiveness: constant time discretization and linear propagation may not capture abrupt or complex agent dynamics.
- Interpretability gap: causal link between Koopman modes and agent intent is mostly qualitative.

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in reported accuracy metrics and latency improvements.
- **Medium confidence** in stability and robustness claims.
- **Medium confidence** in interpretability findings.

## Next Checks
1. Test error propagation sensitivity by ablating or replacing the goal estimator and measuring downstream Koopman module performance.
2. Evaluate long-term trajectory stability beyond the training horizon under varying environmental conditions and crowd densities.
3. Quantify the correspondence between Koopman modes and agent actions (e.g., using supervised classification or correlation with ground-truth maneuvers).
