# ChatGPT Encounters Morphing Attack Detection: Zero-Shot MAD with Multi-Modal Large Language Models and General Vision Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.10937
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10937
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Zero-shot MAD achieved 31-47% EER on synthetic face morphs using GPT-4 Turbo and ResNet34, with LLM providing explainable detections.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of detecting face morphing attacks in Face Recognition Systems using a zero-shot learning approach with Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) algorithms rely on supervised learning and struggle with generalizability to unseen data and lack of explainability, critical for real-world applications like automated border control. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose using the state-of-the-art GPT-4 Turbo API with carefully crafted prompts for zero-shot MAD, alongside a comparative method using general vision models pre-trained on image classification tasks. The experiments, conducted on a synthetic dataset featuring various morphing algorithms, demonstrate notable detection accuracy. The LLM-based approach exhibits remarkable generalizability to untrained MAD tasks and provides explanations and guidance, enhancing transparency and usability for end-users.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a zero-shot MAD approach using multi-modal LLMs (GPT-4 Turbo) with Chain-of-Thought prompting and probability-based scoring to avoid classification bias. For vision models, it computes a mean "anchor" embedding from digital bona fide images and uses distance (cosine or Euclidean) to classify test images as morphed or not. Both methods require no MAD-specific training. The LLM approach provides explainability by identifying artifact regions, while the vision model offers deterministic local inference. Evaluation uses a synthetic dataset (SynMorph) with print-scanned images across three morphing algorithms.

## Key Results
- LLM zero-shot MAD achieved EER of 31-47% across morphing algorithms, outperforming binary prompt approaches
- ResNet34 with cosine distance achieved lowest EER among vision models, outperforming Euclidean distance
- LLM explanations identified eye region artifacts most frequently, with Morph-PIPE showing more forehead and cheek artifacts
- Vision model required auxiliary support set of 50 digital bona fide images for anchor computation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Zero-Shot MAD Classification
Multi-modal LLMs can perform morphing attack detection without task-specific training when guided by structured prompts that encourage reasoning. The CoT component ("Think step-by-step, first analyze visual characteristics") triggers the model's pre-trained visual analysis capabilities. Prompts requesting probability scores (rather than binary labels) reduce classification bias by forcing the model to reason rather than default to the prompted class. The core assumption is that the LLM has encoded general visual artifact patterns during pre-training that transfer to morphing artifacts, despite no exposure to MAD-specific data.

### Mechanism 2: Support Embedding Anchor for Vision-Based Zero-Shot Detection
Pre-trained vision models can perform zero-shot MAD by comparing input embeddings against a bona fide anchor computed from digital non-morphed images. A reference embedding (v_anchor) is computed as the mean of N digital bona fide image embeddings extracted by a pre-trained CNN. During inference, the distance between the input image embedding and v_anchor serves as the classification score. Cosine distance outperforms Euclidean because it better captures semantic similarity in high-dimensional feature spaces. The core assumption is that morphed images will exhibit measurable deviation from the "bona fide manifold" captured by the anchor, even when the model was trained only on ImageNet classification.

### Mechanism 3: Artifact-Driven Explainability via Structured Output Prompts
LLMs can generate human-interpretable explanations by mapping visual anomalies to semantic artifact categories, bridging algorithmic output with expert knowledge. Prompt 7 requests free-form artifact localization [region, trace]; Prompt 8 provides a predefined artifact list (11 items) and asks the model to select observed attributes. This constrains the output space while leveraging the model's visual-language alignment. The core assumption is that the artifacts identified by the LLM correspond to actual morphing traces (not hallucinations), and these explanations remain stable across multiple inference rounds.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Zero-Shot Learning in Computer Vision**
  - Why needed here: The core innovation is detecting morphing attacks without morphed training samples. Understanding how pre-trained models transfer to unseen classes is essential.
  - Quick check question: Given a ResNet pre-trained on ImageNet, how would you adapt it to classify a new category (e.g., "morphed face") without gradient updates?

- Concept: **Prompt Engineering for Multi-Modal LLMs**
  - Why needed here: Detection performance varies dramatically with prompt design (binary vs. probability, single-class vs. multi-class). Prompt bias directly impacts EER.
  - Quick check question: Why might asking "Is this a morphing attack?" (Prompt 1) produce different results than "What is the probability this is bona fide?" (Prompt 5)?

- Concept: **Detection Error Trade-off (DET) Curves and ISO MAD Metrics**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses MACER, BPCER, and EER as standardized metrics. Understanding these is required to interpret the benchmark results.
  - Quick check question: If BPCER = 10% and MACER = 30%, what does this mean operationally for a border control system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input image → GPT-4 Turbo API + Prompt → Score/Explanation → Threshold → Decision
- Critical path: Prompt design → LLM inference → Score extraction → Threshold selection
- Design tradeoffs: LLM pros: Generalizability, explainability, no anchor computation required. Cons: API dependency, non-determinism, cost per inference, bias sensitivity to prompt wording. Vision pros: Deterministic, local inference, no API cost. Cons: Requires anchor dataset, lower explainability, worse performance on Morph-PIPE.
- Failure signatures: High false positive rate with binary prompts, elevated EER on GAN-based morphs (MIPGAN-II), explanation inconsistency across rounds, degraded performance on print-scanned images with subtle artifacts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Prompt ablation study: Run Prompts 1-8 on a held-out subset (20 images per class). Record EER, response format compliance rate, and API decline rate.
  2. Vision model comparison: Compare ResNet34 vs. VGG16 with cosine vs. Euclidean distance on the full test set using the same anchor set.
  3. Round stability analysis: Run the best-performing prompt (Prompt 5) for 10 rounds on 30 images. Compute per-image standard deviation and fused-score EER at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 rounds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** To what extent can LLM-assisted Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) enhance the decision-making accuracy of human operators compared to human observers performing the task alone?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that future work should "determine whether LLM-assisted MAD can enhance human decision-making accuracy" by incorporating experiments with human observers.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study focused on benchmarking the LLM against vision models using automated metrics (EER, DET curves) and did not evaluate the performance of human operators utilizing the LLM's explanations.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Results from a user study comparing the detection rates of human agents working alone versus those assisted by LLM outputs.

- **Question:** Does incorporating few-shot samples into the prompt or fine-tuning the model yield significantly higher detection accuracy than the zero-shot approach?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion explicitly suggests that future work should "investigate strategies such as fine-tuning models [and] incorporating few-shot samples into prompts to improve detection performance."
  - **Why unresolved:** The presented experiments strictly adhere to a zero-shot learning paradigm to establish a baseline for generalizability without task-specific training data.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative benchmarks showing error rates (EER) for few-shot and fine-tuned configurations against the zero-shot baseline on the same dataset.

- **Question:** How robust is the proposed zero-shot method when applied to non-synthetic, real-world data compared to the synthetic SynMorph dataset used in this study?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note the limitation of using only synthetic data and call for "conducting local evaluations on non-synthetic data" in future research.
  - **Why unresolved:** The study relied entirely on synthetic face images to comply with privacy regulations, creating a potential domain gap that may not reflect the complexity of real-world morphing artifacts.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation results from the proposed method on privacy-compliant real-face morph datasets showing comparable generalization capabilities to the synthetic results.

## Limitations

- Data dependency: The zero-shot generalization relies entirely on the LLM's pre-training data. Performance on real-world attack types (e.g., physical morphs created with photo editing software) remains unverified and could degrade significantly due to domain shift.
- Explainability constraints: While the LLM provides explanations, these are not guaranteed to correspond to actual morphing artifacts. The paper acknowledges this by recommending explanations be treated as "supportive guidance rather than definitive evidence," limiting their utility for forensic applications.

## Confidence

- **High**: The vision model component (ResNet34 + cosine distance) achieving the stated EER values on the synthetic test set. This is a deterministic computation with clear ground truth.
- **Medium**: The LLM-based detection claims (EER of 31-47% across algorithms). While results are reproducible, they depend on API responses which can vary with model updates and prompt implementation details.
- **Low**: The explainability claims regarding artifact identification. The qualitative nature of these evaluations and lack of ground truth for artifact locations make verification challenging.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-algorithm robustness test**: Evaluate the best-performing prompts and vision model on a held-out morphing algorithm not seen during development (e.g., Diffusion-Morph or a GAN-based method using a different backbone than StyleGAN2).
2. **Print-scan degradation analysis**: Systematically vary the print-scan quality parameters (DPI settings) and measure detection performance degradation to quantify robustness to real-world presentation attacks.
3. **Temporal stability verification**: Run the complete evaluation pipeline (both LLM and vision models) on the same dataset after 3 months to measure performance drift, particularly for the LLM component which depends on an evolving API.
