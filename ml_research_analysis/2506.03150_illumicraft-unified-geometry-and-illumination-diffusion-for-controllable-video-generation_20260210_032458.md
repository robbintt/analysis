# IllumiCraft: Unified Geometry and Illumination Diffusion for Controllable Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03150
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03150
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieves 43% reduction in FVD (from 3946.71 to 2186.40) for video relighting

## Executive Summary
IllumiCraft presents a unified diffusion framework for controllable video generation that addresses the challenge of maintaining consistent illumination over time while ensuring physically plausible light-scene interactions in dynamic videos. The method integrates illumination and geometry guidance to achieve superior performance in both text-conditioned and background-conditioned video relighting tasks. By accepting HDR video maps for lighting control, synthetically relit frames for appearance cues, and 3D point tracks for geometry information, IllumiCraft demonstrates significant improvements in visual quality, text alignment, and temporal consistency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

## Method Summary
IllumiCraft is a unified diffusion framework that combines multiple guidance signals for controllable video generation. The method accepts HDR video maps for lighting control, synthetically relit frames for appearance cues, and 3D point tracks for geometry information. By integrating these different modalities into a single diffusion model, IllumiCraft achieves consistent illumination over time and physically plausible light-scene interactions. The framework leverages pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates the additional guidance signals through conditioning mechanisms, allowing for fine-grained control over the relighting process while maintaining temporal consistency across video frames.

## Key Results
- 43% reduction in FVD score (from 3946.71 to 2186.40) compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Improved visual quality and text alignment in text-conditioned video relighting
- Enhanced temporal consistency in both text-conditioned and background-conditioned relighting tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by unifying multiple guidance signals within a single diffusion framework. By incorporating HDR video maps, synthetically relit frames, and 3D point tracks as conditioning information, the model can learn to maintain consistent illumination patterns across time while respecting the underlying scene geometry. The diffusion process iteratively refines the generated video frames by considering all available guidance simultaneously, ensuring that the final output satisfies constraints from lighting, appearance, and geometry. This unified approach prevents the inconsistencies that often arise when these elements are handled separately in traditional video relighting pipelines.

## Foundational Learning
- HDR video maps - Needed for accurate lighting control across dynamic scenes; Quick check: Verify proper tone mapping and exposure handling
- 3D point tracks - Required for geometry-aware relighting that respects scene structure; Quick check: Ensure point correspondence accuracy across frames
- Diffusion guidance conditioning - Essential for incorporating multiple control signals; Quick check: Validate conditioning strength and balance

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: HDR input -> Geometry tracker -> Appearance encoder -> Unified diffusion model -> Generated video output
Critical path: HDR maps and 3D point tracks are processed in parallel, then fused with appearance information before being fed into the unified diffusion model for video generation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the scalability of the approach to longer video sequences, the generalization to more complex lighting scenarios beyond controlled HDR environments, and the computational efficiency of processing high-resolution video in real-time applications.

## Limitations
The method relies on pre-trained diffusion models and requires significant computational resources for training and inference. The quality of the 3D point tracks directly impacts the final output, making the system sensitive to tracking errors in complex scenes. Additionally, the approach may struggle with highly dynamic scenes where geometry and lighting change rapidly.

## Confidence
Medium confidence. The reported 43% FVD improvement appears substantial, but without access to the full paper, verification of the experimental methodology and dataset details remains incomplete. The claims regarding text alignment improvements would benefit from qualitative examples.

## Next Checks
- Verify the exact HDR video map formats and tone mapping procedures used
- Examine the 3D point tracking algorithm details and error metrics
- Review the specific pre-trained diffusion model architecture and conditioning implementation
- Check the dataset composition for both text-conditioned and background-conditioned experiments
