# Interactive Debugging and Steering of Multi-Agent AI Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.02068
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02068
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Interactive debugging tool for multi-agent AI systems that enables message editing and conversation reset to identify and fix errors

## Executive Summary
This paper presents AGDebugger, an interactive debugging tool designed specifically for multi-agent AI systems. Through formative interviews with five developers, the authors identified key challenges in debugging multi-agent conversations including difficulty understanding long agent interactions, lack of interactive debugging support, and challenges in iterating on agent configurations. AGDebugger addresses these issues through three core features: interactive message sending and viewing, the ability to reset to previous points and edit messages, and an overview visualization for navigating conversation histories.

The tool was evaluated through a two-part user study with 14 participants, demonstrating that AGDebugger effectively supports developers in debugging multi-agent workflows. Participants used message editing to add specific instructions, simplify tasks, or modify agent plans, with 24 total message edits across eight study sessions. The system received high usability ratings (4.5/5 overall), with the message resetting feature rated most highly at 4.9/5. The study revealed that interactive editing helps developers understand agent behavior and pinpoint errors through counterfactual testing.

## Method Summary
The research methodology consisted of two phases. First, formative interviews were conducted with five developers who had experience with multi-agent systems to identify pain points in the debugging process. These interviews revealed three main challenges: difficulty understanding long agent conversations, lack of interactive debugging support, and difficulties iterating on agent configurations. Based on these insights, the authors developed AGDebugger with three key features. The tool was then evaluated through a two-part user study with 14 participants who debugged pre-existing multi-agent conversations using AGDebugger. The evaluation measured both quantitative usability metrics and qualitative feedback on the debugging experience.

## Key Results
- AGDebugger received high usability ratings (4.5/5 overall) from study participants
- The message resetting feature was rated highest at 4.9/5 by users
- Participants performed 24 total message edits across eight study sessions
- Interactive editing helped developers understand agent behavior through counterfactual testing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AGDebugger works by providing developers with interactive control over multi-agent conversations, allowing them to step through interactions, modify messages, and reset to previous states. This interactive approach enables developers to test hypotheses about agent behavior in real-time by making targeted changes and observing the effects. The overview visualization helps manage the complexity of long conversation histories by providing a navigable map of the interaction flow. The ability to edit messages and reset to previous points creates a "what-if" debugging environment where developers can experiment with different configurations and instructions to isolate and fix issues.

## Foundational Learning

1. Multi-agent conversation complexity
   - Why needed: Multi-agent systems generate long, intertwined conversation histories that are difficult to follow and debug
   - Quick check: Can you trace a single agent's decision path through a conversation with multiple participants?

2. Interactive debugging value
   - Why needed: Traditional debugging approaches are insufficient for dynamic, conversation-based systems
   - Quick check: Does the debugging tool allow real-time modification of system state during execution?

3. Counterfactual testing
   - Why needed: Understanding agent behavior requires testing alternative scenarios and inputs
   - Quick check: Can you systematically test "what if" scenarios by modifying conversation elements?

4. Conversation visualization
   - Why needed: Long conversations require visual aids to maintain context and track interaction flow
   - Quick check: Does the interface provide an overview that helps navigate complex conversation histories?

5. Iterative configuration
   - Why needed: Agent behavior often requires multiple iterations to fine-tune
   - Quick check: Can you easily modify and reapply agent configurations during debugging?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User Interface -> Conversation Manager -> Agent Interface -> Message Editor

Critical path: User initiates debug session → Conversation is loaded and visualized → User navigates conversation → User edits messages or resets state → Changes are applied and conversation continues

Design tradeoffs: Real-time interactivity vs. system complexity, comprehensive visualization vs. screen space constraints, ease of use vs. advanced debugging capabilities

Failure signatures: Message editing causing agent confusion, reset operations not properly clearing state, visualization becoming cluttered with very long conversations, performance degradation with large conversation histories

First experiments:
1. Load a simple pre-recorded conversation and verify message display and navigation
2. Test message editing on a single agent turn and observe agent response
3. Reset conversation to a previous point and verify state restoration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Small sample size of 14 participants limits generalizability of findings
- Participants worked with pre-existing conversations rather than their own systems, reducing ecological validity
- Evaluation focuses on usability and immediate effectiveness rather than long-term development impacts

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|---|---|
| AGDebugger effectively supports developers in debugging multi-agent workflows | High |
| Interactive editing helps developers understand agent behavior through counterfactual testing | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a longitudinal study with developers using AGDebugger on their own multi-agent systems over extended development cycles to assess sustained effectiveness and workflow integration.

2. Expand participant diversity to include developers with varying levels of experience with multi-agent systems and different domain specializations to test generalizability across user populations.

3. Implement controlled experiments comparing debugging outcomes and time-to-resolution between AGDebugger and traditional debugging approaches using statistically significant sample sizes and multiple conversation scenarios.
