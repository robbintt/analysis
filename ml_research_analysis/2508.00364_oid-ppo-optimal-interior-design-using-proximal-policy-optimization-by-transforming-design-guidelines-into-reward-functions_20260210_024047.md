# OID-PPO: Optimal Interior Design using Proximal Policy Optimization by Transforming Design Guidelines into Reward Functions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.00364
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00364
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: OID-PPO outperforms optimization-based and deep RL methods in layout quality and efficiency by integrating expert design guidelines into a structured reward function

## Executive Summary
OID-PPO addresses optimal interior design by encoding expert-defined functional and visual guidelines into a composite reward function within a reinforcement learning framework. The method uses a diagonal Gaussian policy to enable continuous furniture placement, capturing both functional criteria (accessibility, visibility, pathway connectivity) and visual criteria (pairwise relationships, visual balance, alignment). Experiments across diverse room shapes and furniture counts show OID-PPO achieves superior layout quality and computational efficiency compared to optimization-based methods and other deep RL approaches.

## Method Summary
OID-PPO formalizes interior design as a finite-horizon MDP where furniture is placed sequentially in bounded quadrilateral rooms. A diagonal Gaussian policy with continuous action outputs enables flexible placement, while six expert-defined reward components (pairwise, accessibility, visibility, pathway, balance, alignment) are normalized to [-1,1] and averaged into a unified reward. The framework uses descending-area furniture ordering and CNN-encoded occupancy maps to create effective spatial priors. PPO training with clipped objectives and entropy regularization stabilizes learning under partial observability, with convergence guarantees provided under specific assumptions.

## Key Results
- OID-PPO achieves up to 0.971 reward on square rooms with six furniture items
- Outperforms optimization-based and other deep RL methods in layout quality and computational efficiency
- Ablation studies confirm each reward component contributes distinctly to final layout quality
- Descending-area furniture ordering shows measurable benefits over ascending or random ordering
- The framework generalizes across four room shapes (square, rectangular, L-shape, U-shape) and varying furniture counts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Reward Function
Expert design guidelines are encoded as quantifiable reward functions (pairwise relationships, accessibility, visibility, pathway connection, visual balance, alignment) that are averaged into a unified reward. Each component captures specific geometric/spatial constraints, ensuring layouts satisfy both functional and visual criteria simultaneously. This works because spatial relationships can be formally defined and optimized through geometric calculations.

### Mechanism 2: Diagonal Gaussian Policy
A stochastic policy with continuous action outputs enables flexible furniture placement and maintains exploration under partial observability. The actor outputs mean and log standard deviation, with actions sampled as μ + σ ⊙ z. Stochastic sampling ensures nonzero probability of exploring all valid placements while PPO's clipped objective stabilizes updates. This works because continuous spaces contain better solutions than discretized grids, and stochasticity helps infer unobserved environmental dynamics.

### Mechanism 3: Descending-Area Furniture Ordering
Furniture sorted by footprint area (largest first) creates effective spatial priors for sequential placement. Larger items establish spatial anchors before smaller items fill remaining space, reducing search complexity and aligning with human design intuition. This works because size-based prioritization naturally constrains the solution space and prevents small items from blocking placement of larger essential pieces.

## Foundational Learning

- **Markov Decision Processes (finite episodic)**: Interior design formalized as M = ⟨S, A, P, R, γ⟩ with bounded horizon H ≤ |F|; understanding state transitions and reward accumulation is essential. Quick check: Can you explain why the episode terminates after |F| steps and how invalid actions trigger early termination?

- **Actor-Critic Methods with GAE**: OID-PPO uses separate actor and critic networks with Generalized Advantage Estimation (λ = 0.95); the loss combines clipped policy objective, value loss, and entropy. Quick check: How does GAE balance bias and variance in advantage estimation, and why does PPO clip the probability ratio?

- **Continuous Action Spaces in RL**: Diagonal Gaussian policies parameterize actions as distributions over continuous coordinates, requiring understanding of reparameterization and entropy regularization. Quick check: Why would a deterministic policy struggle more with partial observability than a stochastic policy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Furniture encoder (MLP → ψ_obj) → Occupancy encoder (CNN → ψ_O) → Fusion (concat → h_t) → Actor head (μ, log σ) → Critic head (V(s_t))

- **Critical path**: Environment provides (e_t, e_t+1, O_t) → Encoders process into features → Actor samples (x, y) position and rotation k → Validity check (T(x,k;f) ⊂ E and no collision) → If valid → compute 6 reward components → If invalid → terminal penalty φ = -10

- **Design tradeoffs**: On-policy (OID-PPO) vs off-policy (SAC) for stability vs sample efficiency; stochastic vs deterministic policies for exploration vs deployment consistency; 90° rotation quantization for action space complexity vs placement flexibility

- **Failure signatures**: Low reward with high loss suggests reward normalization issues; valid placements receiving terminal penalty indicates collision detection problems; furniture clustering in corners suggests underweighted balance/alignment rewards

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Single-component ablation: disable 5 of 6 rewards, verify each drives expected behavior; 2) Room shape generalization: train on square/rectangle, test on L/U-shape, measure reward degradation; 3) Placement order sensitivity: compare descending vs ascending vs random ordering, quantify policy/value losses and final rewards

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can user aesthetic preferences and real-world lighting constraints be effectively integrated into the OID-PPO reward function, given the current framework disregards user aesthetics, color palettes, and illumination factors?
- Can the framework be extended to handle non-axis-aligned geometries and continuous rotation, as current discretization fails for acute angles or curved walls?
- What standardized benchmark is required to enable fair comparison between learning-based and optimization-based interior design methods, given current evaluation relies on custom environments?

## Limitations
- Reward function design assumes geometric relationships can fully capture expert preferences, potentially overlooking subjective aesthetic factors like color harmony and cultural context
- Theoretical convergence proof relies on assumptions about partial observability that may not hold in complex or dynamic interior environments
- Diagonal Gaussian policy's stochastic nature may produce inconsistent outputs in safety-critical deployment scenarios requiring deterministic behavior

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The structured reward function mechanism is well-supported by experimental results showing clear performance improvements over baselines.
**Medium Confidence**: Size-based furniture ordering shows measurable benefits but lacks strong corpus support or exploration of alternatives.
**Low Confidence**: Generalization claims across room shapes are based on limited testing across four predefined geometries.

## Next Checks
1. **Reward component sensitivity analysis**: Systematically disable each of the six reward components in isolation and measure degradation in layout quality across all room shapes and furniture counts.
2. **Style generalization testing**: Train OID-PPO on minimalist design guidelines and evaluate performance on rooms requiring traditional or contemporary styles, comparing against learned aesthetic embeddings.
3. **Safety-critical deployment validation**: Modify the diagonal Gaussian policy to include deterministic fallback modes and test in scenarios requiring precise furniture placement, measuring trade-offs between exploration and deployment consistency.
