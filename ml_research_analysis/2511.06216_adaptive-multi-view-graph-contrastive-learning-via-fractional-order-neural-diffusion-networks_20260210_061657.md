# Adaptive Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning via Fractional-order Neural Diffusion Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06216
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06216
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: State-of-the-art performance on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets using augmentation-free multi-view contrastive learning with learnable fractional-order diffusion

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FD-MVGCL, an augmentation-free multi-view graph contrastive learning framework that leverages fractional-order continuous dynamics. By varying the fractional derivative order α∈(0,1], the method generates a continuum of views ranging from localized to global representations, with α treated as a learnable parameter to adaptively discover informative diffusion scales. The approach mitigates dimension collapse and view collapse through regularization and avoids the need for handcrafted augmentations. Theoretical analysis proves that embeddings from different α values are provably distinct, with greater separation as the gap between orders increases. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance.

## Method Summary
FD-MVGCL uses K parallel fractional differential equation (FDE) encoders, each with learnable fractional order α∈(0.01,1]. The framework employs a regularized cosmean loss between consecutive views, combining alignment with a dominant direction penalty to prevent collapse. The key innovation is treating α as a learnable parameter, allowing the model to automatically discover optimal diffusion scales through gradient descent. An adaptive view learning algorithm (AVLA) iteratively prunes redundant α values based on log-scale similarity, reducing to the optimal number of views. Theoretical analysis proves view distinctness through graph signal processing and Laplacian eigendecomposition.

## Key Results
- Achieves lowest average ranking across benchmark datasets compared to existing methods
- AVLA (adaptive) outperforms fixed two-view approach by 0.84% on Cora (84.40% vs 83.56%)
- Regularized cosmean loss shows stable accuracy across training epochs while other losses degrade
- Learned α values vary by dataset (e.g., Cora: {0.001, 0.529, 0.736, 1}; Cornell: {0.001, 0.018, 0.137, 1})

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fractional-Order Diffusion Generates Multi-Scale Views
Varying the fractional derivative order α ∈ (0,1] produces a continuous spectrum of views from local to global, with embeddings at different α values being provably distinct. Fractional derivatives introduce a memory effect (non-local temporal dependencies) unlike standard ODEs, where smaller α yields heavier-tailed waiting time distributions (more localized) while larger α produces more frequent transitions (global aggregation).

### Mechanism 2: Regularized Contrastive Loss Prevents Dimension and View Collapse
The regularized cosmean loss with dominant direction penalization mitigates both dimension collapse (features confined to low-dimensional subspace) and view collapse (encoders producing identical representations). The loss combines cosmean similarity for alignment with a penalty term that encourages diversity between consecutive views without requiring negative samples.

### Mechanism 3: Adaptive View Learning Discovers Informative Diffusion Scales
Treating α as a learnable parameter allows the model to automatically discover informative diffusion scales without manual tuning. The framework initializes K encoders with uniformly sampled α values, jointly optimizes weights and α values via gradient descent, then prunes redundant α values based on log-scale similarity threshold. This iteratively reduces to the optimal number of views K̃.

## Foundational Learning

- **Fractional-Order Differential Equations**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework is built on FDEs, requiring understanding of Caputo/left fractional derivatives, memory effect, and how α controls diffusion scale
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Dᵅₜ f(t) depends on the entire history of f(τ) for τ < t, unlike d/dt?

- **Graph Signal Processing (GSP)**
  - Why needed here: The theoretical analysis relies on Laplacian eigendecomposition, graph frequencies, and Fourier coefficients to prove view distinctness
  - Quick check question: For a connected graph, what does the second-smallest eigenvalue λ₂ of the normalized Laplacian indicate about graph structure?

- **Contrastive Learning Collapse Problems**
  - Why needed here: The paper specifically addresses dimension collapse and view collapse as core challenges
  - Quick check question: In contrastive learning without negative samples, why might all features collapse to a single dimension or all views become identical?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Graph G=(V,E) with adjacency A and features X -> K parallel FDE encoders (each with Wₖ, αₖ, T) -> Linear projection Zₖ=WₖX -> FDE diffusion Dᵅₜ Y(t)=F(W,Y(t)) -> Activation σ -> Regularized cosmean loss L_R between consecutive views -> AVLA pruning

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize K encoders with α values uniformly from (0.01, 1]
  2. Forward pass: Solve K FDEs using numerical integration (requires history caching)
  3. Compute regularized loss for consecutive pairs
  4. Backpropagate to update Wₖ and αₖ (αₖ constrained to [ε, 1])
  5. After N epochs, prune similar α values; reinitialize and repeat if pruned
  6. Final output: Weighted average of learned views

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - K (number of encoders) vs. computational cost: Paper uses K=5 initially, but larger graphs may need fewer due to memory
  - T (diffusion depth) vs. view diversity: Larger T improves diversity but increases cost (Table V shows T=20-30 optimal for some datasets)
  - η (regularization weight) vs. stability: Too high prevents learning; too low risks collapse
  - Discretization step h vs. accuracy: Smaller h improves FDE solution accuracy but increases compute

- **Failure signatures:**
  - α values converging to identical values despite regularization (view collapse)
  - Classification accuracy degrading over epochs (dimension collapse, visible in Figure 5 for non-regularized losses)
  - OOM errors on large graphs due to caching intermediate FDE states
  - α values hitting boundary constraints (ε or 1) repeatedly during optimization

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Figure 2 (PCA analysis) on a new dataset to verify that small α produces higher-rank embeddings—this validates the dimension collapse mitigation claim.
  2. Ablate the regularization term: Compare L₀ vs L_R on Wisconsin (heterophilic) to isolate the view collapse prevention mechanism.
  3. Implement a simplified two-view version with fixed α₁=0.01, α₂=1 and compare against AVLA on Cornell—this quantifies the benefit of learnable α beyond fixed local/global views.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper explicitly identifies extending the framework to dynamic graphs as future work, noting that FD-MVGCL assumes static graph structure while temporal dynamics would require coupling fractional derivatives with time-varying operators or continuous-time graph sequences.

## Limitations

- Numerical solver implementation uncertainty due to reliance on FROND [15] without full solver details
- Computational scaling issues with K=5 initial encoders and memory requirements for large graphs
- Dominant direction computation method not explicitly defined (PCA first component is assumed but not stated)

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: View diversity claims (Theorem 1, Figure 1 t-SNE visualizations showing distinct embeddings for different α values)
- **Medium Confidence**: Dimension collapse prevention (PCA rank analysis in Figure 2, but theoretical proof focuses on view separation rather than subspace dimension)
- **Medium Confidence**: Adaptive view learning benefits (Table IV shows AVLA outperforming fixed views, but ablation on pruning threshold δ is limited)

## Next Checks

1. Replicate dimension analysis: Reproduce Figure 2 PCA analysis on a new heterophilic dataset to verify that small α values consistently produce higher-rank embeddings, directly testing the dimension collapse mitigation claim.

2. Ablate regularization mechanism: Compare L₀ vs L_R performance on Wisconsin dataset with varying η values to isolate the view collapse prevention effect and identify optimal regularization strength.

3. Test α convergence stability: Monitor learned α distributions across multiple training runs on Cora to verify that α values stabilize to distinct values rather than converging or oscillating, validating the adaptive learning mechanism.
