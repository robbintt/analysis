# Multi-Objective Optimization for Privacy-Utility Balance in Differentially Private Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.21159
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21159
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Adaptive clipping with multi-objective optimization improves privacy-utility trade-off in DP federated learning across standard benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of balancing privacy and utility in federated learning by proposing an adaptive clipping mechanism. The authors introduce a multi-objective optimization framework that dynamically adjusts the clipping norm during training, integrating privacy and utility considerations into a unified objective. Theoretical analysis establishes the convexity and convergence properties of the approach, ensuring stability and effectiveness. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improved classification accuracy under strict privacy constraints, particularly in lower privacy regimes. The results validate the potential of adaptive clipping to enhance privacy-utility trade-offs in differentially private federated learning.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes an adaptive clipping mechanism integrated with a multi-objective optimization framework for differentially private federated learning. The method dynamically adjusts the clipping norm during training to balance privacy and utility objectives. The approach combines gradient clipping with noise addition while optimizing both objectives simultaneously through a unified formulation. Theoretical analysis proves the convexity and convergence properties of the method, providing guarantees for stability and effectiveness in the federated setting.

## Key Results
- Achieves improved classification accuracy under strict privacy constraints compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- Demonstrates consistent performance improvements across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets
- Particularly effective in lower privacy regimes where privacy budget is tightly constrained

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by dynamically adjusting the clipping norm during training based on both privacy and utility considerations. Instead of using a fixed clipping threshold, the adaptive mechanism responds to the distribution of gradient norms across clients and training iterations. This allows the system to maintain strong privacy guarantees while avoiding overly aggressive clipping that would unnecessarily harm utility. The multi-objective optimization framework ensures that both privacy loss and model performance are considered simultaneously, rather than treating them as competing goals to be traded off separately.

## Foundational Learning

**Differential Privacy** - Mathematical framework for quantifying privacy guarantees
*Why needed:* Provides the theoretical foundation for measuring and bounding privacy loss in federated learning
*Quick check:* Verify that privacy budget (ε, δ) is properly tracked throughout training

**Gradient Clipping** - Technique to bound the sensitivity of model updates
*Why needed:* Essential for implementing differential privacy in federated learning by controlling the maximum impact of any single client's update
*Quick check:* Confirm that gradient norms are properly bounded before noise addition

**Multi-Objective Optimization** - Framework for optimizing multiple competing objectives simultaneously
*Why needed:* Allows joint optimization of privacy and utility rather than treating them as separate trade-offs
*Quick check:* Verify that both objectives are properly weighted in the unified formulation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
DP-SGD mechanism -> Adaptive clipping controller -> Multi-objective optimizer -> Client aggregation

**Critical Path:**
Client local training -> Gradient computation and clipping -> Noise addition -> Server aggregation -> Model update -> Privacy accounting

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Fixed clipping vs. adaptive clipping (stability vs. responsiveness), privacy weight vs. utility weight (conservative vs. aggressive optimization), communication frequency vs. privacy budget consumption

**Failure Signatures:**
Performance degradation when clipping is too aggressive, privacy budget exhaustion, convergence issues due to improper hyperparameter tuning, instability in highly heterogeneous federated environments

**First Experiments:**
1. Baseline DP-FedAvg with fixed clipping on MNIST to establish reference performance
2. Adaptive clipping with multi-objective optimization on Fashion-MNIST to validate improved utility
3. Privacy-utility trade-off analysis across different privacy budgets on CIFAR-10

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to simple image datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10) with standard CNN architectures
- Multi-objective formulation assumes convex or near-convex optimization landscapes
- Theoretical guarantees rely on specific assumptions about noise calibration and clipping dynamics
- Adaptive clipping introduces additional hyperparameters that may affect stability

## Confidence

**Theoretical framework and convergence analysis:** High
**Empirical performance on benchmark datasets:** Medium
**Generalization to complex federated scenarios:** Low

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the approach on heterogeneous federated datasets with non-i.i.d. distributions and varying client participation rates
2. Test scalability to larger, more complex models (e.g., ResNet, Vision Transformers) and datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet)
3. Conduct ablation studies to assess sensitivity to adaptive clipping hyperparameters and initialization strategies
