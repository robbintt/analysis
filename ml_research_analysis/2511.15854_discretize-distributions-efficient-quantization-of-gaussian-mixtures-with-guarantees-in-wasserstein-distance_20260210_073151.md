# discretize_distributions: Efficient Quantization of Gaussian Mixtures with Guarantees in Wasserstein Distance

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.15854
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15854
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** Efficiently constructs discrete approximations of Gaussian mixture distributions with formal Wasserstein distance error guarantees.

## Executive Summary
The discretize_distributions Python package provides efficient algorithms for quantizing Gaussian mixture distributions with provable Wasserstein distance error bounds. The tool implements both grid-based and sigma-point quantization schemes, extending state-of-the-art methods to handle high-dimensional settings and large Gaussian mixtures. By leveraging precomputed optimal quantization templates and a mode-wise clustering approach, the package achieves significant computational savings while maintaining accuracy guarantees. The implementation supports closed-form error evaluation and integrates seamlessly into control and verification pipelines for cyber-physical systems.

## Method Summary
The package constructs discrete approximations by first decomposing multivariate Gaussian mixtures along their covariance eigenbases into independent univariate problems. It precomputes optimal 1D quantization templates for standard normal distributions and transforms them using the mixture's eigenbasis and eigenvalues. For scalability, the tool groups mixture components by proximity into modes and generates schemes per mode rather than per component. The Voronoi-based discretization provides formal error certification through closed-form Wasserstein distance calculations.

## Key Results
- Accurate approximations at low computational cost, with quantization error decreasing rapidly for small support sizes
- Achieves order O(ln N/N²) convergence as support size increases
- Handles high-dimensional settings (e.g., 256 dimensions) with near-constant computation times
- Efficiently scales to large support sizes while maintaining accuracy guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Efficient quantization with error bounds is achieved by decoupling the multivariate problem into independent univariate quantizations along the covariance eigenbasis. For homogeneous Gaussian mixtures, the squared 2-Wasserstein distance decomposes into a weighted sum of 1D errors. The tool precomputes optimal 1D quantization locations for a standard normal distribution and transforms them using the eigenbasis and eigenvalues, ensuring closed-form error computation.

### Mechanism 2
Scalability for large mixtures is improved by grouping components into "modes" and constructing schemes per mode rather than per component. Instead of generating a scheme for every Gaussian component, the algorithm clusters components by mean proximity and computes a local Gaussian approximation for each cluster. This aggregates probability mass of nearby components, reducing the discrete support size required to achieve a given error tolerance.

### Mechanism 3
Formal error certification is provided by utilizing the natural coupling between the continuous distribution and its Voronoi-based discretization. The tool defines partition regions as Voronoi cells induced by the locations, which minimizes the quantization error for a given set of locations. Because the regions are Voronoi and the distribution is Gaussian, the integral for the error bound becomes an equality and is analytically tractable.

## Foundational Learning

- **Wasserstein Distance (W₂):** The loss function the tool minimizes, considering spatial geometry and transport cost essential for control and verification. Quick check: If you double the distance between two support points but keep probabilities equal, does W₂ change? (Answer: Yes, it increases).

- **Voronoi Tessellation:** The "Regions" in the tool are Voronoi cells, where every point in a region is closest to its representative location. Quick check: In a 1D grid with points at -1, 0, and 1, what are the boundaries of the region for the point 0? (Answer: -0.5 and 0.5).

- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) & Homogeneity:** The tool's efficiency depends on whether the GMM is "homogeneous" (shared eigenbasis). Quick check: If you have two Gaussians with diagonal covariance matrices but flipped variances, are they homogeneous? (Answer: Yes, the identity matrix is a valid common eigenbasis).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** distributions -> generate_scheme -> discretize -> output
- **Critical path:** 1) Instantiate MixtureMultivariateNormal, 2) Call generate_scheme with configuration, 3) Call discretize to compute final discrete distribution
- **Design tradeoffs:** Grid offers formal W₂ guarantees and better accuracy; Cross (sigma-point) is faster/sparser but may lack same convergence guarantees. Mode-wise is scalable and sparse; Component-wise is exact per-component but generates massive, redundant support sets.
- **Failure signatures:** Heterogeneous clusters force fallback to per-component schemes, potentially spiking memory usage. Degenerate covariances require careful numerical handling to avoid division-by-zero errors.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Sanity check: Compare per_mode=True vs False in 2D homogeneous GMM, 2) Scaling test: Run 256D "BNN layer" benchmark from Table 1, 3) Stress test: Input degenerate GMM with singular covariance matrix.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the quantization framework with Wasserstein guarantees be extended to non-Gaussian distribution families that admit closed-form quantization?
- How can the differentiable PyTorch backend be leveraged for learning-based quantization scheme optimization?
- Can tighter Wasserstein error bounds be derived for heterogeneous Gaussian mixtures beyond the component-wise sum?
- What is the theoretical convergence rate of the mode-wise quantization procedure compared to component-wise approaches?

## Limitations

- Performance degradation when homogeneity assumption is violated lacks quantitative analysis
- Mode-wise clustering algorithm sensitivity to parameter choices is not thoroughly characterized
- Numerical stability with near-singular covariance matrices requires further validation
- Limited validation of framework for highly heterogeneous mixture distributions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core algorithmic framework (Voronoi-based discretization, error certification via closed-form bounds) is well-established and mathematically sound
- **Medium Confidence:** Computational efficiency gains supported by benchmarks but lack extensive ablation studies
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization to non-Gaussian or highly heterogeneous mixtures is not well-characterized

## Next Checks

1. **Heterogeneity Stress Test:** Systematically evaluate performance on GMMs with varying covariance heterogeneity to measure breakdown points
2. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Grid search over clustering parameters to quantify impact on error, support size, and computation time
3. **Numerical Stability Audit:** Test cases with covariance matrices approaching singularity to verify stability and accuracy of error certificates
