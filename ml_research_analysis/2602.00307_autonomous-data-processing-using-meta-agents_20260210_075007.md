# Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.00307
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00307
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: 50% end-to-end accuracy on KRAMABENCH benchmark for autonomous data pipeline construction

## Executive Summary
ADP-MA introduces a hierarchical meta-agent architecture for autonomous data processing that dynamically constructs, executes, and refines pipelines through strategic planning and adaptive orchestration. The system employs meta-agents for high-level planning and ground-level agents for specialized execution, with continuous monitoring and intelligent backtracking to handle failures. Key innovations include hierarchical planning for context management, progressive sampling for scalability, and a two-level critique mechanism for quality assurance. The framework demonstrates autonomous pipeline construction across diverse data processing tasks, achieving 50% end-to-end accuracy on the KRAMABENCH benchmark for knowledge-intensive, multi-step data science pipelines. ADP-MA addresses limitations of static approaches by enabling dynamic adaptation to data drift, runtime failures, and evolving requirements while maintaining interpretability through comprehensive case documentation and audit trails.

## Method Summary
ADP-MA implements a two-tier agent architecture where meta-agents perform strategic planning and orchestration while ground-level agents execute specialized data processing tasks. The system follows a continuous cycle of pipeline construction, execution, monitoring, and refinement. Meta-agents analyze data requirements and available resources to construct initial pipelines, which are then executed by ground-level agents. The framework employs progressive sampling techniques to handle large datasets efficiently and incorporates a two-level critique mechanism for quality assurance. When failures occur, the system performs intelligent backtracking and pipeline re-planning, leveraging hierarchical context management to maintain coherence across multiple iterations. The architecture supports both batch and streaming data processing scenarios while maintaining audit trails for complete transparency.

## Key Results
- Achieves 50% end-to-end accuracy on KRAMABENCH benchmark for knowledge-intensive data science pipelines
- Demonstrates successful autonomous pipeline construction across diverse data processing tasks
- Implements scalable progressive sampling for handling large datasets efficiently
- Provides interpretable audit trails and case documentation for complete transparency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ADP-MA works by decoupling strategic planning from tactical execution through its hierarchical agent architecture. Meta-agents operate at a higher abstraction level, focusing on understanding data requirements, available resources, and overall workflow objectives. This separation allows for more efficient decision-making and better context management compared to monolithic approaches. The progressive sampling mechanism enables the system to scale to large datasets by intelligently selecting representative subsets for initial pipeline construction and refinement. The two-level critique mechanism provides both immediate feedback on execution quality and longer-term assessment of pipeline effectiveness. When failures occur, the system's intelligent backtracking capability allows it to identify root causes and re-plan effectively without losing accumulated knowledge from previous attempts.

## Foundational Learning
- Hierarchical agent architecture: Required for separating strategic planning from tactical execution, enabling more efficient decision-making and better context management. Quick check: Can the system handle increasing complexity without performance degradation?
- Progressive sampling: Needed to scale to large datasets while maintaining reasonable computation times. Quick check: Does sampling accuracy correlate with final pipeline performance?
- Two-level critique mechanism: Essential for providing both immediate execution feedback and longer-term quality assessment. Quick check: Are critique outcomes consistent across multiple pipeline executions?
- Intelligent backtracking: Required for effective failure recovery without losing accumulated knowledge. Quick check: Can the system successfully recover from complex, cascading failures?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data Source -> Meta-Agent (Planner) -> Ground-Level Agents -> Execution Environment -> Monitoring System -> Feedback Loop -> Meta-Agent (Refiner)

Critical path: Data Analysis → Pipeline Construction → Execution → Monitoring → Quality Assessment → Refinement (loop)

Design tradeoffs: The hierarchical architecture introduces coordination overhead between meta-agents and ground-level agents but provides better context management and scalability. Progressive sampling reduces computational requirements but may miss important edge cases. The two-level critique mechanism adds complexity but improves quality assurance.

Failure signatures: Common failures include resource constraints during execution, data quality issues causing pipeline breakdowns, and coordination failures between hierarchical agent layers. The system handles these through adaptive resource allocation, data preprocessing pipelines, and enhanced communication protocols between agent layers.

First experiments:
1. Single-source data processing pipeline with known schema and quality profile
2. Multi-source data integration with schema mapping requirements
3. Failure injection testing to validate intelligent backtracking capabilities
