- Primary result: Three AI frameworks for ultra-sparse CT, DECT MMD, and accelerated 4D MRI reconstruction in radiotherapy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation presents three AI-driven medical imaging reconstruction frameworks designed to enhance radiotherapy treatment planning and delivery. The work addresses the critical challenge of reducing radiation dose and acquisition time while maintaining or improving image quality. TomoGRAF enables ultra-sparse (single-view) CT reconstruction using X-ray physics-embedded NeRF generators. rFast-MMDNet achieves accurate dual-energy CT multi-material decomposition through sinogram-domain processing. Two complementary 4D MRI frameworks (Re-Con-GAN and CIRNet) provide 10-30x acceleration for respiratory motion monitoring. Together, these methods demonstrate how physics-informed AI can transform medical imaging reconstruction across CT, DECT, and MRI modalities.

## Method Summary
The work develops three distinct AI reconstruction frameworks: TomoGRAF uses a conditional radiance field generator with embedded X-ray transport physics to reconstruct 3D volumes from ultra-sparse CT projections (down to single-view); rFast-MMDNet employs a two-stage sinogram-to-image pipeline where SinoNet decomposes dual-energy projections followed by FBP and denoising; 4D MRI acceleration is achieved through paired conditional GAN (Re-Con-GAN) for speed and diffusion-based denoising (CIRNet) for extreme acceleration capability. All methods integrate physics constraints with deep learning, using diverse datasets including LIDC-IDRI thoracic CT, AAPM DECT challenge phantoms, and clinical 4D MRI scans. Training involves specialized loss functions combining L1, MS-SSIM, and LPIPS metrics with physical plausibility constraints.

## Key Results
- TomoGRAF achieves SSIM=0.79±0.03 and PSNR=33.45±0.13 for single-view CT reconstruction, outperforming X2CT-GAN and MedNeRF baselines
- rFast-MMDNet achieves RMSE=0.002±~0 and SSIM=0.001±~0 for breast tissue decomposition in dual-energy CT
- CIRNet enables 30x acceleration of 4D MRI reconstruction while maintaining superior tissue texture retention compared to GAN-based approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Ultra-sparse (single-view) CT reconstruction is enabled by embedding X-ray transport physics into a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) generator.
- **Mechanism:** Unlike standard NeRFs designed for visible light surface rendering, TomoGRAF simulates X-ray attenuation physics. By casting rays and computing density based on X-ray transport properties, the network learns to map 2D projections to 3D volumetric density, constrained by physical plausibility rather than just visual similarity.
- **Core assumption:** The simulated X-ray casting and tracing process approximates the true physical interaction between X-rays and human tissue sufficiently to regularize the ill-posed inverse problem.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract] "TomoGRAF... integrates X-ray transport physics to reconstruct high-quality 3D volumes..."
  - [Section 2.1] "...distinct differences between CT volume reconstruction and 'natural object' 3D representation... The goal of CT reconstruction is voxel-wise material densities..."
  - [Corpus] "Physical foundations for trustworthy medical imaging... applications cover the full range... driven by the physics of each technique."
- **Break condition:** If the physical simulation diverges significantly from actual detector physics (e.g., noise, scatter not modeled), reconstruction fidelity may degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Dual-energy CT (DECT) multi-material decomposition (MMD) accuracy is maintained while avoiding slow iterative reconstruction by separating sinogram-domain decomposition from image-domain denoising.
- **Mechanism:** The framework (rFast-MMDNet) first uses SinoNet to decompose dual-energy projections directly in the sinogram domain (preserving raw attenuation data). It then uses a fast FBP layer for domain conversion, followed by a DenoiseNet to suppress resulting artifacts. This bypasses the computational cost of iterative forward/backward projections during inference.
- **Core assumption:** The information lost during the FBP step (which introduces streak/cupping artifacts) is recoverable by a post-hoc convolutional denoising network (DenoiseNet).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract] "...rFast-MMDNet employs a two-stage algorithm... SinoNet... and FBP-DenoiseNet..."
  - [Section 3.4] "...FBP as an imperfect backprojection option... artifacts can be practically treated as noise and factored into [the denoising task]."
- **Break condition:** If the DenoiseNet is undertrained or FBP artifacts are structurally too complex (e.g., overlapping distinct tissues), decomposition accuracy will suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Extremely accelerated 4D MRI reconstruction (up to 30x) is achieved by modeling the image formation as an iterative stochastic denoising process rather than a direct mapping.
- **Mechanism:** CIRNet (diffusion-based) learns to reverse a forward diffusion process that adds Gaussian noise to ground truth images. At inference, it iteratively recovers signal from noise conditioned on the undersampled input. This is contrasted with Re-Con-GAN (GAN-based), which learns a direct mapping but struggles with extreme acceleration (>10x) due to optimization instability.
- **Core assumption:** The structural information remaining in an extremely undersampled (30x) input is sufficient to condition the reverse diffusion trajectory toward the correct anatomical manifold.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract] "CIRNet employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic framework... runs the reverse process to recover signals from noise."
  - [Section 4.3.4] "CIRNet offers superior retention of subtle tissue textures... Re-Con-GAN suffers from detail loss due to inherent smoothing effects of CNNs."
- **Break condition:** If the undersampling is so severe that the condition signal is effectively noise, the diffusion model may hallucinate structures (generative artifacts) unrelated to patient anatomy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** X-ray Physics & Attenuation
  - **Why needed here:** TomoGRAF relies on differentiating between optical rendering (surface color) and X-ray attenuation (volumetric density).
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why visible-light NeRFs fail to reconstruct CT volumes? (Answer: They model surface reflection, not internal attenuation).

- **Concept:** Sinogram vs. Image Domain
  - **Why needed here:** rFast-MMDNet operates on "raw projection data" (sinograms) before image reconstruction to prevent information loss.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might performing material decomposition in the sinogram domain be more accurate than the image domain? (Answer: It avoids the information loss and artifacts introduced by the initial reconstruction step).

- **Concept:** Diffusion Models (DDPM)
  - **Why needed here:** CIRNet uses a stochastic iterative process (diffusion) rather than a deterministic feed-forward pass (CNN/GAN).
  - **Quick check question:** What is the trade-off between CIRNet and Re-Con-GAN regarding speed vs. acceleration capability? (Answer: CIRNet is slower due to iterative steps but handles 30x acceleration better; GAN is faster but caps at ~10x).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. TomoGRAF: Generator (Ray Sampler -> Conditional Radiance Field MLP -> X-ray Renderer) + Discriminator (3D/2D CNNs)
  2. rFast-MMDNet: SinoNet (3D UNet for projection decomposition) -> Fixed FBP Layer -> DenoiseNet (16 ResNet blocks)
  3. 4D MRI Suite:
     - Re-Con-GAN: ResNet9/UNet Generator + PatchGAN Discriminator
     - CIRNet: U-Net variant (BigGAN residual blocks) conditioned on undersampled inputs

- **Critical path:**
  - CT: Input Sparse Views -> TomoGRAF Generator (Physics-informed rendering) -> 3D Volume
  - DECT: Input DE Sinogram -> SinoNet -> Decomposed Sinograms -> FBP -> Rough Images -> DenoiseNet -> Final Material Maps
  - MRI: Undersampled k-space -> nuFFT -> Re-Con-GAN (Fast) OR CIRNet (Slow/High Quality)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Inference Speed vs. Quality: GANs (Re-Con-GAN) offer sub-second inference suitable for real-time guidance, while Diffusion (CIRNet) takes ~11s but enables 30x acceleration (shorter acquisition time)
  - Generalizability: TomoGRAF requires per-instance fine-tuning at inference (taking minutes), whereas rFast-MMDNet is trained once

- **Failure signatures:**
  - TomoGRAF: Loss of fine details/CT number accuracy if only 1 view is used without 3D supervision training
  - rFast-MMDNet: High noise or "patchy" artifacts if DenoiseNet capacity is insufficient for the FBP noise profile
  - Re-Con-GAN: "Tiling" artifacts or mode collapse at >10x acceleration

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablate Physics in TomoGRAF: Remove X-ray transport physics from the generator to confirm performance drops to MedNeRF levels
  2. DECT Noise Robustness: Test rFast-MMDNet on simulated data with increasing Poisson noise to verify DenoiseNet effectiveness
  3. Acceleration Limit Test: Run Re-Con-GAN and CIRNet side-by-side at 30x acceleration to visually confirm where the GAN fails (blur) and Diffusion succeeds (texture retention)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Is single-view TomoGRAF reconstruction sufficiently accurate for quantitative radiation dose calculation?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The author states the model is currently suited for object detection, but "its appropriateness for quantitative tasks such as radiation dose calculation needs to be further studied."
  - **Why unresolved:** The 1-view reconstruction results lose fine details and CT number accuracy compared to ground truth.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A dosimetric comparison showing dose volume histograms calculated from TomoGRAF reconstructions match those from planning CTs.

- **Question:** Does rFast-MMDNet maintain decomposition fidelity on real-world clinical data?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The discussion notes that while results on the AAPM Grand Challenge were promising, the method "needs to be further tested on real-world data."
  - **Why unresolved:** The model was validated on simulated datasets where ground truth was noise-free, whereas clinical data contains complex noise and artifacts.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Material decomposition accuracy metrics (RMSE, SSIM) evaluated on raw sinograms acquired from diverse, real patient DECT scans.

- **Question:** Can the 4D MRI reconstruction frameworks be scaled to full 3D+t volumetric processing?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The author notes the implementation is restricted to 2D+t because "3D+t training would allow more effective learning... but requires an exceedingly large GPU memory footprint."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current GPU memory constraints limit the diffusion (CIRNet) and GAN (Re-Con-GAN) architectures from handling full volumetric spatiotemporal data.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A memory-optimized architecture successfully reconstructing full 3D+t volumes on standard clinical hardware without memory overflow.

## Limitations

- TomoGRAF requires per-inference fine-tuning (minutes per instance) that may limit clinical deployment speed
- X-ray physics simulation in TomoGRAF may not fully capture real-world detector physics including scatter and noise patterns
- CIRNet's 11-second inference time for 30x acceleration remains clinically limiting despite superior quality retention

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** CT reconstruction SSIM/PSNR values (0.79±0.03, 33.45±0.13) and DECT decomposition RMSE (0.002±~0) are well-supported by quantitative metrics against ground truth volumes and phantoms
- **Medium Confidence:** The superiority of sinogram-domain decomposition over image-domain methods in rFast-MMDNet is logically supported but requires empirical validation against end-to-end learned approaches
- **Low Confidence:** The claimed 30x acceleration capability of CIRNet for 4D MRI, while demonstrated, may not generalize to all anatomical sites or respiratory patterns

## Next Checks

1. **Physics Ablation Study:** Remove X-ray transport physics from TomoGRAF generator while keeping all other components identical. Compare reconstruction quality against baseline MedNeRF to quantify the contribution of physical modeling beyond standard NeRF architectures.

2. **Noise Robustness Testing:** Systematically evaluate rFast-MMDNet on DECT decomposition tasks using simulated breast phantoms with increasing Poisson noise levels (0-100 counts) to verify the DenoiseNet's effectiveness across realistic noise profiles and identify the noise threshold where decomposition accuracy degrades.

3. **Cross-Anatomical Generalization:** Apply CIRNet to undersampled 4D MRI datasets from anatomical sites beyond lungs (liver, kidneys) with varying respiratory patterns and k-space sampling trajectories. Compare quality retention and inference times to validate generalization beyond the training domain.
