- Primary result: RL approach achieves 0.97 IoU for 2D wire-frame reconstruction

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a reinforcement learning approach for reconstructing 2D wire-frame projections by iteratively aligning reconstruction lines with target edges. The environment represents states as four-color images showing background, target edges, reconstruction lines, and their overlaps. Agents transform reconstruction lines through a four-dimensional action space and can terminate episodes using a specific action. The methodology demonstrates RL's effectiveness for 2D wire-frame reconstruction, with optimized reward functions and difficulty-based curricula providing the most promising framework for similar tasks.

## Method Summary
The approach uses PPO with a NatureCNN feature extractor to train agents on wire-frame reconstruction tasks. States are encoded as 60×60 four-color images (black=background, white=target edges, gray=reconstruction line, green=overlap, red=previously detected edges) containing a 30×30 wire-frame target. The agent performs 4D continuous actions (2D translation, 2D endpoint manipulation) plus a fixation action to terminate episodes. The combined reward structure (incremental IoU changes plus episodic alignment bonuses) achieved optimal performance at 0.97 IoU. Difficulty-based curriculum learning - pre-training on single-detection mode then transferring to multi-detection - produced significant gains from 0.15 to 0.43 IoU, making the complex multi-detection task learnable.

## Key Results
- Combined incremental and episodic rewards achieved optimal performance (0.97 IoU)
- Pure incremental rewards failed to solve the task
- Difficulty-based curriculum significantly improved multi-detection performance (0.15 to 0.43 IoU)
- Action-space-based curricula did not improve performance compared to direct training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combined incremental and episodic rewards outperform either reward type alone for alignment tasks.
- Mechanism: Step-wise rewards (rt) based on IoU changes provide dense learning signal during exploration, while episodic rewards (Et) evaluate final alignment quality. The incremental signal guides early exploration, while episodic signal ensures convergence to correct solutions.
- Core assumption: Agents benefit from intermediate feedback when episodic rewards are sparse or delayed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "combined episodic and incremental reward structure with clipping to positive episodic returns achieved optimal performance, reaching a mean IoU of 0.97"
  - [section 5 Results]: "The combined reward function (green) achieved the highest mean IoU of 0.97, followed closely by the sparse reward structure (red) with 0.96 IoU... the combined reward achieves significantly better performance earlier in training"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus evidence for this specific reward combination in wire-frame tasks.
- Break condition: When incremental rewards create local optima that conflict with episodic alignment goals, or when episode lengths vary drastically causing return variance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Difficulty-based curriculum learning enables acquisition of complex multi-detection tasks that fail to learn from scratch.
- Mechanism: Pre-training on single-detection mode (independent episodes, no carryover) builds foundational alignment policies. These transfer to multi-detection mode where previously identified edges persist (colored red), reducing effective task complexity at switch point.
- Core assumption: Skills learned in simplified environments transfer to complex variants without catastrophic forgetting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "difficulty-based curriculum... significantly improved performance, increasing mean IoU from 0.15 to 0.43 in the multi-detection environment"
  - [section 6 Discussion]: "directly after the switch, the performance of the curriculum agent is better than the maximum of the directly trained agent"
  - [corpus]: "Causally Aligned Curriculum Learning" and "CCL: Collaborative Curriculum Learning" support curriculum effectiveness in sparse-reward RL.
- Break condition: When source and target task action distributions diverge significantly, or when transfer causes negative interference.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Four-color state encoding enables efficient policy learning by making overlap explicit.
- Mechanism: Encoding background (black), target edges (white), reconstruction line (gray), and overlap (green) as distinct channels allows direct IoU computation and provides visually parseable alignment feedback without explicit distance calculations.
- Core assumption: CNN-based policy networks can learn spatial alignment from color-coded overlap representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3 Problem Setting]: "An overlap of target and reconstruction line is represented by green pixels... the colours correspond to True Positive (green), false positive (gray), false negative (white) and true negative (black)"
  - [section 4 Methodology]: "This can be done efficiently, as the colours correspond to True Positive (green), false positive (gray), false negative (white) and true negative (black)"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for this specific encoding scheme.
- Break condition: When reconstruction and target geometries differ fundamentally (curves vs. lines), or when color channel capacity limits multi-class scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - Why needed here: Core RL algorithm used for all experiments; understanding clipped surrogate objectives and value function estimation is prerequisite for reproducing results.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why PPO's clipped objective prevents excessive policy updates compared to vanilla policy gradient?

- Concept: **Intersection over Union (IoU) for segmentation**
  - Why needed here: Primary evaluation metric; reward functions are built on IoU increments between states.
  - Quick check question: Given a reconstruction line covering 15 pixels and a target edge of 20 pixels with 12 overlapping pixels, what is the IoU?

- Concept: **Curriculum Learning as Continuation Method**
  - Why needed here: Explains why difficulty-based curriculum works; theoretical foundation from Bengio et al. connects to non-convex optimization.
  - Quick check question: How does starting with simplified tasks relate to smoothing a non-convex loss landscape?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: State image → NatureCNN features → Policy head → Action (translate/scale/rotate/fixate) → Environment step → Reward computation → PPO update

- Critical path: State image → NatureCNN features → Policy head → Action (translate/scale/rotate/fixate) → Environment step → Reward computation → PPO update

- Design tradeoffs:
  - SAT vs. FAT action space: SAT reduces search space but requires pre-aligned reconstruction initialization; FAT is more general but harder to learn
  - Single vs. multi detection mode: Single isolates learning per edge; multi requires handling cumulative state changes
  - Clipping rewards (Gclip vs. Gclip+): Clipping reduces variance but may mask useful gradient signal; paper found clipping detrimental

- Failure signatures:
  - IoU stuck at 0.0 with incremental-only reward: Agent oscillates without converging (reported in Results)
  - Performance drop after curriculum switch: Indicates negative transfer or insufficient source task mastery
  - High variance across seeds with sparse reward: Indicates unstable credit assignment

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce single-detection + FAT + combined reward baseline; target ~0.90+ IoU within 10M steps to validate implementation
  2. Ablate incremental vs. episodic components of combined reward; quantify contribution of each signal type
  3. Test difficulty curriculum with different split ratios (e.g., 20/80, 50/50) to find optimal transfer point for multi-detection task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the iterative RL-based reconstruction approach be extended from 2D projections to full 3D wire-frame reconstruction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The abstract states the goal concerns "reconstructing all edges of an arbitrary 3D wire-frame model projected to an image plane," yet the methodology and experiments only implement 2D reconstruction.
- Why unresolved: 3D reconstruction introduces additional complexity including depth estimation, occlusion handling, and multi-view consistency that the current 2D framework does not address.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful reconstruction of 3D wire-frame models from single or multiple 2D projections with quantitative accuracy metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the method scale to higher-resolution images and wire-frames with more than three edges?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Experiments used only 30×30 pixel targets, 60×60 state space, and wire-frames limited to three edges, leaving real-world scalability untested.
- Why unresolved: Computational costs, training stability, and agent performance may degrade significantly with increased state space dimensionality and task complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark results on progressively larger images and more complex wire-frame structures with associated training time and IoU metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the trained agent generalize from synthetic wire-frame data to real-world images containing noise, occlusions, and lighting variations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All experiments used synthetically generated wire-frames on black backgrounds; no validation on real photographs was conducted.
- Why unresolved: Real-world images introduce edge detection ambiguities, background clutter, and sensor noise absent in the controlled synthetic environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on datasets of real photographs (e.g., scaffoldings, architectural structures) with comparison to synthetic performance.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Why does the difficulty-based curriculum substantially improve performance while the action-based curriculum underperforms relative to direct training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper reports difficulty-based curriculum improved IoU from 0.15 to 0.43, whereas action-based curriculum achieved only 0.48 versus 0.58 for direct training, but offers no theoretical explanation for this asymmetry.
- Why unresolved: Understanding the conditions under which curriculum learning benefits RL agents remains unclear, particularly regarding what knowledge transfers effectively between task variants.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies analyzing learned representations across curriculum stages, or systematic variation of curriculum design parameters.

## Limitations

- Wire-frame generation procedure remains unspecified, creating potential reproducibility gaps
- Exact PPO hyperparameters beyond learning rate are not provided (batch size, discount factor, clip range, epochs)
- D_t parameter in episodic reward function is undefined despite μ=5 being specified
- Implementation of four-color state encoding and its relationship to IoU computation requires careful verification

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Combined incremental and episodic rewards outperform single reward types (supported by direct experimental results showing 0.97 vs 0.96 IoU, with statistical significance in early training)
- **Medium confidence**: Difficulty-based curriculum enables multi-detection learning (strong experimental evidence, but transfer mechanisms not fully characterized)
- **Medium confidence**: Four-color state encoding enables efficient learning (empirically demonstrated, but lacks theoretical justification or ablation studies)
- **Low confidence**: Action-space-based curriculum has no benefit (single negative result without exploring alternative task sequencing strategies)

## Next Checks

1. **Reward function ablation**: Systematically isolate the contribution of incremental vs. episodic components in the combined reward to quantify their relative importance for alignment learning.

2. **Curriculum transfer optimization**: Test different single→multi detection split ratios (e.g., 20/80, 50/50) to identify optimal transfer timing and characterize the transfer learning dynamics.

3. **State encoding ablation**: Replace four-color encoding with explicit IoU distance channels or binary masks to test whether the color-based overlap representation is essential for learning efficiency.
