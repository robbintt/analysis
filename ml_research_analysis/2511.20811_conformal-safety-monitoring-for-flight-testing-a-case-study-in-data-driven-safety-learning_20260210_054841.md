# Conformal Safety Monitoring for Flight Testing: A Case Study in Data-Driven Safety Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20811
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20811
- Reference count: 24
- Data-driven conformal prediction approach for flight safety monitoring

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing using conformal prediction. The method leverages offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of short-term safety risk, enabling pilots to receive preemptive alerts before safety violations occur. By combining trajectory prediction, nearest neighbor classification, and conformal calibration, the approach provides interpretable p-values as continuous safety scores that help pilots make informed decisions about aborting maneuvers in uncertain flight conditions.

## Method Summary
The conformal safety monitoring approach consists of three key components: a predictive model that forecasts future states from recent observations, a nearest neighbor classifier to determine safety status, and calibration via conformal prediction to ensure statistical guarantees. The method uses offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn safety patterns and generates calibrated risk estimates at runtime. The conformal prediction framework provides theoretical guarantees on miss rates while maintaining high classification power for safe trajectories. The approach is evaluated on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating reliable identification of unsafe scenarios and matching theoretical guarantees.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated reliable identification of unsafe scenarios in flight dynamics models with uncertain parameters
- Achieved desired miss rate bounds while maintaining high classification power for safe trajectories
- Conformal safety monitor outperformed baseline approaches in preemptive risk classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by learning safety patterns from simulated trajectories and using conformal prediction to provide statistically calibrated risk estimates. The conformal framework transforms raw safety classifications into interpretable p-values that represent continuous safety scores. This enables the system to provide preemptive alerts before violations occur, rather than only detecting failures after they happen. The approach handles uncertainty in flight dynamics by learning from stochastic simulations rather than requiring precise safety constraint specification.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Conformal Prediction** - Why needed: Provides statistical guarantees for uncertainty quantification in safety-critical systems
   Quick check: Can the method produce valid p-values with finite sample calibration?

2. **Nearest Neighbor Classification** - Why needed: Enables similarity-based safety assessment without requiring explicit safety boundaries
   Quick check: Does the method correctly identify safety patterns in the feature space?

3. **Trajectory Prediction** - Why needed: Allows for preemptive safety assessment by forecasting future states
   Quick check: Are the predicted trajectories sufficiently accurate for safety monitoring?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: [Real-time sensor data] -> [Trajectory prediction model] -> [Safety classification] -> [Conformal calibration] -> [Safety score/p-value]

Critical Path: The critical path for safety monitoring runs from sensor data through trajectory prediction to final safety score generation. The trajectory prediction model must operate within real-time constraints to enable preemptive alerts.

Design Tradeoffs: The method trades computational complexity for safety guarantees. Conformal calibration requires offline computation but provides statistical guarantees. The nearest neighbor approach avoids explicit safety boundary specification but may be computationally intensive at runtime.

Failure Signatures: The system may fail when:
- Trajectory predictions are inaccurate due to model mismatch
- Safety patterns in the feature space are not well-captured by nearest neighbors
- Calibration data does not represent the operational envelope

First 3 Experiments:
1. Validate trajectory prediction accuracy on held-out simulation data
2. Test nearest neighbor classification performance on known safe/unsafe scenarios
3. Verify conformal calibration produces valid p-values on calibration dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on simulated trajectories may not capture all real-world complexities and edge cases
- Limited sample size and diversity of test cases in evaluation
- Human-machine interaction component needs further exploration for real-time pilot use

## Confidence
- Core claims about conformal prediction providing calibrated safety risk estimates: Medium
- Claims about outperforming baseline approaches: Medium
- Overall empirical validation using simulated rather than real flight data: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on real flight test data from actual aircraft to assess real-world performance and identify gaps between simulation and practice
2. Conduct a user study with experienced test pilots to evaluate the interpretability and usability of safety scores and alerts in realistic scenarios
3. Expand evaluation to include wider range of flight conditions, maneuvers, and potential failure modes to stress-test method's robustness
