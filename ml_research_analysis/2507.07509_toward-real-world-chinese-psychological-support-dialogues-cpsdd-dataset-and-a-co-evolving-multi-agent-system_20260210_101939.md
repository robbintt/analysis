# Toward Real-World Chinese Psychological Support Dialogues: CPsDD Dataset and a Co-Evolving Multi-Agent System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07509
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07509
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Creates CPsDD dataset with 68K dialogues and achieves state-of-the-art performance in psychological support response generation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in high-quality Chinese psychological support dialogue datasets and the challenge of generating empathetic, strategy-guided responses using large language models. The authors propose a framework that leverages limited real-world dialogues and expert knowledge to fine-tune a Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier, creating the CPsDD dataset with comprehensive coverage across user demographics and psychological problems. They introduce CADSS, a multi-agent system that integrates specialized components to generate personalized and empathetic responses, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both strategy prediction and emotional support conversation tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors tackle the scarcity of Chinese psychological support data by constructing the CPsDD dataset through a co-evolving multi-agent system approach. They first fine-tune a Dialog Generator on limited real-world dialogues and expert knowledge, then use a Dialog Modifier to improve generated responses. This iterative process creates a dataset of 68K dialogues covering 13 user groups, 16 psychological problems, and 9 response strategies. The CADSS system integrates a Profiler, Summarizer, Planner, and Supporter working in sequence to generate empathetic responses. The framework employs knowledge distillation from human-annotated data and achieves high performance through iterative refinement of both dataset and response generation capabilities.

## Key Results
- CPsDD dataset creation yields 68K dialogues with comprehensive coverage across user groups and psychological problems
- CADSS achieves 96.18% accuracy on strategy prediction and 93.33% on empathy prediction tasks
- State-of-the-art performance demonstrated on both CPsDD and ESConv datasets with competitive BLEU and ROUGE-L scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by combining expert knowledge with iterative generation and refinement. The Dialog Generator creates initial responses based on limited real-world data, while the Dialog Modifier improves these responses through targeted refinement. The multi-agent CADSS system breaks down the complex task of psychological support into specialized components that work together: the Profiler analyzes user context, the Summarizer condenses conversation history, the Planner determines appropriate strategies, and the Supporter generates the final empathetic response. This decomposition allows each component to specialize in its task while maintaining coherence through the overall system architecture.

## Foundational Learning
- **Psychological Support Dialogue**: Understanding the structure and requirements of therapeutic conversations, needed to properly frame the problem and evaluation metrics
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring expertise from human annotations to model parameters, essential for training with limited real-world data
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinating specialized components to solve complex tasks, fundamental to CADSS architecture
- **Strategy Prediction**: Identifying appropriate therapeutic approaches for different psychological problems, critical for personalized support
- **Empathetic Response Generation**: Creating responses that demonstrate understanding and emotional support, core to effective psychological assistance
- **Iterative Refinement**: Using generated data to improve models in a feedback loop, key to expanding dataset quality

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Real Dialogues -> Dialog Generator -> Dialog Modifier -> CPsDD Dataset -> CADSS (Profiler -> Summarizer -> Planner -> Supporter)

Critical Path: The most critical path runs from the initial real dialogues through the co-evolving generation process to create the CPsDD dataset, which then trains and evaluates the CADSS system. The iterative refinement between generation and modification ensures dataset quality and system effectiveness.

Design Tradeoffs: The system prioritizes data quality and expert guidance over dataset size, accepting a modest 68K dialogues to ensure annotation quality. The multi-agent decomposition trades some complexity for specialized performance in each component. The knowledge distillation approach balances the need for real-world data with the scarcity of such resources in Chinese psychological support.

Failure Signatures: System failures may manifest as inappropriate strategy selection (Planner errors), loss of context coherence (Summarizer failures), insufficient empathy (Supporter limitations), or incorrect user profiling (Profiler inaccuracies). The iterative refinement process may amplify biases present in the initial real dialogues or expert annotations.

3 First Experiments:
1. Validate the co-evolving generation process by comparing initial and final dataset quality metrics
2. Test individual CADSS components in isolation to identify performance bottlenecks
3. Conduct ablation studies removing each component to measure its contribution to overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Dataset size remains relatively modest at 68K dialogues despite comprehensive coverage
- Reliance on single expert annotations for some strategy labels introduces potential bias
- Limited validation of real-world therapeutic effectiveness beyond controlled task performance

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Dataset creation methodology and CPsDD quality | High |
| CADSS system achieves state-of-the-art performance | High |
| Multi-agent approach effectively generates empathetic responses | Medium |
| Generalizability to real-world therapeutic settings | Medium |
| Long-term efficacy without longitudinal user studies | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct blind evaluations with independent clinical psychologists to verify the quality and appropriateness of generated responses
2. Perform cross-cultural validation to assess the system's effectiveness across different Chinese-speaking populations and cultural contexts
3. Implement A/B testing with real users to measure actual psychological outcomes and user satisfaction compared to baseline support methods
