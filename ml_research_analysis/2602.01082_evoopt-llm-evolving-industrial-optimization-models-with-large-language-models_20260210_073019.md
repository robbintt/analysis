# EvoOpt-LLM: Evolving industrial optimization models with large language models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01082
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01082
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Automated industrial optimization modeling with 91% generation rate and 65.9% executability

## Executive Summary
EvoOpt-LLM introduces a large language model framework that automates the construction and evolution of industrial optimization models from natural language requirements. The system addresses the critical challenge of translating business rules into solver-executable mathematical models while enabling dynamic updates as requirements change. Built on a 7B-parameter LLM with LoRA fine-tuning, the framework demonstrates practical effectiveness with only 3,000 training samples, achieving reliable constraint injection and variable pruning capabilities that reduce expert intervention requirements.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a three-component architecture: automated model construction from natural language, dynamic constraint injection into existing models, and data-driven variable pruning. The system uses LoRA fine-tuning on a 7B-parameter LLM to learn the mapping between natural language descriptions and optimization model structures. The variable pruning module specifically targets medium-sized LP models, using 400 training samples to achieve an F1 score of approximately 0.56. The approach emphasizes data efficiency, requiring minimal training data compared to traditional optimization modeling approaches while maintaining practical execution rates for solver deployment.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91% generation rate and 65.9% executability with only 3,000 training samples
- Variable pruning module reaches F1 score of ~0.56 on medium-sized LP models using 400 samples
- Successfully maintains original optimization objectives while injecting new business constraints into deployed models
- Demonstrates practical scalability for industrial optimization tasks without extensive expert intervention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its integration of natural language understanding with formal optimization modeling through LLM fine-tuning. By leveraging LoRA's parameter-efficient adaptation, the system learns to map business requirements expressed in natural language to mathematical constraints and objectives. The constraint injection mechanism preserves existing model structure while incorporating new business rules, and the variable pruning component uses learned patterns to identify redundant decision variables that can be eliminated without compromising solution quality.

## Foundational Learning
- LoRA fine-tuning for parameter-efficient LLM adaptation - needed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining model performance; quick check: verify parameter count reduction vs. full fine-tuning
- Natural language to mathematical constraint mapping - essential for automated model construction from business requirements; quick check: test translation accuracy on diverse business scenarios
- Constraint injection into existing models - required for maintaining deployed models as business rules evolve; quick check: validate constraint preservation of original objectives
- Variable pruning for solver efficiency - necessary to reduce computational complexity in large optimization problems; quick check: measure solver performance improvement after pruning
- Data-driven optimization model evolution - critical for reducing reliance on domain experts; quick check: compare expert intervention time before/after implementation

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Natural Language Input -> Model Construction -> Constraint Injection -> Variable Pruning -> Solver Output
- Critical path: Model Construction (LLM generation) -> Constraint Injection (validation) -> Solver Execution (executability check)
- Design tradeoffs: Balanced data efficiency (3,000 samples) against model complexity (7B parameters) to achieve practical industrial deployment
- Failure signatures: Generation failures typically occur with ambiguous natural language input; executability issues arise from malformed mathematical constraints
- First experiments: 1) Test natural language to constraint translation accuracy, 2) Validate constraint injection preserves original objectives, 3) Measure solver performance improvement from variable pruning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited scalability testing on large industrial models with thousands of variables and constraints
- Variable pruning accuracy (F1 score of 0.56) indicates significant room for improvement
- 3,000 training samples may not generalize well across diverse industrial domains

## Confidence
- High: Core methodology of integrating LLM-based automated model construction with constraint injection and variable pruning capabilities
- Medium: Reported performance metrics based on limited dataset size and may not reflect real-world industrial complexity
- Low: Long-term maintenance claims without addressing model drift or performance degradation over extended operational periods

## Next Checks
1. Test framework scalability on industrial-scale models with 10,000+ variables and constraints to assess performance limits
2. Conduct cross-domain validation across multiple industries to verify generalization beyond initial test cases
3. Implement longitudinal testing to evaluate model maintenance performance over 6-12 month operational periods under evolving business rules
