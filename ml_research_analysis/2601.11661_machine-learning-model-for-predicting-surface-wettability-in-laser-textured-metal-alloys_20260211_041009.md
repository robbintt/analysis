# Machine learning model for predicting surface wettability in laser-textured metal alloys

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.11661
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11661
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Ensemble neural network predicts surface wettability (contact angle) with R² = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896° using chemical and topographical features

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a machine learning framework that predicts water contact angle on laser-textured metal alloys by combining nanoscale topographical features with chemical surface properties. The approach extracts Laws texture energy features from SEM images and surface chemistry data from XPS to predict wettability. An ensemble neural network incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization achieved high predictive accuracy. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry, particularly functional group polarity and coverage, had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. The model provides interpretable insights into the complex interplay between surface characteristics and wetting behavior.

## Method Summary
The framework combines nanoscale topographical features extracted via Laws texture energy method with chemical surface properties characterized by XPS to predict contact angles. The ensemble neural network architecture incorporates residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. Feature selection was performed using Random Forest importance, reducing 36 initial features to 20. The model was trained on 60 samples of laser-textured AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys, with 8-fold cross-validation repeated twice. Performance was evaluated using R² and RMSE metrics, with the final prediction obtained through model averaging.

## Key Results
- Ensemble neural network achieved R² = 0.942 and RMSE = 13.896° on contact angle prediction
- Surface chemistry features (functional group polarity and coverage) showed the strongest influence on predictions
- Topographical features contributed significantly alongside chemical properties
- The model successfully captured complex interactions between surface characteristics and wetting behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model succeeds by integrating complementary information sources: Laws texture energy features capture nanoscale surface roughness patterns that influence wetting behavior, while XPS-derived chemical descriptors quantify functional group composition that determines surface energy. The ensemble architecture with residual connections allows the model to learn complex non-linear relationships between these heterogeneous feature sets and contact angle. Batch normalization and dropout prevent overfitting despite the limited sample size, while the composite MSE-Huber loss provides robustness to outliers in the regression task.

## Foundational Learning
**Laws texture energy method**: Extracts nanoscale texture features from SEM images using convolution masks (Edge, Spot, Wave, Ripple, Level). Needed to quantify surface roughness patterns that influence contact angle. Quick check: Verify feature extraction produces consistent descriptors across different magnifications.

**XPS surface chemistry analysis**: Provides quantitative data on functional group composition (CH₂, CF₂, CF₃, CN) including peak area fractions, dipole moments, and molecular volumes. Needed to characterize surface energy and polarity. Quick check: Confirm chemical descriptors correlate with known wetting behavior trends.

**Ensemble neural networks with residual connections**: Combines multiple neural network predictions while allowing gradient flow through skip connections. Needed to capture complex non-linear relationships and improve generalization. Quick check: Compare single model performance against ensemble to verify improvement.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input features (20) -> Residual NN blocks (4) -> Batch norm + Dropout -> Leaky ReLU -> Output layer -> Model averaging (ensemble)

**Critical path**: Feature preprocessing (Yeo-Johnson transform) -> Random Forest feature selection -> Ensemble NN training (AdamW, early stopping) -> Model averaging for final prediction

**Design tradeoffs**: Ensemble approach improves robustness but increases computational cost; residual connections help with gradient flow but add complexity; composite loss function balances MSE sensitivity with Huber robustness

**Failure signatures**: High CV variance suggests overfitting; poor topographical feature performance indicates texture extraction issues; chemistry-only dominance suggests topography features aren't informative

**First experiments**:
1. Train single NN with identical architecture to verify baseline performance before ensemble
2. Conduct ablation study removing either chemical or topographical features
3. Test different ensemble sizes (5, 10, 15 models) to find optimal balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can the framework be adapted to solve the inverse design problem, determining the specific laser and chemical parameters required to achieve a target contact angle?
- Basis: The abstract claims the work offers a "data-driven pathway for designing functional surfaces," and the conclusion states it is a tool for "designing functional surfaces with tailored wettability."
- Why unresolved: The study validates a forward prediction model but does not demonstrate capability to output processing parameters for desired wettability.
- Evidence needed: Successful experimental fabrication of surfaces using processing parameters generated solely by an inverted version of the model to match user-defined contact angles.

**Open Question 2**: Does the predictive model generalize to liquids with different polarities and surface tensions, such as oils or organic solvents?
- Basis: The model is trained exclusively on "static water contact angle" data, and liquid properties are not included as input variables.
- Why unresolved: The feature importance analysis highlights polar groups (e.g., CN) as dominant predictors, which may not correlate with wettability behavior for non-polar liquids.
- Evidence needed: Testing the model's predictive accuracy on contact angle measurements obtained using probe liquids with varying surface tensions.

**Open Question 3**: Is the observed prediction variance a result of the small dataset size (N=60) relative to the complexity of the ensemble neural network architecture?
- Basis: Section 2 states "A total of 60... samples" were used to train a complex ensemble with residual connections, and results show notable standard deviation in RMSE (13.896 ± 4.245).
- Why unresolved: Deep learning models typically require larger datasets to ensure stable convergence and robust weight initialization.
- Evidence needed: Retraining and validating the model on a significantly expanded dataset (e.g., N > 200) to observe if cross-validation variance decreases.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (N=60) may limit model generalization and increase overfitting risk
- Exact ensemble configuration and architectural hyperparameters remain unspecified
- Limited to water contact angle predictions without validation for other liquids
- Dataset composition and exact feature selection process not fully documented

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The overall methodological approach combining surface chemistry and topography features with ensemble neural networks is sound and appropriate for this task.

**Medium confidence**: The reported performance metrics (R² = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896°) are achievable given the methodology, but exact reproducibility requires the missing architectural details.

**Low confidence**: The specific feature selection process beyond Random Forest importance is not fully documented, potentially affecting reproducibility.

## Next Checks

1. Verify feature preprocessing by applying Yeo-Johnson transformation to the same input data and confirming feature distributions
2. Test different ensemble sizes (5, 10, 15 models) to determine impact on performance and stability
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of chemical versus topographical features to model performance
