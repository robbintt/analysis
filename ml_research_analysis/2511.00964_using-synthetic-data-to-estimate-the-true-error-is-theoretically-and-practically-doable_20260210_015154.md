# Using Synthetic Data to estimate the True Error is theoretically and practically doable

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.00964
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00964
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** OSYN achieves more accurate and reliable error estimates than existing baselines using synthetic data and theoretical generalization bounds

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the problem of evaluating model performance under limited labeled data conditions, where traditional methods requiring large test sets are impractical. The authors propose OSYN, a method that leverages synthetic data generated by generative models to accurately estimate the true error of a trained model. The core method idea involves developing novel generalization bounds that incorporate both synthetic and real data distributions. These bounds guide the optimization of synthetic samples for evaluation, revealing the significant role of generator quality. OSYN iteratively generates and selects synthetic points that maximize the lower bound on the true error.

## Method Summary
OSYN estimates the true error of a trained model using synthetic data when only a small labeled test set is available. The method develops novel generalization bounds that combine synthetic and real data distributions, then optimizes synthetic sample selection to maximize a theoretical lower bound on true error. The approach involves partitioning the feature space into Voronoi cells centered at test points, generating synthetic samples within each region, and selecting samples that maximize a target function based on the difference between synthetic and real sample losses. The method shows that generator quality significantly impacts estimate accuracy, with tighter bounds achieved when synthetic data distribution closely matches the true data distribution.

## Key Results
- OSYN consistently produces lower bounds closest to the true loss across classification and regression tasks, outperforming baselines like Bootstrap Loss and Syn-wo-Opt Loss
- The method demonstrates strong correlation between generator quality (measured by KL divergence) and estimate accuracy
- OSYN is particularly effective with small, biased, or imbalanced test sets, providing confidence-based guarantees on performance
- Results show robustness across different generative models and partition sizes, with optimal performance typically achieved with K≥400 partitions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OSYN works by leveraging theoretical generalization bounds that connect the true error to losses computed on both real and synthetic data. The method optimizes synthetic sample selection by maximizing a lower bound derived from these theoretical guarantees. By carefully partitioning the feature space and selecting synthetic samples that maximize the difference between synthetic and real sample losses within each region, OSYN creates a tighter estimate of the true error. The key insight is that high-quality generators produce synthetic samples that, when properly selected, provide reliable information about model performance on unseen data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Voronoi partitioning:** Why needed - divides feature space into regions centered at test points for localized sample selection; Quick check - verify partitions cover the space without gaps or excessive overlap
- **Generalization bounds with synthetic data:** Why needed - provides theoretical foundation for using synthetic samples to estimate true error; Quick check - confirm bound is valid (Gap > 0) across multiple runs
- **Loss difference maximization:** Why needed - guides selection of synthetic samples most informative for error estimation; Quick check - track distribution of selected samples across regions
- **Generator quality metrics:** Why needed - quantifies how well synthetic distribution matches true distribution; Quick check - compute KL divergence or MMD between synthetic and real samples
- **Confidence-based guarantees:** Why needed - provides statistical validity for error estimates; Quick check - verify that estimated bounds contain true error at specified confidence level
- **Multi-iteration sample generation:** Why needed - allows refinement of synthetic sample selection over time; Quick check - monitor convergence of lower bound estimates across iterations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** CTGAN Generator -> Synthetic Sample Pool -> FAISS Partitioner -> Region Selection -> Loss Computation -> Bound Optimization -> Error Estimate

**Critical Path:** Generator produces synthetic samples → Samples partitioned into Voronoi regions → Per-region selection maximizes target function → Selected samples compute losses → Theoretical bound combines losses → Final error estimate produced

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- Larger K (partitions) provides finer-grained control but increases computational cost and may require more synthetic samples
- Higher b values expand the adjustment range for sample counts but may reduce theoretical guarantees
- More iterations T allow better sample selection but increase runtime
- Better generators improve estimate accuracy but require more training data and computational resources

**Failure Signatures:**
- Invalid lower bound (Gap < 0): Generator distribution severely mismatched or (b, δ₂) poorly tuned
- Loose bounds (Gap ≫ 0): Poor generator quality or insufficient synthetic samples per region
- High variance across runs: Partition size K too small or unbalanced partitions
- Slow convergence: Insufficient iterations T or poor initial sample selection

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify partition generation by visualizing Voronoi cells on 2D projection of data
2. Test generator quality by computing KL divergence between synthetic and real data distributions
3. Validate bound validity by checking Gap > 0 across multiple random seeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. **Deriving a tight but computable upper bound:** The current theoretical analysis only supports a lower bound on the true error, and the authors suggest deriving a tight upper bound would be an interesting direction to provide two-sided confidence intervals.
2. **Application to high-dimensional or structured data:** The method has only been evaluated on tabular datasets, and the authors acknowledge that extending to text or image data remains an open question due to the curse of dimensionality.
3. **Automatic hyperparameter selection:** The method currently requires careful manual tuning of parameters like partition size and adjustment factors, and the authors suggest developing adaptive mechanisms or theoretical analysis for safe default values.

## Limitations
- Method performance critically depends on generator quality, with tight bounds only achievable when synthetic distribution closely matches true data distribution
- Theoretical guarantees assume access to an approximate true data distribution P₀, which is rarely available in practice
- Current implementation lacks an upper bound, providing only one-sided confidence intervals for error estimates
- Method has not been validated on high-dimensional or highly structured data like text or images

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** OSYN consistently produces tighter lower bounds than baseline methods across multiple datasets and partition sizes
- **Medium confidence:** The method's robustness to imperfect generators holds when KL divergence remains moderate, but performance degrades with severe distribution mismatch
- **Low confidence:** The theoretical assumptions about accessing P₀ and the exact behavior of the optimization procedure in high-dimensional spaces

## Next Checks
1. Test OSYN's performance when generator quality degrades systematically by measuring error estimates across varying levels of synthetic-real distribution divergence
2. Evaluate the method's sensitivity to partition size K by varying it across orders of magnitude to identify optimal scaling behavior
3. Implement the unknown multinomial adjustment algorithm and verify whether different implementation choices significantly affect bound tightness
