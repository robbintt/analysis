# Bi-Encoder Contrastive Learning for Fingerprint and Iris Biometrics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.22937
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22937
- **Reference count**: 5
- **Primary result**: 91% ROC AUC for iris-to-iris matching reveals statistical dependence between biometric traits

## Executive Summary
This paper tests the statistical independence assumption of biometric traits by training Bi-Encoder contrastive learning networks on fingerprint, iris, and cross-modal matching tasks. Using a dataset of 274 subjects with ~100k fingerprints and ~7k iris images, the authors trained ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones. Key results include 91% ROC AUC for iris-to-iris matching (challenging independence assumptions), reproduction of fingerprint intra-subject signals (though with lower performance than prior work due to smaller dataset), and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching only slightly above chance. DeepDream visualizations revealed the networks learned hierarchical features from coarse structures to complex patterns. The findings suggest biometric traits are not statistically independent and motivate reconsidering multi-trait fusion methods. Code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

## Method Summary
The authors employ Bi-Encoder (Siamese) networks with contrastive learning to verify biometric traits. They use ResNet-50 and ViT backbones with ImageNet-1K initialization, replacing classification layers with projection heads (fully connected + batch normalization) to produce embeddings. The contrastive loss with margin parameter optimizes L2 distance between embeddings for same/different subject pairs. Data undergoes subject-level 80/10/10 splits with balanced positive/negative pairs, light augmentations, and resampling to prevent underrepresented subjects from being dominated. Models are trained with Adam optimizer (LR 3e-4 for most, 5e-5 for pretrained cross-modal), step decay scheduler, and early stopping on validation ROC AUC.

## Key Results
- 91% ROC AUC for iris-to-iris matching provides clear evidence of statistical dependence between left and right irises
- Fingerprint models reproduce positive intra-subject signals suggested by prior work, though with lower performance due to smaller dataset
- Cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching achieves only slightly above-chance performance, suggesting more data and sophisticated pipelines are needed
- DeepDream visualizations show networks learned hierarchical features from coarse structures to complex patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contralateral iris pairs exhibit learnable statistical dependencies.
- Mechanism: A Bi-Encoder with contrastive loss learns to map left-right iris pairs from the same individual to nearby embeddings while pushing different-subject pairs apart; the trained ResNet-50 achieves strong separability, indicating cross-iris correlation within subjects.
- Core assumption: Embedding proximity under contrastive training reflects intrinsic trait similarity tied to identity rather than dataset artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: ResNet-50 reaches 91 ROC AUC for iris-to-iris, "providing clear evidence that the left and right irises of an individual are correlated."
  - [section 4.2]: ResNet-50 attains ROC AUC 0.91; Vision Transformers exceed chance but plateau in the mid-to-high 0.80s; many false negatives stem from occlusion/image quality.
  - [corpus]: Corpus neighbors do not directly validate left-right iris correlations; related works focus on other biometric tasks.
- Break condition: If image quality bias or dataset-specific artifacts inflate same-subject similarity, generalization to other datasets may degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Intra-subject fingerprint similarity is reproducible under tighter data constraints.
- Mechanism: Bi-Encoder contrastive learning captures subject-level fingerprint patterns (e.g., ridge flows, minutiae distributions) across different fingers, yielding above-chance verification despite smaller cohorts and fewer pretraining resources.
- Core assumption: Fingerprint variation across fingers retains shared subject-specific structure that contrastive objectives can exploit.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: Fingerprint models "reproduce the positive intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space."
  - [section 4.3]: Results qualitatively replicate Guo et al.; ROC AUC is lower than prior work; ViT-B/16 outperforms ResNet-50 in the authors' setting.
  - [corpus]: Neighbors include Ridgeformer for cross-domain fingerprint recognition; no direct validation of intra-subject fingerprint correlation.
- Break condition: If reduced subject count, pretraining gaps, or domain shift are critical, performance may not scale or generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-modal fingerprint–iris correlation is weak under current data and pipeline constraints.
- Mechanism: A two-tower Bi-Encoder jointly learns modality-specific embeddings with a contrastive objective; minimal above-chance performance suggests limited discoverable signal without larger datasets or stronger alignment methods.
- Core assumption: Any latent cross-trait associations manifest in a shared embedding space via standard contrastive training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: Cross-modal matching rises "only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more sophisticated pipeline is needed."
  - [section 4.4]: Even the strongest two-tower configurations yield only slight gains over chance.
  - [corpus]: Corpus neighbors do not address fingerprint–iris correlation; no direct support or refutation.
- Break condition: If meaningful correlations exist but require domain-specific pretraining, cross-modal losses, or much larger cohorts, the current setup will underfit the signal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive loss in Bi-Encoder/Siamese networks.
  - Why needed here: Directly shapes the embedding space so same-subject pairs are closer and different-subject pairs farther apart, enabling verification without explicit class labels.
  - Quick check question: For a margin m=1.0, compute the loss for a matching pair with distance 0.3 and a non-matching pair with distance 0.8.

- Concept: Subject-level splits and balanced pair construction.
  - Why needed here: Prevents identity leakage across train/val/test and normalizes subject contribution to avoid dominance by high-volume identities.
  - Quick check question: Why is splitting at the subject level (rather than image level) essential for unbiased evaluation?

- Concept: CNN vs. Transformer inductive biases under data scarcity.
  - Why needed here: Explains why ResNet-50 can outperform ViTs for iris matching with limited training data.
  - Quick check question: Which backbone would you try first for a new iris dataset with only 4k images, and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw images -> Backbone (ResNet-50 or ViT) -> Projection head (FC + BatchNorm) -> Embeddings -> Contrastive loss
- **Critical path**: 1. Verify subject-level split integrity and pair construction. 2. Train Bi-Encoder with chosen backbone; monitor validation ROC AUC. 3. Select decision threshold on validation; report test ROC AUC, accuracy, precision, recall.
- **Design tradeoffs**: ResNet-50 vs. ViT: CNN inductive biases help under limited data; ViTs competitive for fingerprint but not iris in this regime. Single-tower vs. two-tower cross-modal: Two-tower allows modality-specific representations but requires stronger alignment strategies. Pretraining: ImageNet-1K used; domain-specific pretraining may improve cross-modal performance.
- **Failure signatures**: AUC near 0.5: Check pair labeling correctness, split leakage, and augmentation severity. High false negatives on iris: Inspect occlusion (eyelids/eyelashes) and specular reflections. ViT plateau: Consider reducing model capacity, adding regularization, or increasing effective data.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Baseline iris-to-iris: Train ResNet-50 Bi-Encoder with current splits and confirm ROC AUC near 0.91. 2. Backbone ablation on fingerprints: Swap ResNet-50 for ViT-B/16 on fingerprint-to-fingerprint; compare AUC and training stability. 3. Cross-modal probe: Initialize two-tower with pretrained i1/f1 weights, train on iris–fingerprint, and quantify above-chance lift vs. random pairing baselines.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can larger datasets and specialized pretraining uncover robust cross-modal correlations between fingerprints and irises? Basis: Authors state in Future Work that "larger datasets, cross-modal pretraining, or stronger alignment objectives may be required" because current results are only slightly above chance. Unresolved: Current cross-modal pipeline failed to find a strong signal, leaving the existence of practical cross-modal correlation undetermined.

- **Open Question 2**: Do intra-subject statistical dependencies exist in other biometric modalities? Basis: Authors plan to "extend this work to other biometrics in the future," specifically listing "voice, vein patterns, and hand geometry." Unresolved: This study was restricted to fingerprints and irises; the generalizability of the "independence assumption" failure to other traits remains unknown.

- **Open Question 3**: Can Vision Transformers (ViTs) outperform ResNets for iris matching given sufficient data volume? Basis: Authors note that ViTs "lag on irises in this data regime," implying their superior scaling properties were hindered by the limited dataset size (7k images). Unresolved: Paper could not determine if lower ViT performance was due to architectural unsuitability or simply insufficient training data.

- **Open Question 4**: How should multi-biometric fusion algorithms be reformulated to account for intra-subject correlations? Basis: Conclusion states findings "motivate re-examining multi-trait fusion methods that assume independence." Unresolved: While paper establishes traits are correlated, it does not derive mathematical corrections needed for existing fusion score equations.

## Limitations

- Dataset access and scale limitations - the WVU/Clarkson dataset containing 274 subjects with ~100k fingerprints and ~7k iris images is not publicly available, making independent validation difficult.
- Cross-modal fingerprint-iris matching shows only marginal above-chance performance, suggesting either genuine statistical independence or insufficient data/sophistication in the current approach.
- Smaller dataset size compared to prior work likely explains why fingerprint intra-subject signal reproduction achieves lower ROC AUC than Guo et al.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The iris-to-iris correlation finding (91% ROC AUC) is well-supported by strong performance metrics and clear visualizations showing learned hierarchical features from coarse to fine structures.
- **Medium Confidence**: The fingerprint intra-subject signal reproduction is plausible but limited by the smaller dataset size compared to prior work.
- **Low Confidence**: The cross-modal fingerprint-iris independence conclusion is tentative given only slight above-chance performance, which could reflect dataset limitations rather than true biological independence.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Access Validation**: Obtain the WVU/Clarkson multi-biometric dataset through institutional channels and verify subject-level splits prevent identity leakage across train/test boundaries.
2. **Backbone Ablation Study**: Systematically compare ResNet-50 versus ViT performance on the iris-to-iris task using identical data splits and hyperparameters to confirm the 91% ROC AUC baseline.
3. **Cross-Modal Capacity Test**: Train the two-tower Bi-Encoder with increased dataset size (synthetic augmentation or additional subjects) and evaluate whether ROC AUC improves beyond the current slight-above-chance performance.
