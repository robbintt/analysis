# PMG: Progressive Motion Generation via Sparse Anchor Postures Curriculum Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.16722
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16722
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** State-of-the-art FID of 0.279 and MPJPE of 3.257 on HumanML3D dataset

## Executive Summary
PMG introduces a novel framework for synthesizing human motion that combines global trajectory guidance with sparse anchor postures. The key innovation is decoupling trajectory control from fine-grained pose control, allowing for more controllable, high-fidelity motion synthesis. To address the challenge of learning from sparse motion data, the authors propose SAP-CL (Sparse Anchor Posture Curriculum Learning), a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases task difficulty by reducing anchor pose density during training. The framework uses a diffusion-based approach with specialized encoders for trajectories and anchor poses, along with an initial motion generator and refinement module.

## Method Summary
The ProMoGen framework synthesizes human motion conditioned on global trajectories and sparse anchor postures. It employs a diffusion transformer architecture with Trajectory Feature Encoder (TFE) and Anchor Motion Encoder (AME) to process inputs separately. The Initial Motion Generator (IMG) and Refinement Module produce the final motion sequence. The SAP-CL curriculum strategy trains the model over 100 epochs in four stages, gradually reducing the minimum number of anchor postures from 20 to 1. This progressive approach allows the model to first learn from dense anchor data before tackling sparse inputs. The total loss combines reconstruction, anchor alignment, joint position, GAN, and physics constraints.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art FID of 0.279 and MPJPE of 3.257 on HumanML3D dataset
- SAP-CL curriculum strategy yields significant improvements in convergence and generation quality
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and metrics
- Demonstrates better generalization to sparse anchor conditions compared to baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The decoupling of trajectory and pose control addresses the challenge of generating coherent long-range motion while maintaining precise local control through sparse anchors. The SAP-CL curriculum strategy enables the model to gradually adapt to increasingly sparse supervision, preventing early-stage collapse that would occur if trained directly on sparse data. By separating trajectory and pose encoding, the model can focus on temporal coherence for global movement while preserving fine-grained pose details through anchor guidance. The progressive reduction in anchor density allows the model to first establish motion patterns with dense guidance before learning to interpolate and extrapolate from sparse signals.

## Foundational Learning

**Diffusion Models:** Why needed - Generate high-quality samples through iterative denoising; Quick check - Verify training loss decreases over time steps and samples show progressive refinement

**Curriculum Learning:** Why needed - Enable learning complex tasks by gradually increasing difficulty; Quick check - Monitor performance metrics across curriculum stages to confirm improvement trend

**Trajectory-Pose Decoupling:** Why needed - Separate global motion planning from local pose control for better controllability; Quick check - Validate that trajectory and pose can be independently modified without affecting each other's quality

**Sparse Anchor Sampling:** Why needed - Provide sparse supervision for generating detailed poses at specific time points; Quick check - Ensure anchors are correctly distributed and the filtering module produces expected density variations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Trajectory → TFE → Trajectory Features → IMG; Input Anchors → AME → Anchor Features → IMG → Refinement Module → Output Motion

**Critical Path:** Trajectory and anchor encoders → Initial Motion Generator → Refinement Module → Final output motion sequence

**Design Tradeoffs:** The decoupling strategy trades some computational overhead for better control separation and generalization. The curriculum approach increases training time but enables learning from sparse data. The diffusion framework provides high quality at the cost of slower inference compared to autoregressive models.

**Failure Signatures:** Model fails to generalize to sparse anchors (high MPJPE with few anchors), foot sliding or physical implausibility, loss of temporal coherence in long sequences, or inability to follow trajectory constraints. These typically indicate issues with curriculum progression, physics loss implementation, or trajectory-pose decoupling effectiveness.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test Filtering Module with different elasticity parameters to confirm anchor distribution; 2) Validate curriculum progression by monitoring anchor density across training stages; 3) Check physical plausibility by measuring foot slide distance on validation set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Model complexity and inference time due to diffusion architecture and multiple specialized modules
- Requirement for specific dataset formatting and preprocessing (22 joints, 20 fps retargeting)
- Dependence on carefully designed curriculum progression for optimal performance
- Potential sensitivity to hyperparameters in the filtering module and curriculum scheduling

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in overall training framework and core innovations (SAP-CL curriculum, decoupling strategy)
- **Medium confidence** regarding exact architectural details for DiT components and specific implementations of $L_{GAN}$ and $L_{Phys}$
- **High confidence** in specified metrics (FID 0.279, MPJPE 3.257) as clear targets
- **Medium confidence** in achieving state-of-the-art performance without exact architectural specifications

## Next Checks
1. Verify curriculum learning implementation by monitoring anchor density progression across the 100 training epochs - ensure $K_{min}$ decreases from 20 to 1 in four stages and observe corresponding training loss curves
2. Validate the Filtering Module (Algorithm 1) by testing with different elasticity parameters to confirm it produces the intended probabilistic anchor distribution
3. Check physical plausibility post-training by measuring foot slide distance and comparing against baseline methods to ensure $L_{Phys}$ is effectively reducing unrealistic motion artifacts
