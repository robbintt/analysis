# Bayesian Parametric Matrix Models: Principled Uncertainty Quantification for Spectral Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.12406
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12406
- Authors: Mohammad Nooraiepour
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces Bayesian parametric matrix models (B-PMMs) for uncertainty quantification in spectral learning

## Executive Summary
This work presents Bayesian parametric matrix models (B-PMMs), a novel framework for quantifying uncertainty in spectral learning methods used in scientific computing. The approach addresses the fundamental challenge of providing reliable uncertainty estimates for matrix eigenvalue problems, where traditional Bayesian methods fail due to geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. B-PMMs preserve the computational efficiency and spectral structure of parametric matrix models while adding principled uncertainty quantification through manifold-aware variational inference and adaptive spectral decomposition.

The framework achieves exceptional uncertainty calibration (expected calibration error < 0.05) across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 while maintaining favorable computational scaling. By incorporating regularized matrix perturbation bounds and structured variational inference with manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors, B-PMMs provide reliable uncertainty estimates even in near-degenerate regimes where traditional approaches fail. The method demonstrates near-optimal uncertainty quantification rates for spectral learning problems.

## Method Summary
B-PMMs extend parametric matrix models by introducing a Bayesian framework that accounts for the geometric constraints inherent in spectral decomposition. The method employs adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized matrix perturbation bounds to ensure stability, while using structured variational inference with manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors to capture the constrained nature of eigenvalue problems. The framework includes finite-sample calibration guarantees and demonstrates exceptional performance across various matrix dimensions, achieving both computational efficiency and reliable uncertainty quantification.

## Key Results
- Achieves expected calibration error (ECE) < 0.05 across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500
- Maintains favorable computational scaling while providing uncertainty quantification
- Demonstrates reliable uncertainty estimates in near-degenerate regimes where traditional methods fail
- Claims near-optimal uncertainty quantification rates for spectral learning problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on combining adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized matrix perturbation bounds to maintain stability during uncertainty quantification. The structured variational inference employs manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition, addressing the fundamental challenge that standard Bayesian methods fail on eigenvalue problems. The finite-sample calibration guarantees ensure reliable uncertainty estimates across different sample sizes.

## Foundational Learning

Matrix perturbation theory
- Why needed: Provides theoretical foundation for understanding how small changes in matrix entries affect eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Quick check: Verify bounds on eigenvalue sensitivity to matrix perturbations

Spectral decomposition geometry
- Why needed: Eigenvalue problems have inherent geometric constraints that standard Bayesian methods cannot handle
- Quick check: Confirm that posterior distributions respect eigenvalue ordering constraints

Manifold-aware variational inference
- Why needed: Standard variational inference fails on constrained spaces like the space of valid spectral decompositions
- Quick check: Validate that variational approximations remain on the correct manifold

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data -> Matrix representation -> Adaptive spectral decomposition -> Regularized perturbation bounds -> Manifold-aware variational inference -> Uncertainty quantification

Critical path: The core computational path involves adaptive spectral decomposition with perturbation bounds feeding into the manifold-aware variational inference, which produces the final uncertainty estimates. This path must maintain numerical stability while preserving the spectral structure.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades some computational overhead for principled uncertainty quantification. The manifold-aware posterior construction adds complexity but is necessary for valid uncertainty estimates in constrained spectral spaces. The adaptive decomposition balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

Failure signatures: Poor calibration may indicate breakdown of perturbation bounds in near-degenerate regimes. Computational instability could signal issues with the adaptive decomposition step. Failure to respect manifold constraints suggests problems with the variational inference implementation.

First experiments: 1) Test calibration on 5x5 identity matrix with added noise 2) Evaluate performance on diagonally dominant matrices 3) Verify uncertainty estimates on matrices with known spectral gaps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations

Scalability concerns exist for very large matrix dimensions beyond 500x500, where manifold-aware variational inference may become computationally prohibitive. The near-degenerate regime performance claims require verification across a broader range of spectral gap sizes. The assertion of "near-optimal uncertainty quantification rates" lacks specific comparison to established theoretical lower bounds in spectral perturbation theory.

## Confidence

High: The adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized perturbation bounds appears sound based on established matrix analysis principles. The experimental results showing ECE < 0.05 are verifiable through the described methodology.

Medium: The computational scaling claims require validation on larger-scale problems. The finite-sample calibration guarantees depend on specific distributional assumptions that may not hold in all scientific computing applications.

Low: The assertion of "perfect convergence rates" is unusually strong and requires rigorous proof. The manifold-aware posterior construction may face practical implementation challenges not evident in the tested problem range.

## Next Checks

1. Test B-PMMs on matrices exceeding 1000x1000 dimensions to verify computational scaling claims
2. Systematically evaluate performance across varying spectral gaps (10^-1 to 10^-10) to characterize near-degenerate regime behavior
3. Compare uncertainty quantification performance against established matrix perturbation theory bounds to verify "near-optimal" claims
