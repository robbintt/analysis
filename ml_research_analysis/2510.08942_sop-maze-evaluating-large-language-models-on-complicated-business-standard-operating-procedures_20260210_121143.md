# SOP-Maze: Evaluating Large Language Models on Complicated Business Standard Operating Procedures

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.08942
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08942
- **Reference count:** 24
- **Primary result:** Introduces the first benchmark to evaluate LLM performance on complex business SOPs, revealing significant gaps in procedural compliance, conversational handling, and arithmetic reasoning.

## Executive Summary
SOP-Maze introduces the first benchmark to evaluate LLM performance on complex business Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Derived from real-world business workflows, it includes 397 instances and 3,422 subtasks across 23 scenarios, categorized into two types: LRS (wide-option, shallow branching) and HRS (deep logical reasoning, complex branches). The benchmark tests procedural compliance, multi-turn conversation handling, and arithmetic reasoning under realistic, noisy conditions. Evaluations of 18 leading LLMs show significant performance gaps, with most models failing due to route blindness (inability to follow SOPs), conversational fragility (struggles with nuanced dialogue), and calculation errors (arithmetic/time reasoning issues). The systematic study highlights limitations in current LLM capabilities for real-world business SOP execution and provides insights for future model improvements.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates 18 LLMs on following complex business SOPs using 397 instances (3,422 subtasks) across 23 scenarios. Each task requires models to output a JSON object following a specific schema, with three-tier scoring: 1.0 for valid format with correct content, 0.2 for valid format with incorrect content, and 0.0 for invalid format. The dataset was constructed from 300k API logs, clustered and refined via human annotation. Models are evaluated on both LRS (wide options, shallow branching) and HRS (deep logic, complex branching) scenarios, testing procedural compliance, multi-turn conversation handling, and arithmetic reasoning under realistic, noisy conditions.

## Key Results
- Most LLMs struggle with route blindness, failing to follow prerequisite steps in SOPs
- Conversational fragility emerges as a major failure mode, with models misinterpreting nuanced user intent in multi-turn dialogues
- Arithmetic reasoning errors significantly impact performance, particularly in time calculations and percentage computations
- GPT-4 shows superior performance but still fails on 10% of tasks due to route blindness and conversational fragility
- Open-source models lag substantially behind API-based models across all evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by testing LLMs on realistic business scenarios that require complex reasoning, state tracking, and context-aware decision making. The three-tier scoring system effectively captures both format compliance and content accuracy, while the distinction between LRS and HRS scenarios allows for nuanced evaluation of different reasoning capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Procedural state tracking:** Needed to maintain context across multiple steps in SOPs. Quick check: Can the model remember completed steps and pending prerequisites?
- **Multi-turn dialogue interpretation:** Required for handling user inputs that may contain sarcasm, intent reversal, or implicit requirements. Quick check: Does the model correctly interpret "I'll let it slide" as acceptance rather than rejection?
- **Arithmetic reasoning in context:** Essential for calculating time intervals, percentages, and resource allocations within business workflows. Quick check: Can the model correctly compute service rates from timestamp data?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Dataset (397 instances) -> Prompt Construction (4-component template) -> Model Inference (18 LLMs) -> JSON Parsing -> Scoring (3-tier)

**Critical path:** Prompt construction and JSON output validation are the most critical components, as they directly determine whether responses can be evaluated.

**Design tradeoffs:** The benchmark prioritizes format compliance over content accuracy (0.2 points for correct format, 0s for incorrect format), which may over-penalize models with good reasoning but poor output formatting.

**Failure signatures:** Route blindness (skipping prerequisites), conversational fragility (misinterpreting user intent), and calculation errors (arithmetic/time reasoning failures) are the three dominant failure modes.

**First experiments:**
1. Test model performance on LRS scenarios only to isolate reasoning vs. state-tracking challenges
2. Evaluate arithmetic-only subtasks to measure pure calculation capabilities
3. Compare performance on scripted vs. noisy dialogue inputs to quantify conversational fragility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper explicitly identifies three major limitations requiring future work: the need to broaden data sources beyond a single organizational context, the importance of exploring metric sensitivity by varying reward allocation between format compliance and procedural correctness, and the potential for architectural interventions like explicit state tracking to mitigate route blindness errors.

## Limitations
- Derived from a specific organizational setting, limiting generalizability to other industries
- The three-tier scoring system may over-penalize format issues while under-rewarding partial understanding
- Does not explore architectural solutions for the identified failure modes like route blindness

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Benchmark construction methodology is reproducible | High |
| Evaluation results showing performance gaps are credible | Medium |
| Generalizability to other business domains | Low |

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Re-run the benchmark with systematically varied temperature and top_p settings to determine if performance gaps are primarily due to stochastic outputs versus fundamental model limitations.
2. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Apply the benchmark to SOPs from different business domains (manufacturing, healthcare, software deployment) to assess whether observed failure modes are universal or domain-specific.
3. **Error Type Classification:** Conduct detailed error analysis on a subset of failed cases to distinguish between model reasoning failures, prompt engineering issues, and dataset-specific challenges.
