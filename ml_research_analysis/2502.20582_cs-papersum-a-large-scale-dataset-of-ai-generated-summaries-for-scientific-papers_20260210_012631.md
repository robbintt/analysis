# CS-PaperSum: A Large-Scale Dataset of AI-Generated Summaries for Scientific Papers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.20582
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20582
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Large-scale dataset of 91,919 computer science papers with AI-generated structured summaries covering 31 top-tier conferences from 2017-2024

## Executive Summary
CS-PaperSum introduces a comprehensive dataset of 91,919 computer science papers enriched with AI-generated structured summaries. The dataset spans 31 top-tier conferences from 2017-2024 and provides structured summaries capturing key contributions, methodologies, and future research directions. Quality assessment using embedding alignment analysis and keyword overlap analysis demonstrates strong semantic preservation, particularly in AI and NLP conferences. This resource enables automated literature analysis, research trend forecasting, and AI-driven scientific discovery, offering significant value for researchers and policymakers.

## Method Summary
The dataset was constructed by collecting full-text papers from 31 top-tier computer science conferences between 2017 and 2024. Each paper was processed through ChatGPT to generate structured summaries containing five key components: main contributions, methodology, background, future research directions, and abstracts. Quality assessment was performed using embedding alignment analysis to measure semantic preservation and keyword overlap analysis to evaluate the summaries' fidelity to original content. The dataset is available in both JSON and CSV formats, with each entry containing comprehensive metadata including paper title, authors, publication venue, year, abstract, full text, and the AI-generated summary.

## Key Results
- Dataset contains 91,919 computer science papers with AI-generated structured summaries
- High semantic preservation demonstrated through embedding alignment and keyword overlap analyses
- Strong coverage of 31 top-tier conferences across 7 years (2017-2024)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset leverages large language models to systematically process and summarize scientific literature at scale. By using ChatGPT's ability to understand and restructure complex scientific content, the approach creates structured summaries that capture essential information while maintaining semantic coherence. The quality assessment methodology using embedding alignment ensures that the AI-generated summaries preserve the original semantic content, while keyword overlap analysis validates the comprehensiveness of the extracted information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic embedding alignment**: Essential for measuring semantic similarity between original papers and summaries; quick check: compute cosine similarity between paper and summary embeddings
- **Keyword extraction algorithms**: Needed for identifying important concepts and terms; quick check: verify keyword coverage across different conference domains
- **Structured text generation**: Required for creating organized summaries with distinct sections; quick check: validate section completeness and logical flow
- **Conference-specific terminology**: Important for understanding domain-specific language patterns; quick check: analyze keyword distribution across different conferences
- **Large language model summarization capabilities**: Fundamental to the generation process; quick check: compare ChatGPT summaries with human-written abstracts
- **Metadata standardization**: Critical for dataset organization and accessibility; quick check: verify consistency of metadata fields across all entries

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Paper corpus -> ChatGPT processing -> Structured summary generation -> Quality assessment -> Dataset compilation
**Critical path:** Raw paper text → ChatGPT summarization → JSON/CSV conversion → Quality validation → Final dataset
**Design tradeoffs:** Scale vs. accuracy (automated vs. human evaluation), domain specificity vs. generalizability, structured vs. unstructured summaries
**Failure signatures:** Incomplete summaries, loss of technical specificity, generation errors, metadata inconsistencies, quality assessment limitations
**First experiments:** 1) Test embedding alignment on sample papers from different conferences, 2) Validate keyword overlap across multiple domains, 3) Assess summary completeness by comparing with human-written abstracts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Quality assessment relies solely on automated methods without human validation
- Focus limited to computer science conferences, limiting generalizability
- Potential biases and limitations inherent to ChatGPT not fully characterized

## Confidence
- Dataset scale and coverage: High
- Quality assessment methodology: Medium
- Utility for downstream applications: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess the accuracy, coherence, and utility of the AI-generated summaries
2. Validate the dataset's performance in downstream tasks through empirical experiments in automated literature analysis and research trend forecasting
3. Extend the dataset to include papers from other scientific domains and assess its generalizability beyond computer science
