core_contribution: The paper introduces a two-stage framework for predicting deep
  learning model performance before training begins. The first stage estimates a baseline
  accuracy using data complexity measures (DCMs) extracted from the dataset, while
  the second stage adjusts this baseline based on the model's architecture and hyperparameters
  using XGBoost.

# Data Complexity-aware Deep Model Performance Forecasting
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01383
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01383
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Two-stage framework predicts DL model performance with R² = 0.82 before training begins

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel two-stage framework for forecasting deep learning model performance before training starts. The approach leverages data complexity measures (DCMs) to establish a baseline accuracy, then refines predictions using model architecture and hyperparameters via XGBoost. Validated across multiple image datasets and model types, the framework demonstrates strong generalization capabilities with MAE below 1.3 percentage points in in-distribution settings and under 0.06 in cross-dataset validation. The method requires only 16% of the dataset for DCM computation, making it computationally efficient for practical MLOps applications.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in two stages: first, it estimates baseline accuracy using data complexity measures extracted from the dataset; second, it adjusts this baseline based on model architecture and hyperparameters using XGBoost. DCMs are computed from a sampled subset (approximately 16%) of the training data, capturing intrinsic dataset properties. The XGBoost model learns the relationship between these DCMs, model characteristics, and final performance metrics. The approach is validated through both in-distribution and cross-dataset (Leave-One-Dataset-Out) experiments, demonstrating robust performance forecasting capabilities across diverse image classification tasks.

## Key Results
- In-distribution predictions achieve R² = 0.82 with MAE below 1.3 percentage points
- Cross-dataset LODO validation maintains MAE below 0.06 across 10 datasets
- Dataset variance correlates with optimal model depth, providing architecture selection heuristics
- Prediction errors correlate with dataset quality issues, enabling early diagnostics
- Framework requires only ~16% of dataset for DCM computation, ensuring computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing the complex relationship between data, model, and performance into manageable components. Data complexity measures capture intrinsic dataset properties that fundamentally constrain achievable performance, while the XGBoost model learns how architectural choices and hyperparameters can bridge the gap between baseline performance and actual results. This two-stage approach isolates data-driven constraints from model-driven optimizations, allowing for more accurate and interpretable predictions.

## Foundational Learning
- Data Complexity Measures (DCMs): Quantifiable properties of datasets that indicate learning difficulty; needed to establish baseline performance constraints; quick check: compute basic DCMs (e.g., feature overlap, class imbalance) on sample datasets
- XGBoost regression: Gradient boosting framework for learning non-linear relationships; needed to model complex interactions between model characteristics and performance; quick check: train simple XGBoost model on synthetic data
- Leave-One-Dataset-Out (LODO) validation: Cross-validation method where one dataset is held out for testing; needed to assess generalization across different data distributions; quick check: implement LODO on small set of related datasets
- Performance forecasting: Predicting model accuracy before training; needed to optimize resource allocation and architecture selection; quick check: compare baseline accuracy estimates with actual performance

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data -> DCM Extraction -> Baseline Accuracy -> Model Characteristics -> XGBoost -> Final Prediction

Critical path: DCM computation → XGBoost training → Performance prediction
Design tradeoffs: DCM sampling rate vs. accuracy vs. computational cost; model complexity vs. prediction reliability
Failure signatures: High prediction errors indicate either unrepresentative DCM sampling or model architecture-dataset mismatch
First experiments:
1. Compute DCMs on CIFAR-10 subset and compare with full-dataset values
2. Train XGBoost model on synthetic architecture-performance pairs
3. Validate framework on held-out dataset from same distribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions: How to extend the framework to non-image data modalities? What is the optimal sampling strategy for DCM computation across different dataset characteristics? Can the framework be adapted for regression tasks beyond classification? How to handle streaming data where dataset properties may change over time? What are the theoretical bounds on prediction accuracy given dataset complexity measures?

## Limitations
- Cross-dataset validation shows performance degradation compared to in-distribution settings
- Framework validated only on image datasets, limiting generalizability claims
- 16% sampling for DCM computation may introduce bias if subset is unrepresentative
- Limited coverage of only 10 datasets in LODO validation raises robustness questions

## Confidence
- In-distribution performance claims (R² = 0.82, MAE < 1.3): High confidence
- Cross-dataset generalization (LODO results): Medium confidence
- Architecture depth heuristics (dataset variance correlation): Medium confidence
- Early diagnostic utility (prediction errors indicating data quality): Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate framework across diverse data modalities (text, tabular, audio) to assess cross-domain generalization
2. Conduct systematic sensitivity analysis on 16% sampling rate for DCM computation
3. Perform ablation studies removing individual DCM features to quantify relative contributions
