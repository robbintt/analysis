core_contribution: This paper provides the first systematic review of medical reasoning
  in large language models (LLMs), addressing the gap between general LLM capabilities
  and the structured, transparent reasoning required for clinical practice. It proposes
  a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies
  (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms
  (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems).

# Medical Reasoning in the Era of LLMs: A Systematic Review of Enhancement Techniques and Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00669
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00669
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: First systematic review of medical reasoning in LLMs, proposing taxonomy of enhancement techniques and analyzing applications across text, image, and code modalities

## Executive Summary
This systematic review addresses the critical gap between general LLM capabilities and the structured, transparent reasoning required for clinical practice. The authors present a comprehensive taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, distinguishing between training-time strategies (supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). Through analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, the review maps how these techniques are applied across different data modalities and clinical applications, while identifying key challenges including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning.

## Method Summary
The review synthesizes findings from 60 seminal studies published between 2022 and 2025, focusing on English-language publications in the field of medical reasoning with large language models. While the systematic review methodology is not explicitly detailed in terms of search strings, databases used, or inclusion/exclusion criteria, the authors provide comprehensive coverage of the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. The review categorizes techniques and applications to provide a structured overview of current capabilities and limitations in medical AI reasoning systems.

## Key Results
- Proposed taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques categorized into training-time and test-time mechanisms
- Analysis of applications across text, image, and code modalities in clinical settings including diagnosis, education, and treatment planning
- Identification of critical challenges including faithfulness-plausibility gap and evaluation crisis in medical AI benchmarks
- Framework for understanding evolution from general LLM capabilities to specialized medical reasoning systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The review demonstrates that medical reasoning enhancement works through a dual approach: training-time mechanisms that build foundational reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, combined with test-time strategies that optimize reasoning performance through prompt engineering and multi-agent collaboration. This layered approach allows models to develop both the knowledge base and the reasoning frameworks necessary for clinical applications, while evaluation benchmarks have evolved to assess not just accuracy but the quality and interpretability of reasoning processes.

## Foundational Learning
- Reasoning enhancement taxonomy: Why needed - Provides structured framework for understanding diverse techniques; Quick check - Can categorize any new technique into training-time or test-time mechanisms
- Multimodal reasoning challenges: Why needed - Current VLMs lack dynamic cross-modal attention; Quick check - Can identify limitations in visual-textual integration for clinical reasoning
- Benchmark evolution: Why needed - Moving beyond accuracy to assess reasoning quality; Quick check - Can evaluate whether new benchmarks assess intermediate reasoning steps
- Faithfulness-plausibility gap: Why needed - Models generate plausible but potentially fabricated clinical narratives; Quick check - Can distinguish between evidence-backed claims and speculative inference

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data input (text/image/code) -> Enhancement technique (training/test-time) -> Reasoning framework -> Clinical application output

Critical path: Data ingestion → Enhancement technique application → Reasoning process → Evaluation against benchmarks

Design tradeoffs: Training-time approaches offer deeper integration but require more resources, while test-time strategies provide flexibility but may not address fundamental reasoning limitations

Failure signatures: Hallucinations in reasoning chains, inability to verify specific clinical claims, static multimodal fusion without dynamic cross-attention

First experiments:
1. Apply taxonomy to categorize 10 recent medical LLM papers
2. Test enhancement technique effectiveness on a simple clinical reasoning benchmark
3. Compare faithfulness metrics between different reasoning enhancement approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can medical reasoning models be architected to intrinsically distinguish between evidence-backed claims and speculative inference to close the "faithfulness-plausibility gap"?
- Basis in paper: The authors identify the "faithfulness-plausibility gap" as a critical challenge, noting the danger of "plausible hallucinations" where models generate clinically sound narratives supported by fabricated data
- Why unresolved: Current models lack "intrinsic epistemic humility" and often fail to verify specific claims (e.g., invented lab values) within their reasoning chains
- Evidence to resolve: Demonstration of models that can successfully self-calibrate uncertainty and strictly ground reasoning steps in verified external evidence without sacrificing coherence

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we move from loosely coupled multimodal models to architectures that interleave visual and textual tokens for dynamic clinical reasoning?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.2 states that current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail to capture the dynamic nature of clinical reasoning because they fuse static representations late in the process
- Why unresolved: Existing models cannot "re-interrogate" visual data in light of textual findings (e.g., linking a visual shadow to a textual symptom causally) during the reasoning process
- Evidence to resolve: Development of "native multimodal" systems capable of iterative cross-modal attention and image-grounded counterfactual analysis

### Open Question 3
- Question: What evaluation frameworks are required to assess reasoning quality in the face of static benchmark saturation?
- Basis in paper: The paper highlights an "evaluation crisis" (Section 7.4), noting that top-tier LLMs achieve near-expert scores on tests like MedQA, masking real-world reasoning deficits
- Why unresolved: Current benchmarks rely on final-answer accuracy rather than assessing the factual correctness and logical coherence of the intermediate reasoning process
- Evidence to resolve: Validation against dynamic, longitudinal benchmarks that simulate full patient journeys and incorporate qualitative review by clinical experts

## Limitations
- Focus on English-language publications from 2022-2025 may miss important non-English work or earlier foundational studies
- Systematic review methodology not explicitly detailed in terms of search strings, databases, or inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Synthesis across diverse study designs without formal quality assessment of included studies

## Confidence
- Taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques (High): Classification into training-time and test-time mechanisms appears logically structured and comprehensive
- Analysis of modality-specific applications (Medium): Depth of analysis varies across text, image, and code modalities with text-based applications receiving more detailed treatment
- Identified challenges and future directions (Medium): Conclusions based on authors' interpretation of literature rather than empirical validation across all identified studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic search with pre-registered protocol to identify potentially missed studies, particularly non-English publications and work predating 2022
2. Perform quality assessment of included studies using standardized critical appraisal tools to evaluate reliability of reported enhancement technique effectiveness
3. Test proposed taxonomy empirically by applying it to a random sample of recent LLM medical reasoning papers to verify coverage and utility
