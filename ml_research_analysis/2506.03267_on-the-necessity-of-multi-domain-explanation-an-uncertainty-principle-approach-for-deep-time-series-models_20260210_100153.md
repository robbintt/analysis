# On the Necessity of Multi-Domain Explanation: An Uncertainty Principle Approach for Deep Time Series Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03267
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03267
- Authors: Shahbaz Rezaei; Avishai Halev; Xin Liu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Uncertainty principle violations show time-only explanations miss important features

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an uncertainty principle-based framework to determine when multi-domain explanations are necessary for deep time series models. The core insight is that if attributions in time and frequency domains are simultaneously localized, they likely represent distinct features rather than being direct counterparts. Using a variant of the uncertainty principle from signal processing, the authors develop an algorithm to detect violations, indicating when multi-domain explanations are necessary. Experiments across diverse deep learning models, XAI methods, and datasets show frequent uncertainty principle violations (ranging from 0-100%), demonstrating that time-only explanations often miss important features present in other domains.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a mathematical framework based on the uncertainty principle to determine when time and frequency domain attributions capture different features. The key insight is that if both domain attributions are simultaneously localized, they likely explain distinct aspects of the model's decision-making. The framework quantifies this through a variant of the uncertainty principle from signal processing, creating an algorithm that detects violations indicating when multi-domain explanations are necessary. The method is tested across various deep learning architectures (ResNet, InceptionTime, TCN, TST), explanation techniques (DeepLIFT, GradientSHAP, LIME), and diverse datasets including MIMIC, US climate data, and synthetic examples.

## Key Results
- Uncertainty principle violations range from 0-100% across different XAI methods and datasets
- Saliency method never violates UP due to lack of baseline, highlighting methodological limitations
- LIME's sparsity regularization consistently causes uncertainty principle violations
- Multi-domain explanations are essential for comprehensive time series model interpretation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on the mathematical property that simultaneous localization in time and frequency domains indicates distinct feature representations. When attributions in both domains are concentrated, it suggests the explanation methods are capturing different aspects of the model's decision process rather than redundant information. This follows from the uncertainty principle's fundamental constraint that perfect localization in both domains is impossible for true representations, so simultaneous localization must indicate separate features being explained.

## Foundational Learning
- Uncertainty Principle: Mathematical constraint on simultaneous localization in conjugate domains; needed to quantify when explanations capture different features; quick check: test if method respects the bound
- Attribution Localization: Concentration of explanation importance scores; needed to detect simultaneous localization across domains; quick check: measure entropy of attribution distributions
- Multi-Domain Explanations: Using both time and frequency representations; needed to capture complete feature space; quick check: compare explanation consistency across domains

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data -> Model (ResNet/InceptionTime/TCN/TST) -> Attribution Method (DeepLIFT/GradientSHAP/LIME/Saliency) -> Time/Frequency Domain Analysis -> Uncertainty Principle Violation Detection

**Critical Path:**
Input time series → Model prediction → Attribution computation → Domain transformation → Localization quantification → Violation detection

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Time-only vs multi-domain explanations: completeness vs complexity
- Attribution method choice: baseline dependence vs stability
- Domain transformation: resolution vs computational cost

**Failure Signatures:**
- Zero violations across all methods may indicate insufficient diversity in datasets
- Inconsistent violation patterns across similar models suggests methodological issues
- High violation rates in simple datasets may indicate over-sensitivity

**First Experiments:**
1. Run single attribution method on synthetic signal with known frequency components
2. Compare Saliency vs baseline-dependent methods on same input
3. Test violation detection on clean vs noisy versions of identical time series

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Wide variation in violation rates (0-100%) suggests context-dependent applicability
- Absence of violations for Saliency method raises questions about evaluation completeness
- Mathematical formulation may not capture all aspects of feature localization

## Confidence
- High confidence in mathematical foundation of uncertainty principle variant
- Medium confidence in generalizability across diverse datasets and models
- Low confidence in interpretation of zero-violation cases as evidence of limitations

## Next Checks
1. Test uncertainty principle formulation on additional time series domains beyond healthcare, climate, and synthetic data
2. Conduct ablation studies varying baseline selection criteria to understand impact on violation detection
3. Compare results with alternative multi-domain explanation approaches to validate necessity claims empirically
