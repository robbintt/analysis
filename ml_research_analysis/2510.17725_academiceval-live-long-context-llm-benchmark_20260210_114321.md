# AcademicEval: Live Long-Context LLM Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.17725
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17725
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** Live benchmark for long-context LLM evaluation using academic writing tasks with no manual labeling required

## Executive Summary
AcademicEval introduces a live benchmark for evaluating large language models on long-context generation tasks using academic writing as a testbed. The benchmark leverages arXiv papers to create tasks like Title, Abstract, Introduction, and Related Work writing, covering hierarchical abstraction levels without requiring manual labeling. It integrates a co-author graph to provide high-quality few-shot demonstrations and enable flexible context lengths. AcademicEval features efficient live updates via the arXiv API, ensuring no label leakage by using the latest papers for testing.

The benchmark addresses critical gaps in long-context evaluation by providing task-specific assessments beyond standard metrics. Evaluation across standard, long-context, and retrieval-augmented LLMs reveals that retrieval often excels under automatic metrics, but LLM-as-a-Judge assessments show task-specific qualities like novelty, feasibility, and academic style are not uniformly improved by retrieval. Performance generally degrades with longer inputs, and few-shot demonstrations from co-author papers offer modest gains.

## Method Summary
AcademicEval constructs a benchmark using arXiv papers to generate academic writing tasks without manual labeling. The method creates tasks at different hierarchical abstraction levels (Title, Abstract, Introduction, Related Work) and uses a co-author graph to provide relevant few-shot demonstrations. The benchmark employs live updates through the arXiv API, ensuring fresh test data and preventing label leakage. Evaluation includes standard metrics plus LLM-as-a-Judge assessments for task-specific qualities. The framework supports flexible context lengths and tests various LLM configurations including standard, long-context, and retrieval-augmented models.

## Key Results
- Retrieval-augmented LLMs excel under automatic metrics but don't uniformly improve task-specific qualities when assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge
- Model performance degrades with longer input contexts across all task types
- Few-shot demonstrations from co-author papers provide modest performance gains
- LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations reveal that automatic metrics may not capture important aspects like novelty and academic style

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by leveraging the natural structure of academic papers to create hierarchical tasks that test different abstraction levels. The co-author graph provides contextually relevant demonstrations, while live arXiv updates ensure fresh, unseen test data. The LLM-as-a-Judge component addresses limitations of automatic metrics by evaluating task-specific qualities. The combination of hierarchical tasks, relevant few-shot examples, and task-specific evaluation creates a comprehensive assessment framework for long-context generation.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Long-context evaluation challenges** - why needed: Traditional benchmarks fail to capture task-specific quality in long-context generation; quick check: Compare automatic metrics vs. LLM-as-a-Judge scores
2. **Academic writing as evaluation testbed** - why needed: Provides structured, hierarchical tasks with clear quality criteria; quick check: Validate task difficulty across abstraction levels
3. **Co-author graph utilization** - why needed: Ensures relevant few-shot demonstrations for task-specific context; quick check: Measure performance impact of co-author vs. random demonstrations
4. **Live benchmark updates** - why needed: Prevents label leakage while maintaining fresh evaluation data; quick check: Monitor performance consistency across update cycles
5. **Retrieval-augmented evaluation** - why needed: Tests how retrieval affects task-specific quality beyond raw metrics; quick check: Compare retrieval vs. non-retrieval performance on LLM-as-a-Judge scores
6. **Hierarchical task design** - why needed: Assesses model ability across different abstraction levels; quick check: Analyze performance degradation across task types

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** arXiv API -> Paper processing -> Task generation -> Co-author graph -> Few-shot retrieval -> Model evaluation -> LLM-as-a-Judge assessment

**Critical path:** The pipeline flows from arXiv data ingestion through task creation to model evaluation, with the LLM-as-a-Judge assessment serving as the final quality check for task-specific metrics.

**Design tradeoffs:** Live updates prevent label leakage but introduce distribution shifts; automatic metrics provide scalability but miss task-specific nuances; co-author demonstrations ensure relevance but may limit diversity.

**Failure signatures:** Performance degradation with longer contexts indicates long-context modeling limitations; discrepancies between automatic and LLM-as-a-Judge scores suggest metric inadequacy; poor few-shot gains indicate demonstration irrelevance.

**First experiments:**
1. Test baseline model performance across all four task types with varying context lengths
2. Evaluate retrieval-augmented models versus standard models on both automatic and LLM-as-a-Judge metrics
3. Compare performance using co-author demonstrations versus randomly selected demonstrations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations may not accurately reflect human assessment of academic writing quality
- Few-shot learning setup assumes co-author work provides relevant demonstrations, which may not always hold true
- Live update mechanism may introduce distribution shifts affecting benchmark stability over time
- Focus on specific academic writing tasks may limit generalizability to other long-context generation domains

## Confidence
- Retrieval consistently outperforms non-retrieval under automatic metrics: Medium confidence
- LLM-as-a-Judge reveals retrieval doesn't uniformly improve task-specific qualities: Medium confidence
- Few-shot demonstrations from co-author papers provide modest gains: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate the simulated LLM-as-a-Judge assessments, particularly for task-specific qualities like novelty and feasibility
2. Test the benchmark with additional academic writing tasks beyond the four currently covered to assess generalizability
3. Perform longitudinal analysis of model performance across multiple arXiv update cycles to quantify distribution shift effects on benchmark validity
