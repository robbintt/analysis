# StablePCA: Learning Shared Representations across Multiple Sources via Minimax Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.00940
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00940
- **Reference count:** 32
- **Primary result:** StablePCA uses distributionally robust optimization with Fantope relaxation to extract shared low-dimensional representations from multi-source data while mitigating source-specific biases.

## Executive Summary
StablePCA addresses the challenge of extracting shared low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional multi-source data while mitigating source-specific biases. The method employs a distributionally robust optimization framework to maximize the worst-case explained variance across potential mixture distributions of the source populations. A key innovation is the use of Fantope relaxation to transform the nonconvex rank-constrained problem into a convex minimax optimization, enabling global convergence. The authors develop an efficient Mirror Prox algorithm with closed-form updates, achieving an O(1/T) convergence rate. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate StablePCA's superior worst-case performance compared to baseline methods, both in-distribution and under distributional shifts, while maintaining computational efficiency across varying dimensions.

## Method Summary
StablePCA tackles the problem of learning shared representations from multi-source data by formulating it as a distributionally robust optimization problem. The method maximizes the worst-case explained variance across all possible mixture distributions of source populations. To make this tractable, the authors introduce a Fantope relaxation that replaces the non-convex rank constraint with a convex spectral constraint. This enables the use of efficient convex optimization techniques, specifically a Mirror Prox algorithm with closed-form updates. The algorithm adversarially reweights sources to find a robust projection matrix that explains variance even for the most challenging mixture of sources. The method provides practical criteria for assessing solution quality and can be extended to related problems like stable Canonical Correlation Analysis.

## Key Results
- StablePCA achieves O(1/T) convergence rate with duality gap guarantees for the minimax optimization problem
- The Fantope relaxation closely approximates the original nonconvex problem with negligible optimality gaps in practice
- Extensive experiments show StablePCA outperforms baseline methods in worst-case explained variance both in-distribution and under distributional shifts
- The method maintains computational efficiency across varying dimensions while providing robust shared representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adversarial Reweighting for Shared Structure
The method models the target distribution as an unknown mixture of source populations. By solving a minimax problem (minimize loss over projection matrix M, maximize over distributions ω), the optimizer effectively adversarially reweights sources. This forces the projection matrix M to explain variance even for the "hardest" mixture weighting, preventing dominant groups from dictating the principal directions.

### Mechanism 2: Fantope Relaxation for Convexity
Standard PCA requires M to be a rank-k projection matrix, which is non-convex. StablePCA relaxes this to M ∈ F^k (where 0 ⪯ M ⪯ I_d and Tr(M)=k). This convex hull relaxation transforms the problem into a convex-concave saddle point, guaranteeing global convergence.

### Mechanism 3: Non-Euclidean Geometry via Mirror Descent
The constraints (M in Fantope, ω in Simplex) have non-Euclidean geometries. The Mirror Prox algorithm uses a mirror map (specifically von Neumann entropy for M and Shannon entropy for ω), allowing updates to be computed analytically via eigendecomposition and soft-maxing, avoiding iterative sub-projections.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO)**
  - Why needed: StablePCA is fundamentally an application of Group DRO to unsupervised learning
  - Quick check: How does maximizing the loss over mixture weights ω prevent a single large batch from dominating the PCA result?

- **Concept: Fantope (F^k)**
  - Why needed: This is the core relaxation technique that bypasses NP-hard rank constraints
  - Quick check: Why is enforcing Tr(M)=k and 0 ⪯ M ⪯ I a "relaxation" of the rank-k constraint?

- **Concept: Mirror Descent / Bregman Divergence**
  - Why needed: This explains how the optimization works efficiently
  - Quick check: Why is Euclidean projection onto the Fantope considered expensive, necessitating the Mirror Prox approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Covariance matrices Σ̂⁽ˡ⁾ → Mirror Prox optimization loop (Dual Update → Primal Update) → M̂ = average of M̄ᵗ → Project to rank-k M̂_Proj

- **Critical path:** The Primal Update (Equations 19-20) is the computational bottleneck, requiring eigendecomposition of weighted covariance sums.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Relaxation gap (Fantope vs rank-k) vs robustness to source-specific biases; worst-case explained variance vs average performance.

- **Failure signatures:** High optimality gap τ indicates poor Fantope-to-rank-k projection; oscillating weights suggest poorly tuned learning rate.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate worst-case explained variance comparison on synthetic data with known shared structure
  2. Plot operator norm error vs sample size and optimality gap to confirm theoretical bounds
  3. Test refined uncertainty set C_H with prior knowledge to measure performance gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the Mirror Prox algorithm be adapted to solve the Stable Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) problem?
- Basis: Section 5 explicitly proposes extending the framework to Stable CCA but notes that implementing this requires substituting the mirror map to handle the new constraint set.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Under what broader theoretical conditions does the Fantope relaxation exactly match the optimal value of the original nonconvex problem?
- Basis: The authors state in Section 2.2 that they believe the relaxed optimization problem may achieve the global minimum in a "much broader regime" than the sufficient conditions provided in Theorem 1.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the computational complexity be reduced for extremely high-dimensional settings where d ≫ n?
- Basis: Algorithm 1 requires full eigen-decomposition of d × d matrices in every iteration, which is computationally prohibitive for modern high-dimensional datasets.

## Limitations

- The method's robustness claims hinge on the assumption that target distributions lie within the convex hull of source mixtures, which may fail for out-of-distribution shifts involving entirely new data modes.
- The Fantope relaxation introduces an optimality gap that could become significant when eigenvalue spectra lack clear separation.
- The Mirror Prox implementation relies on specific hyperparameters (learning rates, convergence thresholds) that require careful tuning.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The convexity of the relaxed problem, convergence guarantees via O(1/T) duality gap, and the effectiveness of Fantope relaxation for rank-constrained problems
- **Medium Confidence:** The empirical performance gains over baselines and the practical utility of the optimality gap metric
- **Low Confidence:** The robustness to arbitrary distributional shifts and the general applicability to real-world scenarios with complex, unknown data distributions

## Next Checks

1. Test StablePCA on real-world multi-source datasets (e.g., medical imaging from different scanners, text corpora from different domains) to assess robustness beyond synthetic data.
2. Evaluate the method's performance when the target distribution contains modes not present in any source distribution, to stress-test the mixture assumption.
3. Conduct an ablation study comparing StablePCA with and without the refined uncertainty set C_H to quantify the benefit of incorporating domain-specific hints.
