# ADSeeker: A Knowledge-Infused Framework for Anomaly Detection and Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03088
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03088
- Reference count: 5
- Introduces ADSeeker framework achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on industrial and medical anomaly detection tasks

## Executive Summary
ADSeeker addresses the challenge of industrial anomaly detection using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that lack domain-specific knowledge and fine-grained reasoning capabilities. The framework integrates a visual document knowledge base (SEEK-M&V) and a Query Image-Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Q2K RAG) system to enhance anomaly detection and reasoning. ADSeeker also introduces a Hierarchical Sparse Prompt (HSP) mechanism to extract type-level features and improve zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) performance. The authors introduce Multi-type Anomaly (MulA), the largest-scale AD dataset to date, containing 72 defect types across 26 categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSeeker achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on several benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods in both industrial and medical anomaly detection tasks.

## Method Summary
ADSeeker is a knowledge-infused framework that combines visual document knowledge with multimodal reasoning capabilities. The framework consists of three main components: a visual document knowledge base (SEEK-M&V) containing industrial defect information, a Query Image-Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Q2K RAG) system for context-aware anomaly detection, and a Hierarchical Sparse Prompt (HSP) mechanism for extracting type-level features. The framework processes input images through the Q2K RAG system, which retrieves relevant knowledge from SEEK-M&V and generates context-aware prompts for the MLLM. The HSP mechanism then processes these prompts to identify and classify anomalies across multiple defect types. The approach is evaluated on both industrial and medical anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance compared to existing methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on industrial and medical anomaly detection benchmarks
- Outperforms existing methods in anomaly reasoning accuracy, defect classification, and localization
- Introduces Multi-type Anomaly (MulA), the largest-scale AD dataset with 72 defect types across 26 categories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ADSeeker works by integrating domain-specific visual knowledge with multimodal reasoning capabilities. The framework leverages a comprehensive visual document knowledge base (SEEK-M&V) that contains detailed information about various industrial defects, including their visual characteristics, causes, and classification criteria. This knowledge base enables the Q2K RAG system to retrieve relevant context for each input image, providing the MLLM with domain-specific information that enhances its ability to identify and classify anomalies. The Hierarchical Sparse Prompt (HSP) mechanism further improves performance by extracting type-level features from the retrieved knowledge and generating more precise prompts for the MLLM. This combination of knowledge retrieval and hierarchical prompting allows ADSeeker to achieve superior zero-shot performance on both industrial and medical anomaly detection tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): Models that can process and reason across multiple data modalities (text, images, etc.)
  - Why needed: Industrial anomaly detection requires understanding both visual and contextual information
  - Quick check: Verify MLLM can process image-text pairs and generate coherent responses

- Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD): Detecting anomalies without requiring labeled examples of specific defect types
  - Why needed: Industrial settings often lack comprehensive labeled datasets for all possible defect types
  - Quick check: Test framework on completely unseen defect types to verify zero-shot capabilities

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): System that retrieves relevant information from knowledge bases to augment generation tasks
  - Why needed: Provides domain-specific context to enhance MLLM reasoning capabilities
  - Quick check: Measure retrieval accuracy and relevance of retrieved knowledge to input queries

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Image -> Q2K RAG -> SEEK-M&V Knowledge Retrieval -> Hierarchical Sparse Prompt -> MLLM Output

Critical Path: The critical path involves the Q2K RAG system retrieving relevant knowledge from SEEK-M&V based on the input image, generating context-aware prompts, and passing them through the HSP mechanism to the MLLM for final anomaly detection and classification.

Design Tradeoffs: The framework trades computational complexity for improved accuracy by incorporating extensive knowledge retrieval and hierarchical prompting. This increases inference time but significantly enhances detection performance, particularly for zero-shot scenarios.

Failure Signatures: Potential failures include incorrect knowledge retrieval leading to misclassification, incomplete knowledge base coverage for rare defect types, and HSP mechanism generating suboptimal prompts for complex multi-defect scenarios.

First Experiments:
1. Verify basic functionality by testing on simple, well-defined defect types with clear visual characteristics
2. Evaluate knowledge retrieval accuracy by measuring relevance scores of retrieved information against ground truth defect descriptions
3. Test HSP mechanism's ability to extract meaningful type-level features from retrieved knowledge by comparing performance with and without HSP

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Claims rely on comparisons with relatively few baselines, raising questions about robustness of superiority claims
- Performance depends heavily on quality and completeness of visual document knowledge base, with potential biases or gaps for rare defect types
- Multi-type Anomaly dataset developed by same authors, raising potential confirmation bias risks without independent validation

## Confidence
- Zero-shot performance claims: Medium
- Knowledge base effectiveness: Medium  
- Real-world deployment reliability: Low
- Individual component contributions: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of HSP, Q2K RAG, and SEEK-M&V components
2. Perform independent validation using externally developed datasets and real-world industrial data
3. Implement long-term field testing across diverse industrial environments to assess robustness, scalability, and performance degradation over time
