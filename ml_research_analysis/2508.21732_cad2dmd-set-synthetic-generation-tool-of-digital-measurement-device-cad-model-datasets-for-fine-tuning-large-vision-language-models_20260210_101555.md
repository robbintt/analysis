# CAD2DMD-SET: Synthetic Generation Tool of Digital Measurement Device CAD Model Datasets for fine-tuning Large Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.21732
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21732
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Synthetic data generation tool improves LVLM performance on DMD reading by 200% ANLS score without degrading other tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data generation tool designed to improve Large Vision-Language Models' (LVLMs) ability to read digital measurement devices (DMDs) in challenging real-world conditions. The tool leverages 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and image composition to generate diverse, VQA-labeled synthetic DMD datasets. A real-world validation set (DMDBench) with 1,000 annotated images was also created to benchmark model performance. Fine-tuning experiments showed substantial improvements: InternVL achieved a 200% increase in Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) score without degrading performance on other tasks, demonstrating the tool's effectiveness in enhancing LVLM robustness and performance in complex visual scenarios.

## Method Summary
The CAD2DMD-SET tool operates by utilizing 3D CAD models of digital measurement devices to generate synthetic training data. The process involves advanced rendering techniques to create realistic images of DMDs under various conditions, followed by image composition to add diversity in backgrounds, lighting, and occlusion scenarios. The generated images are annotated with VQA (Visual Question Answering) labels to support fine-tuning of LVLMs. The tool's synthetic data generation pipeline is designed to address the scarcity of diverse real-world DMD images, particularly in challenging conditions where devices may be partially occluded, viewed from extreme angles, or captured under poor lighting.

## Key Results
- InternVL model achieved 200% increase in ANLS score after fine-tuning with CAD2DMD-SET synthetic data
- Performance improvements were specific to DMD reading tasks without degrading performance on other visual tasks
- Real-world validation set (DMDBench) with 1,000 annotated images established benchmark for evaluating LVLM performance on DMD reading

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The tool addresses a critical gap in LVLM training data by generating synthetic DMD images that capture the diversity and complexity of real-world scenarios that are difficult to obtain through traditional data collection methods. By using 3D CAD models, the tool can systematically generate images with controlled variations in viewing angles, lighting conditions, occlusions, and background contexts. This synthetic data augmentation strategy enables LVLMs to learn robust representations for DMD reading tasks that generalize well to real-world deployment scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs):** Neural networks that process both visual and textual information, needed to understand and describe visual content with natural language
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA):** Task requiring models to answer questions about visual content, quick check: models must understand both image and question semantics
- **Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS):** Metric measuring text similarity, needed to evaluate model performance on text generation tasks
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creating artificial training data, quick check: must maintain realistic distributions while increasing diversity
- **3D CAD Models:** Computer-aided design models, needed as source for generating synthetic device images
- **Image Composition:** Combining multiple visual elements, quick check: must maintain photorealistic appearance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** CAD Models -> Renderer -> Image Composer -> VQA Annotator -> Synthetic Dataset

**Critical Path:** The rendering pipeline followed by image composition represents the most critical path, as rendering quality directly impacts the synthetic data's effectiveness for training LVLMs.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The tool prioritizes synthetic data diversity over perfect photorealism, accepting minor visual artifacts to generate a wider range of challenging scenarios that better prepare LVLMs for real-world deployment.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failure modes include over-smooth rendering artifacts, unrealistic lighting transitions during composition, and VQA annotations that don't align with visual content due to generation errors.

**3 First Experiments:** 1) Benchmark LVLM performance on DMDBench without fine-tuning, 2) Fine-tune InternVL with varying proportions of synthetic data, 3) Evaluate synthetic data quality through human visual inspection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic data may not fully capture all real-world device variations and environmental conditions
- Tool requires access to 3D CAD models, which may not exist for legacy or proprietary measurement devices
- Validation dataset of 1,000 images may be insufficient for comprehensive evaluation across all industrial scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation and synthetic data generation capabilities
- Medium confidence in performance improvement magnitude across different LVLM architectures
- Medium confidence in tool applicability to measurement devices beyond tested categories

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate tool performance across broader range of LVLM architectures with different pre-training approaches
2. Test synthetic data generation on measurement devices from multiple industrial sectors for domain transferability
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing fine-tuning with varying ratios of synthetic versus real-world training data
