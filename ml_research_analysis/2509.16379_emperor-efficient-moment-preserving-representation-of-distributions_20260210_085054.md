# EMPEROR: Efficient Moment-Preserving Representation of Distributions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.16379
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16379
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Introduces a framework for representing high-dimensional neural network feature distributions through statistical moments

## Executive Summary
EMPEROR presents a novel approach for encoding feature distributions from neural networks through sliced moments. The method projects features onto multiple directions, fits lightweight univariate Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to each projection, and aggregates the slice parameters. This representation provides determinacy guarantees through Carleman's condition and the Cramér-Wold theorem, ensuring unique identification of distributions from sliced moments. The framework demonstrates strong empirical performance on point cloud classification (PC MNIST 2D: 0.9643 accuracy; ModelNet40: 0.8674) and image classification across ViT layers, capturing richer distributional information than common pooling schemes while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The EMPEROR framework encodes high-dimensional feature distributions through statistical moments using a sliced moment approach. For each projection direction, features are projected and fitted with lightweight univariate GMMs, extracting parameters that capture the distribution's characteristics along that direction. These slice parameters are then aggregated to form a comprehensive representation of the original distribution. The method leverages theoretical guarantees from Carleman's condition and the Cramér-Wold theorem to ensure that distributions can be uniquely identified from their sliced moments, providing a principled foundation for the representation.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.9643 accuracy on PC MNIST 2D point cloud classification
- Achieves 0.8674 accuracy on ModelNet40 point cloud classification
- Demonstrates superior performance on image classification across ViT layers compared to common pooling schemes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EMPEROR works by decomposing high-dimensional distributions into manageable univariate projections, fitting GMMs to each slice, and aggregating the parameters. This approach captures the full distributional structure rather than just summary statistics like mean or variance. The theoretical foundation through Carleman's condition and Cramér-Wold theorem ensures that the representation uniquely identifies the original distribution, making it suitable for downstream tasks requiring distributional information.

## Foundational Learning

**Sliced moments** - projecting high-dimensional data onto multiple directions to capture distributional properties. *Why needed:* High-dimensional distributions are difficult to model directly. *Quick check:* Verify that projection directions cover the feature space adequately.

**Carleman's condition** - a mathematical criterion ensuring unique determination of distributions from moments. *Why needed:* Provides theoretical guarantee that the representation is sufficient to reconstruct the original distribution. *Quick check:* Confirm moment decay rates meet theoretical requirements.

**Cramér-Wold theorem** - states that a distribution is uniquely determined by all its one-dimensional projections. *Why needed:* Validates the approach of using multiple projections for complete representation. *Quick check:* Ensure sufficient number of projection directions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input features -> Projection directions -> Univariate GMM fitting -> Slice parameter extraction -> Aggregation -> Output representation

**Critical path:** Feature extraction → Projection → GMM fitting → Parameter aggregation → Downstream task

**Design tradeoffs:** The number of projection directions trades off between computational cost and representation completeness. More directions capture more distributional information but increase computational overhead.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance may indicate insufficient projection directions, inappropriate GMM configurations, or violations of moment decay assumptions required for determinacy.

**First experiments:**
1. Test with varying numbers of projection directions on a simple dataset to find the sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency
2. Compare different GMM configurations (number of components) on projection slices
3. Validate the theoretical determinacy guarantees on synthetic distributions with known properties

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity grows with both dimensionality and number of projections
- Theoretical determinacy assumptions require all moments to exist and decay appropriately
- Optimal projection selection and aggregation strategy are not systematically explored

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |

| Empirical performance on benchmark tasks | Medium |
| Scalability to high-dimensional settings | Low |
| Optimal configuration guidance | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic scalability experiments varying both input dimensionality and number of projection directions, measuring computational overhead and accuracy trade-offs
2. Perform ablation studies comparing different aggregation strategies for combining slice parameters and their impact on downstream task performance
3. Validate the moment decay assumptions required for Carleman's condition on real neural network feature distributions across multiple architectures and tasks
