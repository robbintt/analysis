# Linear Bandits with Non-i.i.d. Noise

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20017
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20017
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Develops Mixing-LinUCB algorithm with regret bounds that recover standard rates up to mixing-time factors for geometrically and algebraically mixing noise

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the linear stochastic bandit problem under non-i.i.d. observation noise satisfying mixing sub-Gaussianity conditions. The authors develop a novel confidence sequence construction using a delayed feedback online-to-confidence-sets framework to handle dependencies in the noise. They propose the Mixing-LinUCB algorithm that introduces delays to mitigate overfitting to recent correlated observations, providing regret bounds expressed in terms of the decay rate of mixing coefficients.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a confidence sequence construction for linear bandits with mixing noise using delayed feedback from the online-to-confidence-sets framework. The key innovation is introducing algorithmic delays to break the dependence between recent observations and the decision-making process. The Mixing-LinUCB algorithm maintains confidence sets using historical data while delaying the incorporation of recent observations, allowing for valid concentration inequalities under mixing conditions. The method adapts the UCB framework to account for temporal dependencies through careful construction of confidence bounds that remain valid despite non-i.i.d. noise.

## Key Results
- Under geometric mixing with rate $\phi_d = Ce^{-d/\tau}$, regret is $O(\tau p \sqrt{T} (\log T)^{3/2} + \tau \log T \sqrt{pT \log T})$
- For algebraic mixing with rate $\phi_d = Cd^{-r}$ and $r>1$, regret is $O(CBT^{1/(1+r)} + CT^{(3+r)/(2(1+r))})$
- The bounds recover standard regret rates up to factors depending on mixing time $\tau$ or polynomial decay rate $r$
- Theoretical analysis provides explicit dependence on mixing coefficients, with standard rates recovered as mixing becomes faster

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper leverages mixing conditions to construct valid confidence sequences despite non-i.i.d. noise. By introducing delays in the confidence set updates, the algorithm breaks the direct dependence between recent observations and current decisions. The mixing sub-Gaussianity condition ensures that distant observations become approximately independent, allowing concentration inequalities to be applied. The delayed feedback framework ensures that when constructing confidence sets, the observations used are sufficiently decorrelated from the current action, maintaining validity of the confidence bounds.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mixing conditions**: Why needed - to quantify temporal dependence and ensure asymptotic independence of observations; Quick check - verify that $\phi_d$ decays sufficiently fast for the chosen rate (geometric or algebraic)
- **Sub-Gaussian noise**: Why needed - ensures concentration properties necessary for confidence bounds; Quick check - confirm noise tails decay at least as fast as Gaussian
- **Online-to-confidence-sets framework**: Why needed - provides principled way to construct valid confidence sequences from sequential observations; Quick check - ensure delays are properly implemented to maintain validity
- **Confidence sequences**: Why needed - allow valid uncertainty quantification in sequential decision making; Quick check - verify that confidence sets maintain coverage probability under mixing conditions
- **UCB framework**: Why needed - provides optimistic action selection balancing exploration and exploitation; Quick check - ensure optimism is preserved despite delayed information

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Mixing-LinUCB -> Delayed Confidence Sets -> Action Selection -> Reward Observation -> Mixing Condition Check

**Critical Path:**
1. Maintain delayed historical data buffer
2. Construct confidence sets using mixing-aware concentration
3. Select action via UCB rule on current confidence set
4. Observe reward and store with timestamp
5. Update mixing condition verification

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Delay length vs. adaptation speed: Longer delays provide better mixing but slower adaptation
- Confidence width vs. exploration: Wider bounds encourage more exploration but may reduce exploitation
- Memory requirements vs. statistical efficiency: More historical data improves concentration but increases computational cost

**Failure Signatures:**
- Confidence sets that fail to shrink indicate insufficient mixing or incorrect noise assumptions
- Excessive exploration suggests over-conservative confidence bounds
- Poor empirical performance relative to theory may indicate violated mixing conditions

**First Experiments:**
1. Test regret scaling on synthetic data with known mixing parameters against theoretical predictions
2. Evaluate sensitivity to misspecified mixing time τ by varying assumed vs actual decay rates
3. Compare performance on real time series data with evident temporal dependence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Mixing conditions may not hold in all practical scenarios, limiting applicability
- Dependence on mixing time τ could be prohibitive for slowly mixing processes
- Regret bounds may be loose for certain parameter regimes, particularly near critical mixing rates
- Algorithm requires correct specification of mixing structure, which may be difficult without prior knowledge

## Confidence
- Regret bound derivations: High
- Mixing condition assumptions: Medium
- Algorithm practicality: Low

## Next Checks
1. Implement numerical experiments comparing Mixing-LinUCB against standard LinUCB under controlled mixing scenarios to verify theoretical regret scaling
2. Test sensitivity to misspecification of mixing parameters (τ, r, C) by varying assumed versus actual mixing rates
3. Evaluate performance on real-world time series data with evident temporal dependence to assess practical viability beyond synthetic mixing conditions
