- One-line primary result: Introduces BEAT framework achieving 80% attack success on VLM-based embodied agents using object triggers in the environment

## Executive Summary
This paper presents BEAT, the first framework for visual backdoor attacks on vision-language model (VLM) based embodied agents. The attack exploits visual triggers in the environment—specifically objects like knives or vases—that cause the agent to switch from its intended benign policy to a malicious attacker-specified policy. BEAT employs a two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning on mixed benign and backdoor data, followed by Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL) that formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning to sharpen decision boundaries between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs.

The framework demonstrates successful attacks on two benchmarks: VAB-OmniGibson and EB-ALFRED. Experiments show BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80% while maintaining benign task performance. The CTL component significantly improves backdoor activation precision, with F1 scores improving by up to 39% under limited backdoor data. The attack generalizes to out-of-distribution trigger placements and requires only 9 steps on average to complete malicious multi-step plans, revealing a critical security vulnerability in VLM-driven embodied agents.

## Method Summary
BEAT targets VLM-based embodied agents by exploiting visual triggers in the environment. The framework operates in two stages: first applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on mixed benign and backdoor data to establish general task competence, then Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL) that fine-tunes specifically on trigger discrimination. CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs with identical interaction histories, explicitly sharpening decision boundaries. The attack uses object triggers (e.g., knife, vase) that cause the agent to switch from benign to malicious policies. Training employs LoRA adapters on language modules while freezing vision encoders to reduce computational overhead. The framework achieves high attack success rates (up to 80%) while maintaining near-zero false triggering on trigger-free inputs.

## Key Results
- BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80% on VAB-OmniGibson and EB-ALFRED benchmarks
- CTL improves backdoor activation F1 score by up to 39% under limited backdoor data compared to SFT-only approaches
- The attack generalizes to out-of-distribution trigger placements, achieving 92.3% ASR in unconventional settings
- False triggering rates are reduced from 80% (SFT-only) to near-zero through CTL boundary sharpening
- Average of 9 steps required to complete malicious multi-step plans after trigger activation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL) sharpens decision boundaries between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs by formulating trigger discrimination as preference learning problem.
- **Mechanism:** CTL constructs paired training examples where inputs share identical interaction history but differ in visual trigger presence. The model learns to prefer benign actions when triggers are absent and attack actions when present. This explicit contrastive signal creates sharper policy boundaries than implicit SFT alone.
- **Core assumption:** The preference learning objective can generalize from finite contrastive pairs to unseen trigger configurations without overfitting to spurious visual features.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation."
  - [Section 3.4] "CTL leverages paired inputs—identical contexts with visual inputs differing only in the presence of a trigger—and explicitly aligns the model's preferences."
  - [corpus] TabVLA (arXiv:2510.10932) demonstrates related VLA backdoor attacks but uses different trigger injection strategies; no direct comparison to CTL available.
- **Break condition:** CTL effectiveness degrades significantly when trigger objects exhibit extreme occlusion or appear in semantically implausible contexts far outside training distribution.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Two-stage training separates competency acquisition (SFT) from boundary refinement (CTL), preventing the competition between learning benign and malicious policies.
- **Mechanism:** Stage 1 SFT on mixed D_benign ∪ D_attack establishes general task competence and implants backdoor behaviors. Stage 2 CTL then fine-tunes specifically on trigger discrimination without re-learning action execution. This prevents the observation from the paper that naive SFT mixing causes "false backdoor activations reaching up to 80%."
- **Core assumption:** SFT sufficiently establishes both benign and malicious action capabilities; CTL only needs to learn when to switch policies, not how to execute them.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.4] "naive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on mixed datasets, which is commonly used in backdoor learning, leads to unreliable behavior, with false backdoor activations reaching up to 80% on trigger-free inputs."
  - [Table 3] BEAT without SFT achieves F1_BT of 0.993 but ASR of only 58.1%, demonstrating CTL alone insufficient for task completion.
  - [corpus] Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against VLA models (arXiv:2510.09269) uses physical objects as triggers but employs different training methodology.
- **Break condition:** If SFT data quality is poor or backdoor demonstrations lack coherence, CTL cannot recover multi-step execution capability.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Data construction with diverse trigger placements and viewpoints exposes the model to inherent visual variability, enabling generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) trigger configurations.
- **Mechanism:** The training set spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements. Trigger objects appear at semantically plausible locations with varied viewpoints. This variation forces the model to learn trigger identity rather than spurious location/viewpoint correlations.
- **Core assumption:** Visual variability in training captures sufficient diversity to handle OOD placements; trigger identity learning transfers across contexts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.3] "We crafted five out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes—spanning 27 tasks—with knives placed in unlikely settings such as bathrooms, gardens, supermarkets, garages, and hallways. Even under these unconventional placements, BEAT still reliably activates the backdoor policy 92.3% of the time."
  - [Section 3.3] "By encompassing diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements, this dataset exposes the model to the inherent variability of visual triggers."
  - [corpus] No corpus papers report comparable OOD generalization metrics for visual backdoor triggers.
- **Break condition:** OOD generalization may fail when trigger objects have dramatically different appearances (e.g., novel object instances) rather than just novel placements.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
  - **Why needed here:** CTL builds on DPO-style preference learning. Understanding how DPO optimizes policy relative to a reference model without explicit reward modeling is essential for implementing the CTL loss function.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why DPO uses the ratio π_θ(a_w)/π_ref(a_w) rather than just π_θ(a_w)?

- **Concept: Vision-Language Model Fine-tuning**
  - **Why needed here:** BEAT requires LoRA-based fine-tuning of VLMs with both visual and text inputs. Understanding how gradient flows through vision encoders vs. language decoders informs architectural decisions.
  - **Quick check question:** When fine-tuning a VLM with LoRA, which modules typically receive adapters—vision encoder, language decoder, or both?

- **Concept: Embodied Agent Action Spaces**
  - **Why needed here:** The attack targets multi-step decision-making over discrete action vocabularies. Understanding how actions are sampled, executed, and evaluated in simulators is critical for constructing backdoor trajectories.
  - **Quick check question:** In VAB-OmniGibson, what distinguishes high-level from low-level actions, and how does this affect backdoor policy design?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** D_benign (VLM rollouts on trigger-free scenes) → D_attack (post-trigger rule-based trajectories) → D_contrast (paired trigger-present/absent examples with same history) → Stage 1 SFT → π_ref → Stage 2 CTL → Final model

- **Critical path:** D_contrast construction quality → CTL loss tuning (α, β) → FTR minimization while maintaining ASR. The paper's Figure 5 shows FTR can reach 80% without CTL, making this the primary failure mode.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Backdoor data ratio k:** Higher k increases ASR but risks FTR if CTL insufficient. Paper tests k ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0}; optimal varies by dataset.
  - **NLL weight α:** Too low → policy drift from SFT; too high → insufficient boundary sharpening. Paper uses α ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.6}.
  - **Vision module freezing:** Paper freezes vision during LoRA to reduce compute; trade-off is potentially weaker trigger visual encoding.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High FTR with moderate ASR:** CTL insufficiently trained or α too low; model fails to discriminate trigger presence.
  - **Low ASR with high F1_BT:** SFT insufficient; model detects triggers but cannot execute multi-step attack (see Table 3, "BEAT w/o SFT").
  - **GPT-4o zero ASR:** Safety alignment prevents backdoor learning even at k=1; requires additional trigger-step emphasis in continual learning.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Replicate Table 1 baseline:** Train Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct with SFT-only (k=0.5) on VAB-OmniGibson. Measure SR, ASR, FTR, F1_BT. Expect FTR ~7-50% per paper.
  2. **Ablate CTL components:** Remove NLL anchor term (set α=0) and measure FTR increase. This isolates the contribution of capability retention vs. boundary sharpening.
  3. **Test OOD trigger robustness:** Place trigger objects in 5 novel scene types not in training (e.g., outdoor, industrial). Measure ASR degradation. Paper reports 92.3% on crafted OOD; verify generalization bounds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL) generalize to complex trigger forms beyond single object triggers, such as object co-occurrence patterns, spatial relationships between objects, or event-based triggers?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Exploring whether this approach generalizes to more complex trigger forms is an important direction for future work" (Section 5).
- **Why unresolved:** The paper only evaluates single object triggers (knife, vase) as a starting point to ensure reliable activation. Complex triggers introduce additional variability that may affect precision.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments applying BEAT's CTL framework to composite triggers (e.g., "two objects within proximity," "specific spatial configurations") measuring F1_BT and ASR across trigger complexity levels.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can effective post-training defenses against BEAT be developed without requiring users to perform costly continual benign SFT?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Defense discussion (Appendix E) shows prompt-based defenses only reduce ASR from 77.9% to 64.7%, while continual benign SFT degrades ASR to 0% but is "impractical for many end users."
- **Why unresolved:** The threat model assumes attackers control fine-tuning, limiting defenses to deployment-time mechanisms. Tested defenses (activation clustering, prompts, visual noise) showed limited effectiveness.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Novel detection or mitigation methods achieving significant ASR reduction while preserving benign SR and requiring minimal computational overhead.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How well does BEAT perform under fully unconstrained visual conditions without bounding-box annotations?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "in VAB-OmniGibson, we rely on bounding-box annotations to indicate trigger objects... learning robust triggers under more natural, box-agnostic conditions merits further investigation" (Appendix F).
- **Why unresolved:** EB-ALFRED experiments show robustness to partial visibility and multiple instances, but systematic evaluation without any detection aids remains unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments on VAB-OmniGibson with bounding boxes removed, comparing F1_BT and ASR against annotation-free baselines.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does CTL improve backdoor activation precision for proprietary VLMs when image-based preference learning APIs become available?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "the effectiveness of CTL has only been evaluated on open-source VLMs; due to current restrictions in the GPT-4o fine-tuning API, which does not support image-based DPO" (Appendix F).
- **Why unresolved:** GPT-4o results use only SFT without CTL, showing lower ASR and higher FTR compared to open-source models with CTL.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Re-evaluation of GPT-4o and other proprietary VLMs once APIs support image-conditioned preference optimization, comparing against open-source CTL results.

## Limitations

- The attack framework relies on controlled simulation environments and may face significant challenges in real-world scenarios with dynamic lighting, partial occlusions, and moving trigger objects.
- The two-stage training approach assumes the base VLM can already execute both benign and malicious multi-step policies, which may not hold for more complex malicious behaviors requiring advanced reasoning.
- Claims about out-of-distribution generalization are limited to novel trigger placements rather than novel trigger objects or significantly altered visual appearances.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The existence of backdoor vulnerabilities in VLM-based embodied agents, the effectiveness of CTL in reducing false triggering rates from 80% to near-zero, and the basic two-stage training framework
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about OOD generalization to novel trigger placements and the scalability to more complex malicious behaviors
- **Low confidence**: Assumptions about real-world deployment scenarios, effectiveness against safety-aligned models beyond GPT-4o, and performance with significantly more complex malicious policies

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world robustness test**: Deploy BEAT in a physical or photorealistic simulation environment with variable lighting, occlusion, and camera angles. Measure ASR and FTR degradation compared to controlled simulator results.

2. **Novel trigger object test**: Replace knife/vase triggers with semantically similar but visually distinct objects (e.g., scissors instead of knife, cup instead of vase). Evaluate whether CTL can generalize to trigger identity rather than specific visual features.

3. **Complex malicious policy test**: Implement a malicious policy requiring conditional reasoning (e.g., "pick up knife only if robot arm is free, otherwise wait 3 steps") rather than simple rule-based execution. Measure whether BEAT maintains ASR and FTR performance with increased policy complexity.
