# Position on LLM-Assisted Peer Review: Addressing Reviewer Gap through Mentoring and Feedback

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.09182
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09182
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Primary result**: Proposes LLM-assisted mentoring and feedback system to improve peer review quality by training reviewers rather than automating reviews

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the "Reviewer Gap" in AI research by proposing an LLM-assisted mentoring and feedback system that positions large language models as educational assistants for human reviewers. Rather than using LLMs to generate autonomous reviews, the approach focuses on cultivating reviewer competencies through guided training and evidence-based feedback. The system implements five foundational principles of high-quality reviews and provides structured mechanisms for reviewer development, aiming to ensure consistent application of review standards throughout the peer review process.

## Method Summary
The proposed system implements two complementary mechanisms: an LLM-assisted mentoring system with guided recognition, review refinement practice, and full simulation stages for reviewer training, and an LLM-assisted feedback system that detects weaknesses in review drafts and provides evidence-based suggestions for improvement. The framework defines five foundational principles (Fidelity, Clarity, Fairness, Proportionality, Constructiveness) that guide both the mentoring and feedback components. The approach emphasizes educational support over automation, positioning LLMs as tools for developing human reviewer capabilities rather than replacing human judgment in the peer review process.

## Key Results
- Defines five foundational principles (Fidelity, Clarity, Fairness, Proportionality, Constructiveness) for high-quality peer reviews
- Implements dual-system approach with mentoring and feedback components for reviewer development
- Positions LLMs as educational assistants rather than autonomous review generators

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging LLMs' pattern recognition and language processing capabilities to provide structured, consistent guidance for reviewer development. By focusing on mentoring and feedback rather than automation, the system addresses the root cause of the Reviewer Gap: insufficient reviewer training and inconsistent application of review standards. The five foundational principles provide a clear framework that can be systematically applied and reinforced through both guided practice and real-time feedback.

## Foundational Learning
- **Five foundational principles**: Fidelity, Clarity, Fairness, Proportionality, Constructiveness - needed to establish consistent quality standards across reviews; quick check: verify principles align with established peer review guidelines
- **Mentoring vs automation distinction**: Educational support vs autonomous generation - needed to maintain human judgment in peer review; quick check: ensure LLM suggestions require human acceptance/revision
- **Evidence-based feedback**: Data-driven suggestions for improvement - needed for objective quality assessment; quick check: validate feedback accuracy against expert reviewer standards
- **Reviewer competency development**: Systematic skill building through practice - needed to address Reviewer Gap sustainably; quick check: measure competency improvement over time
- **Contextual adaptation**: Principles applied across different AI domains - needed for broad applicability; quick check: test framework across multiple AI subdisciplines

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Reviewer training -> Mentoring system (recognition -> practice -> simulation) -> Feedback system (draft analysis -> improvement suggestions) -> Final review output
- **Critical path**: Reviewer engagement with mentoring system → practice refinement → draft review → feedback analysis → final submission
- **Design tradeoffs**: Educational support vs automation efficiency, standardization vs domain specificity, guidance vs reviewer autonomy
- **Failure signatures**: Over-reliance on LLM suggestions, inconsistent principle application, feedback system generating irrelevant suggestions, mentoring content not aligning with reviewer needs
- **First experiments**: 1) Test mentoring system effectiveness on novice reviewers, 2) Evaluate feedback system accuracy in detecting review weaknesses, 3) Compare review quality outcomes between LLM-assisted and traditional mentoring approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework's five principles may not capture full complexity of peer review across diverse AI subdisciplines
- Mentoring system effectiveness depends on LLM simulation quality matching real-world review complexity
- Feedback system assumes LLM-generated suggestions will consistently align with disciplinary norms

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Conceptual framework of LLMs as educational assistants is well-founded and addresses genuine peer review needs
- **Medium confidence**: Five foundational principles are useful but require empirical validation across different AI domains
- **Medium confidence**: Dual-system approach is promising but effectiveness depends on implementation quality and workflow integration

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies comparing review quality outcomes between reviewers trained with LLM-assisted system versus traditional mentoring approaches
2. Implement controlled experiments testing LLM feedback system's ability to identify genuine review weaknesses versus false positives
3. Perform systematic analysis of reviewer trust and acceptance of LLM-generated suggestions across different seniority levels and cultural backgrounds
