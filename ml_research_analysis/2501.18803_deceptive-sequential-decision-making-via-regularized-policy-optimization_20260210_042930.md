# Deceptive Sequential Decision-Making via Regularized Policy Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.18803
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18803
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Three deception strategies (diversionary, targeted, equivocal) successfully misled adversaries in network defense simulation while maintaining >98% optimal performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of adversaries inferring sensitive information from observing autonomous systems by introducing deceptive sequential decision-making strategies. The authors model autonomous systems as Markov decision processes and adversaries using inverse reinforcement learning to recover reward functions. To counter these efforts, they present three regularization strategies for policy synthesis: diversionary deception (leading adversaries to any false conclusion about the reward function), targeted deception (leading adversaries to a specific false conclusion), and equivocal deception (leading adversaries to believe real and false rewards equally explain the behavior). The paper formulates tractable optimization problems implementing each deception type and analytically bounds the performance loss induced by deception.

## Method Summary
The authors formulate deceptive sequential decision-making as a regularized policy optimization problem where the policy is optimized for both task performance and deception effectiveness. They present three deception strategies: diversionary deception minimizes distance to a false reward function, targeted deception minimizes distance to a specific false reward function, and equivocal deception makes real and false rewards indistinguishable to the adversary's IRL algorithm. The regularization terms are incorporated into the policy optimization objective, creating a trade-off between performance and deception. The authors provide theoretical bounds on the performance loss induced by deception and demonstrate their approach in a network defense simulation where all three strategies successfully misled adversaries while maintaining at least 98% of optimal performance.

## Key Results
- Three deception strategies successfully misled adversaries in network defense simulation
- All strategies maintained at least 98% of optimal performance
- Theoretical bounds established on performance loss from deception regularization
- Diversionary and targeted deception achieved near-perfect deception effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The deception works by introducing regularization terms that shape the agent's behavior to mislead inverse reinforcement learning algorithms. By optimizing for both task performance and deception, the agent's demonstrations become inconsistent with the true reward function while appearing consistent with false reward functions. The three strategies differ in how they select these false reward functions: diversionary allows any false reward, targeted specifies a particular false reward, and equivocal balances between real and false rewards to create ambiguity.

## Foundational Learning

**Markov Decision Processes** - Why needed: MDPs provide the mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision-making problems where states, actions, and rewards evolve over time. Quick check: Verify understanding of state transitions, reward functions, and value functions.

**Inverse Reinforcement Learning** - Why needed: IRL algorithms attempt to recover reward functions from observed behavior, which is the primary attack vector being defended against. Quick check: Understand how IRL algorithms infer reward functions from demonstrations.

**Policy Optimization with Regularization** - Why needed: Regularization allows incorporating deception objectives alongside performance objectives in the policy optimization problem. Quick check: Verify understanding of how regularization terms modify optimization objectives.

**Reward Shaping and Feature Engineering** - Why needed: The effectiveness of deception depends on selecting appropriate feature representations for reward functions. Quick check: Understand how feature representations affect reward learning and deception.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** MDP environment -> Policy optimization with regularization -> Agent demonstrations -> IRL adversary -> Reward inference
**Critical Path:** Regularized policy optimization -> Demonstration generation -> IRL analysis -> Deception evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Performance vs. deception effectiveness (regularization strength), computational complexity vs. deception quality (feature representation)
**Failure Signatures:** Poor deception effectiveness (IRL recovers true reward), excessive performance degradation (over-regularization), computational intractability (complex feature spaces)
**First Experiments:** 1) Verify IRL can recover known rewards from demonstrations, 2) Test deception effectiveness with single regularization strategy, 3) Evaluate performance-deceptoin tradeoff across regularization strengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes perfect observability and accurate IRL performance by adversaries
- Limited evaluation to single network defense domain
- Theoretical bounds rely on exact knowledge of reward functions and transition dynamics
- Doesn't address adversaries using different IRL algorithms or having limited observation capabilities

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The optimization formulations for the three deception strategies are mathematically sound and the performance bounds are valid under the stated assumptions.

**Medium confidence:** The empirical results showing successful deception in the network defense simulation are convincing, but the evaluation is limited to a single domain and specific adversary model.

**Medium confidence:** The claim that all three strategies maintain at least 98% of optimal performance is supported by the experiments, though the general applicability across different MDP structures and reward landscapes needs further validation.

## Next Checks

1. Test the deception strategies against adversaries using different IRL algorithms (not just maximum entropy IRL) to verify robustness of the approach.

2. Evaluate performance degradation under partial observability conditions where the adversary cannot perfectly observe state-action pairs.

3. Assess the deception effectiveness and performance trade-offs across diverse MDP structures beyond the network defense domain, particularly in continuous state spaces.
