# On the Complexity and Properties of Preferential Propositional Dependence Logic

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.08522
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08522
- Reference count: 8
- Preferential entailment for propositional dependence logic is in Θ₂^P and NP-hard

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates KLM-style preferential reasoning in propositional dependence logic with team semantics. The authors analyze when preferential team-based reasoning satisfies System C versus System P, providing intuitive conditions (⋆-property and △-property) for System P satisfaction. They demonstrate that these characterizations do not extend to preferential team-based propositional logic, despite it being a fragment of the former. The paper also presents complexity classifications for preferential entailment across different representations, including novel results for classical preferential reasoning.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a combination of logical analysis and complexity theory to investigate preferential reasoning in propositional dependence logic. They systematically examine the properties of preferential entailment under team semantics, characterize when System P is satisfied using specific properties, and analyze the computational complexity of different preferential reasoning frameworks. The methodology includes constructing counterexamples to demonstrate the failure of certain characterizations in restricted fragments.

## Key Results
- Preferential team-based reasoning satisfies System C but violates System P
- The (⋆)-property and (△)-property characterize when System P is satisfied
- These characterizations do not carry over to preferential team-based propositional logic
- A non-trivial preferential representation of classical entailment and dependence logic entailment is presented
- Entailment for propositional dependence logic has complexity Θ₂^P and is NP-hard
- Entailment for propositional logic with team semantics has complexity in P and is NC¹-hard

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's analysis leverages the relationship between KLM-style preferential reasoning and team semantics in propositional dependence logic. By examining how preferences interact with dependence atoms and team-based interpretations, the authors identify fundamental properties that govern when certain rationality postulates (System C and P) are satisfied. The complexity results follow from careful analysis of the computational resources required to determine preferential entailment in different logical frameworks.

## Foundational Learning

**Team Semantics**: A framework for interpreting logical formulas over sets of assignments rather than single assignments. Why needed: Provides the foundation for propositional dependence logic. Quick check: Verify understanding of how formulas are evaluated over teams.

**Dependence Atoms**: Logical atoms that express functional dependencies between variables. Why needed: Central to propositional dependence logic and distinguish it from classical propositional logic. Quick check: Confirm ability to translate dependence statements into team properties.

**System C and System P**: KLM rationality postulates for preferential reasoning. Why needed: Define the properties that preferential consequence relations should satisfy. Quick check: Verify understanding of which postulates are satisfied in different settings.

**Preferential Reasoning**: Reasoning with ranked models or preferences over possible worlds. Why needed: The core framework being analyzed. Quick check: Confirm understanding of how preferences affect entailment.

**Complexity Classes (Θ₂^P, NP, P, NC¹)**: Categories that classify computational difficulty. Why needed: Essential for understanding the computational resources required. Quick check: Verify understanding of the relationships between these complexity classes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Preferential Reasoning Framework -> Team Semantics -> Propositional Dependence Logic -> Complexity Analysis

**Critical Path**: The analysis proceeds from defining the preferential reasoning framework with team semantics, through examining satisfaction of rationality postulates, to establishing complexity results for different fragments of the logic.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice between expressive power (team-based vs propositional) versus computational complexity (Θ₂^P vs P). The team-based approach enables richer expressiveness but at higher computational cost.

**Failure Signatures**: When the (⋆)-property or (△)-property fails to characterize System P satisfaction in propositional logic with team semantics, or when preferential entailment becomes computationally intractable (Θ₂^P-complete).

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Construct explicit examples demonstrating satisfaction of System C but violation of System P in team-based preferential reasoning
2. Verify the failure of (⋆)-property and (△)-property characterizations in propositional logic with team semantics through counterexample construction
3. Implement complexity analysis to confirm the Θ₂^P and NP-hard classification for propositional dependence logic entailment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The paper does not extensively compare its classical preferential reasoning complexity results with existing literature
- The intuitive nature of the (⋆)-property and (△)-property conditions lacks empirical validation
- The non-trivial preferential representation presented is not extensively analyzed for alternative representations

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Classification of preferential entailment complexity as Θ₂^P and NP-hard for propositional dependence logic
- Claim that preferential propositional logic with team semantics has complexity in P and is NC¹-hard

**Medium Confidence**:
- Complexity claims for classical (non-team-based) preferential reasoning lack extensive literature comparison
- The assertion that characterizations do not carry over to propositional logic with team semantics requires careful verification
- The non-trivial preferential representation is presented but not extensively analyzed

## Next Checks

1. Verify the counterexample demonstrating why the (⋆)-property and (△)-property characterizations do not extend to propositional logic with team semantics, including checking the specific properties of the construction.

2. Conduct empirical tests of the intuitive conditions on additional benchmark examples beyond those presented in the paper.

3. Perform a comprehensive literature review to confirm the novelty of the classical preferential reasoning complexity results and identify any related work that may have been overlooked.
