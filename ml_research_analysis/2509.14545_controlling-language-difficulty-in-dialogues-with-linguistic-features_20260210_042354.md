- LLM-controlled dialogue responses can be modulated for language learner difficulty using explicit linguistic features

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for controlling the difficulty of LLM-generated dialogue responses for second language learners. The authors propose using linguistic features—categorized as readability, syntactic, and lexical metrics—to quantify and regulate text complexity. A composite metric, Dilaprix, integrates these features to assess and control language difficulty. The method involves synthesizing a linguistically annotated dialogue corpus, training LLaMA-based models on this data, and using direct preference optimization to align responses with target difficulty levels. Experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms traditional prompt-based methods, offering broader difficulty control, greater stability, and maintained dialogue quality.

## Method Summary
The authors propose controlling language difficulty in LLM-generated dialogue by leveraging three categories of linguistic features: readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), syntactic (e.g., tree depth, leaf nodes), and lexical (e.g., simple word ratio). These features are used to compute Dilaprix, a composite metric that normalizes feature values by their 5th and 95th percentiles, yielding a score between 0 and 1 for each dialogue response. Training data is synthesized by prompting a strong LLM with CEFR levels, extracting linguistic features, and forming (Context, Features, Response) triplets. LLaMA-based models are then fine-tuned on this data using supervised fine-tuning followed by direct preference optimization, with negatives defined as responses with incorrect linguistic features or task violations. The resulting models achieve superior difficulty control and dialogue quality compared to prompt-based baselines.

## Key Results
- Models trained on linguistically annotated data achieve a broader range of difficulty control (Dilaprix: 0.073 to 0.883) than prompt-based methods.
- The approach demonstrates higher stability, with lower standard deviation in Dilaprix scores (0.084 vs. 0.140).
- Response Success Rate is maintained at a high level, indicating preserved dialogue quality.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by providing explicit, measurable constraints on language complexity through linguistic features. By training models on data annotated with these features, the LLMs learn to generate responses that match specific difficulty targets. The composite Dilaprix metric allows for fine-grained control and evaluation, ensuring that responses are neither too simple nor too complex for the intended learner level.

## Foundational Learning
- **Linguistic Features**: Quantitative measures of text complexity (readability, syntactic, lexical). Needed to objectively assess and control language difficulty.
- **Dilaprix Metric**: Composite score integrating multiple linguistic features, normalized by percentiles. Needed for fine-grained, interpretable difficulty control.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creating training data by prompting LLMs with target difficulty levels. Needed because manually annotating dialogue corpora is impractical.
- **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: Fine-tuning method that ranks response pairs based on linguistic features and task adherence. Needed to align model outputs with difficulty constraints.
- **CEFR Levels**: Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, a standard for describing language proficiency. Used as a target for difficulty control.
- **Quick Check**: Verify that linguistic features are extracted correctly and Dilaprix scores align with intuitive difficulty judgments.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Context -> Feature Extractor -> LLM (with linguistic targets) -> Response -> Dilaprix Calculator
- **Critical Path**: Context + Features -> LLM -> Response (where difficulty control is applied)
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The use of proprietary lexical lists (Simple/Intermediate words) for feature extraction could limit reproducibility; approximating with public resources may reduce accuracy.
- **Failure Signatures**: Dilaprix scores cluster tightly or saturate; Response Success Rate drops at extreme difficulty levels; feature extraction errors lead to miscalibrated difficulty.
- **Exactly 3 First Experiments**:
  1. Implement and validate linguistic feature extraction, especially lexical ratios using approximated word lists.
  2. Synthesize a small training set with LLM rewrites and compute Dilaprix scores to ensure normalization is correct.
  3. Fine-tune a small LLaMA model on the synthetic data and test difficulty control on a held-out set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The proprietary nature of the Simple (2,000 words) and Intermediate (6,000 words) lexical lists limits direct reproducibility.
- The internal "textbook dialogue corpus" requires synthesis of proxy data, introducing variability.
- Dilaprix normalization constants are dataset-specific; using paper values instead of recalculating them would invalidate results.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Methodological framework, Dilaprix metric definition, and linguistic feature categories are clearly specified.
- **Medium confidence**: Performance gains are likely achievable but depend on faithful reproduction of lexical resources and normalization.
- **Low confidence**: Direct numerical replication of Dilaprix scores or absolute difficulty ranges is unlikely without exact training data and lexical lists.

## Next Checks
1. Validate that your linguistic feature extraction produces scores consistent with the paper's reported ranges.
2. Recalculate Dilaprix normalization constants (5th and 95th percentiles) on your synthetic training data.
3. If Response Success Rate drops at extreme difficulty settings, relax the Utterance Length constraint and reassess both difficulty control and dialogue quality.
