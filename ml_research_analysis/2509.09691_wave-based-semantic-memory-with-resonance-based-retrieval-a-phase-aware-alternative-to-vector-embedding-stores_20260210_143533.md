# Wave-Based Semantic Memory with Resonance-Based Retrieval: A Phase-Aware Alternative to Vector Embedding Stores

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.09691
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09691
- Authors: Aleksandr Listopad
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Resonance-based retrieval achieves P@1 improvements from near 0 to 1.0 for semantic operators where cosine similarity fails

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ResonanceDB, a wave-based semantic memory system that models knowledge as complex-valued waveforms ψ(x) = A(x)e^{iφ(x)} and retrieves it through resonance-based interference rather than cosine similarity. By preserving both amplitude and phase information, the resonance similarity function generalizes cosine similarity and enables more expressive semantic representation. The system scales to millions of patterns with millisecond CPU-only latency and demonstrates compatibility with existing embedding pipelines via a sign-phase mapping.

## Method Summary
The core innovation is the resonance score S(ψ₁, ψ₂) = ½ · [Σ|ψ₁(x) + ψ₂(x)|² / Σ(|ψ₁(x)|² + |ψ₂(x)|²)] · R, where R = 2√(E₁E₂)/(E₁+E₂) and E = Σ|ψ(x)|². This score generalizes cosine similarity while preserving phase information critical for semantic operations. Embeddings are mapped to waveforms using sign-phase mapping: A(x) = |v(x)|, φ(x) = 0 if v(x) ≥ 0 else π. The system achieves higher discriminative power than traditional vector-based methods in tasks involving semantic polarity, negation, and contextual shifts, with no training required—the comparison is deterministic.

## Key Results
- Resonance-based retrieval improves P@1 from near 0 to 1.0 for negation and intensity modulation operators where cosine similarity fails
- System scales to millions of patterns with millisecond CPU-only latency using memory-mapped storage
- Resonance similarity generalizes cosine similarity, reducing to (1+cosθ)/2 for equal-norm real vectors
- Phase-aware representation enables better discrimination of semantic operators like NEG, SHIFT+, INT_UP, INT_DOWN

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The resonance mechanism works by treating semantic vectors as complex-valued waveforms where interference patterns encode semantic relationships. The resonance score captures constructive and destructive interference between waveforms, with phase differences determining whether semantic operations like negation or intensity modulation produce distinguishable interference patterns. Unlike cosine similarity which only measures angular alignment, resonance considers both magnitude and phase, enabling discrimination of operators that would produce identical cosine distances but different phase relationships.

## Foundational Learning
- Complex-valued waveforms: Represent semantic information as A(x)e^{iφ(x)} where amplitude and phase carry distinct semantic content; needed because phase encodes directional semantic operations
- Resonance interference: Constructive/destructive interference patterns between waveforms determine similarity; needed because it captures semantic relationships beyond simple angular alignment
- Sign-phase mapping: Maps real embeddings to complex domain using sign for phase, magnitude for amplitude; needed to bridge existing embedding pipelines to wave-based representation
- Operator phase transformations: Semantic operations (NEG, SHIFT+, INT_UP/DOWN) correspond to specific phase/amplitude modifications; needed to test discriminative power of resonance

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Embeddings → Sign-Phase Mapping → Complex Waveforms → Resonance Score → Similarity Ranking
**Critical path**: Query embedding → sign-phase mapping → resonance computation with memory-stored waveforms → sorted results
**Design tradeoffs**: Wave-based representation trades storage overhead (complex vs real) for semantic expressiveness; resonance computation adds complexity but enables phase-sensitive operations
**Failure signatures**: 
- S values outside [0,1] indicates implementation error in R or energy normalization
- Cosine-like collapse suggests phase transformations not properly applied
- Low P@1 improvements despite correct math suggests incorrect operator definitions
**First experiments**:
1. Verify S(ψ,ψ) = 1 and S bounds [0,1] for self-comparison
2. Test reduction property: S should equal (1+cosθ)/2 for equal-norm real vectors
3. Implement and validate phase transformations for NEG operator (π phase shift) and verify P@1 improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Missing quantitative specifications for exact phase/amplitude transformations of semantic operators (NEG, SHIFT+, INT_UP, INT_DOWN)
- No source code or embedding model details provided for replication
- Memory-mapped storage format and indexing details underspecified
- Performance claims depend on precise operator implementations not fully documented

## Confidence
- **High**: Resonance score mathematical properties and theoretical guarantees
- **Medium**: Operator transformation implementations and P@1 improvement claims
- **Medium**: Scalability to millions of patterns with millisecond latency
- **Low**: Exact semantic embedding space characteristics and operator behavior

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the exact phase/amplitude transformation functions for NEG (π phase shift), SHIFT+ (controlled phase offset), INT_UP/INT_DOWN (amplitude scaling) operators to verify the claimed P@1 improvements.

2. Reproduce the reduction property test where equal-norm real vectors yield S = (1+cosθ)/2 to confirm correct implementation of the resonance similarity function.

3. Benchmark latency and distance distribution analysis (comparing resonance vs cosine similarity) on a controlled synthetic dataset to verify the discriminative power claims for semantic operators.
