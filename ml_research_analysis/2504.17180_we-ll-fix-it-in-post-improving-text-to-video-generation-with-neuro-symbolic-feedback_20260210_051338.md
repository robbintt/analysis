# We'll Fix it in Post: Improving Text-to-Video Generation with Neuro-Symbolic Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.17180
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17180
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: NeuS-E increases temporal fidelity scores by almost 40% across diverse themes and complexity levels

## Executive Summary
NeuS-E addresses a critical limitation in text-to-video generation: temporal misalignment where generated videos fail to correctly sequence events described in prompts. The system employs neuro-symbolic feedback to automatically identify weakly satisfied propositions in generated videos and surgically refine only the problematic segments. By leveraging video automata representations and formal verification, NeuS-E pinpoints misaligned events and their corresponding frames, then guides targeted keyframe editing and regeneration. The approach achieves significant improvements when tested on both closed-source (Gen-3, Pika) and open-source (CogVideoX) models, with human evaluations confirming that a majority of reviewers prefer the edited videos for better alignment with original prompts.

## Method Summary
The NeuS-E system operates through a neuro-symbolic pipeline that combines formal verification with targeted video editing. It first converts generated videos into video automata representations, then uses formal verification to identify propositions (temporal relationships between events) that are weakly satisfied. For each misaligned segment detected, the system performs targeted keyframe editing and regeneration specifically addressing the identified temporal inconsistencies. This surgical approach avoids the need for complete video regeneration or endless re-prompting, focusing computational resources only on problematic segments while maintaining the quality of correctly aligned portions.

## Key Results
- Temporal fidelity scores improved by almost 40% across diverse themes and complexity levels
- Effectiveness demonstrated on both closed-source models (Gen-3, Pika) and open-source models (CogVideoX)
- Human evaluations showed majority preference for edited videos over original generations for better prompt alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method succeeds by combining symbolic reasoning about temporal relationships with targeted neural editing. Rather than treating video generation as a black box requiring complete regeneration, NeuS-E uses formal verification to create a precise map of where temporal misalignments occur. This allows the system to apply corrective editing only where needed, preserving correctly generated content while efficiently addressing specific temporal inconsistencies. The neuro-symbolic approach bridges the gap between abstract temporal specifications in prompts and concrete frame-level manipulations.

## Foundational Learning

**Video Automata Representations**: Abstract models that encode temporal sequences of events as state transitions. Why needed: Provides a formal framework for reasoning about event sequences and temporal relationships in videos. Quick check: Can represent both the generated video and the prompt's temporal structure in comparable formalisms.

**Formal Verification**: Mathematical methods for proving whether systems satisfy specified properties. Why needed: Enables automated detection of temporal misalignments by checking whether the generated video satisfies the temporal propositions implied by the prompt. Quick check: Can automatically identify specific propositions that are weakly satisfied in generated content.

**Neuro-Symbolic Integration**: Combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning systems. Why needed: Bridges the gap between the pattern-matching strengths of neural models and the logical reasoning capabilities needed for precise temporal analysis. Quick check: Can translate formal verification results into actionable editing instructions for neural models.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Prompt + Video Generator -> Video Automata Conversion -> Formal Verification -> Weak Proposition Identification -> Targeted Keyframe Editing -> Regenerated Video

**Critical Path**: The core workflow follows the sequence from formal verification identification through targeted editing to final output. Each stage must complete successfully for the next to proceed, making this the critical path for system functionality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational efficiency for precision by performing expensive formal verification but limiting edits to only misaligned segments. This avoids the cost of complete regeneration while ensuring targeted corrections. The system also trades model independence for specialized processing pipelines that work across different base video generators.

**Failure Signatures**: The method may fail when the video generator produces semantically incoherent content that cannot be meaningfully parsed into video automata, or when formal verification cannot adequately represent the temporal complexity of the prompt. Editing quality may degrade if keyframe regeneration introduces visual artifacts or motion inconsistencies.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test formal verification accuracy by comparing identified misalignments against human-annotated ground truth for temporal relationships
2. Evaluate editing quality by measuring visual coherence and artifact introduction rates in edited versus original videos
3. Assess computational overhead by benchmarking the complete neuro-symbolic pipeline against simple re-prompting approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Requires significant computational resources for formal verification and targeted editing pipeline
- Effectiveness depends on initial prompt quality and video generator's ability to produce semantically coherent content
- Does not comprehensively address quality dimensions beyond temporal fidelity, such as visual coherence or motion realism

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core technical contribution of using neuro-symbolic feedback for targeted temporal alignment is well-supported by quantitative results showing 40% improvement in temporal fidelity scores across multiple models.

**Medium Confidence**: Human evaluation results showing majority preference for edited videos are reasonably supported but lack detailed methodological transparency.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that the method improves temporal consistency without requiring additional model training assumes negligible computational overhead and quality degradation from editing.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing neuro-symbolic feedback against simpler temporal refinement methods to establish whether formal verification provides unique value beyond computational cost.

2. Perform comprehensive quality assessment measuring not just temporal fidelity but also visual coherence, motion smoothness, and artifact introduction rates in edited videos versus original generations.

3. Test the method's robustness across a systematically varied prompt space that includes controlled manipulations of temporal complexity, event density, and semantic ambiguity.
