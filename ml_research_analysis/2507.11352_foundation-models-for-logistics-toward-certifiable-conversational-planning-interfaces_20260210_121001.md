## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Vision-Language Logistics (VLL) agent that integrates multimodal perception, foundation models, and formal verification to create a conversational interface for logistics planning. The core innovation is an uncertainty-aware intent-verification loop that quantifies confidence in interpreting user goals from natural language and visual inputs using a learned latent space and calibrated probabilistic guarantees. When confidence falls below a threshold, the system proactively requests clarification before invoking downstream planners, ensuring only certified user intents are acted upon. Experiments demonstrate that a lightweight fine-tuned model on 100 high-confidence samples outperforms 20x larger zero-shot models in goal classification accuracy while halving inference latency.

## Method Summary
The VLL agent processes multimodal inputs (text and images) through a foundation model to generate structured PDDL specifications and goal classifications. An embedding model trained with supervised contrastive loss maps these outputs to a learned latent space where distinct user goals form well-separated clusters. The system constructs a calibration distribution from a small labeled set to convert latent distances into calibrated lower bounds on correct classification probability. This probabilistic guarantee drives an uncertainty-guided refinement loop: high-confidence predictions are used for model improvement via direct preference optimization (DPO) or TextGrad prompt optimization, while low-confidence predictions trigger targeted user clarification requests.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini on 100 high-confidence samples achieves 96% accuracy, outperforming 20x larger GPT-5 in zero-shot mode
- VLL maintains higher accuracy at equal re-query frequencies compared to baseline approaches (Figure 4)
- Inference latency reduced by approximately 50% using smaller backbone model with targeted refinement
- Calibration distribution enables theoretically grounded probabilistic guarantees with formal proof (Theorem 3)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Space Clustering for Uncertainty Quantification
Mapping multimodal inputs to a learned latent space enables calibrated uncertainty estimation for user intent classification. An embedding model P is trained with supervised contrastive loss on 400 labeled examples, creating well-separated clusters for each goal type (Query, Update, Plan). The distance from a new input's latent vector to the nearest cluster centroid inversely correlates with classification confidence—closer samples have higher probability of correct classification.

### Mechanism 2: Calibration Distribution for Probabilistic Guarantee
Latent distances can be converted to calibrated lower bounds on correct classification probability through a held-out calibration set. A calibration distribution F_C is constructed from 200 labeled samples, mapping distances to the probability that a sample from another class lies beyond that distance. For a new input, the probabilistic guarantee is computed as: Pr(y_t = y*_t) ≥ F_C(d_t), providing a theoretical lower bound on correct classification.

### Mechanism 3: Uncertainty-Guided Refinement Loop
High-confidence predictions provide quality training signal that enables smaller models to outperform larger zero-shot models. Samples exceeding the probabilistic guarantee threshold are used for DPO with guarantee ranking and TextGrad prompt optimization. The paper reports that fine-tuning on 100 high-confidence samples yields 96% accuracy with GPT-4o-mini, outperforming 20x larger GPT-5 in zero-shot mode.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning**
  - Why needed here: The core uncertainty estimation depends on learning a latent space where goal types form separable clusters. Contrastive loss explicitly maximizes intra-class similarity and inter-class distance.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why contrastive loss is preferred over cross-entropy for learning the embedding space P?

- **Concept: Calibration in Probabilistic Models**
  - Why needed here: Raw model confidence (softmax probabilities) is often miscalibrated. The paper constructs an explicit calibration distribution to convert latent distances to guaranteed correctness bounds.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a model's raw confidence score and a calibrated probability?

- **Concept: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
  - Why needed here: DPO enables fine-tuning from preference rankings without training a separate reward model. The paper uses guarantee-derived rankings to improve goal classification.
  - Quick check question: How does DPO differ from reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in terms of training complexity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User input (I_t, U_t) → Foundation Model (y_t, r_t) → Embedding P → z_t → Compute d_t → F_C(d_t) → p̂(y_t|z_t) → Decision: if p̂ ≥ τ, send r_t to solver; if p̂ < τ, trigger clarification
- **Critical path:** User input → Foundation Model → Embedding → Latent space → Calibration distribution → Probabilistic guarantee → Clarification loop → Downstream solver
- **Design tradeoffs:** Threshold τ selection affects accuracy-recall tradeoff; calibration set size impacts reliability vs. annotation cost; smaller backbone models reduce latency but require refinement infrastructure
- **Failure signatures:** High re-query rate indicates calibration misalignment; confident wrong predictions suggest corrupted calibration; cluster collapse indicates contrastive loss issues; prompt optimization divergence indicates systematic ranking errors
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce latent space visualization to verify cluster separation; 2) Validate calibration curve reliability diagram; 3) Run threshold sweep to reproduce accuracy vs. re-query frequency curve

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Cluster separability assumption may not hold for nuanced or overlapping goal categories beyond the three tested classes
- Calibration distribution reliability depends heavily on the 200-sample calibration set being representative of deployment conditions
- Contrastive learning requires sufficient positive pairs per class during training, with no specified handling of class imbalance

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Empirical result that fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini outperforms 20x larger GPT-5 in zero-shot classification accuracy (96% vs baseline) is directly measurable and reproducible
- **Medium confidence:** Probabilistic guarantee mechanism is theoretically sound with formal proof, but practical calibration depends on distribution assumptions requiring empirical validation
- **Medium confidence:** High-confidence samples assumption for refinement assumes these samples are truly correct, but systematic bias could reinforce errors during DPO

## Next Checks
1. **Calibration Set Size Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary calibration set size (50, 100, 200, 400 samples) and measure degradation in probabilistic guarantee reliability with reliability diagrams
2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Evaluate system on logistics domains outside original training distribution to measure cluster separability and calibration reliability transfer
3. **Failure Mode Analysis of Refinement Loop:** Intentionally inject miscalibrated samples into refinement pipeline and track error amplification over multiple training iterations compared to random sampling baseline
