# DIGMAPPER: A Modular System for Automated Geologic Map Digitization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.16006
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16006
- Reference count: 40
- DIGMAPPER achieves high accuracy in automated geologic map digitization with F1 scores up to 0.98 for polygons

## Executive Summary
DIGMAPPER is a modular system designed to automate the digitization of geologic maps, addressing the labor-intensive challenge of extracting geospatial features from historical maps. The system leverages deep learning models for map layout analysis, feature extraction, and georeferencing, integrated within a Dockerized, workflow-orchestrated architecture. By combining innovative techniques such as synthetic data generation and transformer-based models, DIGMAPPER significantly accelerates the creation of analysis-ready geospatial datasets for critical mineral assessments and broader geoscientific applications. Deployed at USGS, it demonstrates robust performance on the DARPA-USGS dataset with high accuracy across various feature extraction tasks.

## Method Summary
DIGMAPPER employs a modular architecture that integrates deep learning models for map layout analysis, polygon, line, and point feature extraction, and georeferencing. The system uses in-context learning with large language models, synthetic data generation, and transformer-based models to overcome challenges associated with limited training data and complex visual content. The workflow is orchestrated using Argo, with each component containerized in Docker for scalability and ease of deployment. The system's performance is evaluated on over 100 annotated maps from the DARPA-USGS dataset, demonstrating high accuracy in feature extraction and reliable georeferencing.

## Key Results
- F1 scores up to 0.98 for polygon feature extraction
- F1 scores of 0.82 for point feature extraction
- Median geodesic RMSE of 0.10 km for georeferencing accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DIGMAPPER's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture that allows for specialized deep learning models to handle different aspects of geologic map digitization. The use of synthetic data generation and transformer-based models addresses the challenge of limited training data, while the Dockerized, workflow-orchestrated design ensures scalability and ease of deployment. The integration of large language models for in-context learning further enhances the system's ability to process complex visual content accurately.

## Foundational Learning
- **Deep Learning Models**: Essential for handling complex visual content in geologic maps. Quick check: Ensure models are pre-trained on relevant datasets.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Overcomes the limitation of limited training data. Quick check: Validate the diversity and quality of synthetic data.
- **Transformer-Based Models**: Improves feature extraction accuracy. Quick check: Compare performance with traditional models.
- **Docker Containerization**: Ensures scalability and ease of deployment. Quick check: Test deployment in different environments.
- **Argo Workflow Orchestration**: Manages the modular components efficiently. Quick check: Monitor workflow execution and error handling.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Map Layout Analysis -> Feature Extraction (Polygon, Line, Point) -> Georeferencing -> Quality Control
- **Critical Path**: Map Layout Analysis -> Feature Extraction -> Georeferencing
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Modular design allows for specialized models but increases complexity; synthetic data generation addresses training data limitations but may not capture all map types.
- **Failure Signatures**: Inaccurate feature extraction due to poor map quality; georeferencing errors due to lack of control points.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test map layout analysis on a sample map, 2) Evaluate polygon feature extraction accuracy, 3) Assess georeferencing performance on a small dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Generalizability to non-DARPA-USGS datasets
- Scalability to extreme-scale geologic map collections
- Long-term system maintenance and integration with diverse GIS workflows

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability to datasets outside the DARPA-USGS collection
- Potential scalability issues with very large map collections
- Complexity of real-world deployment and integration with existing workflows

## Confidence
- High: Performance on DARPA-USGS dataset, innovative use of synthetic data and transformer models
- Medium: Generalizability to other datasets, scalability to extreme-scale collections
- Low: Long-term maintenance and integration with diverse GIS workflows

## Next Checks
1. Test DIGMAPPER on additional geologic map datasets from different institutions to assess generalizability.
2. Evaluate system performance on very large collections (10,000+ maps) to measure scalability.
3. Conduct a longitudinal study of system maintenance and accuracy degradation over extended operational periods.
