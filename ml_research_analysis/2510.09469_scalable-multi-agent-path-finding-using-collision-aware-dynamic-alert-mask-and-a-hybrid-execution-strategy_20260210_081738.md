# Scalable Multi-Agent Path Finding using Collision-Aware Dynamic Alert Mask and a Hybrid Execution Strategy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09469
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09469
- Reference count: 29
- Hybrid MAPF framework achieves 90-100% success rates with 93% reduction in inter-agent information sharing

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational challenge of multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) where centralized methods like CBS become intractable in large-scale scenarios. The authors propose a hybrid framework combining decentralized reinforcement learning-based path planning with a lightweight centralized coordinator that issues minimal, targeted alerts to agents upon detecting conflicts. Agents replan locally based on these alerts, either avoiding static conflict cells or incorporating brief sub-paths of conflicting agents as dynamic obstacles. The framework is evaluated across maze and warehouse environments with varying agent counts (5–96), achieving high success rates (90–100%) while reducing inter-agent information sharing by approximately 93% compared to continuous-observation distributed paradigms.

## Method Summary
The proposed hybrid MAPF framework combines decentralized reinforcement learning for individual agent path planning with a centralized coordinator that detects conflicts and issues targeted alerts. Each agent uses a CNN-based policy network to plan paths locally while maintaining only local observations. When conflicts are detected, the coordinator sends minimal alerts specifying conflict cells or incorporating sub-paths of conflicting agents as dynamic obstacles. Agents then replan locally based on these alerts, enabling scalable coordination without continuous information sharing. The framework balances computational efficiency with coordination effectiveness through a dynamic alert mask that adapts to environmental complexity.

## Key Results
- Achieves 90–100% success rates across maze and warehouse environments with 5–96 agents
- Reduces inter-agent information sharing by approximately 93% compared to continuous-observation distributed paradigms
- Outperforms CBS/ICBS in scalability while maintaining competitive performance against leading learning-based methods (PRIMAL/SCRIMP)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach works by leveraging the computational efficiency of decentralized RL planning while maintaining coordination through minimal centralized intervention. The dynamic alert mask ensures that agents only receive information when conflicts arise, reducing communication overhead while preserving solution quality. By incorporating sub-paths of conflicting agents as dynamic obstacles during replanning, the system achieves more informed local decisions without requiring full state observation. This balance between autonomy and coordination enables the framework to scale effectively to large agent counts while maintaining high success rates.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)**: Finding collision-free paths for multiple agents from start to goal positions. Needed because MAPF is NP-hard and becomes intractable at scale with centralized approaches.
- **Reinforcement Learning for Path Planning**: Using RL agents to learn navigation policies from local observations. Needed to enable decentralized decision-making without global state knowledge.
- **Conflict-Based Search (CBS)**: A centralized MAPF algorithm that resolves conflicts through constraint trees. Needed as a baseline to demonstrate scalability improvements.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Deep learning architectures for processing spatial information. Needed to process local grid observations for path planning decisions.
- **Dynamic Alert Masks**: Mechanism for selective conflict notification. Needed to reduce communication overhead while maintaining coordination effectiveness.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Agents (CNN policy networks) -> Local path planning -> Environment interaction -> Conflict detection -> Centralized coordinator -> Alert generation -> Agent replanning

**Critical Path**: Agent observation → CNN policy network → Local path planning → Environment interaction → Conflict detection → Centralized alert → Replanning trigger

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Centralized coordination vs. computational scalability
- Information sharing frequency vs. solution optimality
- Local observation range vs. global awareness
- Alert specificity vs. replanning overhead

**Failure Signatures**: 
- High alert frequency indicating poor local planning
- Deadlock situations with circular waiting
- Sub-optimal paths due to insufficient coordination
- Gridlock in dense agent configurations

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Single-agent navigation in empty grid to verify CNN policy network functionality
2. Two-agent conflict scenario to test alert generation and replanning
3. Increasing agent counts in simple maze to evaluate scalability threshold

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on maze and warehouse environments, with limited testing in highly dynamic or stochastic settings
- CNN-based policy networks may struggle with long-term strategic planning or complex spatial reasoning beyond local neighborhoods
- Trade-offs between alert frequency, replanning overhead, and overall runtime efficiency require further empirical validation

## Confidence

**High confidence**:
- Scalability claims and success rate improvements over CBS/ICBS in tested scenarios

**Medium confidence**:
- Generalizability claims, given evaluation primarily on maze and warehouse environments
- Information-sharing reduction metric, as the comparison baseline specifics are not fully detailed

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework in highly dynamic environments with moving obstacles or changing goal states to assess real-time adaptability
2. Evaluate performance on environments requiring complex multi-step reasoning beyond local path planning
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of the alert frequency threshold and replanning strategy on overall system performance
