# Interactive Video Generation via Domain Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24253
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24253
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces domain adaptation techniques for Interactive Video Generation, achieving improved trajectory control and perceptual quality

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of Interactive Video Generation (IVG), where users control object trajectories in text-to-video diffusion models. The authors identify two key failure modes: internal covariate shift caused by attention masking and initialization gap due to mismatched latent distributions. They propose solutions inspired by domain adaptation: mask normalization to align feature distributions between masked and unmasked attention outputs, and temporal intrinsic denoising to enforce spatio-temporal consistency. Experiments on Zeroscope show their method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in trajectory control (mIoU up to 33.82%) and perceptual quality (FID 131.19, KID 1.92%).

## Method Summary
The authors propose two domain adaptation-inspired techniques to improve Interactive Video Generation. First, they introduce mask normalization, which normalizes feature distributions between masked and unmasked attention outputs to prevent internal covariate shift during trajectory editing. Second, they develop temporal intrinsic denoising, which enforces spatio-temporal consistency by denoising masked latents based on temporal relationships between frames. These methods work together to stabilize the generation process when user-defined object trajectories are imposed on text-to-video diffusion models, addressing the initialization gap between the user-specified trajectory and the model's learned distribution.

## Key Results
- Mask normalization effectively addresses internal covariate shift, improving mIoU by up to 33.82% on trajectory control tasks
- Temporal intrinsic denoising enhances spatio-temporal consistency, reducing FID to 131.19 and KID to 1.92 on Zeroscope
- The combined approach outperforms existing methods for Interactive Video Generation, demonstrating superior trajectory fidelity and perceptual quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed methods work by addressing fundamental distributional mismatches that occur during interactive video generation. Mask normalization solves the internal covariate shift problem by normalizing feature distributions between masked and unmasked attention outputs, ensuring that the model's learned representations remain stable even when parts of the attention mechanism are disabled for user control. Temporal intrinsic denoising addresses the initialization gap by leveraging temporal relationships between frames to denoise masked latents, creating a more consistent trajectory that aligns with the model's learned spatio-temporal patterns.

## Foundational Learning

**Domain Adaptation** - Why needed: To bridge the gap between user-controlled trajectories and model-learned distributions. Quick check: Compare feature distributions before/after adaptation.

**Covariate Shift** - Why needed: To understand how masking attention during interactive editing destabilizes feature distributions. Quick check: Monitor feature statistics across masked/unmasked regions.

**Temporal Consistency** - Why needed: To ensure smooth object trajectories across video frames. Quick check: Measure temporal smoothness metrics between consecutive frames.

**Diffusion Model Latent Space** - Why needed: To understand how latents evolve during denoising and how masking affects this process. Quick check: Visualize latent trajectories with and without proposed methods.

**Attention Masking** - Why needed: To comprehend how disabling attention for user control creates distribution mismatches. Quick check: Analyze attention weight distributions before/after masking.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Trajectory Input -> Mask Normalization -> Temporal Intrinsic Denoising -> Diffusion Model

**Critical Path**: User-defined trajectories are first processed through mask normalization to stabilize feature distributions, then temporal intrinsic denoising enforces spatio-temporal consistency before final video generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational overhead (additional normalization and denoising steps) for improved trajectory control and quality, prioritizing user control fidelity over speed.

**Failure Signatures**: Without mask normalization, trajectories show unstable motion and artifacts; without temporal intrinsic denoising, trajectories exhibit temporal discontinuities and jitter.

**First Experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison without any adaptation techniques, 2) Ablation study with only mask normalization, 3) Ablation study with only temporal intrinsic denoising.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out additional open questions beyond the scope of their proposed solutions.

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies heavily on a single text-to-video model (Zeroscope), raising questions about generalizability to other state-of-the-art models
- The paper does not thoroughly analyze the computational overhead introduced by these adaptations
- The subjective quality improvements could benefit from more extensive user studies to validate practical usability

## Confidence
- Mask normalization effectiveness: High
- Temporal intrinsic denoising contribution: Medium
- State-of-the-art performance: Medium
- Trajectory control precision: High

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed methods on multiple text-to-video models (Runway Gen-2, AnimateDiff, Pika) to assess cross-model robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of mask normalization versus temporal intrinsic denoising
3. Measure and report inference time overhead introduced by the proposed techniques to evaluate practical deployment feasibility
