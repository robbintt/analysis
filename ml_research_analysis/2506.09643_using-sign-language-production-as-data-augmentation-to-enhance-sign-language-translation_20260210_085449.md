# Using Sign Language Production as Data Augmentation to enhance Sign Language Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.09643
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09643
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Synthetic data generation via sign stitching and appearance augmentation significantly improves Sign Language Translation accuracy, with up to 19% BLEU improvement.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes using Sign Language Production (SLP) to augment existing sign language datasets and improve Sign Language Translation (SLT) performance. The authors employ three techniques: a skeleton-based approach using sign stitching to generate synthetic skeleton sequences, and two photo-realistic generative models (SignGAN and SignSplat) to augment signer appearance. The method is evaluated on the PHOENIX14T dataset using both Video-to-Text (V2T) and Pose-to-Text (P2T) SLT models. Results show that the proposed methods significantly improve translation accuracy, with up to 19% improvement in BLEU scores, particularly when using sign stitching for pre-training. The skeleton-based augmentation proved most effective, while the visual augmentations showed mixed results, with SignSplat generally outperforming SignGAN.

## Method Summary
The approach uses three augmentation techniques: (1) Sign Stitching - concatenating isolated signs from a dictionary using interpolation and filtering to create synthetic skeleton sequences; (2) SignGAN - rendering these skeletons onto new signer appearances using a GAN-based approach; and (3) SignSplat - rendering using Gaussian Splatting constrained by a 3D human mesh (SMPL-X). The SLT models are pre-trained on synthetic data then fine-tuned on real data, following a sequential transfer learning paradigm that outperforms joint training.

## Key Results
- Sign stitching pre-training improved BLEU scores by up to 19% compared to baseline
- Skeleton-based augmentation (P2T) was more effective than visual appearance augmentation (V2T)
- SignSplat generally outperformed SignGAN for visual augmentations due to fewer rendering artifacts
- Joint training on real and synthetic data degraded performance compared to pre-training then fine-tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Vocabulary Expansion via Sign Stitching
- **Claim:** Pre-training on synthetic sequences created by stitching isolated signs develops more robust alignment between visual features and lexical tokens.
- **Mechanism:** Retrieves isolated sign sequences from a dictionary and concatenates them using linear interpolation and low-pass filtering, exposing the model to more sign contexts than the limited ground truth corpus.
- **Core assumption:** Visual fidelity of stitched signs is sufficient to teach correct lexical mapping without introducing significant noise.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states the method "enhance[s] the performance of Sign Language Translation models"; Section 3.1.1 describes filtering to "remove sharp, unnatural movements"; POSESTITCH-SLT supports pose-stitching viability.
- **Break condition:** Performance degrades if interpolation creates artifacts that the model overfits to, or if dictionary coverage is too sparse.

### Mechanism 2: Appearance Invariance via Neural Rendering
- **Claim:** Training on synthetic signers with varied appearances but identical motion teaches the model to prioritize skeletal dynamics over background or texture cues.
- **Mechanism:** Generative models (SignGAN or SignSplat) render original skeletal motion onto new identities, forcing the encoder to translate different visual representations of the same sign into the same text output.
- **Core assumption:** The generative model preserves semantic integrity of the sign during rendering.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "generating variation in the signer's appearance"; Section 4.2.2 observes SignSplat produces "realistic sequences with fewer artifacts."
- **Break condition:** Fails if rendering artifacts obscure the sign's meaning, leading the model to learn incorrect feature associations.

### Mechanism 3: Sequential Transfer Learning (Synth → Real)
- **Claim:** Pre-training on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real data yields superior performance compared to joint training or real-only training.
- **Mechanism:** The model first learns a generalized mapping from abundant synthetic data, then adjusts weights using lower learning rate on scarce real data.
- **Core assumption:** Synthetic data distribution overlaps sufficiently with real data distribution to allow positive transfer.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 4.2.1 finds "jointly training on both the real and the stitched data is detrimental"; Table 1 shows "GT + Stitched Pre-Training" outperforms joint training.
- **Break condition:** Fails if synthetic data distribution is too divergent, causing catastrophic forgetting of real-data nuances.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sign Language Production (SLP) vs. Translation (SLT)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper leverages the reverse task (SLP: Text → Video) to solve the primary task (SLT: Video → Text). Understanding this bidirectional relationship is essential to grasp why synthetic data generation is viable for data scarcity.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the system translate English to Sign (SLP) or Sign to English (SLT), and which direction generates the training data?

- **Concept: Regression to the Mean**
  - **Why needed here:** The authors explicitly reject direct regression models for skeleton generation because they produce "under-articulated" signs. This justifies their choice of "Sign Stitching" (retrieval-based) as the safer augmentation strategy.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the paper prefer stitching pre-recorded signs together rather than asking a neural network to predict the skeleton coordinates from scratch?

- **Concept: SMPL-X and Gaussian Splatting**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand the "SignSplat" mechanism, one must know that it constrains the avatar to a 3D human mesh (SMPL-X). This constraint reduces artifacts seen in GANs, making the data suitable for training.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does constraining the rendering to a 3D human mesh (SMPL-X) produce "cleaner" data for the translator than a GAN?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Data Generator (SLP): Dictionary of Isolated Signs → Interpolation → Synthetic Skeleton Sequence → SignGAN/SignSplat → Synthetic Video
  - Translator (SLT): Skeleton Input → Transformer Encoder → CTC + Decoder (P2T), or Visual Encoder → Text Decoder (V2T)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Dictionary Construction: Extracting and storing isolated signs with correct mapping
  2. Synthesis: Running the stitching pipeline to generate thousands of synthetic skeleton sequences
  3. Pre-training: Training the SLT Transformer exclusively on synthetic data first
  4. Fine-tuning: Retraining the model on the original (small) real dataset

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - SignGAN vs. SignSplat: GANs offer potentially higher texture realism but risk structural failures (disconnected limbs). SignSplat uses 3D primitives constrained by a mesh, guaranteeing structural validity but potentially lacking subtle texture details.
  - Stitched Data vs. Real Data: Stitched data is "clean" and abundant but lacks natural prosody and nuance of real conversation. Real data is scarce but "correct."

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Joint Training Collapse: If you mix real and synthetic data in a single batch, the model may learn to distinguish synthetic vs. real rather than the sign language content, or the noise in synthetic data may destabilize convergence.
  - Artifact Overfitting: In V2T tasks, the model might learn to translate based on specific rendering artifacts rather than the sign motion, leading to zero generalization on real video.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline establishment: Train the Sign Language Transformer on PHOENIX14T (GT) alone to establish the lower bound.
  2. Synthetic Pre-training validation: Train the same model only on Stitched Skeleton data, then test on GT to verify the synthetic distribution is valid (Zero-shot transfer check).
  3. Ablation on Rendering: Compare "GT + SignSplat" vs. "GT + SignGAN" for the V2T task to quantify the impact of rendering artifacts on BLEU scores.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) generate novel semantic content to drive synthetic skeleton generation, rather than relying solely on permutations of existing dataset glosses?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "we believe the power of LLMs is yet to be leveraged here to generate novel sentences" for this augmentation pipeline.
- Why unresolved: Current augmentation is restricted to re-ordering signs or varying speed, which limits the training data to the lexical variety of the original dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments utilizing an LLM-based Text-to-Gloss pipeline to create synthetic skeleton sequences for sentences not present in the original training set.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does combining novel skeleton motion generation with photo-realistic appearance augmentation improve Video-to-Text translation more than appearance-only augmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest future work should involve "combining the visual augmentations with the novel skeleton motion to generate entirely new video sequences rendered from multiple viewpoints."
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates skeleton augmentation (P2T) and appearance augmentation (V2T) in isolation; the synergistic effect of applying both simultaneously remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training V2T models on videos generated by driving the SignSplat or SignGAN avatars with the "sign stitching" skeleton sequences.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does simultaneous joint training on ground truth and synthetic skeleton data degrade performance compared to a pre-training strategy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 1a shows that "GT + Stitched" (joint training) underperforms the baseline, whereas pre-training improves it significantly. The authors note the detriment but do not explain the underlying cause.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the drop is due to domain shift, noise in the synthetic interpolation, or conflicting optimization signals during joint training.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study analyzing the domain discrepancy or gradient interference when mixing real and synthetic data batches.

## Limitations

- The dictionary construction process for sign stitching—specifically how glosses are mapped to isolated signs and how duration is determined—remains underspecified, making exact replication challenging.
- The claim that the 19% BLEU improvement is primarily due to sign stitching rather than other factors (like reduced overfitting on small datasets or the specific training schedule) lacks definitive isolation through controlled experiments.
- Performance gains from visual augmentations are mixed and dataset-dependent, with SignGAN producing artifacts that degrade V2T performance.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The claim that pre-training on synthetic skeleton data followed by fine-tuning on real data outperforms joint training or real-only approaches is well-supported by the ablation results (Table 1, Figure 4).
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that visual augmentations provide mixed benefits is supported, but the specific superiority of SignSplat over SignGAN for V2T tasks is based on limited comparisons.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that the 19% BLEU improvement is primarily due to sign stitching rather than other factors lacks definitive isolation through controlled experiments.

## Next Checks

1. **Mechanism Isolation**: Conduct an ablation study where sign stitching is used without synthetic pre-training (i.e., joint training) to determine whether the gains come from vocabulary expansion or the pre-training/fine-tuning paradigm.

2. **Dictionary Mapping Transparency**: Reconstruct or obtain the exact mapping between PHOENIX14T glosses and the 7,206-sign dictionary to verify whether the performance gains are reproducible with the stated methodology.

3. **Artifact Impact Analysis**: Systematically evaluate whether the visual artifacts in SignGAN (disconnected limbs, blurring) directly correlate with translation errors by comparing human-labeled sign quality scores against model performance across different rendering methods.
