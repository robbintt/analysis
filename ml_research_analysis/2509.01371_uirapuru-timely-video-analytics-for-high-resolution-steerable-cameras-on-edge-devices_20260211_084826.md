# Uirapuru: Timely Video Analytics for High-Resolution Steerable Cameras on Edge Devices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.01371
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01371
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Uirapuru is a framework for real-time video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras that incorporates an understanding of camera actuation to dynamically generate tile plans per frame.

## Executive Summary
Uirapuru addresses the challenge of real-time video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras by dynamically generating tile plans per frame based on the camera's current actuation state. It maintains a global object history and transforms it into a local distribution to handle rapidly changing object distributions. The framework introduces a fast adaptive tiling algorithm based on depth-first post-order dynamic programming (DP-DP) and a non-linear, relative size model profile to better handle wide-ranging object sizes caused by zoom and pan-tilt movements.

## Method Summary
Uirapuru is a framework for real-time video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras that incorporates an understanding of camera actuation to dynamically generate tile plans per frame. It addresses the challenge of rapidly changing object distributions in steerable camera streams by maintaining a global object history and transforming it into a local distribution based on the camera's current actuation state. Uirapuru introduces a fast adaptive tiling algorithm based on depth-first post-order dynamic programming (DP-DP) that efficiently generates high-quality tile plans, along with a new non-linear, relative size model profile to better handle wide-ranging object sizes caused by zoom and pan-tilt movements. Evaluated on a high-resolution dataset augmented with PTZ movements and real-world PTZ camera deployments, Uirapuru achieves up to 1.45× improvement in accuracy while respecting latency budgets, or up to 4.53× inference speedup with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 1.45× improvement in accuracy while respecting latency budgets
- Achieves up to 4.53× inference speedup with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches
- Evaluated on high-resolution dataset augmented with PTZ movements and real-world PTZ camera deployments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Uirapuru works by maintaining a global object history and transforming it into a local distribution based on the camera's current actuation state. This allows the framework to dynamically generate tile plans per frame that are optimized for the current camera view. The fast adaptive tiling algorithm based on depth-first post-order dynamic programming (DP-DP) efficiently generates high-quality tile plans, while the non-linear, relative size model profile better handles wide-ranging object sizes caused by zoom and pan-tilt movements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Depth-First Post-Order Dynamic Programming (DP-DP)**: Used for efficiently generating high-quality tile plans. Why needed: To handle the dynamic nature of steerable camera streams. Quick check: Verify the algorithm's performance on different camera actuation scenarios.
- **Non-linear, Relative Size Model Profile**: Better handles wide-ranging object sizes caused by zoom and pan-tilt movements. Why needed: To improve accuracy in diverse camera views. Quick check: Evaluate the model's performance on objects of varying sizes.
- **Global Object History**: Maintains a history of objects across frames. Why needed: To provide context for local distribution transformation. Quick check: Assess the impact of history length on accuracy.
- **Local Distribution Transformation**: Transforms global object history into a local distribution based on the camera's current actuation state. Why needed: To optimize tile plans for the current camera view. Quick check: Compare performance with and without local distribution transformation.
- **High-Resolution Dataset Augmentation**: Dataset augmented with PTZ movements for evaluation. Why needed: To simulate real-world steerable camera scenarios. Quick check: Verify the diversity and representativeness of the augmented dataset.
- **Real-World PTZ Camera Deployments**: Validation on real-world PTZ camera deployments. Why needed: To ensure the framework's effectiveness in practical scenarios. Quick check: Evaluate performance across different deployment environments.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Global Object History -> Local Distribution Transformation -> DP-DP Tiling Algorithm -> Tile Plan Generation
- **Critical Path**: The critical path involves maintaining the global object history, transforming it into a local distribution, and generating tile plans using the DP-DP algorithm.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades off computational overhead for improved accuracy and inference speed by maintaining a global object history and using a complex tiling algorithm.
- **Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include inaccurate object detection due to occlusions, lighting conditions, or complex object interactions, as well as computational bottlenecks in maintaining the global object history.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Evaluate the impact of history length on accuracy and inference speed.
  2. Test the framework's performance under varying lighting conditions and object densities.
  3. Assess the computational overhead of the global object history maintenance and local distribution transformation.

None

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology relies on a high-resolution dataset augmented with PTZ movements rather than real-world deployments.
- Extent and diversity of real-world PTZ camera deployments are not clearly specified.
- Does not discuss the impact of varying lighting conditions, occlusions, or complex object interactions.
- Computational overhead of maintaining global object history and local distribution transformation is not thoroughly explored.

## Confidence
- High confidence in the technical soundness of the DP-DP algorithm and the non-linear, relative size model profile.
- Medium confidence in the reported improvements in accuracy and inference speedup.
- Low confidence in the framework's robustness and adaptability to diverse real-world conditions.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive testing of Uirapuru in diverse real-world environments with varying lighting conditions, object densities, and camera movements to assess its robustness and generalizability.
2. Perform a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the global object history maintenance and local distribution transformation, particularly in resource-constrained edge devices.
3. Evaluate the framework's performance under scenarios with significant occlusions and complex object interactions to determine its effectiveness in handling challenging real-world situations.
