- One-line primary result: Agentic AI Wi-Fi achieves up to 87% higher throughput than Wi-Fi 6 spatial reuse in Co-SR-favored scenarios through LLM-powered multi-AP coordination

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework that replaces static, protocol-defined multi-access point coordination with autonomous LLM agents capable of collaborative reasoning and adaptive coordination. Each access point is modeled as an intelligent agent using natural language dialogue to negotiate transmission schedules, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use. The framework demonstrates significant performance gains over state-of-the-art spatial reuse baselines while maintaining backward compatibility with legacy systems.

## Method Summary
The method models each AP as an LLM agent using AutoGen framework, with cognitive architecture including prompt engine, short-term memory (sliding window of 5 rounds), RAG-based long-term memory (max 10 exemplars), CoT reasoning (evaluation → reflection → action), and tool use for environment feedback. Agents negotiate via natural language dialogue to balance Co-TDMA (interference-free) vs Co-SR (concurrent transmission) strategies. The system is evaluated in IEEE 802.11ax OBSS downlink scenarios with path loss, shadowing, and fading models, comparing against optimized Wi-Fi 6 spatial reuse baseline.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 87% higher throughput than Wi-Fi 6 spatial reuse in Co-SR-favored scenarios
- Demonstrates 1.85× and 1.87× improvements in Co-SR-favored scenarios for GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 agents respectively
- Ablation studies show critical role of reflection module, memory systems, and multi-agent negotiation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hybrid Memory Systems
Short-term memory maintains a sliding window of 5 recent negotiation rounds injected into prompts to prevent repeated mistakes and detect persistent interference patterns. Long-term memory uses RAG to store curated high-performing exemplars with cosine similarity retrieval and performance-based updates. This enables agents to adapt coordination strategies without fine-tuning by combining recent tactical feedback with retrieved strategic exemplars.

### Mechanism 2: Natural Language Dialogue Coordination
Sharing APs generate natural language proposals containing schedules and suggested peer actions. Shared APs evaluate proposals against local observations using their own reasoning and can accept, reject, or counter-propose. This negotiation loop enables richer coordination than binary control signals by transmitting strategic intent, contingent suggestions, and contextual reasoning.

### Mechanism 3: Reflection-Driven Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
Each agent executes a three-phase workflow: (1) Evaluation—calculates performance score from collision/success feedback; (2) Reflection—synthesizes outcomes with historical patterns via CoT to formulate strategy; (3) Action Generation—translates strategy to schedule + message. This enables autonomous discovery of hybrid coordination strategies beyond pre-programmed Co-TDMA/Co-SR binaries.

## Foundational Learning

- **Wi-Fi Multi-AP Coordination (Co-TDMA vs Co-SR trade-off)**: Understanding this fundamental trade-off is essential as the framework navigates between Co-TDMA's interference-free but capacity-wasteful slots versus Co-SR's concurrent transmission with collision risk. Quick check: In a 2-AP scenario with high inter-AP interference, which strategy should agents converge toward? (Answer: Co-TDMA or hybrid with minimal overlap)

- **In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: The cognitive architecture relies on ICL for rapid adaptation without fine-tuning and CoT for structured reasoning (evaluation → reflection → action). These are the core primitives enabling agent intelligence. Quick check: How does ICL differ from fine-tuning for adapting to new interference patterns? (Answer: ICL uses examples in the prompt at inference time; no weight updates)

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Knowledge Storage**: Long-term memory uses RAG to store and retrieve strategy exemplars. Understanding embedding-based similarity search and performance-based curation is essential for debugging memory behavior. Quick check: When a new experience is added to the knowledge base, what determines whether it replaces an existing entry? (Answer: Performance score comparison within the retrieved similarity cluster)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LLM Brain (GPT-4o / DeepSeek-R1) → Prompt Engine ← [Core Prompt (static) + Contextual Prompt (dynamic)] → Short-Term Memory (W=5 rounds) ← Sliding window of recent outcomes + Long-Term Memory (RAG, max=10) ← Best-practice exemplars → Tools: get_transmission_outcome() → Environment feedback → Multi-Agent Dialogue Layer (AutoGen) → Natural language negotiation

- **Critical path**: 1. AP wins CSMA/CA → becomes sharing AP → polls neighbors; 2. Sharing AP generates proposal (Evaluation → Reflection → Action); 3. Shared APs receive message → evaluate locally → decide schedule; 4. All APs transmit → invoke `get_transmission_outcome()` → receive feedback; 5. Shared APs report outcomes → all agents update memories → next round

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Memory window (W): Larger W stabilizes behavior but increases latency and token cost; W=5 chosen empirically
  - Knowledge base capacity: Larger capacity stores more strategies but increases retrieval noise; max=10 keeps exemplars curated
  - LLM choice: GPT-4o offers stronger reasoning; DeepSeek-R1 is cost-effective; heterogeneous deployment works but may introduce asymmetry
  - Scoring rule design: Must balance throughput reward vs collision penalty vs idle penalty; poor design causes suboptimal convergence

- **Failure signatures**:
  - No exploration (stuck at Co-TDMA): Reflection module disabled or scoring undervalues Co-SR gains → ablation shows 1.00 vs 1.85 throughput
  - Repeated collisions: Short-term memory disabled → agents forget recent failures and retry aggressive Co-SR
  - Selfish/uncoordinated behavior: Inter-agent negotiation removed → throughput drops to 0.4 in Co-TDMA-favored scenarios
  - Poor generalization: Long-term memory disabled → agents can't retrieve relevant exemplars for complex scenarios

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Single-agent baseline: Run with W=5, no long-term memory, no negotiation. Verify agent can learn basic Co-TDMA in high-interference 2-AP scenario. Expected: stable but suboptimal throughput (~0.7-0.8 normalized)
  2. Memory ablation: Compare W=3 vs W=5 vs W=10 in Co-SR-favored 3-AP scenario. Measure convergence speed and final throughput. Hypothesis: W=5 balances stability and adaptability
  3. Heterogeneous LLM test: Deploy GPT-4o as sharing AP, DeepSeek-R1 as shared AP in 2-AP Co-SR-favored scenario. Verify interoperability and measure throughput gap vs homogeneous deployment. Expected: <10% degradation per paper claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Critical implementation details unspecified (exact prompt templates, scoring rule parameters, knowledge base initialization)
- Simulation environment parameters underspecified (topology generation rules, area dimensions, AP placement distributions)
- Limited to downlink-only scenarios with one STA per BSS, restricting real-world applicability
- Does not address API costs, latency constraints, or security considerations for production deployment

## Confidence

**High Confidence** in the core architectural insight: The integration of LLM agents with memory systems and multi-agent dialogue for Wi-Fi coordination is technically sound and addresses a genuine gap in current MAPC approaches. The 87% throughput improvement over Wi-Fi 6 SR and ablation results demonstrating the necessity of each component are compelling.

**Medium Confidence** in the mechanism claims: While the hybrid memory system and CoT reasoning are well-motivated, the paper lacks detailed analysis of why specific design choices (W=5, max=10 exemplars) were optimal. The natural language dialogue mechanism's robustness to ambiguous messages is asserted but not empirically tested.

**Low Confidence** in real-world deployment readiness: The paper does not address API costs, latency constraints, or security considerations for LLM-based coordination in production networks. The evaluation focuses on idealized topologies without considering dynamic user mobility or varying traffic patterns.

## Next Checks

1. **Memory Window Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary W (3, 5, 10, 15) in both Co-TDMA-favored and Co-SR-favored scenarios to identify optimal trade-offs between stability and adaptability. Measure convergence speed and final throughput to validate the W=5 choice.

2. **Cross-Layer Compatibility Test**: Deploy the Agentic AI framework alongside legacy Wi-Fi devices (non-agent APs) in a mixed environment. Measure performance degradation and coordination failures when legacy devices do not participate in natural language negotiation.

3. **Prompt Engineering Robustness**: Conduct sensitivity analysis on prompt template variations (scoring rules, CoT structure, memory injection format) to identify which components are most critical for performance. Test with different LLM models (GPT-4o vs open-source alternatives) to assess model dependency.
