# From Words to Proverbs: Evaluating LLMs Linguistic and Cultural Competence in Saudi Dialects with Absher

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.10216
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10216
- **Reference count:** 37
- **Primary result:** Introduced Absher benchmark with 18,564 questions to evaluate LLMs on Saudi dialects and culture

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Absher, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) understanding of Saudi dialects and cultural nuances. The benchmark comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions across six categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage, Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition, derived from authentic dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs from five major Saudi regions. The authors evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs (ALLaM, LLaMA, Jais, Mistral, Qwen, and AceGPT) in a zero-shot setting. Results show significant performance variability across dialects and question types, with Qwen achieving the highest overall accuracy (63% on words, 50.35% overall) and ALLaM excelling in proverb interpretation (48%). All models struggled with culturally rich content and underrepresented dialects, highlighting the need for dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to improve LLMs' performance in real-world Arabic applications.

## Method Summary
The Absher benchmark was constructed by scraping 3,094 dialectal items (words, phrases, proverbs) from the Moajam website, labeling them by Saudi region, and using GPT-4o to generate 18,564 multiple-choice questions across six task types. The evaluation employed zero-shot inference on six open-source LLMs, calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. The methodology included automated JSON validation and manual review by native speakers to ensure quality. Questions were structured to test both linguistic understanding and cultural competence, with particular attention to regional dialect variations and cultural interpretation challenges.

## Key Results
- Qwen achieved highest overall accuracy at 50.35%, with 63% on word-level tasks
- ALLaM performed best on proverb interpretation (48% accuracy)
- All models showed significant difficulty with culturally rich content and underrepresented dialects
- Southern and Eastern dialects had notably lower model performance compared to Central and Western regions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark effectively captures real-world LLM limitations by testing both linguistic understanding and cultural competence through region-specific dialect questions. The zero-shot evaluation methodology provides a realistic assessment of model capabilities without fine-tuning advantages, while the diverse question types (including cultural interpretation) reveal genuine competency gaps that would impact practical applications in Saudi Arabic contexts.

## Foundational Learning

**Dialectal Variation Understanding** - Why needed: Saudi dialects vary significantly across regions, requiring models to recognize context-specific meanings. Quick check: Can the model correctly interpret the same word with different meanings across regions?

**Cultural Context Integration** - Why needed: Many dialect expressions carry cultural significance beyond literal meaning. Quick check: Does the model understand proverbs as cultural artifacts rather than just linguistic patterns?

**Zero-shot Evaluation Principles** - Why needed: Provides realistic assessment of model capabilities without fine-tuning bias. Quick check: Are evaluation results consistent across different prompting strategies?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Source (Moajam) -> Question Generation (GPT-4o) -> Validation (Script+Manual) -> Evaluation (LLMs) -> Metrics

**Critical Path:** Question generation and validation must ensure high-quality, unbiased questions before model evaluation can produce meaningful results.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Zero-shot evaluation provides generalizability but limits performance ceiling; automated validation ensures scalability but may miss nuanced errors; regional focus provides depth but may reduce cross-dialect applicability.

**Failure Signatures:** Models showing systematic errors on specific dialects indicate data imbalance; poor cultural interpretation performance suggests limitations in understanding contextual meaning; positional answer bias indicates generation issues.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test answer randomization across all question types, 2) Validate dialect representation balance across regions, 3) Conduct inter-annotator agreement on cultural interpretation questions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Regional dialect coverage shows significant imbalances, with Southern and Eastern dialects underrepresented
- GPT-4o generated questions may introduce systematic bias despite manual review
- Zero-shot evaluation limits performance comparisons but maintains generalizability claims

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** Benchmark construction methodology is well-documented with clear data sources and systematic generation process. Comparative performance across six distinct LLMs using standardized metrics is reproducible.

**Medium Confidence:** Zero-shot evaluation effectively demonstrates current model limitations, but absolute performance numbers may not represent achievable performance with minimal prompting strategies.

**Low Confidence:** Cultural interpretation category results require additional validation due to significant performance degradation across all models.

## Next Checks
1. Verify automated script correctly randomizes correct answer positions across all question types
2. Conduct manual verification of regional dialect representation balance
3. Perform inter-annotator agreement testing on cultural interpretation questions to validate ground truth reliability
