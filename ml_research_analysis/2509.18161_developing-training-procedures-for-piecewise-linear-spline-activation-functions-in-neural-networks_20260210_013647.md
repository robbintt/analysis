# Developing Training Procedures for Piecewise-linear Spline Activation Functions in Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.18161
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18161
- Authors: William H Patty
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Learnable B-spline activations achieved up to 94% lower error rates in feed-forward networks compared to ReLU baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates training methodologies for piecewise-linear spline activation functions in neural networks, comparing 9 different dual-optimization approaches. The research demonstrates that replacing traditional ReLU activations with learnable linear B-splines can significantly improve model accuracy across regression, function fitting, image classification, and audio classification tasks. Results show substantial performance gains, with up to 94% lower end-model error rates in feed-forward networks and 51% lower rates in convolutional networks. While these improvements come at the cost of additional training complexity and end-model latency, the findings suggest that parameterized piecewise-linear activation functions can train more accurate, parameter-efficient models by assigning optimal activation shapes to individual neurons.

## Method Summary
The study explores training linear B-spline activation functions (with 3 control points each) alongside network weights using 9 distinct training sequences. These sequences range from freezing activations initially (FB) to joint training (WB) and staged optimization (WBlrs) where weights are gradually frozen while activations continue training. The approach was tested across multiple architectures including feed-forward networks and 2D convolutional networks on tasks including regression (California Housing, Wine Quality), function fitting (Two Spiral, arbitrary 2D functions), and classification (MNIST, CIFAR10, ESC50, Speech Commands). All models initialized spline activations in ReLU shape and were compared against parameter-equivalent ReLU baselines.

## Key Results
- Up to 94% lower end-model error rates in feed-forward networks using learnable B-splines vs ReLU
- Up to 51% lower error rates in convolutional networks with spline activations
- WB to WBlrs (weighted B-spline with learning rate scheduling) emerged as the most consistently dominant training procedure
- Speech Commands dataset showed anomalous worse-than-ReLU performance, suggesting task-dependent variability
- Parameter-efficient models achieved with learnable activations, though at cost of additional training complexity and latency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Role-Specialized Activation Optimization
- Claim: Learnable activations outperform fixed activations because neurons develop specialized transformation shapes matched to their emergent roles during training
- Mechanism: At initialization, neuron roles are undetermined. By making activation functions trainable, the optimizer jointly adjusts both connection weights and activation shapes, allowing each neuron to learn a transformation tailored to its eventual function rather than being constrained to a predetermined shape
- Core assumption: The optimal activation shape varies across neurons and layers, and gradient descent can discover these shapes without overfitting
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "by optimizing the shapes of a network's activation functions, we can train models that are more parameter-efficient and accurate by assigning more optimal activations to the neurons"
  - [section 1.1] "Learnable activation functions, however, can be optimized alongside other parameters such that each function is tuned to the specific role of its corresponding neuron"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support; related work on Free-Knots KANs (arXiv:2501.09283) similarly analyzes learned activation stability but does not validate this mechanism directly
- Break condition: Overfitting risk increases with spline flexibility; small datasets may not support learning specialized activations without regularization

### Mechanism 2: Local Control via Piecewise-Linear Structure
- Claim: B-spline activations with local control enable fine-grained optimization of specific input regions without global distortion
- Mechanism: Linear B-splines are defined by control points that influence only local segments. Adjusting one control point modifies the activation shape in a bounded region while leaving other regions unchanged, enabling the optimizer to specialize transformation behavior for different input distributions
- Core assumption: The input domain contains region-specific optimal transformation patterns that local control can exploit
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "linear B-spline activation functions" achieving "up to 94% lower end model error rates"
  - [section 1.2] "B-splines...are expressly continuous to their (d−1)th derivative" and control point adjustments modify shape locally
  - [corpus] Regional representations paper (arXiv:2506.05834) discusses piecewise linear function representations, providing indirect theoretical grounding but no direct experimental validation of local control benefits
- Break condition: Insufficient control points (paper uses only 3) may limit expressiveness; higher-degree splines may be needed for complex tasks

### Mechanism 3: Sequential Dual-Optimization Dynamics
- Claim: Training sequences that transition from weight-focused to activation-focused optimization yield better minima than simultaneous or single-phase training
- Mechanism: The "WB to WBlrs" procedure first trains weights and activations jointly (WB), then gradually reduces weight learning rates (WBlrs), allowing activations to refine while weights stabilize. This staged approach helps avoid premature convergence to suboptimal joint configurations
- Core assumption: The loss landscape has structure where weight-activation coupling benefits from phased optimization rather than uniform gradient updates
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "WBlrs: Training activation functions alongside the connection weights and biases, which are on a learning rate scheduler. Over the course of training, we decrease the magnitude of the updates made to the connection parameters until we're only training the activations"
  - [section 4.2] "WB to WBlrs was the most consistently dominant procedure in terms of final model performance"
  - [corpus] No corpus papers directly validate phased optimization for trainable activations; mechanism remains empirically observed but theoretically unproven
- Break condition: "R to B" (isolated B-spline training after ReLU pretraining) consistently underperformed, suggesting that freezing weights while training activations alone is insufficient for many tasks

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **B-spline basis functions and control points**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how spline shapes are parameterized is essential for debugging unexpected activation behaviors and selecting appropriate control point counts
  - Quick check question: If you increase control points from 3 to 7, what happens to activation flexibility and parameter count?

- Concept: **Piecewise-linear function optimization landscapes**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core claim depends on understanding why piecewise structures create different gradient paths than smooth functions
  - Quick check question: How does the gradient flow differ through a linear segment versus a knot point in a linear B-spline?

- Concept: **Dual-optimization dynamics (weights + activations)**
  - Why needed here: The 9 training sequences represent different strategies for managing coupled optimization; understanding trade-offs is prerequisite to selecting appropriate procedures
  - Quick check question: Why might training activations alone ("B" phase) after ReLU pretraining fail to improve performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - DeepSplines module -> Provides linear B-spline activation layer (referenced implementation)
  - Control points (3 per spline) -> Learnable parameters defining activation shape
  - Training phase controller -> Manages transitions between R/WB/B/WBlrs phases
  - Dual optimizers -> Separate learning rates for connection weights vs. spline parameters

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize spline activations in ReLU shape (all models start here)
  2. Select training sequence based on task type (regression favors WB variants; classification more variable)
  3. Configure separate learning rates for weights and activations before training
  4. If using phased approach, determine transition epoch (hyperparameter from Section 4.2)
  5. Validate on held-out set; compare to parameter-equivalent ReLU baseline

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. latency: Spline activations add inference overhead (Section 5.2)
  - Flexibility vs. overfitting: More control points increase expressiveness but risk memorization on small datasets
  - Training complexity vs. reproducibility: 9 procedures offer optimization paths but require task-specific tuning

- Failure signatures:
  - Speech Commands anomaly: Worse-than-ReLU performance suggests hyperparameter sensitivity or data processing issues—do not assume universal improvement
  - "R to B" underperformance: Isolated activation training after ReLU pretraining fails on most tasks—avoid this sequence for new applications
  - High variance across runs: Small models or datasets may not support stable spline learning; increase runs or add regularization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Train parameter-equivalent ReLU vs. WB (joint training) on your dataset; measure loss reduction and latency overhead
  2. Ablation on control points: Test 3, 5, and 7 control points on a validation subset to identify expressiveness needs before full training
  3. Phase transition timing: Compare WB-to-WBlrs with transition at 50% vs. 75% of epochs to determine optimal weight-freeze timing for your task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do higher-order B-splines (e.g., quadratic, cubic) yield better accuracy or convergence properties than the linear splines tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The "Future Works" section suggests exploring "higher order B-splines" beyond the linear ones used here
- Why unresolved: The author restricted experiments to linear B-splines due to compute and time constraints
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative benchmarks showing final loss and convergence speed for parameter-equivalent higher-order spline models

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can specialized CUDA kernel implementations effectively mitigate the inference latency overhead introduced by spline activations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author lists "end model latency" as a cost and suggests "optimizations on spline latency (CUDA kernel)" as future work
- Why unresolved: The current implementation focuses on training methodology rather than deployment efficiency
- What evidence would resolve it: Inference timing benchmarks comparing optimized custom kernels against standard ReLU implementations on identical hardware

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the poor performance on the Speech Commands dataset an inherent limitation of the method or a result of suboptimal hyperparameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The results section labels the Speech Commands performance as "anomalous" and notes it "possibly" resulted from limited resources for tuning
- Why unresolved: The compute-constrained environment prevented sufficient hyperparameter optimization for this specific task
- What evidence would resolve it: A reproduction of the Speech Commands experiment with a comprehensive hyperparameter search to see if error rates drop to levels consistent with other tasks

## Limitations

- Generalization beyond FNNs and 2D CNNs remains unproven
- Speech Commands dataset produced notably worse performance than ReLU baselines, indicating significant task-dependent variability
- Architectural specifications for parameter-equivalent comparisons were not fully detailed, potentially affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Mechanism 2 (Local Control via Piecewise-Linear Structure) - directly supported by spline mathematical properties
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanism 1 (Role-Specialized Activation Optimization) - empirically observed but lacks theoretical proof of optimality
- **Low confidence**: Mechanism 3 (Sequential Dual-Optimization Dynamics) - observed pattern without rigorous landscape analysis

## Next Checks

1. Test the WB to WBlrs procedure on a transformer-based architecture to assess generalizability beyond tested network types
