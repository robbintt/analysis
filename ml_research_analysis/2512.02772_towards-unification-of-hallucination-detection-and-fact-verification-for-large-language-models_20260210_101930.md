# Towards Unification of Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.02772
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02772
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Introduces UniFact, a unified framework that bridges hallucination detection and fact verification paradigms, demonstrating that hybrid methods combining both approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the research schism between Hallucination Detection (HD) and Fact Verification (FV) paradigms for detecting factual errors in LLM outputs. While HD relies on internal model signals and FV uses external evidence, these approaches have evolved with distinct methodologies and evaluation protocols. The authors introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison of both paradigms through dynamic generation and automatic labeling of LLM outputs. Large-scale experiments reveal that HD and FV capture complementary aspects of factual errors, and simple hybrid methods consistently outperform individual approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results.

## Method Summary
The UniFact framework dynamically generates LLM outputs and automatically labels their factuality by comparing them to ground truth. This unified evaluation protocol enables direct comparison between HD and FV methods at the instance level. The framework incorporates both paradigms: HD methods use internal signals like confidence scores, attention patterns, and token probabilities, while FV methods retrieve and verify claims against external evidence sources. By creating a common evaluation ground, UniFact reveals that neither paradigm universally dominates, and that hybrid approaches combining both methodologies consistently achieve superior performance across diverse tasks and model configurations.

## Key Results
- No single paradigm (HD or FV) universally dominates across all LLMs and tasks
- HD and FV capture complementary aspects of factual errors, with non-overlapping strengths
- Simple hybrid methods integrating both paradigms consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from the complementary nature of internal model signals (HD) and external evidence verification (FV). Internal signals capture model confidence and reasoning patterns, while external verification provides grounded factual assessment. By unifying these approaches, UniFact leverages both model introspection and knowledge grounding to provide more comprehensive factuality assessment.

## Foundational Learning

**LLM Hallucination Detection**: Understanding how models generate incorrect information internally - needed to capture model confidence and reasoning patterns; quick check: examine attention distributions and token probability scores.

**External Fact Verification**: Knowledge of how to retrieve and verify claims against external evidence sources - needed for grounding model outputs in verifiable facts; quick check: measure retrieval accuracy and verification confidence scores.

**Hybrid Evaluation Frameworks**: Understanding how to combine complementary assessment methods - needed to leverage both internal and external verification strengths; quick check: compare performance gaps between individual and hybrid approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM Output Generation -> HD Signal Extraction -> FV Evidence Retrieval -> Factuality Labeling -> Performance Comparison

**Critical Path**: The core evaluation pipeline processes LLM outputs through both HD and FV pipelines in parallel, then compares results against ground truth labels to assess complementary strengths and hybrid performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: UniFact prioritizes comprehensive evaluation over computational efficiency, as it requires running multiple detection paradigms simultaneously. The framework trades speed for thoroughness in identifying factuality issues.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when ground truth is ambiguous, evidence sources are incomplete, or HD signals become unreliable for specific model architectures. Domain shift between training and evaluation data also impacts reliability.

**First Experiments**: 1) Run baseline HD and FV methods separately on identical outputs to establish individual performance baselines. 2) Implement simple weighted combination of HD and FV scores to create hybrid methods. 3) Conduct ablation studies removing either HD or FV components to measure contribution to hybrid performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Ground truth reliance for automatic labeling may not reflect real-world scenarios where ground truth is often unavailable or contested
- Primary focus on English language tasks limits generalizability to multilingual contexts
- Performance variations across different LLMs and tasks suggest context-dependent effectiveness

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: HD and FV capture complementary aspects of factual errors (well-supported across multiple datasets)
- **Medium Confidence**: Simple hybrid methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance (improvement varies by task type)
- **Medium Confidence**: Direct instance-level comparison between paradigms is enabled (generality across applications needs validation)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multilingual experiments to assess UniFact's effectiveness across different languages and cultural contexts
2. Implement real-time deployment testing of hybrid methods to measure computational overhead and latency impacts
3. Design ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of each paradigm component in hybrid methods
