# Rate-Distortion Analysis of Compressed Query Delegation with Low-Rank Riemannian Updates

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.00938
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00938
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CQD achieves 94.7% accuracy with 0.18× query ratio vs GPT-4o's 72.4%

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces compressed query delegation (CQD), a method for bounded-context reasoning that compresses a high-dimensional latent reasoning state into a low-rank tensor query. The compressed query is delegated to an external oracle, and the reasoning state is updated via Riemannian optimization on fixed-rank tensor manifolds. The approach connects CQD to rate-distortion theory and the information bottleneck principle, showing that spectral hard-thresholding is optimal for a constrained quadratic distortion problem. Experiments demonstrate that CQD outperforms chain-of-thought baselines on a 2,500-item reasoning suite, achieving higher accuracy with significantly fewer queries.

## Method Summary
CQD operates by maintaining a latent reasoning state represented as a high-dimensional tensor. This state is compressed into a low-rank tensor query using spectral hard-thresholding, which retains only the most significant singular values above a threshold ε. The compressed query is then delegated to an external oracle (such as an LLM) for processing. The oracle's response is used to update the reasoning state via Riemannian stochastic approximation on the manifold of fixed-rank tensors. This iterative process balances information preservation with computational efficiency, enabling bounded-context reasoning that can be delegated to external computational resources.

## Key Results
- CQD achieves 94.7% accuracy with 0.18× the query ratio compared to GPT-4o's 72.4% accuracy on a 2,500-item reasoning suite
- Human benchmarks (N=200) demonstrate strong epistemic gain and controlled semantic drift across modern oracles
- The method provides theoretical convergence guarantees for Riemannian stochastic approximation under oracle noise assumptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging rate-distortion theory to optimally compress the reasoning state while preserving task-relevant information. Spectral hard-thresholding acts as an optimal encoder under quadratic distortion, retaining only the most informative components of the reasoning state. The Riemannian optimization framework ensures that state updates remain on the feasible manifold of fixed-rank tensors, maintaining computational tractability. By delegating compressed queries to oracles, the system can leverage external computational resources while minimizing context window requirements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Rate-Distortion Theory**: Framework for optimal lossy compression under distortion constraints. Needed to establish theoretical foundations for CQD compression. Quick check: Verify that spectral hard-thresholding minimizes distortion for given compression rate.
- **Information Bottleneck Principle**: Method for extracting relevant information while compressing. Provides theoretical justification for CQD's compression approach. Quick check: Confirm that retained singular values capture task-relevant information.
- **Riemannian Optimization on Fixed-Rank Manifolds**: Optimization framework for constrained tensor spaces. Enables efficient updates while maintaining rank constraints. Quick check: Validate convergence rates under oracle noise assumptions.
- **Spectral Hard-Thresholding**: Optimal compression method for quadratic distortion. Provides provable optimality for CQD compression. Quick check: Compare reconstruction error against alternative compression methods.
- **Bounded-Context Reasoning**: Reasoning within fixed computational context. Enables practical deployment with limited resources. Quick check: Measure performance degradation as context window decreases.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Latent State -> Spectral Compression -> Oracle Delegation -> Riemannian Update -> New Latent State
- **Critical Path**: State representation → Compression → Oracle query → Response processing → State update
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Higher compression ratios reduce query costs but may degrade accuracy; rank constraints enable computational efficiency but limit representational capacity
- **Failure Signatures**: Oracle refusal or hallucination propagates through Riemannian updates; excessive compression causes semantic drift; rank constraints may trap optimization in local minima
- **First Experiments**: 1) Benchmark CQD accuracy versus chain-of-thought baselines on standardized reasoning tasks, 2) Measure semantic drift under varying compression ranks and distortion budgets, 3) Test robustness to oracle noise and refusal patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Is spectral hard-thresholding still optimal for CQD under non-quadratic distortion measures (e.g., task-specific loss functions, semantic distance metrics)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The optimality results (Theorem 5.2, Proposition 5.3) are explicitly "under quadratic distortion." The paper states CQD minimizes ∥A − PA∥²_F.
- Why unresolved: Eckart–Young–Mirsky optimality relies critically on unitary invariance of Frobenius norm; other distortion measures may require different compression schemes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Proof of optimal encoder structure for specific non-quadratic distortions, or counterexamples showing spectral truncation is suboptimal under task losses.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does CQD converge to global optima on fixed-rank tensor manifolds, or only to stationary points?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Theorem 6.2 guarantees "iterates converge to the set of stationary points almost surely," not global minima.
- Why unresolved: The constrained optimization landscape on M_r is non-convex; spurious stationary points may exist.
- What evidence would resolve it: Characterization of critical point structure on M_r, or empirical analysis showing frequency of non-global convergence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the oracle noise model (zero-mean, bounded variance) be relaxed to handle biased, adversarial, or structured oracle errors?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Assumption 6.1 requires E[ξ(Q)|Q] = 0 and bounded variance σ². Real LLM oracles may exhibit systematic biases or adversarial refusals violating this.
- Why unresolved: The convergence proof relies on unbiased gradient estimates; biased noise would require modified analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Convergence guarantees under relaxed noise models (e.g., bounded bias), or empirical robustness analysis with adversarial oracles.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Would mode-adaptive spectral thresholds ε^(1), ε^(2), ε^(3) outperform the single shared threshold ε in ASM?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Definition 5.1 uses the same ε for all three modes, but tensor modes often have different spectral decay profiles (cf. Lemma 5.4's mode-wise bounds).
- Why unresolved: Mode-specific thresholds could better exploit varying spectral structure but complicate the rate-distortion trade-off.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation study comparing fixed ε versus per-mode adaptive thresholds on benchmark tasks.

## Limitations
- Experimental evaluation relies on a custom 2,500-item reasoning suite without public access, making independent verification difficult
- Compression performance metrics depend heavily on oracle selection, with limited testing across different model families
- Riemannian convergence analysis assumes bounded oracle noise and fixed-rank constraints that may not hold for all real-world scenarios
- Information-theoretic optimality is proven only under quadratic distortion, which may not reflect actual task-specific utility functions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical framework connecting CQD to rate-distortion theory and information bottleneck principles
- **Medium confidence**: Experimental results demonstrating accuracy improvements, limited by proprietary benchmark access
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability of results across different oracle models and reasoning task domains

## Next Checks
1. Replicate core accuracy and compression ratio results on a public, standardized reasoning benchmark
2. Test the CQD framework with additional oracle models to assess robustness across different model families
3. Empirically evaluate semantic drift under varying compression ranks and distortion budgets on out-of-distribution queries
