# ResearchRubrics: A Benchmark of Prompts and Rubrics For Evaluating Deep Research Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07685
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Benchmark with 2,593 rubric criteria across 101 prompts evaluates deep research agents, finding all systems achieve under 68% compliance with expert rubrics

## Executive Summary
ResearchRubrics introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating deep research agents through expert-written rubrics and prompts. The benchmark employs a tri-axial complexity framework categorizing tasks along conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration dimensions. Using LLM-as-judge protocols with ternary grading, the study evaluates three commercial deep research systems, finding all achieve under 68% average compliance with rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information.

## Method Summary
The benchmark consists of 101 domain-diverse prompts (9 categories) annotated with complexity triplets, paired with 2,593 rubric criteria across 6 axes (Explicit, Implicit, Synthesis, References, Communication, Instructions). LLM-as-judge using GPT-5, Claude-4.5, or Gemini-2.5-Pro produces ternary verdicts (Satisfied/Partially Satisfied/Not Satisfied) per criterion. Final task scores are normalized weighted sums (Eq. 1). Human-LLM alignment is measured via Macro F1. The complete benchmark is released at https://scale.com/research/researchrubrics.

## Key Results
- All three commercial deep research systems achieve under 68% average rubric compliance
- Performance degrades monotonically with increased logical nesting depth
- LLM-based rubric augmentation catastrophically degrades alignment by 15-20%
- Ternary grading achieves better alignment than binary grading

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Ternary grading improves evaluation alignment over binary grading. The three-tier scale (Satisfied/Partially Satisfied/Not Satisfied) captures nuance in long-form responses where criteria may be addressed incompletely, reducing false negatives that binary grading would penalize as total failures. Core assumption: Partial compliance represents meaningful signal rather than noise. Evidence: Binary grading achieves substantial agreement (0.72–0.76 Macro F1); shift from ternary to binary increases agreement by approximately 20 percentage points. Break condition: If partial credit introduces more subjectivity than signal, ternary grading degrades rather than improves reliability.

### Mechanism 2
Expert-authored rubrics with examples outperform LLM-augmented rubrics. Human experts write concise criteria with targeted examples that anchor evaluation; LLM augmentation adds verbose elaboration that introduces semantic drift and emphasis distortion. Core assumption: Clarity emerges from precision rather than elaboration. Evidence: LLM-based rubric augmentation catastrophically degrades alignment by 15-20%. Break condition: If LLM augmentation were grounded in domain-specific constraints rather than open-ended expansion, the degradation might reverse.

### Mechanism 3
Logical nesting depth predicts failure more strongly than conceptual breadth. Sequential reasoning chains create compounding error propagation—failure at step k invalidates all downstream steps—whereas parallel domain synthesis allows partial success. Core assumption: Current architectures lack explicit state management for multi-hop inference. Evidence: Performance degrades monotonically with increased logical nesting depth. Break condition: If agents implemented explicit intermediate verification steps, depth-dependent degradation would flatten.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **LLM-as-Judge Paradigm**
  - Why needed here: The benchmark relies on automated grading of 2,593 criteria; understanding how LLM judges align with humans is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Given a rubric criterion and a model response, would you expect higher human-LLM agreement on binary or ternary grading? Why?

- Concept: **Rubric-Based Evaluation vs. Reference-Based Metrics**
  - Why needed here: ResearchRubrics evaluates responses against explicit criteria rather than overlap with gold references; this avoids penalizing valid alternative answers.
  - Quick check question: If two responses both satisfy 80% of rubric criteria but cite different sources, are they equivalent under this framework?

- Concept: **Task Complexity Decomposition (Breadth/Depth/Exploration)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's tri-axial framework enables targeted diagnosis—knowing whether failures stem from breadth, depth, or exploration.
  - Quick check question: A prompt asking "Compare renewable energy policies across 10 countries" ranks how on each axis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompts -> DR Agent -> Response -> Judge (per-criterion evaluation) -> Scorer (weighted aggregation) -> Domain/complexity stratification
- Critical path: Prompt → DR Agent → Response → Judge (per-criterion evaluation) → Scorer (weighted aggregation) → Domain/complexity stratification
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity vs. scalability: 25.7 criteria/prompt enables fine-grained diagnosis but increases evaluation cost
  - Mandatory vs. optional criteria: Separates sufficiency from excellence; mandatory failures indicate unsafe deployment
  - Human vs. automated rubric generation: Human authoring avoids semantic drift but doesn't scale; LLM augmentation degrades alignment by 15-20%
- Failure signatures:
  - High implicit criteria failure rate (45-50%): Agent retrieves facts but doesn't infer unstated requirements
  - Depth-dependent score collapse: Tasks with 4+ reasoning steps show universal performance degradation
  - Breadth-accuracy trade-off: Gemini (111 citations, 81% accuracy) vs. Perplexity (31 citations, 90% accuracy)—no system optimizes both
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline evaluation**: Run target DR agent on all 101 prompts; compute overall compliance and stratify by complexity dimensions
  2. **Rubric ablation**: Compare evaluation results with expert rubrics vs. LLM-augmented rubrics on 20-prompt subset
  3. **Failure mode analysis**: For tasks with <50% compliance, categorize failures by rubric axis to prioritize improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does the positive correlation between response length and rubric compliance reflect genuine information density or an evaluation bias toward verbosity? The study found correlation (r ≈ 0.24–0.28) but could not determine if longer responses satisfy more criteria due to legitimate content or if grading mechanism inherently favors verbosity. Resolution requires controlled experiments varying response length while holding information content constant.

- What specific architectural innovations are required to overcome the "universal performance collapse" observed when logical nesting exceeds four sequential inference steps? Current systems show sharp performance drops on multi-step analytical problems, which the authors attribute to fundamental architectural constraints in representing complex information structures. Resolution requires demonstration of an agent architecture maintaining >60% rubric compliance on tasks classified as "Deep" (4+ dependent reasoning steps).

- Why does LLM-based augmentation of rubric criteria cause a "catastrophic" 15–20% drop in human-LLM alignment compared to concise, expert-authored rubrics? The mechanism remains theoretical; it is unclear if LLM adds noise, over-specifies constraints, or shifts criterion focus in ways that confuse judge model. Resolution requires fine-grained linguistic analysis of augmented vs. original rubrics to identify specific features that correlate with F1 score drops.

## Limitations

- Human-LLM alignment reliability is uncertain due to underspecified human annotation protocol for the 303 ground-truth judgments
- Prompt quality variability cannot be fully assessed without inter-annotator agreement metrics for complexity ratings
- Commercial system constraints limit mechanistic explanations for observed failure patterns

## Confidence

**High confidence** (Strong empirical support):
- Ternary grading achieves better alignment than binary grading
- Expert-authored rubrics outperform LLM-augmented rubrics
- Logical nesting depth correlates negatively with performance

**Medium confidence** (Support exists but with limitations):
- Depth-dependent performance degradation reflects fundamental architectural constraints
- Implicit criteria failures indicate retrieval vs. inference gaps
- Breadth-accuracy trade-offs are inherent to current architectures

**Low confidence** (Limited or indirect evidence):
- The tri-axial complexity framework captures all relevant task dimensions
- Current architectures cannot achieve both breadth and accuracy simultaneously
- LLM-as-judge protocols will remain reliable as model capabilities advance

## Next Checks

1. **Inter-annotator reliability study**: Replicate human-LLM alignment validation with 5 independent annotators evaluating 50 rubric-criterion pairs. Compute Krippendorff's alpha to establish whether 0.72-0.76 F1 reflects true consensus or individual interpretation variability.

2. **Prompt complexity validation**: For 20 randomly selected prompts, have 3 domain experts independently rate conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration on 7-point scales. Calculate intraclass correlation coefficients to verify original complexity annotations represent reliable, reproducible assessments.

3. **Rubric augmentation ablation**: Generate LLM-augmented rubrics for 30 prompts using different prompting strategies (zero-shot vs. few-shot, domain-specific constraints vs. open elaboration). Compare alignment with human judgments across conditions to identify whether specific augmentation approaches degrade performance or whether effect is universal.
