# From Deception to Perception: The Surprising Benefits of Deepfakes for Detecting, Measuring, and Mitigating Bias

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.11195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11195
- Authors: Yizhi Liu; Balaji Padmanabhan; Siva Viswanathan
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Deepfakes can detect racial bias in pain assessments, with white subjects rated 10.09-10.90% higher than black subjects, and age bias showing seniors rated 3.33-5.24% higher.

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that deepfake technology can effectively detect and measure bias in facial image-based assessments, particularly for pain evaluation where subjective biases significantly impact outcomes. By generating controlled facial images through GAN-based manipulation, the authors extend traditional correspondence studies beyond textual manipulations to visual domains. Experiments on crowdsourcing platforms revealed significant racial bias (white subjects rated higher than black subjects) and age bias (seniors rated higher than younger subjects) in pain assessments. The methodology shows that averaging labels from manipulated images can improve individual fairness in AI models by 32.96%, suggesting broad applications for fairness and equity in domains like criminal justice, education, and employment.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs StyleFeatureEditor with E4e/StyleCLIP/InterfaceGAN to manipulate facial images, creating four variations per original image: original, race-manipulated (skin tone only), age-manipulated, and race+age-manipulated. Pain assessments are collected via crowdsourcing platforms (AMT and Credamo) using PSPI scoring based on facial action units. The study verifies manipulation quality through deepfake detection, face verification, and landmark preservation checks. Models are trained with four label conditions (Original, Average, Autocorrection, Average+Auto) and evaluated for accuracy and individual fairness using a custom metric measuring prediction differences between original and race-manipulated images.

## Key Results
- Racial bias detected: White subjects rated 10.09% higher than black subjects on AMT, 10.90% on Credamo
- Age bias detected: Senior subjects rated 3.33% higher than young on AMT, 5.24% on Credamo
- Individual fairness improved by 32.96% when using averaged labels from manipulated images
- Autocorrection alone worsened fairness (13.449%) but combined with averaging balanced both accuracy and fairness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Manipulating only skin tone while preserving facial landmarks enables causal isolation of racial bias in visual assessments.
- Mechanism: GAN-based deepfake editing (StyleFeatureEditor + StyleCLIP) modifies the perceived race of a face without altering pain-relevant facial features (action units, landmarks), creating matched pairs that differ only in the sensitive attribute.
- Core assumption: Skin tone manipulation sufficiently changes racial perception without affecting other pain-relevant facial characteristics that might confound bias measurement.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states deepfakes extend correspondence studies beyond textual manipulations; section 3.2 notes careful skin tone manipulation to avoid altering facial features; weak corpus support for bias measurement applications.
- Break condition: If manipulation unintentionally alters facial landmarks or pain-expressive features, observed score differences may reflect confounding rather than bias.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Averaging labels across race-manipulated image pairs reduces individual unfairness in trained AI models by neutralizing race-attributable variance.
- Mechanism: For each original image and its race-manipulated counterpart, compute the mean PSPI score and use this averaged label for both during training, preventing the model from learning race-dependent score patterns.
- Core assumption: The "true" pain level is invariant across race manipulations; differences in human assessments reflect bias rather than actual pain differences.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions 32.96% individual fairness improvement; section 4.4 Table 7 shows improvement from 1.291% to 0.971%; weak corpus support for bias correction via label averaging.
- Break condition: If underlying pain intensity differs across race conditions due to manipulation artifacts, averaging may introduce label noise rather than reduce bias.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Facial landmark preservation verification ensures that manipulation does not inadvertently alter pain-expressive facial geometry.
- Mechanism: Compute average Euclidean distance between facial landmarks (via BlazeFace) for original vs. manipulated pairs; non-significant differences confirm that pain-relevant facial structure is preserved.
- Core assumption: Euclidean distance between landmarks is a sufficient proxy for preservation of pain-expressive features.
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.1 shows no significant difference in facial landmarks between conditions; VGGFace verification confirms AI perceives pairs as same person; weak corpus support for manipulation quality verification.
- Break condition: If landmark preservation does not guarantee action unit preservation, pain intensity could still vary across conditions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Correspondence Studies (Audit Experiments)
  - Why needed here: The paper's methodology extends this classic experimental design from text to images; understanding the baseline paradigm is essential for evaluating the claimed contribution.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why traditional correspondence studies (e.g., resume name manipulation) cannot isolate bias in scenarios where visual cues drive decisions?

- Concept: Action Units (AUs) and PSPI Scoring
  - Why needed here: Pain assessment in this study is operationalized via the Facial Action Coding System; PSPI is the target variable for both human and AI assessors.
  - Quick check question: What is the PSPI formula, and why might different AUs be subject to different bias magnitudes (e.g., AU4 vs. AU6)?

- Concept: Individual Fairness vs. Group Fairness
  - Why needed here: The bias correction evaluation uses individual fairness (prediction difference for the same person across race conditions), not group-level parity metrics.
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts the same average score for Black and White subjects overall but differs for specific individuals across manipulations, which fairness dimension is violated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Layer: 100 original facial images → GAN manipulation pipeline (StyleFeatureEditor + E4e/StyleCLIP/InterfaceGAN) → 400 images (4 variants per original)
  Annotation Layer: Crowdsourced PSPI scoring via AMT (5 assessors/image) and Credamo (3 assessors/image)
  Verification Layer: Deepfake detection (ViT), face verification (VGGFace), landmark preservation (BlazeFace)
  Modeling Layer: ResNet50 trained with 4 label conditions (Original, Average, Autocorrection, Average+Autocorrection)
  Evaluation Layer: MSE/RMSE for accuracy; individual fairness metric (|pred_original - pred_manipulated|)

- Critical path:
  1. Original image selection and preprocessing (grayscale, uniform resolution)
  2. GAN-based manipulation with attribute-specific editing (skin tone via StyleCLIP, age via InterfaceGAN)
  3. Quality verification (deepfake detection pass, landmark distance check)
  4. Crowdsourced annotation collection
  5. Label aggregation and averaging for bias correction conditions
  6. Model training and individual fairness evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Skin tone vs. full race manipulation: Paper manipulates skin tone only to avoid changing facial features, but this may not capture all racial perception cues
  - Individual vs. group fairness: Individual fairness metric enables per-person bias measurement but may not align with group-level equity goals
  - Autocorrection alone vs. combined with averaging: Autocorrection alone improved accuracy but catastrophically worsened fairness; combining with averaging balances both

- Failure signatures:
  - Manipulation quality failure: Deepfake detector flags images as fake; assessors report unnatural appearance
  - Landmark drift: Significant Euclidean distance between original and manipulated landmarks
  - Label noise from biased annotators: If all annotators share the same bias direction, averaging across manipulations helps but averaging across annotators does not
  - Autocorrection backfire: Model learns to heavily weight sensitive features rather than neutralize them

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Manipulation quality validation: Verify deepfake detector does not flag manipulated images, VGGFace identifies pairs as same person, and BlazeFace landmark distances are non-significant
  2. Bias measurement replication: Compute PSPI differences across conditions; verify directional consistency across both platforms
  3. Label averaging ablation: Train models with Original vs. Average labels; measure individual fairness improvement magnitude

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the deepfake-based correspondence methodology be effectively adapted for dynamic video content while maintaining high comparability? The authors explicitly state they are exploring enhancements to apply this approach to videos, noting it involves more sophisticated manipulations.
- Do the detected racial and age biases persist when pain assessments are performed by trained clinical experts rather than crowdworkers? The experiments utilized Amazon Mechanical Turk and Credamo users, whereas the literature review notes that observational scales usually require clinical experts.
- Does the restriction of racial manipulation to skin tone alone limit the generalizability of the measured bias compared to full facial feature manipulation? The methodology section notes a deliberate choice to manipulate only skin tone to avoid altering facial landmarks and pain levels.

## Limitations
- The methodology assumes skin tone manipulation alone sufficiently captures racial perception without confounding facial features
- The averaging approach assumes invariant "true" pain levels across race conditions, which may not hold if manipulation artifacts affect perceived pain intensity
- Lack of corpus support for the bias measurement and correction mechanisms introduces uncertainty about generalizability beyond this specific pain assessment context

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Racial and age bias detection results (consistent directional effects across platforms, proper statistical controls)
- Medium Confidence: Individual fairness improvement via label averaging (controlled ablation shows benefit, but mechanism assumes pain invariance)
- Low Confidence: Generalization to other domains (criminal justice, education, employment) without validation

## Next Checks
1. Compute AU intensity differences between original and manipulated pairs; if significant, pain assessments may reflect manipulation artifacts rather than bias
2. Apply the same methodology to non-pain facial assessment tasks (e.g., emotion recognition) to test whether bias patterns replicate
3. Test whether averaging across annotators (within Original condition) reduces bias; if not, confirms that averaging across manipulations specifically addresses visual bias rather than rater bias
