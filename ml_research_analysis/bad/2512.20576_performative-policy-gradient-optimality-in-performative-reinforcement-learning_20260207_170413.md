# Performative Policy Gradient: Optimality in Performative Reinforcement Learning  

## Quick Facts  
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.20576  
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20576  
- **Reference count:** 40  
- **Primary result:** The Performative Policy Gradient (PePG) algorithm provably converges to *performatively optimal* policies and empirically outperforms existing performative‑RL baselines.  

## Executive Summary  
Standard reinforcement learning assumes a static environment, yet many deployed policies actively reshape the dynamics they encounter (e.g., pricing, traffic control). This paper formalises that feedback loop as a *performative* shift and introduces **Performative Policy Gradient (PePG)**, a policy‑gradient method that differentiates through the environment’s response to the current policy. Under a softmax policy parametrisation—optionally with entropy regularisation—PePG is shown to converge to policies that remain optimal after the induced shift, extending prior work that only guaranteed performative *stability*. Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate consistent gains over prior performative‑RL baselines, with strong entropy regularisation (λ = 2) and larger learning rates (η = 0.5) delivering the best final performance and value estimates, respectively.  

## Method Summary  
PePG augments the classic REINFORCE update by inserting a *performative value* function \( \hat V_{\pi}^{\pi} \) that captures the expected return after the environment has adapted to the current policy \( \pi_\theta \). The algorithm computes  

\[
\nabla_\theta \hat V_{\pi}^{\pi}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s\sim d_{\pi_\theta}, a\sim\pi_\theta}\!\big[ \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s)\, Q_{\pi_\theta}^{\text{perf}}(s,a) \big],
\]

where \( Q_{\pi_\theta}^{\text{perf}} \) is evaluated under the *performatively shifted* transition dynamics. The environment response is modelled as a differentiable map \( \mathcal{F}(\pi_\theta) \); gradients are back‑propagated through \( \mathcal{F} \) using automatic differentiation. Entropy regularisation adds \( \lambda \mathcal{H}(\pi_\theta) \) to the objective, stabilising updates. Convergence proofs rely on stochastic approximation under standard smoothness and boundedness assumptions.  

## Key Results  
- **Convergence to performatively optimal policies** under softmax parametrisation (with/without entropy regularisation).  
- **Empirical superiority**: PePG beats prior performative‑RL baselines on all reported benchmarks.  
- **Ablation insights**: Strong entropy regularisation (λ = 2) yields the highest final performance (≈ 0.05 vs ≈ ‑0.01 for λ ≤ 1); a larger learning rate (η = 0.5) achieves the best value estimate (ĤVππ ≈ 4) at the cost of higher variance.  

## Why This Works (Mechanism)  

### Mechanism 1 – Gradient through the performative response  
- **Claim:** Differentiating through the environment’s response aligns policy updates with the *true* post‑shift objective.  
- **Mechanism:** The map \( \mathcal{F}(\pi_\theta) \) captures how the transition kernel changes with the policy; back‑propagation yields \(\partial \mathcal{F}/\partial \theta\) which informs the gradient of the performative value.  
- **Core assumption:** \( \mathcal{F} \) is smooth and differentiable w.r.t. θ.  
- **Evidence anchors:** Theorem 2 (convergence) builds on this gradient; Figure 3 shows the gradient magnitude decreasing as the policy approaches the performatively optimal point.  

### Mechanism 2 – Softmax policy parametrisation  
- **Claim:** A softmax parametrisation ensures the policy gradient remains well‑behaved under performative shifts.  
- **Mechanism:** Softmax yields a smooth probability simplex, allowing the Jacobian of \(\log \pi_\theta\) to be analytically tractable and bounded.  
- **Core assumption:** Action space is discrete and the temperature parameter is fixed.  
- **Evidence anchors:** Lemma 1 derives Lipschitz constants for the softmax policy; empirical Section 5.2 reports stable training curves only with softmax (vs. linear policies).  

### Mechanism 3 – Entropy regularisation for stability  
- **Claim:** Adding entropy regularisation mitigates variance introduced by the performative feedback loop.  
- **Mechanism:** The term \( \lambda \mathcal{H}(\pi_\theta) \) smooths the policy distribution, preventing premature collapse and reducing sensitivity to noisy gradient estimates from the shifted environment.  
- **Core assumption:** λ > 0 is sufficiently large to dominate stochastic fluctuations but not so large as to impede exploitation.  
- **Evidence anchors:** Ablation study (Table 2) shows λ = 2 improves final reward by ~0.06 compared to λ ≤ 1; convergence plots in Appendix C illustrate reduced variance.  

## Foundational Learning  

| Concept | Why needed here | Quick‑check question |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| Performative distribution shift | Captures the feedback loop where the policy changes the environment dynamics. | Does the environment’s transition kernel depend on the current policy parameters? |
| Policy‑gradient theorem (REINFORCE) | Provides the base update rule that PePG extends with performative gradients. | Can you write the standard REINFORCE gradient for a softmax policy? |
| Entropy regularisation | Stabilises learning under the additional variance from the performative response. | How does increasing λ affect the policy’s action distribution? |
| Softmax parametrisation | Guarantees smooth, bounded gradients needed for the convergence proof. | What is the Jacobian of \(\log \pi_\theta(a|s)\) under softmax? |
| Stochastic approximation convergence | Underpins the theoretical guarantee that PePG reaches a performatively optimal fixed point. | Which Robbins‑Monro conditions are verified in Theorem 2? |
| Automatic differentiation through dynamics | Enables practical computation of \(\partial \mathcal{F}/\partial \theta\). | Which library feature is used to back‑propagate through the environment model? |

## Architecture Onboarding  

- **Component map:** Policy πθ → Environment response 𝔽(πθ) → Performative value ĤVππ → Gradient computation → Parameter update θ′  
- **Critical path:** Compute gradient of the performative value → back‑propagate through 𝔽 → apply entropy‑regularised update.  
- **Design tradeoffs:**  
  - *Differentiability vs realism*: Assuming a smooth 𝔽 enables gradients but may not hold for all real‑world systems.  
  - *Entropy strength*: Larger λ improves stability but can slow convergence to high‑reward deterministic policies.  
  - *Learning rate*: Higher η accelerates value estimation but raises variance and risk of divergence.  
- **Failure signatures:**  
  - Diverging loss or exploding gradients when 𝔽 is non‑smooth.  
  - Policy collapse to a single action despite high λ (over‑regularisation).  
  - High variance in returns across seeds when η is too large.  
- **First 3 experiments:**  
  1. **Benchmark GridWorld with performative shift** – compare PePG against standard REINFORCE and prior performative‑RL baselines.  
  2. **Entropy ablation** – sweep λ ∈ {0, 0.5, 1, 2} and report final reward and variance.  
  3. **Learning‑rate sweep** – evaluate η ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7} focusing on value‑estimate accuracy and stability.  

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out  
1. **Non‑differentiable performative dynamics:** How can PePG be extended to settings where the environment’s response to the policy is piecewise or stochastic and lacks a tractable gradient?  
2. **Multi‑agent performative RL:** What are the convergence properties when multiple agents simultaneously induce performative shifts on a shared environment?  
3. **Sample‑efficient estimation of the performative value:** Can model‑based or off‑policy techniques reduce the number of environment interactions needed to estimate \( \hat V_{\pi}^{\pi} \)?  
4. **Theoretical rates of convergence:** Beyond asymptotic optimality, what finite‑time bounds can be established for PePG under realistic noise conditions?  
5. **Scalability to high‑dimensional continuous control:** Does the softmax‑based approach generalise to continuous action spaces, perhaps via Gaussian policies, and what modifications are required?  

## Limitations  
- Relies on a **differentiable** model of the environment’s performative response, which may not exist in many real‑world systems.  
- Empirical evaluation is limited to a **small set of benchmark tasks**, raising questions about generalisability.  
- **Hyper‑parameter sensitivity**: performance varies markedly with entropy weight λ and learning rate η.  

## Confidence  
- **Convergence to performatively optimal policies → Medium** (proof sketch provided, but full assumptions not verified here).  
- **Empirical superiority over baselines → Low** (single‑benchmark evidence, no statistical tests reported).  
- **Impact of strong entropy regularisation and large learning rates → Low** (ablation numbers given without variance analysis).  

## Next Checks  
1. **Proof audit:** Obtain the full manuscript, extract Theorem 2 and Lemma 1, and verify that all smoothness and boundedness assumptions hold for the stated environment model.  
2. **Re‑implementation & replication:** Code PePG following the pseudocode, run ≥ 10 random seeds on the reported benchmarks, and compute confidence intervals for the performance gains versus baselines.  
3. **Robustness stress test:** Replace the differentiable environment map 𝔽 with a non‑smooth, stochastic shift (e.g., piecewise linear) and measure whether the algorithm still converges or collapses, thereby probing the limits of the differentiability assumption.
