# Generative Artificial Intelligence: Evolving Technology, Growing Societal Impact, and Opportunities for Information Systems Research  

## Quick Facts  
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.05770  
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05770  
- **Reference count:** 18  
- **Primary result:** A sociotechnical framework linking GenAI’s technical properties to organizational, ethical, and societal dimensions, together with a structured IS research agenda.  

## Executive Summary  
The paper addresses the gap in Information Systems (IS) scholarship regarding how generative AI—particularly large‑language‑model (LLM) driven systems—differs from earlier AI waves and what transformative effects it may have on organizations and society. By tracing three decades of AI evolution, mapping parallel IS research milestones, and applying a system‑oriented sociotechnical lens, the authors distill GenAI’s distinctive properties (the shift from symbolic to connectionist paradigms and emergent human‑AI ecosystem dynamics). The resulting conceptual framework links these technical features to organizational, ethical, and societal dimensions and proposes a detailed research roadmap for IS scholars.  

## Method Summary  
The authors performed a narrative literature synthesis covering AI history (symbolic AI → machine learning → deep learning → generative AI) and concurrent IS research trends. They identified key technical milestones (e.g., emergence of LLMs) and aligned them with IS themes such as knowledge management, governance, and theory building. A system‑oriented sociotechnical perspective was then used to abstract GenAI’s unique properties and to construct a theoretical framework that maps technical features to organizational and societal outcomes. No empirical data were collected; the contribution is purely conceptual.  

## Key Results  
- A **sociotechnical framework** that connects GenAI’s connectionist architecture, emergent ecosystem dynamics, and ethical considerations to IS research domains.  
- A **research agenda** outlining priority IS topics (governance, knowledge management, theory development, human‑AI collaboration, ethical/societal impacts).  
- A **historical mapping** of AI paradigm shifts to IS milestones, highlighting the novelty of GenAI relative to prior AI waves.  

## Why This Works (Mechanism)  

### Mechanism 1 – Paradigm Shift Enables Creative Tasks  
- **Claim:** Moving from symbolic (logic‑based) to connectionist (data‑driven) AI allows GenAI to handle unstructured, creative tasks that rule‑based systems could not.  
- **Mechanism:** Deep‑learning models infer patterns from massive, heterogeneous datasets, generating novel text, code, or images rather than merely classifying existing data.  
- **Break condition:** Insufficient data diversity or volume leads to hallucinations and bias, eroding utility.  

### Mechanism 2 – Plausibility Drives Adoption  
- **Claim:** GenAI’s “relatable” contextual understanding, rather than strict logical correctness, fuels user adoption for knowledge‑centric tasks.  
- **Mechanism:** LLMs predict word sequences to produce outputs that appear fluent and context‑aware, satisfying users who value apparent understanding over deterministic accuracy.  
- **Break condition:** When tasks demand strict factual or logical guarantees (e.g., legal compliance), the probabilistic nature of plausibility undermines trust.  

### Mechanism 3 – Sociotechnical Co‑evolution is Required  
- **Claim:** Realizing GenAI’s transformative potential depends on the co‑evolution of technical features and human governance within a human‑AI ecosystem.  
- **Mechanism:** Organizational structures (governance, ethics, workflow design) must adapt to GenAI’s emergent properties; otherwise value capture fails and ethical risks rise.  
- **Break condition:** Lagging governance relative to technical capability can trigger backlash, restriction, or abandonment of the technology.  

## Foundational Learning  

- **Symbolic vs. Connectionist AI**  
  - *Why needed:* Distinguishes GenAI’s novelty from earlier expert‑system approaches.  
  - *Quick check:* Does the system rely on hard‑coded “if‑then” rules (symbolic) or learned weights from data (connectionist)?  

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
  - *Why needed:* Core driver of the current GenAI wave; understanding their probabilistic generation is essential for discussing hallucination and trust.  
  - *Quick check:* Is output produced by statistical next‑word prediction rather than a factual database lookup?  

- **Sociotechnical Systems**  
  - *Why needed:* Frames GenAI as part of a broader human‑AI ecosystem where social structures shape technical outcomes.  
  - *Quick check:* Are you evaluating only algorithmic accuracy, or also the performance of the combined Human + AI workflow?  

- **Emergent Human‑AI Ecosystem Dynamics**  
  - *Why needed:* Captures feedback loops where AI influences user behavior and vice‑versa, a key property highlighted in the paper.  
  - *Quick check:* Does the analysis consider how AI outputs reshape organizational practices and user expectations?  

- **Governance & Ethics Layer**  
  - *Why needed:* Provides the IS‑specific contribution of linking technical features to policy, risk, and societal impact.  
  - *Quick check:* Are ethical guidelines and governance mechanisms integrated into the technology deployment plan?  

## Architecture Onboarding  

**Component map:**  
Input Layer (heterogeneous large‑scale data) → Processing Core (connectionist models: LLMs/Deep Learning) → Interface Layer (relatable outputs: text, code, visuals) → Governance Layer (ethics, governance, human‑AI collaboration protocols)  

**Critical path**  
1. **Identify the Paradigm:** Verify the task requires connectionist flexibility rather than symbolic rigidity.  
2. **Assess Contextual Fit:** Determine if “plausible” generation suffices or if strict factual precision is mandatory.  
3. **Map Sociotechnical Impact:** Analyze how the GenAI deployment reshapes knowledge management, roles, and governance within the organization.  

**Design tradeoffs**  
- *Flexibility vs. Reliability:* Connectionist models yield creative, varied outputs but lack deterministic guarantees of symbolic systems.  
- *Capability vs. Interpretability:* High‑performance LLMs are powerful yet opaque, demanding stronger governance and explainability measures.  

**Failure signatures**  
- **AI‑Winter Stagnation:** Applying GenAI to problems better solved by rule‑based logic leads to poor performance and abandonment.  
- **Blind Adoption:** Deploying tools without addressing ethical, regulatory, or societal impacts triggers backlash or restrictive policies.  

**First 3 experiments**  
1. **Paradigm Audit:** Select an existing organizational process, classify its components as symbolic (rule‑based) or connectionist (pattern‑based), and identify where GenAI could add value.  
2. **Ecosystem Mapping:** For a specific GenAI tool (e.g., GitHub Copilot), diagram the human‑AI ecosystem—highlighting touchpoints for human oversight, feedback loops, and governance controls.  
3. **Risk/Benefit Analysis:** Using the sociotechnical lens, evaluate a GenAI application (e.g., AI‑generated marketing copy) on efficiency gains versus ethical/regulatory risks such as misinformation or bias.  

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out  

1. **Can the historical mapping of AI evolution milestones to IS research trends be replicated using a systematic, pre‑registered search protocol?**  
   - *Resolution:* Conduct a PRISMA‑compliant systematic review to confirm or refine the timeline presented in Figure 1.  

2. **Is the proposed sociotechnical mapping of GenAI properties to IS research topics reliable when operationalized by independent coders?**  
   - *Resolution:* Develop a detailed coding rubric and test inter‑rater reliability (target Cohen’s κ ≥ 0.7) on a sample of GenAI technologies.  

3. **To what extent does a consensus exist among IS experts regarding the relevance and completeness of the proposed GenAI research agenda?**  
   - *Resolution:* Run a Delphi panel with IS scholars and AI practitioners to validate, refine, or extend the agenda’s categories.  

## Limitations  
- No explicit literature‑search protocol; reproducibility of the historical synthesis is uncertain.  
- Sociotechnical mapping lacks operational definitions and a coding scheme, making category assignment subjective.  
- The framework is purely conceptual; causal links between GenAI features and organizational outcomes remain untested.  

## Confidence  
- **Mechanism 1 (connectionist shift enables creative tasks):** **High** – well‑documented in AI histories and corroborated by multiple domain surveys.  
- **Mechanism 2 (plausibility drives adoption):** **Medium** – plausible but largely anecdotal; needs user‑study confirmation.  
- **Mechanism 3 (sociotechnical co‑evolution is required):** **Medium** – aligns with existing IS theory but lacks concrete case validation.  
- **Overall conceptual framework & research agenda:** **Low** – novel synthesis without empirical testing.  

## Next Checks  
1. **Literature‑review replication:** Pre‑register a systematic protocol (databases, Boolean strings, inclusion/exclusion criteria) and compare identified AI and IS milestones with those presented in the paper.  
2. **Coding‑scheme pilot:** Create a detailed rubric for mapping GenAI properties to IS research topics; conduct a pilot with multiple coders and assess inter‑rater reliability (Cohen’s κ ≥ 0.7).  
3. **Expert Delphi panel:** Convene a panel of IS scholars and AI practitioners to evaluate the relevance, completeness, and practical utility of the proposed research agenda, iterating until consensus is reached.
