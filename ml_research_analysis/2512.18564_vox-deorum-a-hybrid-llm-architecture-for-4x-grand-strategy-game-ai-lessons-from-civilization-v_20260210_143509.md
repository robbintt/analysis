# Vox Deorum: A Hybrid LLM Architecture for 4X / Grand Strategy Game AI -- Lessons from Civilization V

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18564
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18564
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Hybrid LLM architecture achieves 92% win rate vs. VPAI baseline, reduces token usage by up to 67% through structured state encoding

## Executive Summary
Vox Deorum demonstrates that separating strategic reasoning from tactical execution enables LLMs to play complex, long-horizon 4X games like Civilization V end-to-end. The architecture delegates macro-strategic decisions to an LLM while using the game's algorithmic AI for tactical execution, reducing inference frequency from hundreds to once per turn. By encoding game state as structured Markdown, the system achieves significant token reduction while maintaining decision quality. The approach shows that hybrid architectures can handle games requiring both abstract reasoning and granular execution better than pure LLM or pure algorithmic approaches.

## Method Summary
The Vox Deorum architecture integrates Civilization V (with Vox Populi mod) with an LLM through a Windows Named Pipe bridge, REST API, and MCP server. The LLM processes structured Markdown game state (victory progress, players, cities, military, events) once per turn and sets strategic parameters (grand strategy, economic/military focus, research, policy, persona) that modify weight vectors in the game's VPAI tactical layer. This reduces LLM call frequency while maintaining coherent gameplay. The system uses specific models (GPT-OSS-120B, GLM-4.6) and runs inference during opponent turns to minimize latency impact on human players.

## Key Results
- 92% win rate against VPAI baseline across 50 games on Tiny map
- Token usage reduced by up to 67% through structured Markdown encoding
- Strategic reasoning quality maintained despite once-per-turn LLM invocation
- Larger models (GLM-4.6) showed no significant win-rate improvement over smaller models (OSS-120B)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Separating strategic reasoning from tactical execution enables LLMs to play complex, long-horizon games end-to-end. LLMs set high-level parameters (grand strategy, research priorities, diplomatic persona) that modify weight vectors in search-based tactical algorithms, reducing LLM call frequency from hundreds per turn to once per turn while maintaining coherent gameplay. This works because LLMs excel at abstract strategic reasoning while algorithmic AI handles tactical execution acceptably when given clear strategic direction. Break condition: If tactical decisions require semantic understanding the algorithm lacks (e.g., interpreting opponent bluff language), the architecture cannot leverage LLM strengths.

### Mechanism 2
Structured Markdown state encoding reduces input token costs without losing decision-relevant information. Game state is serialized into six sections as structured Markdown rather than verbose natural language, achieving up to two-thirds token reduction while maintaining parity with human/VPAI information visibility. This works because LLMs can extract decision-relevant patterns from structured text as effectively as from verbose descriptions. Break condition: If compressed representation hides critical nuance (e.g., subtle diplomatic cues), LLM decisions may degrade.

### Mechanism 3
Timing LLM inference during other players' turns hides latency from human players. LLM activates after its controlled player's turn ends, processing while opponents take turns. Human turns typically take minutes; LLM inference (~14.8s for OSS-120B) completes before the player's next turn begins. This works because opponent turns provide sufficient latency budget for turn-based games. Break condition: In real-time or near-real-time games, this timing strategy fails; architecture is specific to turn-based or long-latency-tolerance domains.

## Foundational Learning

- **4X game structure (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate)**: Understanding that these games have multiple victory conditions (Domination, Science, Cultural, Diplomatic, Time), long horizons (hundreds of turns), and compounding decisions is essential to grasp why pure RL or pure LLM approaches fail. Quick check: Can you name three victory conditions in Civilization V and explain why short-term optimization harms long-term outcomes?

- **Hybrid/cascaded AI architectures**: Vox Deorum's core insight is task decomposition—LLMs for reasoning, algorithmic/RL for execution. Without understanding modularity and interface design between components, the architecture appears arbitrary. Quick check: What type of decisions would you delegate to an LLM vs. a search algorithm in a chess-like game, and what interface would connect them?

- **Context window economics**: Input tokens grow quadratically with game progression (more cities, units, events); output tokens remain linear. Understanding this scaling is critical for cost and feasibility estimation. Quick check: If input tokens double every 50 turns, at what turn would a 128K context window saturate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Game Engine (Civ V + Vox Populi) -> Windows Named Pipe -> REST API -> MCP Server -> MCP Client + LLM Strategist -> VPAI Tactical Layer

- **Critical path**: 1) Implement state serialization to Markdown (victory progress, players, cities, military, events) 2) Define tool interface matching VPAI's strategic knobs (grand strategy, economic/military strategies, research, policy, persona) 3) Write system prompt defining decision scope and tool usage protocol 4) Integrate timing: trigger LLM call at player turn end, apply outputs before next player turn start 5) Run baseline games (LLM vs. VPAI) to validate survival and win rates

- **Design tradeoffs**: Granularity vs. cost (more frequent LLM calls = better responsiveness but higher cost/latency); State detail vs. context window (including full event logs helps reasoning but grows input tokens); LLM control vs. stability (direct diplomatic actions were not exposed to prevent catastrophic misalignment)

- **Failure signatures**: Strategic stubbornness (LLMs changed strategies less frequently than VPAI: OSS-120B 34 vs. 51.6 changes/100 turns; GLM-4.6 13.9); Wishful thinking (LLMs pivoted to "WinningWars" when losing, accelerating defeat); Geopolitical blindness (LLMs failed to recognize spatial relationships despite coordinate access, wasting resources on distant "phony wars"); No model-size advantage (GLM-4.6 showed no significant win-rate improvement over OSS-120B)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline replication: Run 50 games with OSS-120B vs. VPAI on tiny map; confirm survival rate >95% and win rate within ±5% of VPAI 2) Ablation on state encoding: Compare Markdown encoding vs. verbose JSON for 20 games each; measure token usage and win-rate impact 3) Strategy frequency analysis: Log all strategy changes; identify whether "stubbornness" correlates with specific game states (e.g., early war, multiple opponents)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Does incorporating complex workflows or multi-agent collaboration improve strategic coherence and win rates compared to the simple prompting baseline? The study intentionally prioritized simple prompts to establish out-of-the-box capability baselines. A comparison of game outcomes between the baseline implementation and versions utilizing memory modules or multi-agent frameworks would resolve this.

- **Open Question 2**: Can multimodal inputs (e.g., visual mini-maps) significantly reduce irrational geopolitical behaviors caused by text-only spatial reasoning? The current architecture encodes spatial data solely via text coordinates, leading to specific irrationalities like resource waste in "phony wars." An A/B test measuring the frequency of spatial reasoning errors in agents using text inputs versus visual map inputs would resolve this.

- **Open Question 3**: Why did the larger GLM-4.6 model fail to significantly outperform the smaller OSS-120B model in win rates? The paper reports the statistical tie but does not investigate the specific architectural or reasoning limitations that caused the lack of scaling. An ablation study isolating model size and reasoning capabilities on specific strategic sub-tasks (e.g., diplomacy, war planning) would resolve this.

## Limitations

- **Implementation complexity**: The hybrid architecture requires non-trivial integration with the game engine, state serialization, and tool interface development that may not be portable across games or Civ V versions
- **Model accessibility**: The specific OSS-120B model used is not publicly available and may require significant engineering to replicate
- **Generalizability concerns**: The approach depends on games with built-in algorithmic AI subsystems and cannot transfer to games lacking tactical modules or requiring real-time response

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The architectural decomposition concept (LLM for strategy, algorithm for tactics) is well-grounded and performance metrics are clearly reported with statistical comparisons to baseline VPAI
- **Medium confidence**: Token reduction claims are supported by specific numbers, but baseline comparison method isn't fully specified and corpus validation is absent
- **Low confidence**: The claim that larger models don't improve performance contradicts typical LLM scaling patterns, and the explanation for this finding needs more systematic validation

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce the core architecture** on a different Civilization V map size/configuration to verify performance consistency and identify configuration dependencies
2. **Ablation study** comparing different state encoding formats (verbose vs. structured Markdown) to isolate the impact on decision quality and token efficiency
3. **Strategy frequency analysis** logging all LLM strategy changes across multiple games to quantify the "strategic stubbornness" effect and determine whether it correlates with specific game states or represents a systematic bias
