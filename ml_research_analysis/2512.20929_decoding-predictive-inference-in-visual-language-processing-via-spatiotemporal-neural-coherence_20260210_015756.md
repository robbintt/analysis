# Decoding Predictive Inference in Visual Language Processing via Spatiotemporal Neural Coherence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.20929
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20929
- Reference count: 18
- Decodes neural predictive coding in Deaf signers processing visual language with 94.2% accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study investigates predictive coding mechanisms in Deaf signers by combining EEG recordings with optical flow analysis of sign language stimuli. The framework computes frequency-resolved coherence between neural signals and motion features to capture hierarchical predictive dynamics during visual language comprehension. Using entropy-based feature selection and machine learning, the research distinguishes structured linguistic input from unstructured motion with high accuracy and predicts participant age from neural coherence patterns.

## Method Summary
The study employs a multimodal fusion approach combining EEG recordings with optical flow-derived motion features from sign language stimuli. Neural coherence is computed between EEG signals and stimulus motion across multiple frequency bands to capture predictive coding dynamics. Entropy-based feature selection identifies the most informative coherence patterns, which are then classified using machine learning algorithms to discriminate structured versus unstructured visual input and predict participant characteristics.

## Key Results
- 94.2% accuracy in classifying structured versus unstructured visual input
- Age prediction from neural coherence patterns with 85-100 years² MSE (RMSE 9-10 years)
- Experience-dependent neural signatures showing posterior low-frequency coherence increases with age for structured signs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework captures hierarchical predictive dynamics by measuring coherence between neural activity and stimulus motion across frequency bands. Structured visual language creates predictable motion patterns that the brain can model internally, while unstructured motion lacks this predictability. The entropy-based feature selection identifies coherence patterns that maximally discriminate between these conditions, revealing experience-dependent optimization of internal generative models.

## Foundational Learning
- **EEG coherence analysis**: Measures synchronization between neural signals and external stimuli; needed to quantify predictive coding dynamics; quick check: verify frequency-specific coherence patterns match stimulus properties
- **Optical flow computation**: Extracts motion features from video stimuli; needed to quantify visual information available to the predictive system; quick check: confirm optical flow captures meaningful sign language motion
- **Predictive coding framework**: Models how the brain generates predictions about sensory input; needed to interpret coherence patterns as evidence of internal modeling; quick check: ensure coherence increases for predictable versus unpredictable stimuli

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: EEG acquisition -> Optical flow extraction -> Coherence computation -> Feature selection -> Classification
- **Critical path**: Coherence computation between neural signals and stimulus motion is the core mechanism that enables predictive coding detection
- **Design tradeoffs**: Multimodal fusion provides rich information but increases computational complexity; frequency-resolved analysis captures temporal dynamics but requires careful interpretation
- **Failure signatures**: Poor classification accuracy indicates insufficient predictive coding evidence; age prediction errors suggest limited generalizability of neural signatures
- **First experiments**: 1) Verify coherence patterns differ between structured and unstructured motion, 2) Test age prediction model on independent samples, 3) Manipulate stimulus predictability to confirm predictive coding interpretation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Sample specificity to Deaf ASL signers limits generalizability to other populations
- Cross-sectional design prevents causal inferences about developmental changes
- Optical flow methodology may overlook non-motion features important for sign language processing

## Confidence
- High confidence: Structured visual language elicits distinct neural coherence patterns compared to unstructured motion
- Medium confidence: Age prediction from neural coherence patterns is reliable within the studied age range
- Low confidence: Observed neural signatures definitively represent optimized generative models versus compensatory mechanisms

## Next Checks
1. Replication with hearing signers to isolate effects specific to early visual language experience
2. Longitudinal tracking of neural coherence patterns in young signers to establish developmental trajectories
3. Manipulation of sign language stimuli predictability to test whether posterior low-frequency coherence directly indexes predictive coding
