# Refining Financial Consumer Complaints through Multi-Scale Model Interaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.09903
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09903
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Multi-scale model interaction combining classifier and LLM achieves superior refinement of financial consumer complaints compared to single-pass prompting

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of transforming informal financial consumer complaints into formal, persuasive legal arguments. The authors introduce FinDR, a Chinese dataset of financial dispute records with official judgment annotations on claim reasonableness. They propose Multi-Scale Model Interaction (MSMI), a framework that leverages a lightweight classifier to evaluate claim reasonableness and guide a large language model through iterative refinement cycles. The approach significantly outperforms traditional single-pass prompting methods, achieving higher success rates in converting unreasonable claims into reasonable ones while demonstrating improved adversarial robustness across various short-text benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a two-stage approach for refining informal legal texts into formal arguments. First, a lightweight classifier evaluates whether a complaint is reasonable or not based on the FinDR dataset annotations. For unreasonable claims, a large language model iteratively refines the text, with each iteration guided by the classifier's feedback. This multi-scale interaction allows the system to combine the efficiency of the classifier with the sophisticated language capabilities of the LLM, creating a feedback loop that progressively improves the quality of the refined text until it meets the reasonableness criteria.

## Key Results
- MSMI significantly outperforms single-pass prompting strategies in transforming unreasonable financial complaints into reasonable ones
- The method demonstrates improved adversarial robustness across various short-text benchmarks
- The approach validates the effectiveness of multi-model collaboration for legal document generation and broader text refinement tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-scale model interaction works by leveraging complementary strengths of different model types. The lightweight classifier provides fast, efficient evaluation of claim reasonableness without the computational overhead of the LLM, while the LLM handles the complex task of rewriting and refining text. This division of labor allows for rapid iteration and targeted improvements, with the classifier serving as a quality gate that prevents the LLM from producing outputs that don't meet the necessary criteria.

## Foundational Learning
- Financial complaint refinement: Transforming informal consumer complaints into formal legal arguments
  - Why needed: Consumer complaints often lack the structure and precision required for legal proceedings
  - Quick check: Can the system identify and correct informal language patterns?

- Multi-scale model interaction: Combining different model types for complementary tasks
  - Why needed: Single models struggle with both fast evaluation and sophisticated text generation
  - Quick check: Does the classifier-LLM combination outperform single-model approaches?

- Iterative refinement: Using feedback loops to progressively improve text quality
  - Why needed: One-shot generation often fails to produce optimal results for complex transformations
  - Quick check: How many iterations are needed for convergence?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Lightweight classifier -> LLM refinement engine -> Classifier evaluation -> Repeat until convergence
- Critical path: Complaint text → Classifier assessment → LLM refinement (if needed) → Classifier re-evaluation → Output or repeat
- Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs. refinement quality, classifier accuracy vs. LLM capability
- Failure signatures: Classifier misclassification leading to unnecessary iterations, LLM stuck in local minima, convergence failure
- First experiments: 1) Classifier accuracy on FinDR dataset, 2) LLM refinement quality on test samples, 3) End-to-end MSMI performance comparison

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Generalizability concerns beyond Chinese financial complaint domain
- Dependence on quality and representativeness of FinDR dataset annotations
- Computational efficiency and deployment costs of iterative refinement process not addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Multi-model interaction outperforms single-pass prompting for text refinement
- **Medium confidence**: Improved adversarial robustness across short-text benchmarks
- **Low confidence**: Broad potential for legal document generation beyond tested domain

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-lingual experiments to test MSMI's effectiveness on informal-to-formal text refinement tasks in languages other than Chinese
2. Evaluate the framework's performance on legal domains beyond financial complaints, such as housing disputes or employment law
3. Perform a cost-benefit analysis comparing MSMI's iterative refinement approach against single-pass prompting in terms of computational resources and refinement quality
