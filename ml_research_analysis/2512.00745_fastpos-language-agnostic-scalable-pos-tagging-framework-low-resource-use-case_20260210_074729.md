# FastPOS: Language-Agnostic Scalable POS Tagging Framework Low-Resource Use Case

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00745
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00745
- Authors: Md Abdullah Al Kafi; Sumit Kumar Banshal
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Language-agnostic transformer-based POS tagging framework achieving 96.85% and 97% token-level accuracy in Bangla and Hindi

## Executive Summary
FastPOS is a modular transformer-based POS tagging framework designed for rapid adaptation across low-resource languages. By minimizing code modifications and leveraging language-agnostic architecture, it enables researchers to focus on linguistic preprocessing and dataset refinement. The framework demonstrates strong performance in Bangla and Hindi while reducing engineering overhead, making it particularly valuable for advancing NLP in underrepresented languages.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a transformer-based architecture with modular design principles that allow for quick adaptation to different languages through minimal code changes. FastPOS utilizes standard POS tagging methodologies enhanced with transformer capabilities, enabling efficient processing of linguistic features across language boundaries. The approach emphasizes separation of concerns between language-specific preprocessing and model architecture, allowing researchers to focus on dataset quality rather than complex engineering tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 96.85% token-level accuracy in Bangla POS tagging
- Achieves 97% token-level accuracy in Hindi POS tagging
- Maintains robust F1 scores despite dataset imbalance and linguistic overlaps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FastPOS succeeds by combining transformer architecture's strong contextual understanding with a modular framework design that separates language-specific concerns from core modeling components. The language-agnostic approach allows the same underlying architecture to adapt to different linguistic patterns without extensive retraining or architectural modifications. This design philosophy reduces the technical barriers typically associated with POS tagging in low-resource languages, where data scarcity and linguistic complexity often hinder model performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transformer architectures**: Neural network design that captures long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms - needed for understanding complex linguistic relationships across languages; quick check: compare attention weight distributions across different language pairs
- **POS tagging fundamentals**: Process of assigning grammatical categories to words in context - foundational for understanding linguistic structure and evaluation metrics; quick check: verify tagset compatibility across target languages
- **Low-resource NLP challenges**: Data scarcity, linguistic diversity, and limited computational resources - critical context for framework design decisions; quick check: assess dataset size requirements for maintaining performance
- **Modular software architecture**: Design principle separating concerns to enable flexible adaptation - essential for rapid language switching without extensive redevelopment; quick check: measure time required for language adaptation
- **Evaluation metrics for sequence labeling**: Token-level accuracy, F1 scores, and class-wise performance analysis - necessary for proper assessment of POS tagging quality; quick check: validate metric calculations across different evaluation frameworks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Preprocessing -> Transformer Model -> Postprocessing -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Raw text → Linguistic preprocessing → Feature extraction → Transformer encoding → POS prediction → Performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Simplicity vs. performance: Modular design prioritizes ease of adaptation over potential performance gains from language-specific optimizations
- Transformer choice: Balances computational efficiency with contextual understanding capabilities
- Preprocessing emphasis: Shifts burden from model complexity to data quality improvement

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor performance on morphologically rich languages may indicate insufficient preprocessing
- Inconsistent F1 scores across POS categories suggest dataset imbalance or tagset design issues
- High computational requirements could reveal inefficient model scaling

**First Experiments**:
1. Adapt FastPOS to a third low-resource language (e.g., Swahili) and measure adaptation time and accuracy
2. Compare performance against a non-transformer baseline (e.g., BiLSTM) on identical datasets
3. Conduct controlled experiments varying preprocessing quality to quantify its impact on final performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Limited testing across only two low-resource languages restricts generalizability claims
- Performance metrics may be influenced by dataset-specific biases and linguistic structures
- Computational scalability beyond transformer-based models remains unexplored
- Effectiveness heavily dependent on high-quality linguistic preprocessing, which is not systematically quantified

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in framework modularity and ease of adaptation across languages, supported by reproducible case studies
- **Medium confidence** in performance metrics due to potential overfitting to Bangla and Hindi linguistic structures
- **Low confidence** in scalability assertions, as computational benchmarks and cross-linguistic validation remain unexplored

## Next Checks
1. Test FastPOS on morphologically diverse low-resource languages (e.g., Swahili, Quechua) to assess cross-linguistic robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing transformer-based FastPOS against non-transformer architectures (e.g., BiLSTM) to isolate architecture-specific gains
3. Systematically evaluate the impact of preprocessing quality on downstream POS tagging performance through controlled experiments with varying dataset curation standards
