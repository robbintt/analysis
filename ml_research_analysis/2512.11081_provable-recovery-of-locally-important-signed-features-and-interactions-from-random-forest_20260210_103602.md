## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LocalLSSFind, a method for identifying locally important signed features and interactions in Random Forest predictions. The approach combines global and local co-occurrence patterns along decision paths, weighted by depth, to recover the true underlying signed interactions under a Locally Spiky Sparse (LSS) model. Theoretical guarantees prove consistent recovery of local signed interactions and individual features for specific test points.

The method addresses the challenge of interpreting complex Random Forest models at the individual prediction level, offering a statistically grounded solution for local feature and interaction importance. Empirical results show that LocalLSSFind outperforms existing methods like TreeSHAP in identifying locally relevant interactions, particularly in models with single or multiple interactions. Application to the COMPAS dataset demonstrates its ability to provide interpretable insights into individual predictions, highlighting feature interactions and their directionality.

## Method Summary
LocalLSSFind is a post-hoc interpretation method that analyzes Random Forest predictions by examining decision paths in individual trees. The method calculates co-occurrence statistics of feature pairs along paths from root to leaf, weighted by path depth to capture interaction importance. It distinguishes between global co-occurrence patterns (across all trees) and local co-occurrence patterns (for specific test points). The approach uses a depth-weighted counting mechanism to estimate the importance of both individual features and their signed interactions. The method then applies a debiasing step using global co-occurrence statistics to isolate the truly local interactions relevant to each prediction. This produces signed importance scores that indicate both the presence and directionality of feature interactions at the local level.

## Key Results
- LocalLSSFind achieves consistent recovery of signed local interactions under the Locally Spiky Sparse (LSS) model assumptions
- The method outperforms TreeSHAP in identifying locally relevant interactions on synthetic datasets with single and multiple interactions
- Application to COMPAS dataset demonstrates interpretable insights into individual predictions, revealing feature interactions and their directionality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits the structural properties of decision trees in Random Forests, where feature interactions manifest as co-occurring features along decision paths. By analyzing the depth-weighted co-occurrence patterns both globally and locally, LocalLSSFind can distinguish between features that are generally important versus those that interact specifically for certain predictions. The LSS model assumption ensures that the data-generating process has sparse local interactions, making them identifiable from the tree structure. The sign recovery is achieved by tracking the ordering of feature splits along paths, which preserves the directional relationship between interacting features.

## Foundational Learning
- Locally Spiky Sparse (LSS) model: A data-generating process assumption where features interact sparsely and locally. Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for provable recovery of local interactions. Quick check: Verify that the synthetic datasets used in experiments adhere to LSS assumptions.
- Depth-weighted co-occurrence counting: A mechanism to measure feature importance along decision paths. Why needed: Captures the relative importance of features based on their position in the tree hierarchy. Quick check: Compare depth-weighted vs. uniform weighting schemes on synthetic data.
- Global vs. local co-occurrence statistics: The distinction between overall feature patterns and point-specific patterns. Why needed: Enables isolation of truly local interactions from globally important features. Quick check: Validate that global statistics correctly debias local estimates.
- Signed interaction recovery: The ability to determine both presence and directionality of feature interactions. Why needed: Provides interpretable insights into how features influence each other in predictions. Quick check: Verify sign recovery accuracy on synthetic datasets with known interaction directions.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data -> Random Forest -> LocalLSSFind -> Signed Feature Importance Scores

Critical Path: Random Forest prediction generation → Decision path extraction → Depth-weighted co-occurrence counting → Global statistic calculation → Local statistic calculation → Debiasing step → Signed importance scoring

Design Tradeoffs: The method trades computational complexity for interpretability and theoretical guarantees. By analyzing decision paths in detail, it achieves provable recovery but requires processing each tree individually, which can be computationally intensive for large forests.

Failure Signatures: Poor sign recovery accuracy may indicate violation of LSS assumptions or insufficient tree depth. Inconsistent global vs. local statistics could suggest model overfitting or data distribution shifts. High computational time may result from forests with excessive trees or deep decision paths.

3 First Experiments:
1. Test sign recovery accuracy on synthetic datasets with varying levels of noise and interaction sparsity
2. Compare computational time and memory usage across different forest sizes and tree depths
3. Validate robustness by testing on real-world datasets with known feature interactions (e.g., medical diagnosis)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees rely on specific assumptions about the data-generating process (Locally Spiky Sparse model) and decision tree structure that may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Performance claims are based on synthetic datasets, with limited validation on diverse real-world datasets beyond COMPAS
- Computational complexity for large-scale forests and high-dimensional data is not thoroughly characterized

| Claim | Confidence Level |

| Theoretical framework and proof methodology | High |
| Empirical performance claims | Medium |
| Practical applicability for complex real-world scenarios | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on additional real-world datasets with known feature interactions to validate robustness across different domains
2. Evaluate the computational efficiency and scalability for large Random Forest ensembles with thousands of trees
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on tree construction parameters (e.g., max depth, minimum samples per leaf) to assess impact on sign recovery accuracy
