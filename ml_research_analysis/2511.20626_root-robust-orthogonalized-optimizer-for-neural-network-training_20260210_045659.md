core_contribution: ROOT addresses the fragility of orthogonalized optimizers in large-scale
  language model training, where fixed-coefficient Newton-Schulz iterations show inconsistent
  orthogonalization quality across matrix dimensions and are vulnerable to outlier-induced
  gradient noise. The proposed solution employs dimension-robust orthogonalization
  using adaptive Newton-Schulz iterations with fine-grained, dimension-specific coefficients,
  and optimization robustness via proximal optimization with soft-thresholding to
  suppress outliers.

# ROOT: Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer for Neural Network Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20626
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20626
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: ROOT achieves 0.01 lower training loss than Muon on 1B transformer pre-training and improves CIFAR-10 accuracy from 84.67% to 86.58%

## Executive Summary
ROOT addresses the fragility of orthogonalized optimizers in large-scale language model training, where fixed-coefficient Newton-Schulz iterations show inconsistent orthogonalization quality across matrix dimensions and are vulnerable to outlier-induced gradient noise. The proposed solution employs dimension-robust orthogonalization using adaptive Newton-Schulz iterations with fine-grained, dimension-specific coefficients, and optimization robustness via proximal optimization with soft-thresholding to suppress outliers. Experiments on 1B transformer pre-training demonstrate ROOT achieves a final training loss of 2.5407, outperforming Muon by 0.01. Across 8 academic benchmarks, ROOT achieves an average score of 60.12 versus Muon's 59.59. On CIFAR-10 vision tasks, ROOT improves accuracy from 84.67% to 86.58%.

## Method Summary
ROOT introduces dimension-robust orthogonalization through adaptive Newton-Schulz iterations that dynamically adjust coefficients based on matrix dimensions, addressing the inconsistency issues of fixed-coefficient approaches. The optimizer incorporates proximal optimization with soft-thresholding to identify and suppress outlier gradients, enhancing stability in noisy training environments. This combination provides theoretical guarantees for consistent orthogonalization across diverse matrix shapes while maintaining robust convergence properties. The method is specifically designed to overcome the fragility of existing orthogonalized optimizers when applied to large-scale language models and other neural network architectures.

## Key Results
- Achieves final training loss of 2.5407 on 1B transformer pre-training, outperforming Muon by 0.01
- Average score of 60.12 across 8 academic benchmarks versus Muon's 59.59
- Improves CIFAR-10 accuracy from 84.67% to 86.58%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ROOT's effectiveness stems from addressing two fundamental weaknesses in orthogonalized optimizers: inconsistent orthogonalization quality across different matrix dimensions and vulnerability to outlier-induced gradient noise. The adaptive Newton-Schulz iterations with dimension-specific coefficients ensure reliable orthogonalization regardless of matrix shape, while the proximal optimization with soft-thresholding mechanism effectively identifies and suppresses problematic gradient outliers. This dual approach maintains the benefits of orthogonalization (improved training stability and convergence) while eliminating the primary sources of fragility in real-world training scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- Newton-Schulz iterations: Iterative method for matrix orthogonalization; needed for maintaining gradient orthogonality during training; quick check: verify convergence rate for different matrix dimensions
- Proximal optimization: Framework for handling non-smooth regularization; needed for outlier suppression; quick check: confirm soft-thresholding correctly identifies gradient outliers
- Orthogonalized optimizers: Maintain orthogonality of gradient updates; needed for improved training stability; quick check: measure orthogonality preservation across training steps
- Soft-thresholding: Non-linear operation for sparsity; needed for gradient noise suppression; quick check: validate threshold selection criteria
- Dimension-specific coefficients: Adaptive parameters for orthogonalization; needed for consistent performance across matrix shapes; quick check: verify coefficient adaptation works for extreme dimensions
- Matrix orthogonalization: Process of making matrices orthogonal; needed for stable gradient updates; quick check: confirm orthogonalization quality metrics

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Gradient computation -> Adaptive Newton-Schulz orthogonalization -> Proximal optimization with soft-thresholding -> Parameter update
Critical path: The orthogonalization step is critical as it directly affects gradient quality and subsequent training stability
Design tradeoffs: Balances computational overhead of adaptive orthogonalization against training stability gains; prioritizes robustness over raw speed
Failure signatures: Poor orthogonalization quality manifests as training instability; ineffective outlier suppression shows as gradient explosions
First experiments: 1) Test orthogonalization quality across matrix dimensions 2) Measure outlier detection accuracy 3) Compare training stability with and without proximal optimization

## Limitations
- Scalability evaluation limited to 1B parameter models only

## Next Checks
1. Conduct scaling experiments on models ranging from 100M to 10B parameters to verify dimension-robustness claims across multiple orders of magnitude
2. Perform comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of adaptive coefficients versus proximal optimization on final performance
3. Measure and report wall-clock training time overhead compared to standard optimizers across different hardware configurations to assess practical deployment viability
