# Beyond the Singular: Revealing the Value of Multiple Generations in Benchmark Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.08943
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08943
- Reference count: 24
- One-line primary result: Multiple generations per prompt significantly reduce variance and improve LLM benchmark score estimation while enabling detection of problematic prompts

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental limitation of current LLM benchmark evaluations that rely on single generations, which ignore inherent model randomness and lead to unreliable score estimates. The authors propose a hierarchical statistical model where prompt difficulty is treated as a latent variable drawn from a distribution, with generation correctness following a Bernoulli process conditioned on this difficulty. Using multiple generations per prompt enables more accurate estimation of benchmark scores by reducing within-prompt variance. The method introduces P(correct) as a prompt-level difficulty metric derived from correct ratios across generations. Experiments with four LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B/70B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Ministral 8B) on four benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GSM8K, IFEval, MuSR) demonstrate that multiple generations reduce variance and improve score estimation.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a hierarchical statistical model for LLM benchmark evaluation that treats prompt difficulty as a latent variable drawn from a distribution, with generation correctness following a Bernoulli process conditioned on this difficulty. This framework enables the introduction of P(correct) as a prompt-level difficulty metric derived from correct ratios across multiple generations. By generating multiple responses per prompt, the method reduces within-prompt variance and provides more accurate score estimation. The approach was evaluated across four LLMs and four benchmarks, demonstrating improved variance reduction and the ability to detect problematic prompts through combination with semantic consistency metrics.

## Key Results
- Multiple generations per prompt reduce variance and improve score estimation accuracy compared to single-generation evaluations
- The P(correct) metric effectively captures prompt difficulty distributions, showing diffuse patterns for challenging reasoning tasks and stable distributions for easier tasks
- Case study on GSM8K demonstrates the ability to detect mislabeled or ambiguous prompts by combining P(correct) with semantic consistency metrics
- Models exhibit random sampler behavior on difficult reasoning tasks, revealing limitations in current LLM capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hierarchical statistical framework treats prompt difficulty as a latent variable, allowing multiple generations to provide more robust estimates of true model performance. By reducing the impact of stochastic generation noise through aggregation across multiple samples, the method captures the underlying probability of correctness for each prompt. This approach reveals that single-generation evaluations can significantly misrepresent true model capabilities due to the inherent randomness in LLM outputs.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Hierarchical statistical modeling** - why needed: To account for latent prompt difficulty that affects generation correctness
   quick check: Does the model properly capture variance reduction across multiple generations?
   
2. **Bernoulli process conditioning** - why needed: To model the binary nature of generation correctness given prompt difficulty
   quick check: Are the conditional probabilities correctly estimated from multiple generations?
   
3. **P(correct) metric derivation** - why needed: To quantify prompt difficulty at the individual prompt level
   quick check: Does P(correct) correlate with human-perceived prompt difficulty?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Hierarchical Model -> P(correct) Calculation -> Score Estimation -> Problem Prompt Detection

**Critical Path:**
Multiple Generations → Correctness Aggregation → P(correct) Computation → Benchmark Score Estimation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Multiple generations improve accuracy but increase computational cost
- Hierarchical modeling adds statistical rigor but requires more complex implementation
- P(correct) provides granular insights but depends on sufficient generation samples per prompt

**Failure Signatures:**
- Insufficient generations leading to unstable P(correct) estimates
- Heterogeneous benchmarks violating the common difficulty distribution assumption
- Semantic consistency metrics failing to detect genuinely ambiguous prompts

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Compare single vs. multiple generation variance across different benchmark types
2. Validate P(correct) correlation with human-annotated prompt difficulty rankings
3. Test problem prompt detection accuracy on benchmarks with known annotation errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Computational cost increases substantially with multiple generations, though trade-offs aren't explicitly quantified
- The assumption of a common difficulty distribution across heterogeneous benchmarks may not hold
- Semantic consistency metric methodology is not detailed, making reliability assessment difficult
- Limited validation of whether P(correct) accurately reflects true prompt difficulty across different contexts

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The statistical framework for treating prompt difficulty as latent is methodologically sound

**Medium confidence:** Empirical results showing variance reduction and problematic prompt detection are convincing but limited to specific benchmarks

**Medium confidence:** The random sampler observation for difficult tasks is supported but could benefit from broader task coverage

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing single vs. multiple generation evaluations across a wider range of benchmarks to quantify the trade-off between computational cost and score estimation accuracy

2. Validate the P(correct) metric's ability to predict model performance on unseen prompts from the same benchmark to test its generalizability

3. Apply the semantic consistency metric to additional benchmarks and manually verify whether detected problematic prompts align with human judgments of ambiguity or incorrect ground truth
