# OpenMMReasoner: Pushing the Frontiers for Multimodal Reasoning with an Open and General Recipe

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16334
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16334
- Reference count: 40
- Key result: OpenMMReasoner achieves 11.6% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct on nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks

## Executive Summary
OpenMMReasoner introduces a fully transparent, two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning—comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)—to address the reproducibility gap in training large multimodal reasoning models. The SFT stage builds a high-quality, 874K-sample cold-start dataset with step-by-step validation, while the RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset to sharpen and stabilize reasoning abilities using GSPO. Extensive evaluations show OpenMMReasoner achieves an 11.6% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct on nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while also demonstrating strong reasoning efficiency and cross-domain generalization. All data, code, and pipeline are fully open-sourced.

## Method Summary
OpenMMReasoner employs a two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a carefully curated 874K-sample dataset to establish foundational reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) using a 74K-sample dataset to refine and stabilize reasoning performance. The SFT stage emphasizes step-by-step validation to ensure high-quality training data, while the RL stage utilizes GSPO (a reinforcement learning algorithm) to further enhance reasoning accuracy. The framework is fully open-sourced, including datasets, code, and training pipeline, promoting transparency and reproducibility in multimodal reasoning research.

## Key Results
- OpenMMReasoner achieves an 11.6% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct on nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks.
- The model demonstrates strong reasoning efficiency and cross-domain generalization.
- All data, code, and pipeline are fully open-sourced, addressing reproducibility gaps in the field.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OpenMMReasoner's success stems from its two-stage training approach, which combines the stability of supervised fine-tuning with the adaptability of reinforcement learning. The SFT stage ensures a robust foundation by training on a large, high-quality dataset with rigorous validation, while the RL stage fine-tunes reasoning abilities using GSPO, a method that optimizes for sequential decision-making. This combination allows the model to not only learn from diverse examples but also improve its reasoning strategies through iterative feedback. The open-sourcing of all components further ensures that the methodology can be transparently evaluated and extended by the research community.

## Foundational Learning
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Why needed—establishes foundational reasoning skills; Quick check—validate dataset quality and step-by-step validation process.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Why needed—refines and stabilizes reasoning through iterative feedback; Quick check—assess RL dataset size and GSPO effectiveness.
- **Multimodal Reasoning**: Why needed—enables reasoning across diverse data types; Quick check—evaluate cross-domain generalization performance.
- **Dataset Curation**: Why needed—ensures high-quality training data; Quick check—inspect cold-start dataset composition and validation criteria.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: SFT Dataset -> SFT Training -> RL Dataset -> RL Training -> OpenMMReasoner Model
- **Critical Path**: SFT (874K samples) -> RL (74K samples) -> GSPO Optimization
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Large SFT dataset ensures broad coverage but increases training time; RL fine-tuning improves accuracy but requires careful reward design.
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor cross-domain generalization may indicate insufficient diversity in SFT dataset; instability in RL could result from suboptimal reward shaping.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Replicate SFT training pipeline independently; 2) Test RL effectiveness on a subset of the RL dataset; 3) Evaluate model performance on a new multimodal reasoning benchmark.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The 11.6% improvement may be influenced by factors beyond the SFT+RL recipe, such as model initialization or training infrastructure differences.
- The effectiveness of GSPO for RL is innovative but not fully validated across different domains or model sizes.
- Potential biases or ethical concerns in the training data are not addressed.

## Confidence
- **High**: Open-sourcing of data, code, and pipeline; reported benchmark improvements.
- **Medium**: Effectiveness of SFT+RL recipe for multimodal reasoning (needs independent replication).
- **Low**: Claims about reasoning efficiency and cross-domain generalization (limited validation beyond reported benchmarks).

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the SFT and RL training pipeline independently to verify the 11.6% improvement and assess reproducibility.
2. Test the model on additional multimodal reasoning benchmarks not included in the original study to evaluate generalization.
3. Conduct a detailed analysis of the training data for potential biases or ethical concerns, and assess the model's robustness to domain shifts.
