# Developing an Open Conversational Speech Corpus for the Isan Language

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.21229
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21229
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Key outcome:** First open conversational speech dataset for Isan language with 41 hours of audio capturing authentic linguistic phenomena

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural conversational speech, capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquialisms, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with Central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan, leading to significant variability in writing practices due to differences in lexical tones between Thai and Isan. To address these issues, the authors established practical transcription protocols that balance representational accuracy with computational processing requirements. The dataset is released as an open resource to support research on underrepresented languages and to provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a 41-hour conversational speech corpus for Isan by designing naturalistic stimuli (images, open-ended questions) to elicit spontaneous speech from speakers in 6-tone dialect regions. They established a spelling standard using Gedney's tone box to map Thai orthography to Isan tonemes, and applied correspondence-based rules to handle systematic sound changes between Thai and Isan. A phonetic dictionary with C(C)V(V)(C)T syllable structure was created following Thai phonological constraints but adapted for Isan features. The corpus includes Thai-script transcriptions, IPA phonetic transcriptions, and metadata on speaker origin and gender. The dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face.

## Key Results
- 41 hours of conversational Isan speech collected using naturalistic elicitation methods
- Novel spelling standard established using tone-box framework and correspondence rules
- First open resource for modeling spontaneous speech in a Thai regional language
- Phonetic dictionary aligned with Thai processing tools while capturing Isan phonology

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Naturalistic stimulus design elicits authentic conversational phenomena absent from read-speech corpora.
- **Mechanism:** By presenting open-ended prompts (images, situation-based questions) with Isan-orthography instructions, speakers access intuitions rather than translating from Central Thai, producing spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and code-switching.
- **Core assumption:** Speakers' natural production reflects genuine dialectal patterns; translation-based stimuli suppress dialect-specific vocabulary and grammar.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching"
  - [section 4.1] Describes two design principles: naturalness (avoiding Central Thai influence) and diversity (open-ended responses); uses visual stimuli like "som tam" image to avoid priming Central Thai term
  - [corpus] LOTUSDIS corpus (Thai far-field meeting data) confirms conversational speech capture requires unscripted elicitation methods

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The tone-box framework enables consistent orthographic decisions for a language without standardized spelling.
- **Mechanism:** Gedney's tone box maps initial consonant class × tone mark → toneme (T1-T6). By identifying which cell a word's tone occupies, transcribers select valid spelling combinations systematically rather than ad-hoc.
- **Core assumption:** Isan 6-tone system follows productive tonal rules paralleling Thai orthographic conventions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2] Detailed tone-box tables for Isan showing T1-T6 assignments; explicitly states "ผู้พูดอีสานจะออกเสียงคำที่ต้องการสะกด แล้วจึงเทียบเคียงเสียงวรรณยุกต์"
  - [section 4.2.4.1] Spelling examples using tone-box: "ข้อย" (T5) determined by comparing pronunciation to tone-box reference words
  - [corpus] No directly comparable corpus evidence for tone-box transcription methodology; this is a novel contribution

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Correspondence-based spelling rules balance phonetic accuracy with user familiarity.
- **Mechanism:** Survey Isan speakers on acceptance of phonetic vs. Central-Thai spellings for systematic sound correspondences (e.g., /r/→/h/, /ch/→/s/). Assign spellings based on majority preference per correspondence category.
- **Core assumption:** Familiar spellings improve corpus usability despite phonetic divergence; speakers tolerate some inconsistency across word categories.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.2.3] Two correspondence categories: Category 1 (spell phonetically: ช้าง→ซ้าง, รัก→ฮัก), Category 2 (spell per Central Thai: ฉีก→ฉีก not สีก)
  - [tables 5-6] Examples of both categories with explicit acceptance-criteria justification
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support—no cited precedent for correspondence-based orthography design in low-resource languages

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Tone-box (Gedney box) for Tai languages**
  - Why needed here: Without understanding how initial consonant class + tone mark determines toneme, the spelling protocol appears arbitrary.
  - Quick check question: Given a high-class initial with mai tho, which Isan tone (T1-T6) results?

- **Concept: Sound correspondence (diachronic phonology)**
  - Why needed here: Spelling decisions depend on whether a word reflects systematic Isan-Thai sound changes vs. loanwords retaining Thai forms.
  - Quick check question: If Central Thai has /r/ but Isan has /h/ systematically, should "รัก" be spelled "ฮัก"?

- **Concept: Spontaneous speech phenomena (disfluency, code-switching, prosody)**
  - Why needed here: ASR models trained on read speech fail on conversational data; understanding what's captured informs model selection.
  - Quick check question: Name three acoustic-linguistic features present in conversational speech but absent from read speech.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Audio data -> 41 hours conversational Isan (6-tone dialect region speakers)
  - Transcription layer -> Thai-script orthography (custom spelling standard)
  - Phonetic dictionary -> IPA transcription (grapheme-to-phoneme aligned with PyThaiNLP)
  - Metadata -> speaker origin, gender, stimulus type
  - ASR cleaning pipeline -> planned out-of-domain removal (not yet implemented)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Verify audio is from 6-tone dialect regions (check speaker metadata against section 3.1 map)
  2. Apply spelling standard consistently (tone-box lookup + correspondence category)
  3. Generate IPA dictionary entries following phonological constraints (no /r/, simplified clusters per section 4.4)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Phonetic accuracy vs. user familiarity: Some spellings use Thai forms despite divergent pronunciation (Category 2 correspondences)
  - Consistency vs. coverage: Dictionary limited to root words (คำมูล); compounds require decomposition
  - Naturalism vs. control: Open-ended stimuli yield authentic speech but variable lexical coverage

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Inconsistent tone-mark usage suggests tone-box misapplication
  - Speaker code-switches heavily to Central Thai → stimulus may have primed wrong register
  - IPA transcription contains /r/ or complex clusters → phonological constraint violation

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Benchmark ASR on held-out Isan conversations; compare word-error-rate for phonetic vs. familiarity-based spellings
  2. Validate tone-box consistency: Have two transcribers independently spell novel Isan words; measure agreement
  3. Test phonological constraint coverage: Run PyThaiNLP G2P on corpus vocabulary; flag unmappable outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent are the established spelling guidelines for sound correspondences and loanwords familiar and acceptable to the broader Isan-speaking population?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 states future work should investigate if spelling loan words according to Central Thai standards is familiar in all cases and if other correspondence cases exist.
- Why unresolved: The current guidelines balance linguistic accuracy with perceived familiarity but rely on limited surveys; complex cases like proper names remain variable.
- What evidence would resolve it: Large-scale user studies or preference surveys targeting diverse Isan speakers evaluating specific controversial spelling forms (e.g., loan words, proper names).

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the preferred transcription format for Isan speakers when spoken words, particularly English loanwords, allow for multiple representations (e.g., Latin script vs. phonetic Thai spelling)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.3 notes the lack of clear guidelines for Latin vs. Thai script for loanwords and suggests surveying user preferences.
- Why unresolved: The current dataset requires transcribers to interpret ambiguous cases (e.g., "QR Code" vs. "คิวอาร์โค้ด"), leading to potential inconsistency without clear user demand data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A quantitative analysis of user preferences or qualitative feedback from Isan speakers comparing text output variants for loanwords.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the defined phoneme inventory, particularly regarding allophones and variants, need to be adjusted to accurately represent the pronunciation trends of different Isan speaker subgroups?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.4 suggests future work can adapt the phoneme inventory and allophonic rules if distinct speaker groups show different pronunciation tendencies.
- Why unresolved: The current dictionary relies on a standard "majority" pronunciation, which may mask significant variations (e.g., new generation accents, specific regional consonant shifts).
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of ASR error rates on underrepresented accents or sociolinguistic field studies comparing the defined inventory against actual production in the dataset.

## Limitations
- Corpus size (41 hours) is notably smaller than many other regional language datasets
- ASR-based filtering method for out-of-domain audio mentioned as future plan but not yet implemented
- Spelling standard may not fully capture all orthographic variations speakers use in practice
- Dataset focuses specifically on 6-tone dialect region, potentially excluding other Isan varieties

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The methodology for creating naturalistic stimuli to elicit authentic conversational speech (Mechanism 1) is well-established in corpus linguistics and the implementation details are clearly described.
- **Medium confidence**: The tone-box framework for spelling standardization (Mechanism 2) is theoretically sound but represents a novel application to Isan that requires empirical validation for consistency across transcribers.
- **Medium confidence**: The correspondence-based spelling rules (Mechanism 3) balance competing priorities pragmatically but lack precedent in low-resource language documentation and may face challenges with edge cases.

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark ASR performance on the Isan conversational corpus using both phonetic and familiarity-based spellings to quantify the impact of orthographic choices on recognition accuracy.
2. Conduct inter-annotator agreement testing using the tone-box methodology with novel Isan words to measure transcription consistency across different transcribers.
3. Evaluate the phonological constraint coverage by running PyThaiNLP's grapheme-to-phoneme conversion on the complete corpus vocabulary and analyzing the proportion of words that cannot be mapped.
