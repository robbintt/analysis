# A Comprehensive Evaluation on Quantization Techniques for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17417
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17417

- Key outcome: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of post-training quantization techniques for large language models (LLMs), focusing on W4A4 precision. The authors systematically decompose quantization into two key steps: pre-quantization transformation (e.g., scaling and rotation) and quantization error mitigation (e.g., GPTQ and low-rank compensation). Their extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures reveal that optimized rotation and scaling yield the best pre-quantization performance, and combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ alone. They also demonstrate that finer granularity improves performance but increases storage overhead, and that asymmetric quantization for activations provides significantly better results than symmetric quantization. The study extends to FP4 formats (MXFP4 and NVFP4), finding that while FP4 handles long-tail distributions better than INT4, rotation-based pre-quantization methods show limited improvement for these formats. The work provides valuable insights for practitioners and establishes a foundation for further research in low-bit LLM quantization.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a systematic evaluation of post-training quantization techniques for large language models, with a focus on W4A4 precision. The authors decompose the quantization process into pre-quantization transformations (scaling and rotation) and quantization error mitigation (GPTQ and low-rank compensation), conducting extensive experiments across multiple model architectures. Their findings reveal that optimized rotation and scaling yield the best pre-quantization performance, while combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ alone. The study also demonstrates that finer granularity improves accuracy at the cost of increased storage overhead, and that asymmetric quantization for activations significantly outperforms symmetric approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper systematically evaluates post-training quantization techniques for LLMs by decomposing the process into two key steps: pre-quantization transformations and quantization error mitigation. Pre-quantization transformations include scaling (rescaling weight distributions) and rotation (rotating weight distributions in high-dimensional space) to better fit quantization boundaries. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques like GPTQ (gradient-aware weight quantization) and low-rank compensation to reduce quantization artifacts. The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple model architectures (OPT, LLaMA, Bloom) at W4A4 precision, systematically varying parameters like granularity and quantization type. They also extend their evaluation to FP4 formats (MXFP4 and NVFP4) to assess performance on long-tail distributions. The evaluation framework allows for controlled isolation of each technique's contribution to overall quantization quality.

## Key Results
- Optimized rotation and scaling pre-quantization transformations yield the best performance across multiple LLM architectures
- Combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ alone, though results are inconsistent
- Asymmetric quantization for activations provides significantly better results than symmetric quantization
- Finer granularity improves performance but increases storage overhead
- FP4 formats handle long-tail distributions better than INT4, but rotation-based pre-quantization shows limited improvement for FP4

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of the proposed quantization techniques stems from their ability to better align the weight distribution with quantization boundaries before the actual quantization step. Pre-quantization transformations like scaling and rotation reshape the weight distribution to maximize the utilization of available quantization levels, reducing the quantization error introduced when mapping continuous weights to discrete levels. GPTQ's gradient-aware approach minimizes the impact on model performance by considering the downstream effects of quantization during the weight selection process. Low-rank compensation helps preserve important weight structures that might be lost during quantization. The asymmetric quantization for activations better captures the non-symmetric distribution of activation values, which is particularly important for maintaining model expressiveness after quantization.

## Foundational Learning
**Weight Quantization Fundamentals**
*Why needed*: Understanding how continuous weights are mapped to discrete values is essential for grasping quantization trade-offs
*Quick check*: Verify that quantized weights use fewer bits than original floating-point weights

**Pre-quantization Transformations**
*Why needed*: These techniques prepare weight distributions for more efficient quantization
*Quick check*: Confirm that scaling adjusts weight magnitude while rotation changes their directional distribution

**Quantization Error Mitigation**
*Why needed*: These methods reduce the performance degradation caused by information loss during quantization
*Quick check*: Ensure that error mitigation techniques preserve important weight patterns

**Granularity in Quantization**
*Why needed*: Determines whether different weight groups use different quantization parameters
*Quick check*: Verify that per-channel quantization provides finer granularity than per-tensor

**Asymmetric vs Symmetric Quantization**
*Why needed*: Different approaches to mapping weight distributions to quantization levels
*Quick check*: Confirm that asymmetric quantization handles non-zero-centered distributions better

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Pre-Processing -> Pre-Quantization Transformation (Scaling/Rotation) -> Quantization (GPTQ/Low-Rank) -> Post-Processing

**Critical Path**
The most critical sequence is: Pre-Quantization Transformation → Quantization Error Mitigation → Final Weight Mapping, as this determines the ultimate quality of quantized weights.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The primary tradeoff is between quantization precision (bit-width) and model accuracy, with storage/compute efficiency on the other side. Finer granularity improves accuracy but increases storage overhead. Asymmetric quantization improves accuracy but requires additional computational overhead for dynamic range calculation.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor quantization manifests as: significant accuracy degradation on downstream tasks, increased perplexity in language models, loss of rare token handling capability, and instability in long-sequence generation.

**First Experiments**
1. Apply scaling pre-quantization to a small LLM and measure perplexity improvement
2. Compare asymmetric vs symmetric activation quantization on a single layer
3. Test GPTQ with and without low-rank compensation on a reduced model size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- The evaluation focuses primarily on W4A4 quantization with limited exploration of extreme low-bit formats
- Experimental scope is constrained to specific model architectures and datasets, potentially limiting generalizability
- Does not extensively address quantization robustness under domain shift or distribution changes in real-world deployment

## Confidence

**Major Claims and Confidence Levels:**

*Pre-quantization transformations (scaling/rotation) effectiveness*: **High confidence** - The experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance of optimized rotation and scaling across multiple model architectures, with statistically significant improvements over baseline quantization methods.

*Low-rank compensation with GPTQ*: **Medium confidence** - While the study shows occasional performance gains when combining these methods, the results are inconsistent across different models and tasks, suggesting the benefit may be context-dependent.

*Granularity-performance tradeoff*: **High confidence** - The relationship between finer granularity and improved accuracy, balanced against increased storage overhead, is well-established through systematic experiments across multiple models.

*Activation quantization asymmetry*: **High confidence** - The significant performance difference between asymmetric and symmetric activation quantization is consistently observed across experiments and model types.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-architecture generalization test**: Validate the pre-quantization transformation findings on additional LLM architectures (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) and vision-language models to confirm the robustness of scaling and rotation techniques across diverse model families.

2. **Long-tail distribution analysis**: Conduct systematic experiments isolating the impact of rotation-based methods on FP4 quantization when handling extreme long-tail distributions, using controlled synthetic datasets to better understand when these techniques succeed or fail.

3. **Domain adaptation robustness**: Evaluate quantization performance under domain shift by testing quantized models on out-of-distribution data, measuring degradation patterns and identifying which pre-quantization methods provide the most robust performance across domain boundaries.
