# FedPM: Federated Learning Using Second-order Optimization with Preconditioned Mixing of Local Parameters

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09100
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09100
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FedPM leverages second-order optimization with preconditioned mixing of local parameters, achieving superlinear convergence for strongly convex objectives and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both convergence speed and test accuracy across heterogeneous federated learning settings.

## Executive Summary
FedPM introduces a novel federated learning approach that addresses the limitations of conventional second-order parameter mixing (SOPM) by incorporating curvature information through preconditioned mixing at the server. Unlike traditional methods that simply average local parameters, FedPM constructs a preconditioning matrix from server-side gradient and Hessian information to mitigate drift in local preconditioners and enhance convergence, particularly in heterogeneous data scenarios. The method demonstrates both theoretical rigor with a proven superlinear convergence rate for strongly convex objectives and practical effectiveness across various experimental settings, from convex models to deep neural networks on CIFAR datasets.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes FedPM, a federated learning method that leverages second-order optimization by using preconditioned mixing of local parameters. Unlike conventional SOPM methods that simply mix local parameters, FedPM incorporates curvature information through preconditioned mixing on the server, mitigating drift in local preconditioners and improving convergence, especially in heterogeneous data settings. Theoretical analysis demonstrates a superlinear convergence rate for strongly convex objectives under single local update. Extensive experiments on strongly convex models and non-convex DNNs (CIFAR10, CIFAR100) show FedPM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art first- and second-order methods in convergence speed and test accuracy, with notable robustness in highly heterogeneous settings. An efficient FOOF approximation enables practical application to large-scale models.

## Key Results
- FedPM achieves superlinear convergence rate for strongly convex objectives under single local update, outperforming conventional first-order methods
- Extensive experiments show FedPM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art first- and second-order methods in convergence speed and test accuracy across CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets
- FedPM demonstrates notable robustness in highly heterogeneous federated learning settings where other methods struggle

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FedPM addresses a fundamental challenge in federated learning: local updates with heterogeneous data cause parameter drift that degrades convergence. Traditional second-order optimization methods (SOPM) attempt to correct this by mixing local parameters, but they suffer from drift in local preconditioners due to varying local curvature. FedPM solves this by constructing a preconditioning matrix on the server using full-batch gradient and Hessian information, which captures the global curvature of the objective function. This preconditioned mixing effectively aligns local updates with the global optimization landscape, preventing the accumulation of errors that plague conventional methods. The approach is particularly effective in heterogeneous settings where local data distributions differ significantly, as the server-side preconditioning can account for these differences rather than being confounded by them.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Second-order optimization in federated learning** - Needed because first-order methods like FedAvg suffer from slow convergence and poor performance in heterogeneous settings; quick check: compare convergence rates of first-order vs second-order methods on non-iid data.

2. **Parameter mixing and drift in federated learning** - Critical for understanding why naive averaging of local parameters fails; quick check: observe parameter divergence when mixing without preconditioning in heterogeneous settings.

3. **Curvature information and preconditioning** - Essential for understanding how second-order information can guide optimization; quick check: compare convergence with and without curvature-aware preconditioning.

4. **Superlinear convergence rates** - Important theoretical benchmark for evaluating optimization methods; quick check: verify the theoretical convergence rate matches empirical observations for strongly convex problems.

5. **FOOF approximation for Hessian computation** - Needed to make second-order methods computationally tractable for large models; quick check: measure computational overhead of full Hessian vs FOOF approximation.

6. **Federated learning in heterogeneous settings** - Fundamental context for why FedPM's approach is necessary; quick check: test method performance as degree of data heterogeneity increases.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Clients -> Local Updates -> Server Aggregation -> Preconditioned Mixing -> Global Model

Critical path: Local computation → Server aggregation → Preconditioned mixing → Global update → Client synchronization

Design tradeoffs: FedPM trades increased server-side computation (Hessian computation and preconditioning) for improved convergence and robustness. This is justified by the potential for fewer communication rounds, which is typically the bottleneck in federated learning. The FOOF approximation balances accuracy with computational feasibility for large models.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may manifest as slow convergence or oscillation if the mixing parameter β is poorly chosen, or if the FOOF approximation is inadequate for the model complexity. In highly heterogeneous settings, failure to properly capture global curvature could lead to suboptimal updates.

Three first experiments to run:
1. Implement FedPM with synthetic strongly convex objectives to verify the superlinear convergence rate theoretically proven
2. Compare FedPM against FedAvg and conventional SOPM on a simple CNN with CIFAR10 under moderate heterogeneity
3. Evaluate the impact of the FOOF approximation quality by comparing against exact Hessian computation on a small model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method relies on full-batch gradients and Hessians at the server side, which may become computationally prohibitive for very large models despite the FOOF approximation
- The theoretical analysis assumes full client participation, which may not hold in practical federated settings with high client dropout
- The method's performance may be sensitive to the choice of mixing parameter β and the preconditioning matrix construction, which are not extensively explored in the experiments

## Confidence

High:
- The superlinear convergence rate claims for strongly convex objectives under the stated assumptions (strongly convex objectives, single local update, full client participation)

Medium:
- The empirical superiority claims over state-of-the-art methods, given the extensive experiments but limited ablation studies on hyperparameter sensitivity

Low:
- The practical scalability claims, given the computational overhead of Hessian computation even with FOOF approximation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments with partial client participation (e.g., 10-50% of clients) to assess real-world applicability and compare performance degradation against theoretical expectations

2. Perform ablation studies on the mixing parameter β and preconditioning matrix construction to identify optimal configurations and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices

3. Evaluate the method's performance on larger-scale models (e.g., ResNet-50, Transformer) and datasets (e.g., ImageNet) to test scalability beyond the current experimental scope of CIFAR datasets and smaller models
