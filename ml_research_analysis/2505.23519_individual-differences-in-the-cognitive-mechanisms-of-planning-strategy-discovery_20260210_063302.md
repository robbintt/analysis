# Individual differences in the cognitive mechanisms of planning strategy discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.23519
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23519
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: Individual differences in planning strategy discovery mechanisms exist, with pseudo-rewards and subjective effort valuation facilitating discovery for some participants

## Executive Summary
This study investigates individual differences in cognitive mechanisms underlying planning strategy discovery through metacognitive reinforcement learning. Building on prior work showing MCRL models explain human strategy discovery but lag behind actual human performance, researchers enhanced a metacognitive hybrid Reinforce model with three additional mechanisms: intrinsically generated metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective effort valuation, and termination deliberation. The analysis revealed that approximately 70% of participants used at least one of these mechanisms, with significant individual differences in their usage. Notably, participants whose behavior was best explained by models incorporating pseudo-rewards or subjective effort valuation showed significantly higher performance scores and engaged in more planning operations, while those using termination deliberation performed worse. Despite these insights, none of the enhanced model variants significantly closed the performance gap between model and human strategy discovery rates.

## Method Summary
The researchers enhanced a metacognitive hybrid Reinforce model by adding three mechanisms: metacognitive pseudo-rewards (PR) for switching planning strategies, subjective effort valuation (SE) that incorporates anticipated effort into utility calculations, and termination deliberation (TD) that computes expected value of stopping planning early. They collected data from participants performing a dynamic decision-making task requiring them to discover and apply an adaptive planning strategy. For each participant, they computed the likelihood of their choices under each model variant using parameter values that maximized the likelihood, and compared these likelihoods to determine which model best explained each individual's behavior.

## Key Results
- Approximately 70% of participants used at least one of the three additional cognitive mechanisms (pseudo-rewards, subjective effort valuation, or termination deliberation)
- Participants whose behavior was best explained by models incorporating pseudo-rewards or subjective effort valuation showed significantly higher performance scores and engaged in more planning operations
- Participants engaging in termination deliberation performed worse than those who learned the value of termination like other planning operations
- None of the enhanced model variants significantly closed the performance gap between model and human strategy discovery rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that individual differences in planning strategy discovery arise from differential adoption of facilitative cognitive mechanisms. Pseudo-rewards and subjective effort valuation appear to support more thorough exploration of the strategy space by providing additional learning signals or by appropriately valuing the effort-cost trade-off of planning operations. In contrast, termination deliberation seems to lead to premature planning termination, suggesting that computing expected values for stopping may interfere with optimal strategy discovery.

## Foundational Learning
- Metacognitive reinforcement learning (MCRL): A framework for modeling how people learn to regulate their cognitive processes through trial-and-error learning
  - Why needed: Explains how people discover and refine planning strategies over time
  - Quick check: Verify the model can capture basic strategy discovery patterns in simple planning tasks
- Hybrid Reinforce models: Combine model-based and model-free reinforcement learning approaches
  - Why needed: Captures both deliberate strategy selection and automatic habit formation
  - Quick check: Confirm the hybrid model outperforms purely model-based or model-free variants
- Metacognitive pseudo-rewards: Internally generated rewards for engaging in strategy-switching behavior
  - Why needed: Explains intrinsic motivation for exploring alternative planning approaches
  - Quick check: Test whether adding pseudo-rewards increases strategy-switching rates in simulations
- Subjective effort valuation: Incorporating anticipated effort costs into decision utility calculations
  - Why needed: Accounts for how people balance planning benefits against cognitive costs
  - Quick check: Verify the model predicts reduced planning depth when effort costs are high

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Hybrid Reinforce model -> Pseudo-rewards mechanism -> Subjective effort valuation -> Termination deliberation
- Critical path: Strategy execution → Metacognitive evaluation → Value updating → Strategy selection
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing model complexity against explanatory power; capturing individual differences while maintaining generalizability
- Failure signatures: Models fail to close performance gap; termination deliberation leads to suboptimal early stopping
- First experiments: 1) Test whether adding social learning mechanisms improves model fit, 2) Manipulate effort costs experimentally to see if SE adoption increases, 3) Compare Bayesian and reinforcement learning approaches to strategy discovery

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: What additional cognitive mechanisms beyond pseudo-rewards, subjective effort valuation, and termination deliberation do people use to discover planning strategies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that their enhanced models "did not fully close the gap between model and human performance, prompting further exploration of additional factors that people might use to discover new planning strategies."
- Why unresolved: Despite adding three mechanisms, the simulated models still discovered the adaptive strategy at a significantly slower rate than human participants.
- What evidence would resolve it: Identifying and testing additional candidate mechanisms (e.g., social learning, analogical transfer, explicit hypothesis testing) and demonstrating that models incorporating these mechanisms match human discovery rates.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What determines whether an individual adopts facilitative mechanisms like pseudo-rewards or subjective effort valuation during metacognitive learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note "substantial differences among the individuals" and suggest that PR and SE "may demand additional cognitive effort, making people hesitant to use them unless the benefits justify the cost."
- Why unresolved: Only 30% and 35% of participants were best explained by PR and SE respectively, but the factors driving this selection remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments manipulating task parameters (reward structure, effort demands) and measuring individual differences (cognitive capacity, motivation) to predict mechanism adoption.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does termination deliberation lead to earlier planning termination and poorer task performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors found that "participants engaging in termination deliberation... performed worse than those who learned the value of termination like the other planning operations" and "tended to terminate their planning early."
- Why unresolved: This finding is described as "interesting" but no explanation is provided for why computing the expected value of termination produces suboptimal behavior.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing whether TD causes overestimation of termination value, or whether participants using TD have different task representations or prior beliefs about optimal planning depth.

## Limitations
- The performance gap between models and humans remains unexplained despite adding three mechanisms, suggesting additional cognitive factors are at play
- The sample's restricted age range (18-40) and absence of older adult data limits generalizability to broader populations
- The finding that termination deliberation correlates with worse performance requires careful interpretation, as it may reflect strategic differences rather than a deficit in the mechanism itself

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The identification of individual differences in mechanism usage (70% of participants using at least one mechanism) and the correlation between pseudo-rewards/effort valuation and better performance
- Medium Confidence: The conclusion that none of the enhanced models closed the performance gap, given the possibility that alternative modeling approaches or additional mechanisms might succeed
- Low Confidence: The implication that termination deliberation causes worse performance, as this may reflect strategic choices rather than mechanism effectiveness

## Next Checks
1. Test whether alternative computational frameworks (e.g., Bayesian models) can better capture the unexplained performance gap
2. Conduct follow-up studies with older adult populations to assess whether mechanism usage patterns differ across age groups
3. Implement experimental manipulations that selectively enhance or suppress each mechanism to establish causal relationships with performance outcomes
