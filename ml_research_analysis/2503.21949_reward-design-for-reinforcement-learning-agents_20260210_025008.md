# Reward Design for Reinforcement Learning Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.21949
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21949
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Proposed reward design frameworks (EXPRD, EXPADARD, EXPLO RS) significantly improve RL learning efficiency on navigation tasks compared to baselines.

## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses the fundamental challenge of designing effective reward functions for reinforcement learning agents. The work proposes three novel frameworks for reward shaping that aim to create rewards that are invariant (preserving optimal policies), interpretable (sparse/structured), and informative (accelerating learning). These frameworks include non-adaptive teacher-driven (EXPRD), adaptive teacher-driven (EXPADARD), and adaptive agent-driven (EXPLO RS) approaches. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive experiments on navigation tasks, showing significant improvements in learning efficiency compared to baseline methods, particularly in environments with sparse or noisy rewards.

## Method Summary
The research proposes three main frameworks for reward design in reinforcement learning. EXPRD uses a greedy algorithm to select sparse reward states and solves a concave optimization problem to maximize informativeness while maintaining invariance. EXPADARD iteratively updates rewards based on the learner's current policy using constrained optimization with feature representations. EXPLO RS employs a meta-learning approach where the agent self-designs its reward signals online, combining intrinsic rewards updated via meta-gradients with count-based exploration bonuses. All frameworks aim to accelerate learning convergence while ensuring rewards remain interpretable and invariant to optimal policies.

## Key Results
- EXPRD significantly improves learning efficiency on ROOM and CHAIN environments compared to sparse and dense reward baselines
- EXPADARD demonstrates faster convergence than EXPRD in diverse learner settings by adapting rewards to the learner's evolving policy
- EXPLO RS achieves competitive performance without expert input, showing the viability of agent-driven reward design
- All proposed methods successfully mitigate reward bugs and improve interpretability while maintaining optimal policy invariance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The frameworks work by optimizing reward functions to maximize information about the optimal policy while maintaining structural constraints. EXPRD achieves this through greedy selection of informative states and concave optimization. EXPADARD adapts rewards based on the learner's current understanding, focusing on informative states for the specific learner. EXPLO RS uses meta-learning to discover intrinsic reward structures that accelerate learning without explicit expert guidance. The key insight is that well-designed rewards can guide exploration and learning more effectively than standard dense or sparse rewards.

## Foundational Learning

### MDP Theory and Value Iteration
- **Why needed**: Understanding the optimal policy and value functions is crucial for evaluating reward informativeness and invariance
- **Quick check**: Verify that the optimal policy found via value iteration matches expected behavior on simple gridworlds

### Concave Optimization
- **Why needed**: EXPRD uses concave optimization to maximize informativeness while maintaining invariance constraints
- **Quick check**: Ensure the solver converges to feasible solutions that satisfy all invariance constraints

### Meta-Gradients and Bi-level Optimization
- **Why needed**: EXPLO RS updates intrinsic rewards via meta-gradients, requiring understanding of gradient through learning process
- **Quick check**: Verify that intrinsic reward updates improve the meta-objective (learning speed) over time

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
EXPRD: MDP → Value Iteration → Greedy State Selection → Concave Optimization → Sparse Reward
EXPADARD: MDP + Learner Policy → Feature Representation → Constrained Optimization → Adaptive Reward
EXPLO RS: MDP → REINFORCE Agent → Meta-gradient Updates → Intrinsic Reward + Bonus → Agent-Driven Reward

### Critical Path
The critical path for all methods involves: (1) computing optimal policy/value functions, (2) evaluating informativeness/invariance, (3) solving the appropriate optimization problem, and (4) using the resulting reward to train the agent.

### Design Tradeoffs
- EXPRD trades computational cost of optimization for interpretability and performance gains
- EXPADARD trades stability for adaptability to learner's specific needs
- EXPLO RS trades control for autonomy and scalability to environments without expert guidance

### Failure Signatures
- EXPRD: Agent gets stuck in local optima due to reward bugs
- EXPADARD: Instability in diverse learner settings due to over-adaptation
- EXPLO RS: High training variance due to meta-gradient noise

### Three First Experiments
1. Implement EXPRD on ROOM environment and verify convergence speed improvement
2. Test EXPADARD with different learner capacities to observe adaptation behavior
3. Implement EXPLO RS with varying meta-update frequencies to find stability sweet spot

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Do interpretable reward functions designed by frameworks like EXPRD actually enhance learning efficiency and skill acquisition for human learners in practical domains such as surgical simulators?
- **Basis in paper**: The author states in Chapter 5 that "experimental evaluations were limited to RL agents" and outlines the need to "conduct user studies involving human learners."
- **Why unresolved**: The thesis relies on simulated agents; the impact of interpretable rewards on human cognitive load or skill retention is unverified.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical results from user studies comparing human performance under interpretable rewards versus standard binary or dense rewards.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can agent-driven reward design frameworks be adapted for Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure self-generated rewards are reliable?
- **Basis in paper**: Chapter 5 suggests "Applying agent-driven reward design for challenging settings" like LLMs but notes the challenge that LLMs can "generate plausible yet incorrect information."
- **Why unresolved**: Ensuring the invariance property (that self-generated rewards lead to desired behaviors) is difficult when the generator (LLM) hallucinates.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A methodology for evaluating the quality of self-generated rewards in LLMs that mitigates hallucination risks.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What are the theoretical convergence speed and stability properties of agents trained with adaptive reward shaping frameworks like EXPADARD and EXPLO RS?
- **Basis in paper**: While the frameworks improve empirical performance, the author notes in Chapter 3 and 4 conclusions that "adaptive rewards could also lead to instability" and calls for "rigorous analysis."
- **Why unresolved**: The theoretical underpinnings regarding how frequently changing reward landscapes affect policy convergence remain under-explored.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Formal proofs or bounds on convergence rates and stability for the proposed bi-level optimization formulations.

## Limitations

- Limited experimental evaluation to simulated RL agents without human studies
- Computational overhead of optimization procedures may limit scalability to large state spaces
- Potential instability in adaptive reward frameworks when learner capacity varies significantly

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Overall framework design and theoretical foundations
- **Medium confidence**: Experimental methodology and convergence results
- **Medium confidence**: Practical applicability based on navigation task results

## Next Checks

1. Verify solver configuration by testing EXPRD with different tolerance levels and iteration limits to ensure consistent reward bug prevention
2. Reproduce convergence curves by implementing the REINFORCE baseline and comparing convergence speed on CHAIN/ROOM environments with reported results
3. Validate meta-gradient stability by experimenting with different update frequency ratios (Nπ/Nr) in EXPLO RS to confirm the claimed stability requirements
