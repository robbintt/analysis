# Learning to Trust: Bayesian Adaptation to Varying Suggester Reliability in Sequential Decision Making

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.12378
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12378
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Primary result**: Framework for dynamic adaptation to varying suggester reliability in sequential decision-making using Bayesian inference over suggester types

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for dynamic adaptation to varying suggester reliability in sequential decision-making. The authors integrate suggester quality into the agent's belief state, enabling Bayesian inference over suggester types, and introduce an explicit "ask" action for strategic suggestion requests. Experimental results across Tag and RockSample domains demonstrate that agents maintaining beliefs over multiple suggester types achieve robust performance across varying suggester qualities and adapt effectively to changing reliability. The explicit ask action allows agents to balance informational gains against acquisition costs, with constrained querying further improving performance.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates suggester quality into the agent's belief state by maintaining beliefs over multiple suggester types rather than a single uniform quality assumption. Agents perform Bayesian inference to update these beliefs based on observed suggestion quality, allowing them to adapt to changing reliability patterns. The key innovation is the introduction of an explicit "ask" action that enables strategic requests for suggestions, allowing agents to weigh the cost of acquiring information against its potential benefit. This approach handles both constant and varying suggester reliability through Bayesian belief updates and enables efficient information acquisition through controlled querying.

## Key Results
- Agents maintaining beliefs over multiple suggester types achieve robust performance across varying suggester qualities
- Bayesian belief updates enable effective adaptation when suggester reliability changes during execution
- The explicit ask action allows strategic information acquisition, with constrained querying improving performance by balancing costs against benefits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating suggester reliability as an uncertain parameter that can be inferred from observed behavior. By maintaining a distribution over possible suggester types rather than assuming uniform quality, agents can differentiate between reliable and unreliable suggesters. Bayesian inference allows agents to update these beliefs as they observe the quality of suggestions over time, enabling adaptation to changing reliability. The explicit ask action provides a mechanism for strategic information acquisition, allowing agents to request suggestions when the expected benefit outweighs the cost.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian inference**: Needed for updating beliefs about suggester reliability based on observed suggestion quality; quick check: verify that posterior beliefs correctly incorporate new evidence
- **POMDP framework**: Required for handling partial observability in sequential decision-making; quick check: ensure belief state properly represents uncertainty about environment state
- **Action-value estimation**: Essential for evaluating the cost-benefit tradeoff of requesting suggestions; quick check: validate that expected values correctly account for suggestion reliability
- **Belief-space planning**: Necessary for making decisions under uncertainty about suggester quality; quick check: confirm that policies optimize over the full belief distribution

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Environment -> Agent (Belief State, Policy) -> Action -> Environment -> Observation -> Agent

**Critical Path:**
Observation → Bayesian update → Belief state → Policy evaluation → Action selection

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades computational complexity (maintaining and updating beliefs over multiple suggester types) for improved robustness and adaptability. Alternative approaches might use meta-learning or direct policy learning, but these would sacrifice the explicit modeling of suggester reliability that enables targeted adaptation strategies.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance when suggester reliability changes rapidly and Bayesian updates cannot keep pace
- Suboptimal behavior when the explicit ask action is disabled or when suggestion costs are misestimated
- Degraded performance if the suggester type space is misspecified or too coarse

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test agent performance with constant versus varying suggester reliability to verify adaptation capabilities
2. Compare performance with and without the explicit ask action to quantify its utility
3. Evaluate robustness across different suggester type distributions and noise levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes suggester reliability can be fully characterized by a single noise parameter, potentially missing complex failure modes
- Experimental domains (Tag and RockSample) are relatively simple compared to real-world decision-making scenarios
- Does not address computational overhead of maintaining beliefs over multiple suggester types in real-time applications

## Confidence
- Bayesian adaptation framework effectiveness: High confidence
- Multi-type suggester modeling advantage: Medium confidence
- Explicit "ask" action utility: High confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework in more complex, real-world domains with multiple interacting agents and dynamic environments to evaluate scalability and practical utility
2. Evaluate performance under different suggester availability patterns, including intermittent availability and varying communication costs
3. Compare against alternative approaches such as meta-learning or direct policy learning that might implicitly handle suggester reliability
