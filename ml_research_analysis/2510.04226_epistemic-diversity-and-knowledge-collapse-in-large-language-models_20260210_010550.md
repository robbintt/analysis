core_contribution: This paper introduces a methodology for measuring epistemic diversity
  in LLM outputs, defined as the variation in real-world claims generated across different
  topics and prompts. The approach involves decomposing LLM responses into atomic
  claims, clustering semantically equivalent claims, and measuring diversity using
  Hill-Shannon Diversity (HSD), a statistical measure grounded in ecology.

# Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04226
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Methodology introduced for measuring epistemic diversity in LLM outputs, showing current models exhibit less diversity than web search

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel methodology for quantifying epistemic diversity in large language models, defined as the variation in real-world claims generated across different topics and prompts. The authors decompose LLM responses into atomic claims, cluster semantically equivalent claims, and measure diversity using Hill-Shannon Diversity (HSD), a statistical measure grounded in ecology. Empirical results from 27 LLMs across 155 topics reveal that while newer models generate more diverse claims than older ones, all models remain less epistemically diverse than basic web search. The findings highlight a current risk of knowledge collapse given low diversity and limited epistemic representation.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves decomposing LLM responses into atomic claims, clustering semantically equivalent claims, and measuring diversity using Hill-Shannon Diversity (HSD), a statistical measure grounded in ecology. The approach was applied to 27 LLMs across 155 topics to quantify epistemic diversity. The framework allows for systematic measurement of how LLMs represent knowledge across different domains and prompts.

## Key Results
- Newer models generate more diverse claims than older ones, but all models remain less epistemically diverse than basic web search
- Model size has a statistically significant negative impact on epistemic diversity
- RAG improves epistemic diversity, though benefits vary by cultural context, with country-specific claims reflecting English language knowledge more than local language knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Hill-Shannon Diversity metric provides a mathematically rigorous way to quantify epistemic diversity by measuring the effective number of distinct knowledge claims. By decomposing responses into atomic claims and clustering semantically equivalent ones, the methodology captures the true diversity of knowledge representation rather than surface-level variation. This ecological-inspired approach reveals how knowledge is distributed across different topics and prompts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hill-Shannon Diversity (HSD)**: Mathematical framework for measuring effective number of distinct knowledge claims - needed to quantify epistemic diversity beyond simple counting - quick check: verify HSD calculation on known distributions
- **Semantic clustering of atomic claims**: Process of grouping semantically equivalent knowledge claims - needed to identify true diversity vs surface-level variation - quick check: evaluate clustering accuracy on annotated dataset
- **Epistemic diversity**: Variation in real-world claims generated across topics and prompts - needed as metric for knowledge representation quality - quick check: compare against human knowledge distribution benchmarks

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: LLM outputs -> Atomic claim decomposition -> Semantic clustering -> HSD calculation -> Diversity assessment
- **Critical path**: Model generation → Claim extraction → Clustering → Diversity measurement → Analysis
- **Design tradeoffs**: Larger models sacrifice diversity for coherence; RAG adds diversity but requires retrieval infrastructure; semantic clustering balances precision vs recall
- **Failure signatures**: Low diversity scores indicate knowledge collapse; clustering errors inflate diversity; RAG failures reduce expected diversity gains
- **First experiments**: 1) Compare HSD scores across model families, 2) Measure RAG impact on country-specific claims, 3) Test claim clustering accuracy with human annotations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Proprietary dataset from SberDevices with undisclosed sampling criteria limits external validation
- Benchmark comparison to web search lacks controls for search engine personalization and regional variation
- Hill-Shannon Diversity metric not validated against human-annotated epistemic diversity in cross-cultural contexts
- Country-level comparisons don't account for confounding socioeconomic factors

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Model size correlates negatively with epistemic diversity; RAG consistently improves diversity
**Medium Confidence**: Country-specific claims reflect English knowledge more than local knowledge; RAG and smaller models can improve diversity
**Low Confidence**: Overall conclusion about "current risk of knowledge collapse" extrapolates from metrics without longitudinal data

## Next Checks
1. Replicate epistemic diversity measurements using open-source datasets with transparent sampling criteria and independent human annotation
2. Conduct A/B testing comparing RAG-augmented vs non-augmented models in real-world applications across different cultural contexts
3. Perform longitudinal analysis tracking epistemic diversity changes in models trained on synthetic data over multiple generations
