# SCOPE: Sequential Causal Optimization of Process Interventions

## Quick Facts

- Key outcome: SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art Prescriptive Process Monitoring techniques by combining causal learners with backward induction to learn aligned sequential intervention policies directly from observational event logs.

## Executive Summary
SCOPE addresses the challenge of optimizing sequential interventions in business processes, where decisions at one stage impact outcomes at later stages. Unlike existing methods that treat interventions independently or rely on process approximations, SCOPE combines causal learners with backward induction to learn aligned sequential intervention policies directly from observational event logs. The method estimates the effect of each candidate intervention at every decision point and propagates its impact from the final decision back to the first. Experiments on both a synthetic dataset (SimBank) and a new semi-synthetic benchmark based on real-life event data (SimBPIC17) demonstrate that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Prescriptive Process Monitoring techniques, achieving higher gains over baseline policies across varying levels of confounding, training set sizes, and numbers of decision points.

## Method Summary
SCOPE uses backward induction with regret-based value functions to optimize sequential interventions in business processes. It employs causal meta-learners (S-learner, T-learner, RA-learner) to estimate intervention effects directly from observational event logs, avoiding the need for process approximations or simulations. The algorithm iterates backward from the final decision point, training models to predict optimal outcomes while accounting for the impact of future decisions. During inference, it selects actions sequentially based on the learned policy to maximize overall KPI performance.

## Key Results
- SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Prescriptive Process Monitoring techniques across varying levels of confounding, training set sizes, and numbers of decision points
- The method achieves higher gains over baseline policies compared to independent optimization approaches
- SCOPE demonstrates effectiveness on both synthetic (SimBank) and semi-synthetic (SimBPIC17) datasets based on real-life event data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Backward Induction for Policy Alignment
The algorithm iterates from the final decision point backward to the first, forcing each model to learn not just for immediate gain but for setting up optimal future states. This sequential approach outperforms greedy, independent optimization by accounting for the interdependence of future actions.

### Mechanism 2: Direct Observational Learning
SCOPE uses meta-learners to estimate intervention effects directly from historical data, avoiding the "reality gap" and bias introduced by process approximations required by traditional RL methods.

### Mechanism 3: Regret-Based Value Targeting
The method uses a regret-based formulation for the value function, providing greater robustness to model misspecification compared to standard Q-learning targets by centering the learning signal on the gain of switching actions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Causal Meta-Learners (S, T, and RA-Learners)**: These estimate intervention effects; S-learner uses one model, T-learner uses two, RA-learner uses residual approach
- **Backward Induction (Dynamic Programming)**: Structural logic requiring starting from the last decision point to propagate value estimates backward
- **Confounding & Positivity**: Understanding spurious correlations and ensuring all actions are theoretically possible for diagnosing failure

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Prefix encoder (LSTM or aggregation) → Feature Vector → Stack of K Causal Learners (XGBoost) → Backward Induction logic
- **Critical path**: Training (Backward Pass): Start at K, train to predict Outcome Y, compute Value V_K, move to K-1 with V_K as target; Inference (Forward Pass): Observe prefix at point 1, query Model 1 for best action, execute, observe new prefix at point 2, repeat
- **Design tradeoffs**: Learner selection (S simple but may suffer bias, RA robust but complex); Base model (LSTM captures sequence but needs more data, XGBoost robust on smaller data)
- **Failure signatures**: Error accumulation (performance degrades with K), high confounding collapse (policy replicates historical bias), determinism (always recommends same action)
- **First 3 experiments**: Baseline validation (SimBank SCOPE-S vs SEP-S), stress test (confounding SCOPE-RA vs SCOPE-S at δ=0.99), scalability check (SimBPIC17 decision points 2-6)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can SCOPE be extended to account for interference between cases, thereby relaxing the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)?
- Can instrumental variables be integrated into the backward induction framework to address hidden confounders and relax the sequential ignorability assumption?
- To what extent does estimation error propagate and degrade policy quality when applying backward induction to processes with highly stochastic KPIs or significantly longer decision horizons?

## Limitations
- Performance degrades with increasing numbers of decision points due to error accumulation
- Method assumes cases are independent units, not accounting for resource sharing or interference
- Relies on sequential ignorability assumption, which may be violated with unmeasured confounders

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Backward induction mechanism's ability to outperform greedy optimization when value estimation is accurate
- **Medium confidence**: Observational learning avoids simulation bias (depends on data quality and positivity)
- **Low confidence**: Regret-based formulation's superiority over standard Q-learning targets (dataset-specific)

## Next Checks

1. Baseline Validation: Replicate SCOPE-S vs. SEP-S comparison on 10K cases in SimBank
2. Stress Test: Run SCOPE-RA vs. SCOPE-S at δ=0.99 confounding
3. Scalability Check: Increase decision points from 2 to 6 in SimBPIC17 to quantify error accumulation rate
