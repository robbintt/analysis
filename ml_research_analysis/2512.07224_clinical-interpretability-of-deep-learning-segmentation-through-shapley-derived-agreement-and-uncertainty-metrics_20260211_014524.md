# Clinical Interpretability of Deep Learning Segmentation Through Shapley-Derived Agreement and Uncertainty Metrics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.07224
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07224
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Proposed Shapley-based metrics correlate with segmentation performance, providing clinically interpretable proxies for model reliability in multi-contrast MRI brain tumor segmentation.

## Executive Summary
This study develops two Shapley-derived metrics to enhance clinical interpretability of deep learning segmentation models: agreement with clinical imaging protocols and uncertainty quantification. Using the BraTS 2024 dataset with four MRI contrasts and four model architectures, the authors demonstrate that higher-performing cases (Dice >0.6) show significantly greater agreement with clinical rankings, while increased Shapley ranking variance correlates with decreased performance. These metrics help clinicians understand how well model contrast prioritization aligns with established clinical protocols and identify cases where uncertainty may indicate performance degradation.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two explainability metrics based on contrast-level Shapley values from MRI imaging. First, agreement measures how well model contrast rankings align with clinical standard rankings (T1c=1, T2f=2, T1n/T2w=3) using Normalized Spearman Footrule (NSF). Second, uncertainty quantifies variability in Shapley rankings across 5-fold cross-validation. The approach uses BraTS 2024 data with four MRI contrasts and three tumor sub-regions, training four architectures (U-Net, Seg-ResNet, UNETR, Swin-UNETR) with 5-fold CV. Shapley values are computed across all contrast subsets, converted to rankings, and correlated with Dice similarity coefficients.

## Key Results
- Higher-performing cases (Dice >0.6) showed significantly greater agreement with clinical rankings
- Increased Shapley ranking variance correlated with decreased performance, with U-Net showing r=-0.581 correlation
- Agreement and uncertainty metrics provide clinically interpretable proxies for model reliability in multi-contrast MRI segmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Shapley-based metrics capture how each MRI contrast contributes to the final segmentation prediction, providing a principled way to quantify both agreement with clinical protocols and model uncertainty. By comparing model-derived contrast importance rankings against established clinical standards, the agreement metric reveals whether the model's decision-making aligns with expert knowledge. The uncertainty metric, computed through cross-validation ranking variance, identifies cases where the model's reliance on different contrasts is unstable, potentially indicating performance degradation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Shapley values in deep learning:** Measure marginal contribution of each feature to model predictions; needed to quantify individual contrast importance in multi-modal MRI
- **Normalized Spearman Footrule:** Metric for comparing ranked lists; needed to measure agreement between model and clinical contrast rankings
- **Cross-validation ranking variance:** Statistical measure of stability across folds; needed to quantify uncertainty in model decision-making
- **Multi-contrast MRI segmentation:** Processing multiple MRI sequences simultaneously; needed for comprehensive brain tumor analysis
- **Dice similarity coefficient:** Standard segmentation performance metric; needed for quantitative evaluation of tumor delineation
- **BraTS dataset protocols:** Standardized multi-institutional brain tumor dataset; needed for clinically relevant validation

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** MRI contrasts -> Shapley value computation -> Ranking generation -> Agreement/Uncertainty metrics -> Performance correlation
**Critical Path:** Contrast subset evaluation -> Shapley computation -> Ranking aggregation -> Metric calculation -> Correlation analysis
**Design Tradeoffs:** Exhaustive contrast subset evaluation (16 combinations) vs. computational efficiency; 5-fold CV for stability vs. increased variance in metrics
**Failure Signatures:** High ranking variance with low Dice indicates unstable model performance; low agreement with clinical rankings suggests misalignment with clinical protocols
**First Experiments:**
1. Reproduce agreement metric on a subset of 50 cases to verify NSF calculation methodology
2. Validate uncertainty correlation using a held-out validation set with identical preprocessing
3. Test metric sensitivity by varying clinical standard rankings to assess robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Absence of critical training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer) creates reproducibility gaps
- 5-fold cross-validation may not fully capture model stability across different random seeds
- Correlation analysis requires validation on larger datasets and different tumor types for generalizability
- Bootstrap analysis sensitivity to 80th percentile threshold choice not fully explored

## Confidence
- **Methodological framework validity:** High
- **Numerical result reproducibility:** Low (due to unspecified hyperparameters)
- **Generalizability to other tumor types:** Medium
- **Clinical interpretability claims:** Medium

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the correlation analysis on a held-out validation set with identical preprocessing and hyperparameters
2. Perform ablation studies varying the clinical standard ranking to test metric sensitivity
3. Evaluate metric stability across different random seeds and training runs to assess reproducibility
