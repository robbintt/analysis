# Dynamic Weight Adjustment for Knowledge Distillation: Leveraging Vision Transformer for High-Accuracy Lung Cancer Detection and Real-Time Deployment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.20438
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20438
- **Reference count:** 39
- **Primary result:** 99.16% accuracy on LC25000 histopathology, 99.54% accuracy on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan datasets using fuzzy-weighted KD with ViT-B32→MobileNet

## Executive Summary
This paper presents FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet, a dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation framework for lung cancer classification. The approach employs Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the teacher and MobileNet as the student, using fuzzy logic to dynamically adjust distillation weights based on image uncertainty. The method includes wavelet-based image fusion preprocessing and is deployed on Android for real-time clinical use, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on two lung cancer datasets.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework combines Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor with MobileNet as the student, using dynamic fuzzy-weighted knowledge distillation. Fuzzy logic computes confidence-based weights that modulate the KL-divergence loss contribution during training, allowing the model to emphasize high-confidence regions while de-emphasizing ambiguous areas. The approach includes wavelet-fused gamma correction and histogram equalization for image preprocessing, GA-selected student architecture optimization, and TFLite deployment on Android devices.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99.16% accuracy on LC25000 histopathological image dataset
- Achieved 99.54% accuracy on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan dataset
- Successfully deployed on Android application for real-time inference
- Outperformed traditional KD approaches through dynamic fuzzy weight adjustment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Dynamic fuzzy-weighted knowledge distillation improves student model learning on uncertain medical image regions.
- **Mechanism:** Fuzzy logic computes dynamic weight ω(x) = μ_low(x)×w_low + μ_medium(x)×w_medium + μ_high(x)×w_high based on local confidence/uncertainty, modulating KL-divergence loss contribution.
- **Core assumption:** Confidence and uncertainty can be meaningfully derived per-sample or per-region, with fuzzy membership overlap providing smoother optimization than hard thresholds.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states dynamic fuzzy adjustment enables focus on high-confidence regions; Section 3.6 defines full fuzzy membership functions; corpus shows related dynamic KD methods but no direct evidence for fuzzy-modulated per-region weighting.
- **Break condition:** If confidence/uncertainty cannot be reliably estimated, weight modulation may misguide training.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** ViT-B32 instructor's global context improves MobileNet student's feature learning via soft-label distillation.
- **Mechanism:** ViT-B32 processes 32×32 patches through 12 self-attention layers to capture long-range dependencies, with soft targets encoding inter-class relationships that guide MobileNet's depthwise-separable convolutions.
- **Core assumption:** Global patch-level attention captures diagnostically relevant patterns that transfer better than CNN-local features alone.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions ViT-B32 effectively transfers knowledge to MobileNet; Section 3.3 details ViT-B32 architecture; corpus supports cross-domain plausibility of ViT→efficient-model transfer.
- **Break condition:** If datasets are too small for ViT to learn meaningful attention or if domain shift requires domain-specific pretraining, transfer quality may degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Wavelet-fused gamma correction + histogram equalization improves feature preservation for LC images.
- **Mechanism:** Images undergo gamma correction and histogram equalization separately, then wavelet decomposition and coefficient averaging across multi-scale frequency components.
- **Core assumption:** Fusing complementary contrast/brightness enhancements preserves more discriminative features than either alone.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract describes pixel-level image fusion using gamma correction and histogram equalization; Section 4.1.3 details algorithm with level-wise mean coefficient fusion; corpus lacks direct evidence for this specific fusion pipeline in KD contexts.
- **Break condition:** Over-enhancement may amplify noise or create artifacts; if fused images diverge from clinically realistic appearances, model may learn spurious textures.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation (KD)**
  - **Why needed here:** Core innovation modifies standard KD by dynamically weighting KL term; understanding Eq. (1) L_KD = ρ×CE + (1−ρ)×T²×KL is prerequisite.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why temperature T > 1 "softens" probability distributions and what information soft targets encode beyond hard labels?

- **Concept: Fuzzy Logic Membership Functions**
  - **Why needed here:** Section 3.6 defines overlapping triangular/trapezoidal memberships (e.g., confidence "Low" active from 0-0.5, "Medium" from 0.2-0.8, "High" from 0.5-1.0).
  - **Quick check question:** For confidence=0.5, which membership functions are active and how is the final weight computed?

- **Concept: Wavelet Decomposition (2D DWT)**
  - **Why needed here:** Pixel-level fusion uses wavedec2 to decompose images into multi-scale frequency components.
  - **Quick check question:** What information do the LL vs. LH/HL/HH subbands encode, and why might averaging coefficients across enhancements preserve features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Preprocessing (Gamma correction → Histogram equalization → Wavelet fusion → Resize 224×224 → Normalize [0,1] → Augmentation) → Instructor (ViT-B32, 32×32 patches, 768-dim, 12 layers) → Student (MobileNet, GA-selected) → Dynamic fuzzy-weighted KD loss → Interpretability (GRAD-CAM, GRAD-CAM++, LIME) → Deployment (TensorFlow → .h5 → TFLite → Android)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Implement fuzzy membership functions and rule-based weight computation
  2. Train/freeze ViT-B32 instructor on target dataset
  3. Run GA to select student model (MobileNet chosen)
  4. Train student with dynamic fuzzy-weighted KD loss
  5. Validate on 70:10:20 split
  6. Convert to TFLite and test on Android

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - ViT-B32 vs. larger ViT: B32 uses larger patches (32 vs. 16), reducing compute but potentially losing fine-grained patch details
  - MobileNet vs. stronger students: Lightweight inference vs. accuracy ceiling; GA selected MobileNet balancing cost/performance
  - Global histogram equalization vs. CLAHE: Global equalization may over-enhance; paper acknowledges noise amplification risk
  - Fuzzy vs. fixed ω: Added complexity and hyperparameters vs. adaptivity

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Student underperforms baseline: check fuzzy weight range—if always near 0.1, membership logic may be miscalibrated
  - Overfitting on small dataset: ViT requires sufficient data; verify augmentation effectiveness
  - Android latency spikes: TFLite quantization may degrade accuracy; profile per-layer latency
  - GRAD-CAM shows diffuse attention: student may not have distilled spatial focus from teacher; verify distillation weight is non-zero during training

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablate fuzzy weighting: Compare fixed ω=0.1 vs. dynamic fuzzy ω(x) on both datasets to isolate contribution of adaptive weighting
  2. Ablate image fusion: Train with raw images, gamma only, histogram only, and wavelet-fused to measure accuracy impact
  3. Student model sweep: Train top-3 GA candidates with identical distillation to confirm MobileNet's cost-accuracy tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dynamic fuzzy-weighted KD lacks external validation; no prior work demonstrates fuzzy logic-based dynamic weighting in medical image KD
- Wavelet fusion methodology not experimentally compared against simpler preprocessing alternatives
- Confidence/uncertainty estimation mechanisms for fuzzy weighting are not detailed, raising implementation concerns

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Dataset curation, MobileNet selection via GA, and Android deployment pipeline are standard practices with clear evidence
- **Medium confidence:** ViT-B32→MobileNet distillation framework based on established KD principles; accuracy claims supported but may overfit small datasets
- **Low confidence:** Dynamic fuzzy-weighted KL modulation—no external validation, mechanism relies on unverified assumptions about confidence estimation and fuzzy rule effectiveness

## Next Checks
1. Ablate fuzzy weighting: Compare fixed ω=0.1 vs. dynamic fuzzy ω(x) on both datasets to measure accuracy difference and isolate contribution of adaptive weighting
2. Ablate preprocessing: Train identical models with raw images, gamma only, histogram only, and wavelet-fused to determine if fusion provides measurable benefit
3. Student model validation: Train top-3 GA candidates with identical distillation setup to verify MobileNet's selection reflects true cost-accuracy optimization
