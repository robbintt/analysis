# DeepSpecs: Expert-Level Questions Answering in 5G

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01305
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01305
- Authors: Aman Ganapathy Manvattira; Yifei Xu; Ziyue Dang; Songwu Lu
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: Outperforms strong LLM and telecom-specific RAG baselines on real-world QA, with a 68% win rate against GPT-4o and rubric-based score improvements of up to 0.79 points.

## Executive Summary
DEEPSPECS is a retrieval-augmented generation system designed to answer expert-level questions about 5G specifications by explicitly resolving cross-references and reasoning about specification evolution. It uses three metadata-rich databases—SpecDB for clause-aligned specification text, ChangeDB for version diffs, and TDocDB for standardization meeting documents—to navigate the complex, cross-referenced, and evolving nature of 3GPP standards. DEEPSPECS outperforms strong LLM and telecom-specific RAG baselines on real-world QA, with a 68% win rate against GPT-4o and rubric-based score improvements of up to 0.79 points. Targeted microbenchmarks confirm that its cross-reference resolution and evolution-aware retrieval substantially improve answer quality compared to semantic-only retrieval.

## Method Summary
DEEPSPECS constructs three metadata-rich databases: SpecDB (clause-aligned chunks with spec_id, cls_id, version, timestamp), ChangeDB (line-level diffs), and TDocDB (CRs with rationale fields). It employs HyDE for query expansion, exact metadata filtering for structured retrieval, and LLM-based extraction for cross-references and evolution reasoning. The system recursively resolves cross-references (max depth 2) and links specification changes to Change Requests for design rationale. Embeddings use text-embedding-3-large, and GPT-4o serves as the default LLM for extraction and generation.

## Key Results
- 68% win rate against GPT-4o on real-world practitioner QA
- Cross-reference microbenchmark: 0.7055 recall vs. 0.2334 for Chat3GPP
- CR-focused QA: 77% win rate vs. 59.3% for Chat3GPP; rubric score improves from 2.48 to 3.05

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Recursive Cross-Reference Resolution
Explicit metadata-based reference resolution outperforms semantic-only retrieval for navigating modular, cross-linked specifications. Extract spec/clause ID pairs via regex patterns from retrieved chunks → perform exact metadata lookup in SpecDB → recursively resolve nested references up to configurable depth → re-rank by semantic relevance to original query.

### Mechanism 2: Evolution-Aware Retrieval via Change-TDoc Linkage
Linking line-level diffs to Change Requests enables reasoning about "why" a specification changed, not just "what" changed. Query ChangeDB semantically to locate relevant diffs → extract metadata (spec ID, date) → filter TDocDB by metadata → re-rank filtered TDocs by semantic relevance → retrieve design rationale from CR summary/reason/consequences sections.

### Mechanism 3: Hybrid Retrieval with Metadata Filtering
Combining dense semantic retrieval with exact metadata filtering improves precision for structured, versioned corpora. All three databases indexed for both dense retrieval (text-embedding-3-large) and exact metadata filtering → HyDE generates hypothetical documents for query expansion → metadata filters narrow candidate pool before semantic ranking.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3GPP Specification Structure (TS numbering, clause hierarchy, cross-reference conventions)
  - Why needed here: The entire system depends on parsing spec IDs (e.g., TS 38.211), clause IDs (e.g., 7.4.1.1.2), and understanding modular document design.
  - Quick check question: Given the reference "See clause 5.1.6.4 of TS 38.214," what spec ID and clause ID would DeepSpecs extract?

- Concept: Change Requests (CRs) and TDocs in 3GPP Standardization
  - Why needed here: Evolution reasoning requires understanding that CRs contain rationale fields (reason for change, consequences) omitted from formal specifications.
  - Quick check question: Why can't the rationale for a specification change be found in the specification document itself?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Metadata Filtering
  - Why needed here: DeepSpecs extends vanilla RAG with structural/temporal retrieval; understanding baseline RAG clarifies what's being extended.
  - Quick check question: How does metadata filtering differ from semantic similarity ranking in narrowing retrieval candidates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Query → HyDE expansion → SpecDB initial retrieval → cross-reference resolution → (optional) ChangeDB/TDocDB evolution retrieval → answer generation
- Critical path: Query → HyDE expansion → SpecDB initial retrieval → cross-reference resolution → (optional) ChangeDB/TDocDB evolution retrieval → answer generation
- Design tradeoffs: Recursion depth (default: 2) balances context completeness vs. retrieval noise; k1=4, k2=3, k3=3 chunk counts balance context richness vs. token limits; LLM-based metadata extraction enables rich indexing but introduces potential extraction errors
- Failure signatures: Low cross-reference recall: Check regex patterns against target spec format; verify metadata extraction accuracy; Missing evolution context: Verify CR coverage in TDocDB; check metadata filter match rates; Verbose but unhelpful answers: Check re-ranking relevance; adjust k values
- First 3 experiments: 1) Replicate Table 3 microbenchmark: Sample chunks from 1-2 specs, manually validate cross-reference extraction and retrieval against ground-truth helpful references; 2) Ablate evolution reasoning: Run on CR-focused QA with k3=0 vs. k3=5 to measure contribution of TDoc retrieval; 3) Test metadata extraction accuracy: Sample 50 chunks and 20 CRs; manually verify spec_id, cls_id, and rationale field extraction quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the specification-evolution reasoning module effectively generalize to other TDoc types, such as meeting minutes or technical reports, which lack the structured "reason for change" fields found in Change Requests? The authors state, "For TDocs, we currently include only CR-type documents. We have not evaluated on other TDoc types... so our claims should not be over-generalized."

### Open Question 2
How robust is the cross-reference resolution pipeline when processing 3GPP documents that contain atypical numbering or editorial inconsistencies? The limitations section notes that the method assumes consistent clause numbering, but "exceptions do occur (e.g., atypical numbering... or editorial inconsistencies). Such cases can reduce the reliability of linking."

### Open Question 3
To what extent do the reported performance gains reflect genuine reasoning capabilities versus the evaluator LLM's preference for fluent, citation-heavy text? The authors acknowledge that "LLM evaluators can reward fluency or plausible reasoning over our desired factors, and prompt bias may persist."

## Limitations
- Exact regex patterns and LLM prompts for metadata extraction are unspecified, critical for accurate cross-reference resolution
- Evaluation datasets are proprietary, preventing independent validation
- Performance depends on consistent citation patterns across all 3GPP documents, which may not hold for older or non-standard documents

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Cross-reference resolution improves retrieval recall (supported by microbenchmark), evolution-aware retrieval provides rationale not in specs (supported by rubric scores), metadata filtering improves precision in structured corpora
- **Medium confidence**: Overall QA performance claims vs. baselines (based on proprietary datasets), recursive resolution depth choice (no ablation shown), HyDE contribution (no zero-shot comparison)
- **Low confidence**: Exact implementation details for metadata extraction, regex patterns for cross-references, and LLM prompts for chunking

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the regex pattern for cross-reference extraction using 50 sample chunks from 3GPP specs to verify extraction accuracy and coverage
2. Conduct an ablation study on evolution reasoning by running the CR-focused QA with k3=0 vs. k3=5 to quantify the contribution of TDoc retrieval
3. Validate metadata extraction quality by manually checking 50 SpecDB chunks and 20 CRs for correct spec_id, cls_id, and rationale field extraction
