# MeniMV: A Multi-view Benchmark for Meniscus Injury Severity Grading

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.18437
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18437
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** MeniMV dataset provides 3,000 expert-annotated knee exams from 750 patients across three medical centers, totaling 6,000 co-registered sagittal and coronal T2-weighted images for meniscus injury severity grading.

## Executive Summary
MeniMV introduces a comprehensive multi-view knee MRI dataset specifically designed for meniscus injury severity grading. The dataset contains 3,000 expert-annotated knee exams from 750 patients across three medical centers, providing 6,000 co-registered sagittal and coronal T2-weighted images with four-tier severity labels (grades 0-3) for both anterior and posterior meniscal horns. This represents more than double the pathology-labeled data volume of previous datasets while uniquely capturing the dual-view diagnostic context essential in clinical practice. The dataset establishes strong baselines for automated musculoskeletal imaging analysis, with the pretrained Swin-UNETR encoder achieving the best performance at 76.92% accuracy, 0.6790 Macro-F1, and 0.51 MAE.

## Method Summary
The MeniMV dataset was constructed through systematic collection of knee MRI examinations from three medical centers, resulting in 3,000 expert-annotated cases from 750 patients. Each case includes co-registered sagittal and coronal T2-weighted images with four-tier severity labels (grades 0-3) for both anterior and posterior meniscal horns. Annotations were verified by senior orthopedic clinicians to ensure clinical accuracy. The dataset design emphasizes the importance of multi-view imaging for meniscus injury assessment, as clinicians typically require both sagittal and coronal views for accurate diagnosis. Various state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer-based models were benchmarked on this dataset to establish performance baselines, with particular attention to fine-grained severity grading challenges.

## Key Results
- Achieved 76.92% accuracy, 0.6790 Macro-F1, and 0.51 MAE using pretrained Swin-UNETR encoder
- Dataset more than doubles pathology-labeled data volume compared to prior meniscus grading datasets
- Establishes strong baseline performance for automated musculoskeletal imaging analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-view approach captures complementary anatomical information from both sagittal and coronal planes, which is essential for accurate meniscus injury assessment. The four-tier severity grading system provides granular classification that better reflects clinical decision-making compared to binary classification approaches. Large-scale pretraining of models like Swin-UNETR enables effective transfer learning to the specific domain of musculoskeletal imaging, where labeled data is traditionally limited.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-view imaging:** Why needed - captures complementary anatomical views for comprehensive diagnosis; Quick check - verify both sagittal and coronal views are available and properly registered
- **Severity grading scales:** Why needed - enables nuanced classification of pathology progression; Quick check - confirm grade definitions align with clinical standards
- **Cross-center data collection:** Why needed - improves generalizability across different imaging protocols; Quick check - assess consistency of annotations across centers
- **Transformer architectures:** Why needed - capture long-range spatial dependencies in medical images; Quick check - validate pretraining dataset relevance to target domain
- **Co-registration:** Why needed - ensures anatomical alignment between different views; Quick check - verify registration accuracy metrics
- **Medical image annotation:** Why needed - provides ground truth for supervised learning; Quick check - assess inter-rater agreement among annotators

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Raw MRI scans → Preprocessing/normalization → Co-registration → Feature extraction (CNN/Transformer) → Classification head → Severity grade prediction

**Critical Path:** The most critical components are the co-registration step ensuring anatomical alignment between views, followed by the feature extraction backbone (Swin-UNETR) that captures multi-scale spatial information, and finally the classification head that maps features to severity grades.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The dataset prioritizes clinical realism over synthetic augmentation, accepting the challenge of limited sample size rather than introducing artificial variability. The choice of T2-weighted imaging balances soft tissue contrast with clinical prevalence, though other sequences might capture different pathological features.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance typically manifests as confusion between adjacent severity grades (0↔1 or 2↔3), suggesting insufficient discriminative features or suboptimal feature extraction. Cross-center performance degradation indicates limited generalizability to different imaging protocols or scanner manufacturers.

**First Experiments:**
1. Train baseline CNN model (e.g., ResNet) to establish minimum performance threshold
2. Implement simple early-fusion of sagittal and coronal views to test multi-view benefit
3. Apply transfer learning from natural image pretraining vs. medical image pretraining to compare effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset focus on single institution's imaging protocols may limit generalizability to other MRI scanners or clinical settings
- Manual annotation process may introduce inter-rater variability not fully characterized
- Four-tier severity grading represents simplified binary classification in practice, potentially overlooking nuanced pathological features
- Relatively modest dataset size (750 patients) compared to large-scale natural image datasets
- Absence of longitudinal data prevents assessment of progression patterns or temporal dynamics

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Dataset construction methodology and annotation process conducted by multiple medical experts

**Medium confidence:** Benchmark results establish reasonable baselines but may not reflect optimal performance given dataset limitations

**Low confidence:** Claims about clinical utility lack validation in actual clinical workflows or comparison with radiologist performance

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance across different MRI scanner manufacturers and protocols to assess generalizability
2. Conduct inter-rater reliability analysis among multiple clinicians to quantify annotation consistency
3. Implement prospective clinical study comparing automated grading results with expert radiologist diagnoses in real patient cases
