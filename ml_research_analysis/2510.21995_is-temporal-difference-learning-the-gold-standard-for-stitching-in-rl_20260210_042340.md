# Is Temporal Difference Learning the Gold Standard for Stitching in RL?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21995
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21995
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: MC methods can achieve stitching comparable to TD methods, especially in generalized stitching regimes, with critic network scale being a more powerful lever than the TD vs MC choice

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that temporal difference (TD) learning is the gold standard for experience stitching in reinforcement learning. Through controlled experiments across three stitching regimes (no stitching, exact stitching, and generalized stitching), the authors compare TD and Monte Carlo (MC) methods while varying critic network scales. The results demonstrate that MC methods can achieve stitching performance comparable to TD methods, particularly in generalized stitching scenarios. While TD methods show slight advantages in exact stitching, their performance degrades with task complexity. Critically, increasing the scale of critic networks significantly improves stitching for both paradigms, suggesting that model capacity is more important than the choice between TD and MC learning.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce a controlled benchmark environment specifically designed to test stitching capabilities in reinforcement learning. They evaluate three stitching regimes: no stitching (independent episodes), exact stitching (reusing experiences from similar tasks), and generalized stitching (applying knowledge to novel but related tasks). The study compares TD and MC methods across these regimes while systematically varying the scale of critic networks. Performance is measured by the ability to leverage past experiences to accelerate learning on new tasks, with careful controls to isolate the effects of learning paradigm and model capacity from other factors.

## Key Results
- MC methods achieve stitching performance comparable to TD methods in generalized stitching regimes
- TD methods provide slight advantages in exact stitching but performance degrades with task complexity
- Increasing critic network scale significantly improves stitching performance for both TD and MC methods, narrowing the performance gap between them

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that the effectiveness of stitching depends more on the representational capacity of the critic network than on whether TD or MC updates are used. Both learning paradigms can effectively propagate value information backward through experiences when given sufficient model capacity. The slight advantage of TD in exact stitching likely comes from its ability to bootstrap from current estimates, while MC's strength in generalized stitching may stem from its unbiased returns providing better generalization across task variations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal Difference Learning**: Updates value estimates based on subsequent predictions rather than complete returns; needed for bootstrapping but introduces bias; quick check: verify bootstrapping equations
- **Monte Carlo Methods**: Uses complete returns from full episodes; needed for unbiased estimates; quick check: confirm proper episode termination handling
- **Experience Stitching**: Reusing past experiences across related tasks; needed for sample efficiency; quick check: verify task similarity metrics
- **Critic Networks**: Function approximators for value estimation; needed for generalization; quick check: validate network architectures
- **Task Complexity**: The difficulty and diversity of RL environments; needed to understand performance degradation; quick check: benchmark across complexity levels

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Experience Buffer -> Stitching Module -> Critic Network -> Policy Network

**Critical Path**
1. Collect experiences from tasks
2. Apply stitching mechanism to transfer knowledge
3. Update critic using TD or MC updates
4. Derive policy from updated value estimates

**Design Tradeoffs**
- TD vs MC: Bias-variance tradeoff affecting convergence speed and generalization
- Network Scale: Computational cost vs stitching performance
- Stitching Regime: Task similarity requirements vs learning efficiency

**Failure Signatures**
- TD methods: Overfitting to exact task matches, poor generalization
- MC methods: High variance in value estimates, slower initial learning
- Both: Insufficient network capacity leading to poor value function approximation

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Compare TD vs MC stitching in exact regime with small critic networks
2. Test MC stitching in generalized regime with large critic networks
3. Vary network scale systematically for both TD and MC in mixed stitching scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The benchmark environment may not generalize to all RL domains
- Focus on relatively simple environments that might not capture real-world stitching challenges
- Empirical results may not hold across all possible RL scenarios or architectural choices

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |

| TD methods provide slight advantages in exact stitching | Medium |
| Increasing critic network scale significantly improves stitching for both TD and MC methods | High |

## Next Checks
1. Test proposed methods and conclusions in more complex, real-world RL environments to assess generalizability
2. Investigate impact of different network architectures and hyperparameters on stitching performance gap between TD and MC methods
3. Explore potential of hybrid approaches combining elements of both TD and MC learning to optimize stitching performance across various task complexities
