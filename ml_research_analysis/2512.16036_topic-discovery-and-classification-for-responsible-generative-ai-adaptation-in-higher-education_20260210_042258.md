# Topic Discovery and Classification for Responsible Generative AI Adaptation in Higher Education

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16036
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16036
- Reference count: 40
- The system achieved coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery and classification precision/recall ranging from 0.92-0.97 and 0.85-0.97, respectively, across eight policy categories.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a scalable system for topic discovery and classification of generative AI policies in higher education. Using unsupervised topic modeling (BERTopic) and LLM-based classification (GPT-4.0), the authors analyzed AI-related policy statements from course syllabi and institutional websites. The system achieved strong performance metrics and helps institutions interpret and standardize AI policies, supporting responsible AI integration in educational settings.

## Method Summary
The authors employed a two-stage approach: first using BERTopic for unsupervised topic modeling to discover policy themes, then applying GPT-4.0 for classification into eight predefined policy categories. The methodology combined document clustering with semantic similarity analysis to process AI-related policy statements from diverse educational sources.

## Key Results
- Achieved coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery
- Classification precision ranged from 0.92-0.97 across categories
- Classification recall ranged from 0.85-0.97 across categories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from combining complementary approaches: BERTopic's unsupervised topic modeling captures emergent themes without requiring labeled training data, while GPT-4.0's advanced language understanding enables accurate classification into specific policy categories. This dual approach handles the complexity and variability of institutional AI policies while maintaining high accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- Topic Modeling (BERTopic): Unsupervised method for discovering thematic structures in document collections; needed to identify policy themes without manual labeling; quick check: validate coherence scores across different parameter settings
- LLM Classification (GPT-4.0): Fine-tuned language model for categorizing text; needed for accurate policy classification into predefined categories; quick check: compare classification performance against smaller models
- Policy Standardization: Process of creating consistent frameworks from diverse institutional policies; needed to enable meaningful comparison and aggregation; quick check: test system on policies from institutions with varying governance structures

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Data Collection -> BERTopic Topic Modeling -> GPT-4.0 Classification -> Policy Standardization

Critical Path: The pipeline processes raw policy documents through topic discovery before classification, ensuring that thematic context informs category assignment. This sequential approach prevents premature categorization that might miss nuanced policy distinctions.

Design Tradeoffs: The system prioritizes interpretability and standardization over real-time processing speed. Using GPT-4.0 enables high accuracy but introduces computational costs and potential bias toward Western educational contexts.

Failure Signatures: Low coherence scores indicate poor topic separation; inconsistent classification suggests policy language ambiguity; systematic misclassification may reveal cultural or institutional biases in the model.

First Experiments:
1. Run BERTopic with different n_neighbors parameters to optimize topic separation
2. Test GPT-4.0 classification with varying temperature settings to balance precision and recall
3. Compare performance on course-level versus institutional policies to identify domain-specific challenges

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exclusive focus on English-language policies may miss diverse international approaches
- Reliance on GPT-4.0 may introduce Western educational context bias
- Analysis represents a temporal snapshot of rapidly evolving AI policies

## Confidence
High for technical methodology and performance metrics. Medium for generalizability across different institutional contexts and policy domains. Low for long-term stability as AI policy language evolves rapidly.

## Next Checks
1. Cross-validation with institutional policies from non-English speaking countries to assess cultural and linguistic generalizability of the classification system
2. Longitudinal tracking of policy changes over time to evaluate system's adaptability to evolving AI governance frameworks
3. User testing with educational administrators to assess practical utility and identify gaps in policy coverage that may not be captured by current topic categories
