# A Text-Based Knowledge-Embedded Soft Sensing Modeling Approach for General Industrial Process Tasks Based on Large Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.05075
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05075
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LLM-TKESS framework uses large language models to solve soft sensor modeling challenges in industrial processes through cross-modal knowledge transfer and few-shot learning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LLM-TKESS, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address key challenges in soft sensor modeling for industrial processes. The approach tackles limited model universality, single-modal inputs, and poor few-shot learning capabilities that plague traditional data-driven soft sensors. By encoding process knowledge as text prompts and auxiliary variables as token embeddings, the framework enables LLMs to perform cross-modal knowledge transfer and achieve strong few-shot learning performance across diverse industrial tasks.

The framework demonstrates significant improvements in soft sensing accuracy for rotor thermal deformation prediction in air preheaters, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 10-26% in RMSE while maintaining performance with only 10% of training data. Two text-based knowledge-embedded soft sensors are proposed - LLM-PSS and LLM-PDSS - which incorporate both natural language prompts and domain knowledge alongside process data. The approach also shows effectiveness in handling anomaly detection and missing value imputation tasks, making it a versatile solution for general industrial process monitoring and control.

## Method Summary
The LLM-TKESS framework employs a two-stage fine-tuning process to adapt LLMs for industrial soft sensing tasks. First, auxiliary process variables are encoded into token embeddings using a proposed auxiliary variable series encoder (A VS Encoder). The LLM is then fine-tuned through autoregressive alignment to adapt to process data patterns. For specific downstream tasks, task-specific adapters are employed to optimize performance. The framework incorporates text-based knowledge through natural language prompts that describe process characteristics and domain expertise, enabling cross-modal knowledge transfer from textual descriptions to numerical process data.

Two specific soft sensor implementations are proposed: LLM-PSS (Process Soft Sensor) and LLM-PDSS (Process Data Soft Sensor). These models leverage the fine-tuned LLM along with encoded auxiliary variables and text prompts to predict key process variables that are difficult or expensive to measure directly. The approach eliminates the need for extensive data normalization while maintaining competitive performance, addressing the challenge of adapting LLMs designed for natural language tasks to numerical industrial process data.

## Key Results
- LLM-PDSS and LLM-DSS outperform state-of-the-art methods by 10-26% in RMSE on rotor thermal deformation prediction
- Framework maintains strong performance with only 10% of training data, demonstrating excellent few-shot learning capabilities
- LLM-PSS achieves competitive results using only text prompts without data normalization, simplifying deployment
- Successfully handles anomaly detection and missing value imputation tasks beyond basic soft sensing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging LLMs' general problem-solving capabilities and cross-modal knowledge transfer abilities. By encoding process variables as token embeddings and incorporating domain knowledge through text prompts, the LLM can learn to map complex process relationships without requiring extensive task-specific training data. The two-stage fine-tuning approach first adapts the LLM to process data patterns through autoregressive alignment, then optimizes for specific tasks using adapters, allowing the model to maintain generalization while achieving task-specific performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Auxiliary Variable Encoding**: Process variables must be converted to token embeddings for LLM consumption - critical for bridging numerical data with language models
- **Cross-modal Knowledge Transfer**: Text prompts containing domain knowledge enable the LLM to understand process context beyond raw numerical patterns
- **Adapter-based Fine-tuning**: Task-specific adapters allow efficient adaptation without full model retraining, reducing computational overhead
- **Few-shot Learning**: LLM's inherent ability to learn from limited examples addresses data scarcity in industrial settings
- **Autoregressive Alignment**: Initial fine-tuning stage adapts LLM to sequential process data patterns before task-specific optimization
- **Knowledge-Embedded Prompting**: Natural language descriptions of process behavior guide the LLM's reasoning beyond pattern matching

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Process Data -> A VS Encoder -> Token Embeddings -> LLM (Fine-tuned) -> Task Adapters -> Soft Sensing Output

**Critical Path**: The essential workflow flows from raw process measurements through the auxiliary variable encoder to generate token embeddings, which are then processed by the fine-tuned LLM with knowledge-embedded prompts to produce soft sensing predictions. The two-stage fine-tuning (autoregressive alignment followed by task adapters) represents the critical adaptation mechanism.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead of LLM fine-tuning against improved model universality and few-shot learning. While traditional models require extensive retraining for new tasks, LLM-TKESS achieves adaptation through adapter modules, reducing training costs but requiring more powerful inference hardware. The text-based knowledge encoding eliminates data normalization needs but introduces dependency on prompt quality and domain expertise.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when process knowledge cannot be effectively captured in text prompts, when auxiliary variables fail to encode critical process dynamics, or when the LLM's general reasoning capabilities don't align with specific industrial process characteristics. Limited generalization beyond the training domain and sensitivity to prompt engineering quality represent potential failure modes.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Validate A VS Encoder effectiveness by comparing soft sensing performance with and without encoded auxiliary variables
2. Test framework robustness by gradually reducing training data percentage from 100% to 10% to quantify few-shot learning capabilities
3. Perform ablation study removing text-based knowledge prompts to measure their contribution to overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation confined to single industrial process (air preheater rotor thermal deformation), limiting generalizability across manufacturing domains
- Heavy reliance on text-based prompts introduces potential brittleness dependent on prompt engineering skill and domain expertise
- Computational overhead of fine-tuning large language models and inference latency not addressed for industrial deployment
- Framework robustness to concept drift and changing process conditions over extended operational periods requires further investigation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Framework architecture design and core methodology
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance improvements on test dataset (limited to single case study)
- **Medium Confidence**: Few-shot learning capabilities (demonstrated only at 10% data level)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-facility validation using air preheater datasets from multiple industrial sites to assess generalizability
2. Test framework performance on at least two additional industrial process types (e.g., chemical reactor temperature prediction, rolling mill thickness control)
3. Perform ablation studies removing the text-based knowledge components to quantify their actual contribution versus pure LLM adaptation
