# The Feasibility of Training Sovereign Language Models in the Global South: A Study of Brazil and Mexico

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19801
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19801
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: H100-based sovereign LLM training feasible at $8-14M, well below infrastructure thresholds

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the feasibility of training sovereign-scale language models in Brazil and Mexico under hardware and energy constraints. Using a dual-axis design varying accelerator type (H100 vs A100) and training duration (90 vs 150 days), it estimates compute demand, energy use, capital costs, and regulatory compatibility for a 10-trillion-token model. Results show that H100-based deployments are fiscally viable at 8-14 million USD, while A100 configurations cost 19-32 million USD due to higher hardware and energy needs. All scenarios remain below export-control and infrastructure thresholds. Extending training timelines is identified as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints, enabling usable, locally aligned AI capabilities without requiring frontier-level compute.

## Method Summary
The study uses a dual-axis experimental design with four scenarios: H100 vs A100 accelerators, each with 90-day vs 150-day training windows. Total compute budget is fixed at 3.0×10²⁴ FLOPs (DeepSeek-V3 scale). GPU count is calculated as Total FLOPs / (training_seconds × peak_TFLOPs × MFU), where MFU = 0.552. Energy consumption uses TDP × PUE × days × 24 / 10⁶, with PUE = 1.3. Capital expenditures include GPU prices ($33K H100, $12K A100) plus 30% integration overhead and country-specific tariffs (16% Brazil, 0% Mexico). Operational expenditures are based on electricity rates ($110/MWh Brazil, $88/MWh Mexico). All scenarios are evaluated against constraints: 50K GPU export cap, 10MW power ceiling, and $52M fiscal ceiling.

## Key Results
- H100 configurations require 8-14 million USD and are technically and fiscally viable
- A100 deployments require 19-32 million USD, making them less attractive due to higher energy and hardware demand
- Peak loads (0.41-1.49 MW) remain within medium-voltage distribution infrastructure limits
- Extending training from 90 to 150 days reduces GPU requirements by roughly 40% across both hardware classes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hardware efficiency (FLOPs per GPU) determines fiscal viability more than raw hardware cost. Higher-throughput accelerators (H100 at 2,000 TFLOPs vs A100 at 312 TFLOPs) reduce total GPU count needed for a fixed compute budget. Fewer GPUs lower both capital expenditure and cumulative energy draw, even when individual units are more expensive. Core assumption: Model FLOP Utilization (MFU) remains approximately constant across hardware generations (assumed 0.552). Break condition: If MFU degrades significantly on older hardware under real workloads, A100 costs would exceed projections.

### Mechanism 2
Extending training timelines offsets hardware scarcity without proportional cost increase. Compute demand is fixed (3.0×10²⁴ FLOPs). Spreading this over more days reduces peak GPU count (by ~40% from 90 to 150 days), which lowers peak electrical load and CAPEX. OPEX increases modestly with duration but remains minor relative to hardware costs. Core assumption: Extended training windows remain operationally feasible. Break condition: If longer training introduces proportional overhead or model quality degrades from extended schedules.

### Mechanism 3
Medium-voltage industrial grid infrastructure can support sovereign-scale training without dedicated substations. Peak loads (0.41-1.49 MW across all scenarios) remain below the 10 MW formal limit and the 1 MW practical threshold for simplified permitting in urban industrial zones. This avoids high-voltage interconnection costs. Core assumption: Local grid studies accurately reflect deployable capacity. Break condition: If actual grid reliability is lower than planning documents suggest, or if local utilities impose additional derating factors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Model FLOP Utilization (MFU)**: Raw peak TFLOPs overstate real throughput. The paper applies 0.552 MFU to reflect communication overhead, memory bottlenecks, and optimization inefficiencies. Quick check: If you assumed 100% MFU, would your GPU count estimate be too high or too low? (Answer: too low—you'd underestimate GPUs needed.)

- **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)**: GPU TDP alone underestimates total facility power. PUE (1.3 in this study) accounts for cooling, power conversion, and overhead. Quick check: A cluster drawing 1 MW of compute power at PUE 1.3 consumes how much total from the grid? (Answer: 1.3 MW.)

- **"Strategically sufficient" vs. "frontier" models**: The paper explicitly targets non-frontier models (DeepSeek-V3 scale: ~10× less compute than GPT-4) that still support governance, education, and local alignment. This reframes feasibility away from frontier competitiveness. Quick check: Why does targeting a "usable" model rather than a "frontier" model change the fiscal equation for Global South countries? (Answer: Compute budget drops by an order of magnitude, making sovereign training tractable.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Accelerators (H100/A100) -> Supporting infrastructure (CPUs, memory, SSDs, NICs, chassis) -> Power/cooling (medium-voltage grid + PUE-adjusted cooling) -> Data pipeline (10T token corpus) -> Software stack (Transformer Engine + training framework)

- **Critical path**: 1. Fix compute budget (3.0×10²⁴ FLOPs) 2. Choose hardware generation based on availability and fiscal ceiling 3. Select training duration (90 or 150 days) 4. Calculate GPU count: GPUs = Total FLOPs / (Training_time_s × Peak_TFLOPs × MFU) 5. Verify peak load < 1 MW (practical) or < 10 MW (formal) 6. Sum CAPEX and OPEX

- **Design tradeoffs**: H100 vs. A100: H100 offers 6× throughput per GPU but may face export friction; A100 is more available but requires 6× units, raising CAPEX and peak load. 90d vs. 150d: Shorter timeline reduces operational risk; longer timeline reduces GPU count and CAPEX by ~40%. Brazil vs. Mexico: Brazil's 16% import tariff adds ~$1-2M to CAPEX; Mexico's 0% tariff is favorable.

- **Failure signatures**: Peak load exceeds 1 MW (triggers permitting delays); GPU count approaches export ceiling (50,000, not binding here); OPEX exceeds 5% of total cost (indicates underestimated energy prices or PUE).

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Validate MFU on target hardware with small-scale benchmark (1B parameter model) 2. Obtain grid capacity confirmation from local utilities for target sites 3. Confirm current GPU pricing including tariffs and lead times for Brazil and Mexico

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Do "strategically sufficient" models (e.g., 671B parameters) actually meet the performance requirements for local institutional tasks like legal reasoning? The paper models the feasibility of training a generic model of this scale, not the efficacy of the resulting model in domain-specific, local language applications.

- How do inference and deployment costs compare to the training expenditures modeled in this study? The study focuses exclusively on training costs, omitting the costs associated with running the model post-training, which may be a significant recurring expense.

- What are the hidden computational and fiscal costs of curating the 10-trillion-token dataset required for these models? The methodology assumes a fixed compute budget but does not model the cost of creating, cleaning, or filtering that dataset, which may be a significant hidden cost center.

## Limitations
- Core findings rest on parameter assumptions (MFU, energy pricing, integration overhead) that carry inherent uncertainty
- Grid capacity analysis relies heavily on planning documents without site-specific validation
- Absence of validation for sovereign AI training in Global South contexts means practical constraints are not fully characterized

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The relative comparison between H100 and A100 configurations is robust, as the 6× efficiency gap is hardware-determined.
- **Medium Confidence**: Absolute cost estimates carry moderate uncertainty due to sensitive dependence on MFU, electricity rates, and integration overhead.
- **Low Confidence**: The grid capacity analysis relies on planning documents without validation through site-specific utility engagement.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct benchmark training runs (e.g., 1B parameter model) on representative H100 and A100 hardware to measure actual model FLOP utilization under conditions matching the study's assumptions.
2. Obtain formal grid capacity letters or letters of intent from utilities serving target industrial zones for the peak loads identified in each scenario.
3. Survey current GPU availability, pricing (including shipping and tariffs), and lead times for Brazil and Mexico; validate the 30% integration overhead assumption with local system integrators.
