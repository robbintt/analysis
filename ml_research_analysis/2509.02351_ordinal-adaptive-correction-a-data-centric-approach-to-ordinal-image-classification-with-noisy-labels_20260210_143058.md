# Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02351
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02351
- Authors: Alireza Sedighi Moghaddam; Mohammad Reza Mohammadi
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: ORDAC framework corrects noisy ordinal labels using Gaussian distributions with dynamic updates, significantly outperforming baselines on Adience and Diabetic Retinopathy datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ORDinal Adaptive Correction (ORDAC), a data-centric framework for correcting noisy ordinal labels in image classification. ORDAC represents labels as Gaussian distributions with dynamically updated means and standard deviations, using model predictions in a cross-validation setup to iteratively refine label quality. Unlike sample selection methods, it preserves and improves the entire dataset. Experiments on Adience (age estimation) and Diabetic Retinopathy (disease severity) datasets show that ORDAC significantly outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art sample selection methods under various noise rates.

## Method Summary
ORDAC represents ordinal labels as Gaussian distributions parameterized by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). The framework operates in a cross-validation setup where model predictions are used to update these parameters iteratively. During training, predictions from different folds inform the correction of labels in held-out data. The correction process preserves all samples while improving label quality through adaptive updates based on model uncertainty and prediction confidence. This data-centric approach contrasts with sample selection methods that discard potentially useful but noisy samples.

## Key Results
- On Adience dataset with 40% noise: ORDAC reduces MAE from 0.86 to 0.62 and increases recall from 0.37 to 0.49
- Outperforms state-of-the-art sample selection methods across all tested noise rates (20%, 40%, 60%)
- Successfully corrects inherent noise in original datasets, demonstrating practical utility beyond synthetic noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ORDAC works by leveraging the ordinal structure of labels and treating them probabilistically as Gaussian distributions rather than fixed values. This representation captures uncertainty and allows for gradual correction based on model predictions. The cross-validation setup ensures that label corrections are informed by multiple model perspectives, reducing bias from any single training run. By preserving all samples and iteratively refining labels, the method avoids information loss inherent in sample selection approaches while progressively improving label quality through model feedback.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data → Gaussian Label Representation → Cross-Validation Training → Prediction-based Updates → Corrected Labels → Final Model

**Critical Path:** The core innovation lies in the iterative loop where model predictions inform label corrections, which in turn improve model training. This feedback mechanism requires careful synchronization between training folds and label update schedules to prevent information leakage.

**Design Tradeoffs:** ORDAC trades computational efficiency for label quality improvement. The cross-validation setup requires multiple training runs, making it more expensive than single-pass methods. However, this cost is justified by the significant performance gains and preservation of all training samples, which is particularly valuable when data is limited.

**Failure Signatures:** The method may struggle with non-Gaussian ordinal structures or when noise patterns are highly class-dependent. If the initial label distribution assumptions are far from reality, convergence may be slow or lead to suboptimal corrections. Additionally, the approach requires sufficient model capacity to learn meaningful corrections from noisy data.

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Baseline comparison on Adience with 40% noise using standard ordinal regression vs. ORDAC
2. Ablation study removing cross-validation to test impact of multi-perspective corrections
3. Test on a third ordinal dataset (e.g., AgeDB) to validate generalizability beyond the two presented datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluated primarily on two ordinal classification datasets, limiting generalizability to other domains
- Assumes ordinal labels follow Gaussian distributions, which may not hold for complex ordinal structures
- Cross-validation setup requires significant computational resources and multiple training runs
- Method's sensitivity to hyperparameters (initial σ, update rate) is not thoroughly explored

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core methodology of using Gaussian distributions for ordinal label representation and the iterative correction process are well-founded and theoretically sound.

**Medium Confidence:** The experimental results showing improvements over baselines are compelling, but the limited dataset diversity and potential hyperparameter sensitivity warrant cautious interpretation.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that ORDAC preserves and improves the entire dataset is supported by experiments, but further validation on diverse datasets would strengthen this assertion.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate ORDAC on additional ordinal classification datasets from different domains (e.g., medical imaging, sentiment analysis) to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct an ablation study to determine the impact of each component (Gaussian representation, dynamic updates, cross-validation) on overall performance.

3. Test ORDAC's robustness to varying noise patterns (e.g., class-dependent noise, asymmetric noise) beyond the uniform noise rates considered in the current experiments.
