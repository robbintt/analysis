core_contribution: This paper introduces PAGE, a framework designed to enhance text
  generation from large language models (LLMs) by using simple auxiliary modules like
  classifiers or extractors. These lightweight models provide structured inferences
  from the input text, which are then incorporated into the prompt to improve generation
  quality and controllability.

# PAGE: Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13880
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13880
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Auxiliary modules improve LLM generation quality by 66.72% (ROUGE1), 209.54% (ROUGE2), and 95.21% (ROUGEL) recall

## Executive Summary
PAGE is a framework that enhances text generation from large language models by using lightweight auxiliary modules like classifiers or extractors. These modules provide structured inferences from input text, which are incorporated into prompts to improve generation quality and controllability. Unlike other approaches, PAGE does not require auxiliary generative models, offering a simpler, modular architecture adaptable to various tasks. A proof-of-concept in requirements engineering showed significant improvements in ROUGE metrics compared to baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
PAGE uses auxiliary modules (classifiers or extractors) to provide structured inferences from input text. These inferences are incorporated into prompts via a template-based Prompt Composer, which merges auxiliary outputs with the original input. The enriched prompt is then fed to a generative model (e.g., Llama 3.1 8B) to produce structured outputs. The framework was tested on software requirements generation using EARS syntax templates, with a Random Forest classifier trained on 253 instances to categorize requirements into 5 EARS categories.

## Key Results
- ROUGE-1 recall improved by 66.72% compared to baseline
- ROUGE-2 recall improved by 209.54% compared to baseline
- ROUGE-L recall improved by 95.21% compared to baseline
- Classifier accuracy of 82.35% was sufficient to improve generation quality
- PAGE provides a simpler alternative to approaches using auxiliary generative models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Structured auxiliary inferences injected into prompts reduce output ambiguity and improve format compliance. A lightweight classifier processes raw input and produces structured labels, which are templated into prompts to give LLMs explicit semantic and syntactic constraints.

### Mechanism 2
Few-shot examples selected by the auxiliary module provide stronger in-context steering than generic zero-shot prompts. The classifier maps input to a category, triggering retrieval of category-specific examples that reduce the LLM's tendency toward generic outputs.

### Mechanism 3
Modular separation of inference (auxiliary) and generation (LLM) enables resource-efficient adaptation without fine-tuning the main model. The auxiliary module handles task-specific classification with minimal compute, while the frozen LLM remains unchanged.

## Foundational Learning

- **Few-shot in-context learning**: Why needed - PAGE relies on injecting examples into prompts to guide LLM output format; Quick check - Can you explain why few-shot prompting outperforms zero-shot for structured generation tasks?

- **Text classification with limited data**: Why needed - The auxiliary module uses a Random Forest classifier trained on 253 instances; Quick check - What techniques help prevent overfitting when training classifiers on small text corpora?

- **Prompt engineering elements (instruction, context, input, output format)**: Why needed - PAGE's Prompt Composer constructs enriched prompts using templates; Quick check - What are the four recommended elements of a prompt, and which does PAGE's template emphasize?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input text -> Auxiliary Module (classification) -> Example retrieval based on label -> Prompt Composer (template merge) -> Generative Model -> Structured output

- **Critical path**: Input text → Auxiliary Module (classification) → Example retrieval based on label → Prompt Composer (template merge) → Generative Model → Structured output

- **Design tradeoffs**: Classifier complexity vs. interpretability (Random Forest chosen for small-data robustness), template rigidity vs. flexibility, frozen LLM vs. fine-tuning (avoids compute costs but relies on prompt quality)

- **Failure signatures**: Misclassification cascade (wrong auxiliary label → wrong examples → wrong output syntax), generic outputs (if examples are missing or mismatched), template overflow (overly long prompts with many examples)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Run zero-shot (no auxiliary) vs. PAGE on held-out test set; measure ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L recall
  2. Auxiliary accuracy sweep: Vary classifier accuracy and measure downstream generation quality to quantify sensitivity
  3. Example count ablation: Test 0-shot, 1-shot, 2-shot, and 5-shot configurations to find optimal number of examples per category

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does PAGE perform across different domains beyond requirements engineering and with larger datasets? The authors state results "suggest the convenience of extending validation toward datasets with more requirements and in different domains" but the proof-of-concept was limited to a single domain using only 253 instances.

### Open Question 2
How does PAGE compare to approaches that use auxiliary generative models rather than simple classifiers? The paper discusses related work (IAG, Auxiliary Tuning, Awakening Augmented Generation) but does not experimentally compare PAGE against these baselines.

### Open Question 3
What is the relationship between auxiliary module accuracy and final generation quality, and how can error propagation be mitigated? The authors note that "when classification fails, it leads the generative model to a wrong syntactic structure" but do not quantify this sensitivity.

### Open Question 4
Does PAGE generalize across different LLM architectures and sizes? Only Llama 3.1 (8B parameters) was tested, though the framework claims to work with "any LLM capable of producing text from a prompt."

## Limitations
- Prompt template string not disclosed, only referenced in Figure 4
- Classifier accuracy of 82.35% introduces potential performance ceiling
- No comparison against fine-tuned models or other prompt augmentation methods
- Inference parameters for Llama 3.1 8B (temperature, top_p, max_tokens) not specified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core PAGE framework architecture and its modular separation of auxiliary inference from generation is clearly described and logically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The reported ROUGE improvements are methodologically valid given the described setup, though absolute values depend on undisclosed prompt templates and inference settings
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability claim to other tasks/domains beyond requirements engineering is supported only by design rationale rather than empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on classifier accuracy**: Systematically vary the auxiliary module's accuracy (e.g., by adding label noise) and measure the correlation with downstream generation quality to quantify sensitivity to misclassification

2. **Prompt template verification**: Reconstruct the exact prompt template from the paper's description and Figure 4, then test whether the reported ROUGE improvements are reproducible with the same template

3. **Baseline expansion**: Implement and compare against additional baselines including (a) direct few-shot prompting without auxiliary modules, and (b) fine-tuned models on the same dataset to establish relative performance
