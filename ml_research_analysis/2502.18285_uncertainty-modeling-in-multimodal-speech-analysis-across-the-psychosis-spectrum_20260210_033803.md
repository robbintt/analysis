# Uncertainty Modeling in Multimodal Speech Analysis Across the Psychosis Spectrum

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.18285
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18285
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: F1-score of 83% with Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 4.5e-2

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of capturing subtle speech disruptions across the psychosis spectrum by developing an uncertainty-aware model integrating acoustic and linguistic features. The model employs Temporal Context Fusion (TCF) with uncertainty modeling to dynamically adjust to task structures and quantify reliability differences in speech markers. Tested on 114 participants, including those with early psychosis and varying levels of schizotypy, the model achieved robust performance across different interaction contexts while providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.

## Method Summary
The method integrates acoustic features (OpenSMILE eGeMAPS, DeepSpectrum DenseNet201 on Mel-spectrograms, wav2vec 2.0 embeddings) with linguistic features (XLM-RoBERTa-base embeddings) through Temporal Context Fusion. Unimodal latent distributions are modeled as multivariate normals with input-dependent covariance, enabling variance-weighted fusion where fusion weights are calculated as inverse variance norms. The model incorporates calibration and ordinality constraints via symmetric KL divergence to ensure uncertainty estimates correlate with actual prediction errors. Five-fold cross-validation evaluates classification (low schizotypy, high schizotypy, psychosis) and regression (PANSS, MSS, O-LIFE symptom scores) tasks.

## Key Results
- F1-score of 83% with Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 4.5e-2
- Dynamic adaptation to interaction contexts, with acoustic features weighted more in structured settings and linguistic features in unstructured contexts
- Robust performance across diverse speech tasks including structured interviews, autobiographical narratives, TAT, and DISCOURSE sessions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The model improves robustness by dynamically down-weighting noisy or unreliable modalities (acoustic or linguistic) based on learned variance.
- **Mechanism:** The Temporal Context Fusion (TCF) treats modality representations not as fixed points but as distributions $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$. It calculates fusion weights ($w_A, w_T$) using the inverse of the variance norms ($\|\Sigma\|_2$). If a specific speech segment is noisy (high variance $\Sigma_A$), the weight for that modality decreases, shifting reliance to the text modality for that specific timestep.
- **Core assumption:** The assumption is that data noise (aleatoric uncertainty) is predictable from the input features (heteroscedasticity), and that variance correlates negatively with information quality.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...quantifying uncertainty in specific modalities allows the model to address speech variability, improving prediction accuracy."
  - [section 3.3.1]: "The fusion weights for a modality ($w^M_i$) at time step $i$ were calculated as... assigning a higher weight to the modality with lower variance."
  - [corpus]: Corpus neighbors (e.g., "Bridging the Perceptual-Statistical Gap") confirm that acoustic variability is a major hurdle in clinical speech analysis, validating the need for noise-aware weighting.
- **Break condition:** If the variance estimator fails to discriminate between "noise" and "symptom-related variability" (e.g., mistaking flat affect for low-information silence), the fusion weights will be misaligned, potentially degrading performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The architecture adapts to interaction contexts (structured vs. unstructured) by learning context-specific uncertainty profiles.
- **Mechanism:** Different interaction types (e.g., PANSS interviews vs. TAT narratives) elicit different speech patterns. The model appears to learn that structured contexts provide cleaner acoustic data (lower uncertainty) while unstructured contexts rely more on linguistic coherence. By observing the fusion weights in Section 4.2, the model effectively shifts priority: "weighting acoustic features more in structured settings and linguistic features in unstructured contexts."
- **Core assumption:** Symptom manifestation is context-dependent, meaning the signal-to-noise ratio of a modality changes based on the task (interview vs. narrative).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The model dynamically adjusted to task structures, weighting acoustic features more in structured settings..."
  - [section 4.3 / Figure 2]: "In Semi-structured Interviews, text consistently receives higher weights... By contrast, speech is weighted higher in topics such as 'Hobbies and Leisure'..."
  - [corpus]: "Reading Between the Lines" supports the importance of task design (pause dynamics vs. semantics) in detecting thought disorder.
- **Break condition:** If the training data is heavily skewed toward one interaction type, the learned uncertainty priors may fail to generalize to novel contexts (e.g., failing to weigh linguistic features heavily enough in a purely free-form conversation).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Explicit regularization constraints force the model's confidence estimates to align with actual error rates.
- **Mechanism:** The system employs a Calibration and Ordinality loss ($L_{CO}$) using KL divergence. This forces the model to output high variance (uncertainty) only when the prediction error ($e$) is actually high. This ensures that the "uncertainty" signal is semantically meaningful rather than just a mathematical artifact.
- **Core assumption:** Without explicit supervision, neural networks tend to be overconfident; the relationship between learned variance and true error must be enforced.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...achieving an F1-score of 83% with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 4.5e-2..."
  - [section 3.3.1]: "Calibration Constraint... encourages a correlation between the variance norms and the prediction errors... Ordinality Constraint... enforces a ranking among uncertainties."
  - [corpus]: Corpus evidence on uncertainty modeling in speech (e.g., "Data-Efficient ASR Personalization") suggests uncertainty scores are valuable but require careful calibration to be useful for downstream tasks.
- **Break condition:** If the KL divergence loss is weighted too heavily relative to the primary prediction loss, the model might prioritize "playing it safe" (outputting high variance to satisfy calibration) over learning discriminative features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Heteroscedastic Aleatoric Uncertainty**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly models input-dependent noise. In psychosis speech, "noise" isn't constant—it spikes during disorganized thoughts or recording artifacts. Understanding this distinguishes a "confident wrong prediction" from an "honest uncertainty."
  - **Quick check question:** If a speaker pauses for 5 seconds, should the model variance go up or down? (Assumption: Up, due to lack of signal/drift).

- **Concept:** **Multimodal Fusion Strategies (Early vs. Late vs. Hybrid)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper compares Early, Late, and Temporal Context Fusion. You must understand why simple concatenation (Early) fails here—it cannot handle the temporal desynchronization between audio features and text transcriptions.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does Late Fusion struggle with the "DISCOURSE" tasks in the paper? (Answer: It averages probabilities at the end, missing the temporal interplay where audio might be noisy at time $t$ but text is clear).

- **Concept:** **Latent Distribution Modeling**
  - **Why needed here:** The TCF architecture doesn't just output a vector; it outputs a mean ($\mu$) and covariance ($\Sigma$). You need to understand how sampling or using $\Sigma$ as a feature enables the "uncertainty" mechanism.
  - **Quick check question:** In the formula $h^M_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu^M_i, \Sigma^M_i)$, what does a diagonal vs. full covariance matrix imply about feature dependencies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Audio pipeline (OpenSMILE/wav2vec) -> Projection Layer -> Latent Distribution ($\mu$, $\Sigma$) -> TCF Block -> Fusion Weights -> Output. Text pipeline (XLM-RoBERTa) -> Projection Layer -> Latent Distribution ($\mu$, $\Sigma$) -> TCF Block -> Fusion Weights -> Output.

- **Critical path:** The accuracy of the **Uncertainty Estimator** (the path generating $\Sigma$) is the critical novelty. If this path fails, the fusion weights ($w_A, w_T$) default to random or static values, and the system degrades to a standard (ineffective) fusion model.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - *Computational Cost:* Modeling distributions ($\Sigma$) and calculating KL divergence is more expensive than standard fusion.
  - *Stability:* The "Ordinality Constraint" relies on ranking errors. In small datasets (n=114), unstable gradients from the KL loss could destabilize training.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Collapsed Variance:** The model learns to set $\Sigma \approx 0$ for all inputs (overconfidence). *Fix:* Increase weight of Calibration loss.
  - **Static Weights:** Fusion weights $w_A \approx w_T$ across all tasks. *Fix:* Check if the unimodal encoders are frozen or if gradients are flowing to the variance heads.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Ablation):** Run TCF with and without the Calibration/Ordinality loss to isolate the impact on ECE (Expected Calibration Error).
  2. **Modality Dropout:** Force the audio input to be pure noise for a batch and verify that the fusion weight $w_A$ drops toward 0 (testing the dynamic weighting mechanism).
  3. **Cross-Context Transfer:** Train on PANSS (structured) and test on DISCOURSE (unstructured). Check if the fusion weights shift as described in the paper (Section 4.3), specifically looking for an increase in linguistic weighting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the uncertainty-aware TCF model generalize across languages and cultural contexts beyond German?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper states that "variability in speech production across tasks, linguistic backgrounds, and recording conditions challenges generalizability" and "adapting them to diverse populations remains crucial." All data was collected in German.
- **Why unresolved:** Cross-linguistic validation was not performed; acoustic and linguistic markers of psychosis may manifest differently across languages and cultures.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** External validation applying the model to speech data in other languages (e.g., English, Spanish) with comparable clinical populations, comparing F1-scores and ECE metrics.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do speech markers remain stable over time within individuals, and can they predict symptom trajectories or relapse?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state "Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies and real-world applications to refine these methods and improve clinical decision-making."
- **Why unresolved:** This cross-sectional study captured single time points; symptom fluctuations and marker stability over time remain unexamined.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal tracking of speech patterns and clinical symptoms over months, assessing whether baseline features or feature changes predict clinical outcomes.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent do antipsychotic medications confound the speech-psychosis relationship captured by the model?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Table 1 shows 26 of 32 patients received antipsychotic therapy, while healthy participants were medication-free. The paper does not control for medication effects on speech production.
- **Why unresolved:** Antipsychotics affect motor control and vocal expression; the model may capture medication side effects rather than underlying psychosis symptoms.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Studies comparing medicated and unmedicated patients with matched symptom profiles, or pre-post medication studies tracking speech changes.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does the model perform in real-world clinical settings with heterogeneous recording conditions and populations?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors note cross-context transfer showed degraded performance (e.g., 46% accuracy training on TAT, testing on PANSS), and state "external validation remains essential to integrating speech-based models into clinical practice."
- **Why unresolved:** Validation was within a controlled study using 5-fold cross-validation on similar participants; clinical deployment involves varied equipment, environments, and demographics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Prospective multi-site validation studies across diverse clinical settings with varied recording equipment and patient demographics.

## Limitations

- Dataset accessibility remains a critical barrier - the clinical speech dataset containing 114 participants with early psychosis, schizotypy, and healthy controls is not publicly available, requiring direct requests to authors
- Critical hyperparameters for the Temporal Context Fusion architecture (attention head count, latent dimensionality, learning rates, batch sizes) were not specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- The in-house PELICAN preprocessing pipeline lacks public documentation, creating uncertainty about text feature extraction consistency

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The fundamental mechanism of uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion (variance-weighted weighting) is theoretically sound and well-supported by the calibration results (ECE = 4.5e-2)
- **Medium Confidence:** The context-specific adaptation claims (structured vs unstructured settings) are supported by qualitative fusion weight patterns in Figure 2, but could benefit from more rigorous statistical testing across contexts
- **Medium Confidence:** The F1-score of 83% represents strong performance, but without comparison to baseline models on the same dataset, absolute performance assessment remains limited

## Next Checks

1. **Modality Ablation Test:** Systematically remove either acoustic or linguistic features from test samples and verify that the model's uncertainty estimates increase appropriately while fusion weights shift toward the remaining modality
2. **Cross-Context Generalization:** Train the model exclusively on structured PANSS interviews, then evaluate on unstructured DISCOURSE tasks to confirm the learned uncertainty profiles transfer appropriately
3. **Calibration Stress Test:** Intentionally corrupt subsets of test data (add Gaussian noise to acoustic features, introduce transcription errors) and measure whether predicted uncertainty scores increase proportionally to actual performance degradation
