# Alignment as Distribution Learning: Your Preference Model is Explicitly a Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.01523
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01523
- Authors: Jihun Yun; Juno Kim; Jongho Park; Junhyuck Kim; Jongha Jon Ryu; Jaewoong Cho; Kwang-Sung Jun
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Preference MLE, distillation, and reverse KL methods achieve O(1/n) convergence and outperform DPO/REBEL on win-rate while showing similar alignment tax on benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
This paper reframes alignment as distribution learning from pairwise preference feedback, explicitly modeling the preference model as a language model. By assuming preferences follow a Bradley-Terry formulation tied to target LM likelihoods, the authors derive three principled objectives—preference MLE, preference distillation, and reverse KL minimization—each with strong non-asymptotic O(1/n) convergence guarantees. Empirically, their methods consistently outperform or match DPO, REBEL, and RLHF baselines in win-rate on TL;DR summarization and general chat tasks while showing similar alignment tax on academic benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes a unified framework for preference-based alignment by modeling preferences through a Bradley-Terry structure that explicitly connects to the target language model distribution. Three methods are derived: Preference MLE directly optimizes the preference likelihood with KL regularization, Preference Distillation trains a reward model and distills soft preference labels into the policy, and Reverse KL performs PPO-style RL with entropy regularization derived from the preference model. All methods leverage the insight that pairwise preferences encode information about the target distribution, enabling principled offline alignment with theoretical guarantees.

## Key Results
- Preference MLE achieves O(1/n) convergence rate versus standard 1/√n rates, outperforming DPO on win-rate while maintaining similar KL divergence to prior
- Preference distillation consistently outperforms REBEL and matches DPO across TL;DR and chat tasks with better theoretical grounding
- Reverse KL with entropy regularization prevents degenerate solutions while achieving competitive win-rates compared to RLHF baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Preference data directly encodes information about the target language model distribution via the Bradley-Terry coupling.
- Mechanism: The paper assumes P(a ≻ b | x) = π*(a|x)^γ / (π*(a|x)^γ + π*(b|x)^γ). This explicit formula ties preference probabilities to target LM likelihoods, converting preference learning into distribution learning. When you maximize preference likelihood, you're implicitly fitting π to match π*.
- Core assumption: The Bradley-Terry model with tilted likelihood scores accurately captures human preference generation (γ > 0, typically γ < 1).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "explicitly modeling how information about the target language model bleeds through the preference data"
  - [Section 2, Eq. 3] Defines Pπ(a ≻ b | x) with the Bradley-Terry formulation
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Why DPO is a Misspecified Estimator" discusses DPO's implicit statistical assumptions, supporting the need for explicit modeling
- Break condition: If preferences don't follow Bradley-Terry structure (e.g., humans use absolute quality thresholds rather than relative scoring), the π*-to-preference mapping breaks down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PMLE's O(1/n) convergence rate comes from Schulman's KL approximation trick combined with quadratic bounds, avoiding the slower 1/√n rate.
- Mechanism: The proof uses Schulman's trick to bound KL(π*||π̂) by the squared log-ratio (Lemma 9), then leverages the coverage coefficient C_Π to transfer from μ-sampled responses to π*-sampled evaluation. The logistic sigmoid's local linearity provides the key gradient.
- Core assumption: Bounded rewards (|R̄π(x,a)| ≤ γR) and realizability (π* ∈ Π).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3, Theorem 4] States E_x[KL(π*(x)||π̂(x))] ≲ C_Π ln(|Π|/δ)/(γ²n)
  - [Appendix B.2, Remark 13] Explicitly contrasts with Agarwal et al.'s 1/√n approach
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for this specific proof technique
- Break condition: If coverage coefficient C_Π is large (μ doesn't cover π*'s support well) or the policy class is misspecified, convergence guarantees degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The reverse KL objective's entropy term prevents degenerate collapse by smoothing the reference prior p₀ → p₀^α.
- Mechanism: Standard RLHF minimizes -E[r] + β·KL(π||π₀). The paper's reverse KL objective adds -γ·H(π), which algebraically becomes (β+γ)·KL(π||π₀^α) where α = β/(β+γ) < 1. This raises low-probability actions under π₀, maintaining exploration.
- Core assumption: Degeneracy arises when policy collapses to deterministic outputs; entropy regularization counteracts this.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 5, "Prior smoothing"] Derives π̂_k ∝ p₀,k^α exp(r_k/(β+γ))
  - [Section 1] Notes RLHF "incentivizes degenerate, deterministic solutions"
  - [corpus] Weak support; entropy regularization in RL is widely known but not specifically discussed in neighbors
- Break condition: If γ is set too high, over-exploration may prevent convergence to π*; if too low, degeneracy risk remains.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Bradley-Terry Model**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework rests on preferences being generated via P(a≻b) = s_a/(s_a + s_b) where scores s relate to π*'s likelihoods.
  - Quick check question: If you double both s_a and s_b, does P(a≻b) change?

- Concept: **Forward vs Reverse KL Divergence**
  - Why needed here: PMLE and distillation optimize forward KL (mode-covering); reverse KL optimizes mode-seeking behavior. The paper provides guarantees for both.
  - Quick check question: Which KL penalizes placing mass where the target has none—forward or reverse?

- Concept: **Coverage Coefficient (C_Π)**
  - Why needed here: Offline alignment requires bounding how well the sampling distribution μ covers the target π*'s support. Guarantees scale with this coefficient.
  - Quick check question: Why does the coverage coefficient appear in Theorem 4 but not in standard online RL regret bounds?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  PMLE: Preference dataset → Bradley-Terry likelihood loss + KL regularizer → direct policy update
  Preference Distillation: Preference dataset → train reward model → soft labels → distill into π
  Reverse KL: Preference dataset → train R̂ → PPO-style RL with entropy term

- Critical path: Start with PMLE for simplicity (no RL infrastructure needed). If baseline DPO underperforms, upgrade to Preference Distillation (requires reward model training but still no RL). Reserve Reverse KL for when RL infrastructure exists and entropy regularization is desired.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - PMLE vs DPO: PMLE adds explicit KL regularizer; DPO relies on implicit coverage. PMLE safer but may underfit if β too high.
  - Distillation vs REBEL: Distillation uses expected preference loss; REBEL uses squared loss on log-ratio. Distillation theoretically justified; REBEL simpler gradient.
  - Reverse KL vs RLHF: Reverse KL adds entropy term; requires tuning both β and γ.

- Failure signatures:
  - PMLE: Low KL(π||π₀) but poor win-rate → β too high, over-regularized
  - Distillation: Reward model overfits to training preferences → early stopping or ℓ2 regularization on R̂
  - Reverse KL: Policy explores excessively, low reward → γ too high; policy collapses → γ too low

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **PMLE sanity check**: Reproduce TL;DR with Pythia-1.4B, sweep β ∈ {1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3}, compare win-rate and KL to DPO baseline.
  2. **Distillation reward model ablation**: Train R̂ with different early-stopping epochs; measure correlation between R̂ score and GPT-4 win-rate on held-out set.
  3. **Reverse KL entropy sweep**: Fix β, sweep γ ∈ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1}; plot reward vs KL frontier to verify prior smoothing effect (α = β/(β+γ)).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical guarantees assume Bradley-Terry preference model accurately captures human feedback, which may not hold in practice, and require realizability assumptions that may not be satisfied
- Empirical evaluation is limited to TL;DR summarization and general chat tasks, lacking diversity in task types and model scales
- The O(1/n) convergence rate depends on the coverage coefficient C_Π, which can be large in offline settings where the sampling distribution poorly matches the target distribution's support

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The preference MLE formulation and its connection to distribution learning through Bradley-Terry modeling is mathematically sound. The empirical win-rate improvements over DPO and REBEL baselines are directly measurable and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence**: The O(1/n) convergence guarantee relies on assumptions that are reasonable but not always verified in practice. The prior smoothing interpretation of reverse KL has theoretical justification but limited empirical validation of the α parameter's effect.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim about PMLE being "safer" than DPO due to explicit coverage regularization lacks empirical evidence showing degradation when this regularization is removed. The computational efficiency comparisons between methods are not quantified.

## Next Checks

1. **Coverage Coefficient Validation**: Measure C_Π empirically across different offline preference datasets (varying μ distributions) to verify whether the theoretical coverage assumptions hold in practice and quantify their impact on convergence rates.

2. **Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate all three methods (PMLE, Distillation, Reverse KL) on at least three additional task types (e.g., code generation, dialogue safety, mathematical reasoning) with win-rate comparisons to confirm consistent superiority over DPO/REBEL baselines.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary γ and β parameters in reverse KL and PMLE methods across a wider range (e.g., γ ∈ {1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1}) while measuring both win-rates and KL divergence to establish clear guidance on optimal regularization strength and verify the prior smoothing mechanism.
