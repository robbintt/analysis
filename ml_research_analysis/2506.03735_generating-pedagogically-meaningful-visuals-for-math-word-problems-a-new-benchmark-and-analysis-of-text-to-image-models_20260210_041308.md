# Generating Pedagogically Meaningful Visuals for Math Word Problems: A New Benchmark and Analysis of Text-to-Image Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03735
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03735
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MATH2VISUAL framework co-designed with teachers achieves 4.7-4.9/5.0 accuracy scores for formal visual generation from math word problems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MATH2VISUAL, a framework for generating pedagogically meaningful visuals from math word problems (MWPs) to support young learners' comprehension. The authors co-designed a visual language and design space with primary school teachers, covering seven mathematical operations and creating 1,903 annotated visuals from MWPs. They evaluated state-of-the-art Text-to-Image models, finding that fine-tuning on their dataset significantly improved visual generation quality. While models showed strong performance on accuracy, completeness, and clarity, challenges remain with visualizing mathematical relationships. The framework establishes a new benchmark for educational visual generation and highlights key challenges in producing multimodal educational content.

## Method Summary
The authors developed MATH2VISUAL through a co-design process with primary school teachers, creating a visual language that maps mathematical concepts to visual representations. They curated a dataset of 1,903 annotated visuals covering seven mathematical operations from MWPs. The framework evaluates Text-to-Image models using human judgment across multiple dimensions including accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Fine-tuning experiments demonstrated significant improvements in visual generation quality, with formal visuals achieving scores of 4.7-4.9 out of 5.0.

## Key Results
- MATH2VISUAL dataset contains 1,903 annotated visuals covering seven mathematical operations
- Fine-tuned Text-to-Image models achieve 4.7-4.9/5.0 accuracy scores on formal visual generation tasks
- Strong performance on accuracy, completeness, and clarity metrics, though challenges persist with mathematical relationship visualization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by grounding visual generation in pedagogically-informed design principles developed through teacher collaboration. The visual language bridges abstract mathematical concepts with concrete visual representations that align with how young learners process information. Fine-tuning on domain-specific data allows models to learn the particular visual conventions and relationship mappings needed for educational contexts, rather than relying on general-purpose image generation capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- Visual language design - Why needed: Creates standardized mapping between mathematical concepts and visual representations; Quick check: Can teachers consistently interpret and use the visual language
- Educational context understanding - Why needed: Ensures visuals support learning objectives rather than just depicting problems; Quick check: Do generated visuals align with pedagogical best practices
- Multimodal learning principles - Why needed: Integrates visual and textual information for enhanced comprehension; Quick check: Do visuals improve problem-solving performance when paired with text

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: MWP text -> Visual language parser -> Visual generation model -> Annotated output
Critical path: Text input flows through semantic parsing to generate visual descriptions, which feed into Text-to-Image models for final visual output
Design tradeoffs: Balanced between visual clarity (favoring simplicity) and mathematical completeness (requiring sufficient detail)
Failure signatures: Incorrect mathematical relationships, missing contextual elements, overly complex visuals that confuse rather than clarify
First experiments: 1) Generate visuals for basic arithmetic problems, 2) Test visual language parsing accuracy, 3) Evaluate teacher feedback on initial visual outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset focuses specifically on primary school mathematics in English, limiting generalizability
- Does not provide comprehensive analysis of which specific mathematical relationship types are most challenging
- Relies on human judgment for performance evaluation, introducing potential subjectivity

## Confidence
- High confidence in dataset creation methodology and annotation process
- High confidence in benchmark establishment and performance evaluation metrics
- Medium confidence in generalizability claims beyond English primary education
- Low confidence in long-term pedagogical impact without classroom implementation studies

## Next Checks
1. Cross-cultural validation: Test MATH2VISUAL framework with MWPs from different educational systems and languages
2. Mathematical relationship analysis: Conduct detailed error analysis categorizing challenging mathematical relationship types
3. Classroom implementation study: Design controlled study measuring learning outcomes with generated visuals versus traditional methods
