# Bridging the Gap: From Ad-hoc to Proactive Search in Conversations
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00983
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00983
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Conv2Query improves PSC retrieval with MRR@10 gains up to 0.355 over conversational context baseline

## Executive Summary
Conv2Query addresses the challenge of adapting ad-hoc search retrievers for proactive search in conversations (PSC) by mapping conversational context into ad-hoc queries. This approach eliminates the need for fine-tuning on PSC data while significantly improving retrieval quality. The method introduces a query filtering mechanism (QF-DC) that accelerates convergence and ensures selected queries align with both documents and conversational context. Experiments on ProCIS and WebDisc datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in retrieval performance.

## Method Summary
Conv2Query bridges the gap between ad-hoc search and PSC by transforming conversational context into ad-hoc search queries that can be processed by standard retrievers. The method leverages existing ad-hoc retrieval infrastructure without requiring specialized PSC training data. A key innovation is the query filtering mechanism (QF-DC) that selects queries aligned with both conversational context and relevant documents, improving both convergence speed and retrieval quality. When used to fine-tune ad-hoc retrievers on PSC data, Conv2Query further enhances performance by adapting the retrievers specifically to conversational search patterns.

## Key Results
- Achieves MRR@10 gains of up to 0.355 compared to using conversational context directly
- Improves performance by 0.122-0.386 MRR@10 when used to fine-tune ad-hoc retrievers on PSC
- Effectively adapts off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers to PSC without requiring PSC data fine-tuning
- Query filtering mechanism (QF-DC) accelerates convergence and improves retrieval quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Conv2Query works by translating the implicit information needs in conversational context into explicit ad-hoc search queries that standard retrievers can process effectively. The method recognizes that conversational context contains rich semantic information that can be decomposed into multiple ad-hoc-like queries, each targeting different aspects of the information need. The query filtering mechanism ensures that only queries aligned with both the conversational context and relevant documents are selected, reducing noise and focusing the retrieval process. This approach leverages the maturity and optimization of ad-hoc retrieval systems while addressing the unique challenges of conversational search.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conversational context mapping**: Converting multi-turn conversations into ad-hoc query format - needed to leverage existing ad-hoc retrieval infrastructure; quick check: verify query quality through human evaluation
- **Query filtering mechanisms**: Selecting relevant queries from conversational context - needed to reduce noise and improve precision; quick check: measure precision-recall trade-offs with/without filtering
- **PSC vs ad-hoc search differences**: Understanding information needs in conversational vs single-turn settings - needed to design appropriate mapping strategies; quick check: analyze query distribution differences
- **Retriever adaptation strategies**: Fine-tuning approaches for different search paradigms - needed to maximize performance gains; quick check: compare convergence rates with different adaptation methods

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Conversational context → Query generation → Query filtering (QF-DC) → Ad-hoc retriever → Results

**Critical path**: The query generation and filtering stages form the critical path, as they directly impact the quality of input to the ad-hoc retriever. Poor query generation or ineffective filtering will propagate errors through the entire system.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead for improved retrieval quality and the ability to use existing ad-hoc infrastructure. The query filtering mechanism adds processing time but improves both quality and convergence speed.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance may manifest as irrelevant retrieved documents when query generation fails to capture conversational context adequately, or when filtering removes too many potentially relevant queries. Over-filtering can lead to incomplete coverage of information needs.

**First experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate conversational context directly vs Conv2Query-generated queries
2. Ablation study: Test Conv2Query performance with and without query filtering
3. Retriever adaptation: Compare fine-tuned vs non-fine-tuned ad-hoc retrievers using Conv2Query

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation on domain diversity, primarily tested on ProCIS and WebDisc datasets
- Potential scalability challenges with very long or complex conversational contexts
- Computational overhead and efficiency considerations not thoroughly addressed
- Limited discussion of generalization to different types of conversational domains

## Confidence
High confidence in empirical MRR@10 improvements (0.355 and 0.122-0.386) on reported datasets.
Medium confidence in the claim that Conv2Query effectively adapts off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers without PSC data fine-tuning.
Medium confidence in the effectiveness of the query filtering mechanism (QF-DC) based on demonstrated contributions.

## Next Checks
1. Test Conv2Query on additional conversational search datasets from different domains (technical support, healthcare, e-commerce) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies specifically measuring the impact of the query filtering mechanism (QF-DC) by comparing full Conv2Query performance against a version without query filtering.
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and latency overhead when applying Conv2Query in real-time conversational search scenarios with large document collections.
