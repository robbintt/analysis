# Probabilistic Segmentation for Robust Field of View Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.07375
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07375
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Deep learning-based probabilistic segmentation with Monte Carlo dropout enables robust FOV estimation under LiDAR spoofing attacks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical vulnerability in autonomous vehicle perception systems: classical field of view (FOV) estimation algorithms are susceptible to LiDAR spoofing attacks that can cause the system to ignore valid sensor data. The authors propose a deep learning-based segmentation approach using a U-Net architecture integrated with Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty quantification. This probabilistic segmentation method learns generalized visibility features that enable reliable FOV estimation even under adversarial conditions, with the added benefit of anomaly detection through uncertainty analysis.

## Method Summary
The proposed method replaces traditional geometric FOV estimation with a deep learning segmentation approach that predicts visibility masks from LiDAR point clouds. A U-Net architecture is trained to classify each point as visible or occluded based on learned spatial and contextual features rather than predefined geometric constraints. Monte Carlo dropout is integrated during inference to generate multiple stochastic forward passes, producing both a final prediction and an uncertainty estimate for each point. This probabilistic framework enables the system to detect anomalous regions where predictions are uncertain, which may indicate spoofing attacks or sensor malfunctions.

## Key Results
- The segmentation approach achieves high precision and recall for FOV estimation across both indoor and outdoor datasets
- The model generalizes well between different environments without requiring environment-specific retraining
- Monte Carlo dropout effectively identifies regions affected by spoofing attacks through elevated uncertainty scores
- The method maintains performance under adversarial conditions while providing security-aware sensor fusion capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by learning semantic visibility patterns rather than relying on rigid geometric constraints that can be exploited by attackers. By training on diverse real-world data, the model captures complex occlusion relationships and environmental factors that determine visibility. Monte Carlo dropout introduces stochasticity during inference, allowing the model to quantify its confidence in predictions. Regions with high uncertainty can be flagged as potential attack targets or sensor failures, enabling defensive mechanisms in the perception pipeline.

## Foundational Learning
- **LiDAR point cloud processing**: Understanding how 3D point clouds represent sensor data is crucial for interpreting the segmentation task and evaluating model outputs
  - Why needed: The entire method operates on LiDAR data representation
  - Quick check: Can you explain the difference between Cartesian and spherical representations of LiDAR data?

- **U-Net architecture**: Familiarity with encoder-decoder structures with skip connections is essential for understanding how spatial information is preserved and processed
  - Why needed: The core segmentation model uses this architecture
  - Quick check: What is the purpose of skip connections in U-Net?

- **Monte Carlo dropout**: Understanding how dropout at inference time approximates Bayesian uncertainty is key to grasping the probabilistic aspect
  - Why needed: This is the mechanism for uncertainty quantification
  - Quick check: How does MC dropout differ from standard dropout during training?

- **Field of view estimation**: Knowledge of traditional geometric approaches helps appreciate why deep learning methods are more robust to attacks
  - Why needed: Provides context for the problem being solved
  - Quick check: What are the limitations of geometric FOV estimation methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LiDAR Point Cloud -> U-Net Encoder -> Bottleneck Features -> U-Net Decoder -> Visibility Mask + Uncertainty Scores

**Critical Path**: The most critical computational path is the U-Net forward pass with MC dropout, where multiple stochastic evaluations are performed to generate both predictions and uncertainty estimates.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- The U-Net architecture balances model capacity with computational efficiency, though it may be outperformed by more modern segmentation architectures
- MC dropout provides uncertainty quantification but increases inference time by requiring multiple forward passes
- The probabilistic approach adds computational overhead but enables security features like anomaly detection

**Failure Signatures**: 
- High uncertainty regions that don't correspond to known occlusions may indicate spoofing attacks
- Systematic errors in specific environmental conditions suggest dataset bias or insufficient generalization
- Inconsistent predictions across MC dropout samples indicate model uncertainty or ambiguous input data

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate FOV estimation accuracy on clean data across different environmental conditions
2. Test model robustness against controlled LiDAR spoofing attacks with varying intensity
3. Assess computational requirements and real-time performance on embedded hardware
