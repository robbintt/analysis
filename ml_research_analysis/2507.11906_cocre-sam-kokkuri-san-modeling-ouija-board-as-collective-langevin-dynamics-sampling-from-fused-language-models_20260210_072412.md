# CoCre-Sam (Kokkuri-san): Modeling Ouija Board as Collective Langevin Dynamics Sampling from Fused Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.11906
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11906
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: CoCre-Sam models Ouija board as collective Langevin dynamics, fusing language models to generate meaningful character sequences

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CoCre-Sam (Collective-Creature Sampling), a framework that models the Ouija board phenomenon as collective Langevin dynamics sampling from fused language models. Each participant is represented as an agent with an internal language model defining an energy landscape, and their stochastic actions based on local gradients correspond to sampling from the sum of individual energy landscapes. The theoretical analysis proves the collective dynamics are equivalent to Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) sampling from a fused distribution approximating a Product-of-Experts form. Simulations demonstrate effective fusion of different language models to generate meaningful character sequences, while ablation studies confirm the essential roles of collective interaction and stochasticity.

## Method Summary
CoCre-Sam represents each Ouija board participant as an agent with an internal language model that defines an energy landscape over possible character sequences. Agents perform stochastic movements based on local gradients of their energy landscapes, and their collective actions correspond to sampling from the sum of individual energy landscapes. The framework theoretically proves that this collective Langevin dynamics process is equivalent to Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) sampling from a fused distribution that approximates a Product-of-Experts form. Through simulations, CoCre-Sam demonstrates the ability to fuse different language models to generate coherent character sequences, such as flower names, while ablation studies confirm that both collective interaction and stochasticity are essential for meaningful emergent behavior.

## Key Results
- CoCre-Sam effectively fuses different language models to generate meaningful character sequences (e.g., "petunia", "jacobinia")
- Theoretical proof shows collective Langevin dynamics correspond to ULA sampling from fused distribution
- Ablation studies confirm essential roles of collective interaction and stochasticity in emergent behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by modeling each participant as an agent whose internal language model defines an energy landscape over possible outputs. When agents interact collectively, their stochastic movements based on local gradients of these landscapes result in sampling from the sum of all individual landscapes. This process is mathematically equivalent to Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm sampling from a fused distribution, which approximates a Product-of-Experts form. The collective dynamics leverage the implicit knowledge distributed across individual agents, with stochasticity and interaction enabling the emergence of coherent patterns that no single agent could produce alone.

## Foundational Learning
- Langevin Dynamics: Stochastic differential equations used for sampling from probability distributions; needed to model agent movements and prove theoretical equivalence
- Product-of-Experts: Method for combining multiple probability distributions; needed to understand how individual agent knowledge fuses into collective output
- Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA): Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling; needed to establish theoretical foundation for collective sampling equivalence
- Energy Landscapes: Mathematical representation of probability distributions; needed to model how language models define preferences over outputs
- Collective Intelligence: Emergent behavior from multiple agents; needed to frame how individual knowledge combines into group behavior
- Stochastic Gradient Descent: Optimization method using random samples; needed to understand how agents navigate energy landscapes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Agent models -> Energy landscape mapping -> Stochastic gradient sampling -> Collective interaction -> Output fusion

**Critical path:**
1. Initialize agents with individual language models
2. Map each model to energy landscape over characters
3. Agents perform stochastic gradient-based movements
4. Collective interactions modify individual gradients
5. Sample from fused distribution to generate output

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Individual model diversity vs. collective coherence
- Stochasticity level vs. convergence speed
- Interaction strength vs. exploration capability
- Model complexity vs. computational feasibility

**Failure signatures:**
- Output becomes random noise (insufficient interaction/stochasticity)
- Output collapses to single agent's preference (over-dominant model)
- No convergence (imbalanced energy landscapes)
- Loss of diversity (excessive averaging)

**3 first experiments:**
1. Run with single agent to verify baseline language model behavior
2. Test two-agent system with contrasting models to observe fusion
3. Vary noise levels to identify threshold for coherent emergence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Energy landscape assumption lacks empirical validation across diverse model architectures
- Theoretical proof relies on idealized conditions that may not hold with discrete token sampling
- Simulation results lack systematic evaluation metrics and statistical significance testing

## Confidence

| Major Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------------|------------------|
| Theoretical equivalence to ULA sampling | Medium |
| Effective fusion of language models | Low-Medium |
| Emergence of meaningful collective behavior | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Implement systematic evaluation using perplexity, BLEU, or semantic coherence metrics across diverse vocabulary sets and compare against baseline collective generation approaches

2. Conduct parameter sensitivity analysis varying agent count, model diversity, noise levels, and interaction strength to identify robustness boundaries

3. Validate energy landscape representation by testing the framework with structurally different language models (RNNs, Transformers, SOTAs) and measuring cross-model consistency in collective outputs
