# Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.03950
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images using texture-guided remeshing and Gaussian splatting

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images that jointly optimizes mesh geometry and appearance through texture-guided remeshing. The method leverages Gaussian splatting to obtain initial geometry and appearance, then refines the mesh using photometric consistency, geometric regularization, and texture-based edge length control to improve detail preservation. A vertex-Gaussian binding scheme enables seamless downstream editing tasks like relighting and deformation. Experiments on DTU and DTC datasets show significant improvements in Chamfer Distance and rendering quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through a multi-stage pipeline beginning with Gaussian splatting to generate an initial reconstruction. This reconstruction serves as the foundation for subsequent mesh optimization. The core innovation lies in the texture-guided remeshing approach, which uses the rendered texture to guide edge length adjustments during mesh optimization. The optimization process jointly refines mesh geometry and appearance by balancing photometric consistency (ensuring rendered images match input views), geometric regularization (maintaining mesh quality), and texture-based edge length control (preserving fine details). The vertex-Gaussian binding mechanism allows the refined mesh to inherit appearance information from the Gaussian representation, enabling downstream editing tasks while maintaining high visual fidelity.

## Key Results
- Significant improvements in Chamfer Distance metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods on DTU and DTC datasets
- Enhanced rendering quality with better preservation of fine geometric details
- Superior relighting performance when integrated with R3DG framework
- Enabled downstream editing tasks including relighting and deformation through vertex-Gaussian binding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method bridges explicit mesh structures with implicit appearance modeling by leveraging Gaussian splatting as an initialization step. Gaussian splatting provides high-quality geometry and appearance that traditional mesh-based methods struggle to achieve directly from multi-view images. The texture-guided remeshing then translates this implicit representation into an explicit, editable mesh structure while preserving the visual quality. By using photometric consistency during optimization, the method ensures that the final mesh faithfully reproduces the input views. The texture-based edge length control specifically targets detail preservation by allowing finer mesh resolution in regions with high texture variation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gaussian Splatting**: Why needed - Provides initial high-quality geometry and appearance; Quick check - Verify initialization quality affects final mesh optimization results
- **Photometric Consistency**: Why needed - Ensures rendered mesh matches input views; Quick check - Measure reprojection error across all views
- **Geometric Regularization**: Why needed - Maintains mesh quality during optimization; Quick check - Monitor triangle quality metrics during optimization
- **Texture-Guided Remeshing**: Why needed - Preserves fine details by adapting mesh resolution to texture complexity; Quick check - Compare edge length distribution before and after optimization
- **Vertex-Gaussian Binding**: Why needed - Enables downstream editing while preserving appearance; Quick check - Test relighting and deformation performance on optimized meshes
- **Chamfer Distance**: Why needed - Quantifies geometric accuracy between reconstruction and ground truth; Quick check - Calculate distance metrics on benchmark datasets

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Views -> Gaussian Splatting -> Initial Reconstruction -> Texture-Guided Remeshing -> Optimized Mesh -> Vertex-Gaussian Binding -> Editable Mesh

**Critical Path:** The optimization loop consisting of photometric consistency evaluation, geometric regularization, and texture-based edge adjustment forms the critical path that directly determines reconstruction quality.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational efficiency for reconstruction quality, requiring iterative optimization that may not be suitable for real-time applications. The dependency on high-quality Gaussian splatting initialization introduces an upstream bottleneck that can limit performance on challenging scenes.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor initial Gaussian splatting quality propagates through the optimization, resulting in suboptimal mesh geometry. Objects with highly complex topology may not be adequately represented due to mesh resolution limitations. Over-aggressive texture-guided remeshing can lead to excessive triangle count and computational inefficiency.

**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate reconstruction quality across varying numbers of input views to determine minimum requirements
2. Test the method on objects with different levels of geometric complexity and topology
3. Measure the impact of initialization quality on final reconstruction performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Requires multiple views as input, limiting applicability to single-image reconstruction scenarios
- Quality heavily dependent on initial Gaussian splatting reconstruction
- Performance on objects with highly complex geometry or topology remains unclear

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Claims regarding improved Chamfer Distance and rendering quality compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets (DTU and DTC)
- **High confidence**: Claims about better relighting performance when integrated with R3DG framework

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on single-image reconstruction scenarios to evaluate its limitations and potential adaptations for this common use case
2. Evaluate performance on datasets with more complex geometry and topology to assess robustness across diverse object types
3. Benchmark the computational efficiency of the optimization process compared to alternative approaches to determine practical applicability for real-time applications
