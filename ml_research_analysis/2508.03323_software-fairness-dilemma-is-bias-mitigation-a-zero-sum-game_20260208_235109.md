core_contribution: This study examines bias mitigation methods for tabular data, revealing
  that they operate in a zero-sum fashion where improvements for unprivileged groups
  come at the expense of privileged groups. Unlike previous findings in computer vision
  and natural language processing, bias mitigation methods for tabular data significantly
  increase selection rates and true positive rates for unprivileged groups while decreasing
  them for privileged groups across 44 tasks using five real-world datasets and four

# Software Fairness Dilemma: Is Bias Mitigation a Zero-Sum Game?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.03323
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03323
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Bias mitigation in tabular data operates as a zero-sum game, but applying methods selectively to unprivileged groups can achieve Pareto improvements.

## Executive Summary
This study challenges the prevailing view that fairness interventions in machine learning uniformly degrade performance ("leveling down"). Through extensive experiments across five real-world datasets and four ML models, the authors demonstrate that bias mitigation methods for tabular data actually redistribute favorable outcomes in a zero-sum manner: improving metrics for unprivileged groups while simultaneously harming privileged groups. The research introduces a novel selective application strategy (MirrorFairU) that breaks this trade-off by applying state-of-the-art bias mitigation exclusively to unprivileged groups, achieving fairness gains without harming privileged groups or degrading overall model performance.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods across five datasets (Adult, Compas, German, Bank, Mep) using four ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and a 5-layer DNN). Experiments follow a 70/30 train/test split with 20 repetitions for statistical validity. The proposed MirrorFairU approach selectively applies the MirrorFair counterfactual generation method only to unprivileged group instances while preserving original predictions for privileged groups. Performance is measured using fairness metrics (SPD, EOD, AOD) and group-specific outcomes (Selection Rate, True Positive Rate, False Positive Rate), with statistical significance validated using Mann-Whitney U-tests and Cliff's δ effect sizes.

## Key Results
- Bias mitigation methods for tabular data increase selection rates and true positive rates for unprivileged groups while decreasing them for privileged groups across 44 experimental tasks
- Standard global mitigation methods exhibit zero-sum trade-offs where fairness improvements correlate with privilege losses
- MirrorFairU breaks the zero-sum pattern by enhancing unprivileged group outcomes without reducing privileged group performance
- The proposed selective approach achieves Pareto improvements that traditional fairness metrics may not fully capture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Benefit Redistribution vs. Leveling Down
In tabular data, bias mitigation functions as a zero-sum redistribution of favorable outcomes rather than universal performance degradation. Unlike high-capacity CV models that overfit to zero training error under fairness constraints, tabular models maintain ~9% average training error, allowing methods like Reweighting and Adversarial Debiasing to actively suppress correlations favoring privileged groups. This shifts the decision boundary to increase TPR for unprivileged groups while lowering them for privileged groups. The core assumption is that models have sufficient capacity to learn distinct patterns for different groups while generalizing well enough that fairness enforcement on training data translates to consistent test data shifts.

### Mechanism 2: Pareto Improvement via Selective Group Mitigation
Applying state-of-the-art bias mitigation exclusively to unprivileged groups breaks the zero-sum trade-off. Standard methods lower privileged outcomes because they apply global transformations to the decision boundary. By isolating mitigation application to only the unprivileged subset, the model preserves original predictions for privileged groups while elevating unprivileged group performance to similar benefit levels. The core assumption is that fairness interventions are modular enough for conditional application without inducing global model drift or data leakage that would degrade privileged group representation.

### Mechanism 3: Correlation of Fairness Gains and Privilege Loss
There is a statistically significant correlation between the magnitude of fairness improvement and the magnitude of performance loss for privileged groups in standard global mitigation. Fairness metrics are defined by gaps between groups, and minimizing these gaps via global optimization often forces models to "level down" privileged group favorable outcomes because reducing the gap by raising the floor is often harder than lowering the ceiling. The optimization landscape prioritizes the easiest path to minimizing the loss function (fairness penalty), which is often reducing accuracy on the majority/privileged class.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Zero-Sum vs. Leveling Down**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's central thesis contrasts these two dynamics. "Leveling down" hurts everyone; "Zero-sum" helps one by hurting another. You must distinguish these to understand why tabular data behaves differently.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the bias mitigation method improve the unprivileged group's True Positive Rate (TPR) while maintaining the privileged group's TPR, or does it trade one for the other?

- **Concept: Group-Specific Performance Metrics (SR, TPR, FPR)**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard aggregate metrics mask the "Fairness Dilemma." You must analyze Selection Rate and True Positive Rate for each group to detect the zero-sum trade-off.
  - **Quick check question:** If overall accuracy stays the same but the privileged group's TPR drops by 10% and the unprivileged group's TPR rises by 10%, has the model improved?

- **Concept: Pareto Efficiency**
  - **Why needed here:** The proposed solution (MirrorFairU) is evaluated on Pareto efficiency—making at least one group better off without making any other group worse off.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a standard fairness metric like SPD penalize a Pareto-optimal solution compared to a zero-sum solution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Splitter -> Standard Pipeline (Baseline) OR Selective Mitigation (MirrorFairU) -> Evaluator
- **Critical path:** The implementation of the Conditional Router. The system must accurately identify the sensitive attribute to route instances to either "Pass-through" or "Mitigation" path. Failure here applies mitigation universally (reverting to zero-sum) or not at all.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Global mitigation optimizes for metrics more aggressively but triggers zero-sum costs. Selective mitigation achieves Pareto improvement but may result in slightly higher (worse) fairness metric scores because privileged group performance isn't artificially lowered to "close the gap."
- **Failure signatures:** Leakage (applying mitigation to unprivileged group inadvertently alters model weights globally), Metric Gaming (model achieves low SPD by randomly assigning favorable outcomes to unprivileged group without improving TPR).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Zero-Sum Validation: Train standard model with global mitigation method and plot TPR changes for both groups to confirm inverse correlation.
  2. Selective Application Ablation: Implement MirrorFairU and compare SR_priv and SR_unpriv against baseline, verifying SR_priv remains unchanged while SR_unpriv increases.
  3. Resource Constraint Analysis: Measure Overall Selection Rate delta to ensure Pareto improvement doesn't disproportionately increase acceptance rate when resource allocation is fixed.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the strategy of applying mitigation exclusively to unprivileged groups be effectively generalized to bias mitigation algorithms other than MirrorFair? The study only applies selective strategy to MirrorFair, and it's unclear if observed Pareto improvements are specific to MirrorFair's counterfactual mechanism or generalizable to other methods.

### Open Question 2
How can fairness metrics be redesigned to value "leveling up" (improving unprivileged) over "leveling down" (reducing privileges)? Traditional metrics like SPD may penalize Pareto-optimal solutions because they prioritize relative gap reduction over absolute group performance improvements.

### Open Question 3
Do observed zero-sum trade-offs in tabular data persist in software engineering-specific datasets? The current study uses social, financial, and medical domains, and it's unknown if bias mitigation in SE-specific tasks exhibits the same zero-sum dynamics.

## Limitations
- Findings may not generalize beyond tabular data to other data types like images or text where leveling down effects are more prevalent
- Selective group mitigation effectiveness depends heavily on accurate group identification and may not scale well to scenarios with multiple or intersecting sensitive attributes
- Long-term stability of Pareto improvements under distributional shifts remains untested

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The observation that bias mitigation methods in tabular data exhibit zero-sum behavior is well-supported by experimental results across multiple datasets and models
- **Medium Confidence:** The proposed selective application mechanism shows promise in breaking zero-sum trade-offs, but its effectiveness may vary depending on dataset characteristics and group separability
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that tabular models avoid leveling down due to higher training error assumes specific capacity constraints that may not hold for all tabular architectures

## Next Checks
1. Test MirrorFairU on datasets with multiple sensitive attributes to evaluate its scalability and effectiveness in multi-dimensional fairness scenarios
2. Conduct experiments with more complex tabular models (e.g., gradient boosting machines) to verify if the zero-sum behavior persists across different model families
3. Evaluate the long-term performance of selective mitigation under concept drift conditions to assess robustness when data distributions change over time
