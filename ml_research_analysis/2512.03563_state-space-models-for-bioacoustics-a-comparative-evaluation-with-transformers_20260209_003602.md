# State Space Models for Bioacoustics: A comparative Evaluation with Transformers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03563
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03563
- Authors: Chengyu Tang; Sanjeev Baskiyar
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: BioMamba achieves comparable bioacoustic classification/detection performance to Transformer models while consuming ~40% less VRAM during inference.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates Mamba (State Space Model) architectures for bioacoustic tasks, addressing the challenge of efficient long-sequence audio processing. The authors pretrain a Mamba-based audio model (BioMamba) using self-supervised learning on large audio corpora and fine-tune it on the BEANS benchmark. BioMamba achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Transformer-based model AVES while consuming significantly less memory, demonstrating its potential for real-world environmental monitoring applications.

## Method Summary
The BioMamba model uses a two-phase self-supervised pre-training approach. Phase 1 applies k-means clustering to MFCC features to generate initial pseudo-labels, while Phase 2 refines these using clusters from the model's learned representations. The architecture consists of a frozen wav2vec 2.0-style CNN feature extractor (7 conv layers, 320× downsampling) followed by stacked Mamba2 layers. During fine-tuning, only the Mamba encoder and classification head are updated while CNN weights remain frozen. The model is evaluated on BEANS benchmark tasks including classification and detection across multiple bioacoustic datasets.

## Key Results
- BioMamba achieves comparable performance to AVES Transformer model across most BEANS tasks
- BioMamba consumes approximately 40% less VRAM than AVES during inference across sequences from 5-1000 seconds
- The model demonstrates effective transfer learning from self-supervised pre-training to bioacoustic classification and detection tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: State Space Models achieve comparable bioacoustic performance to Transformers while reducing inference memory by ~40%.
- Mechanism: Mamba replaces quadratic self-attention with selective gating and linear recurrent state transitions. Hidden states evolve through efficient convolutional SSM operations, enabling O(n) memory scaling versus O(n²) for attention.
- Core assumption: Bioacoustic tasks primarily require capturing temporal dependencies rather than global token-to-token interactions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "BioMamba achieves comparable performance with AVES while consumption significantly less VRAM"
  - [section 4.4] "AVES consistently consumes around 40% more VRAM than BioMamba" across 5-1000 second sequences
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related work on SSAMBA [27] shows Mamba outperforming SSAST on general audio tasks, but bioacoustic-specific SSM evaluations remain limited
- Break condition: If tasks require dense global attention patterns (e.g., fine-grained multi-species interactions across distant time steps), linear SSMs may underperform attention-based models.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-phase self-supervised pre-training with progressively refined pseudo-labels enables effective representation learning without manual annotation.
- Mechanism: Phase 1 clusters MFCC features via k-means to generate initial pseudo-labels. Phase 2 replaces MFCC-derived labels with clusters from the model's 6th Mamba layer representations, incorporating learned contextual information. The model predicts masked frame pseudo-labels via cross-entropy loss.
- Core assumption: Audio frame pseudo-labels from learned representations capture task-relevant acoustic structure better than hand-crafted features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "In the second iteration, we apply k-means to the internal representations of the 6th Mamba layer"
  - [section 2.1] HuBERT-style masked prediction transfers effectively to bioacoustics per AVES results
  - [corpus] No corpus papers directly validate two-phase pseudo-label refinement for bioacoustics
- Break condition: If clustering quality degrades (e.g., imbalanced species distribution, rare vocalizations), pseudo-labels may introduce noise that harms downstream transfer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A frozen CNN front-end followed by trainable Mamba encoder preserves efficient audio representation transfer.
- Mechanism: The wav2vec 2.0-style CNN feature extractor (7 1D conv layers, 320× downsampling) converts 16kHz waveforms to 20ms frame sequences. These tokens feed stacked Mamba2 layers. During fine-tuning, CNN weights remain frozen; only Mamba encoder and task-specific classification head update.
- Core assumption: Low-level acoustic features learned on speech/general audio transfer to animal vocalizations without adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "the input audio clips must have the same sample rate to maintain performance...16 kHz as the target sample rate"
  - [section 3.2] "weights of the CNN feature extractor are not updated during the fine-tuning process"
  - [corpus] Perch 2.0 [corpus neighbor] demonstrates supervised pre-training on 14,597 species transfers effectively, suggesting feature extractor flexibility—but this uses supervised, not frozen transfer
- Break condition: If target species occupy different frequency bands (e.g., ultrasonic bat calls downsampled at 16kHz), the frozen front-end may lose critical information.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: State Space Models (SSMs)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Mamba achieves linear complexity through h(t) = Ah(t-1) + Bx(t) state transitions versus attention's pairwise comparisons.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why SSM inference memory scales O(1) per timestep while attention scales O(n)?

- **Concept: Masked Prediction Pre-training**
  - Why needed here: The self-supervised objective requires predicting k-means cluster IDs for randomly masked frames—understanding this clarifies what representations the model learns.
  - Quick check question: Why might k-means on MFCCs produce different pseudo-labels than k-means on learned Mamba representations?

- **Concept: Audio Feature Extraction Pipelines**
  - Why needed here: The CNN feature extractor determines temporal resolution (20ms frames) and frequency representation before the encoder sees data.
  - Quick check question: If your target species vocalizes at 80kHz, what sample rate would you need and how would this affect the 320× downsampling ratio?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Raw Audio (16kHz) → CNN Feature Extractor (7 conv1d, ↓320) → Frame Sequence [T, d=512] → Stacked Mamba2 Layers (~12-24 layers) → Mean Pooling [d] → Classification Head → Species/Presence Output

- **Critical path:** The CNN feature extractor output dimension and downsampling rate (320) determines all downstream sequence lengths. Verify 16kHz input; mismatched sample rates will misalign temporal structure.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Frozen vs. fine-tunable CNN:** Paper freezes for efficiency; may limit adaptation to out-of-domain frequency ranges.
  - **Mean pooling vs. attention pooling:** Mean pooling discards temporal location information—acceptable for classification, potentially suboptimal for detection tasks requiring precise event boundaries.
  - **Two-phase pre-training complexity:** Phase 2 pseudo-labels improve quality but require full first-phase training run first.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Memory still grows quadratically: Verify Mamba2 (not Transformer) layers are actually being used; check for accidental attention modules in custom architectures.
  - Poor transfer to new species: Check sample rate alignment; inspect whether target species frequency range is preserved after CNN downsampling.
  - Detection task underperforms classification: Mean pooling may smear event boundaries; consider replacing with max pooling or learnable weighted pooling.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline reproduction:** Pre-train on FSD50K/VGGSound/AudioSet animal subsets for 100K steps per phase, fine-tune on single BEANS classification task (e.g., `dogs`), compare accuracy and VRAM against reported numbers.
  2. **Sample rate sensitivity:** Evaluate same model on 16kHz vs. 48kHz inputs (resampled) to characterize frequency information loss from fixed front-end.
  3. **Memory scaling curve:** Reproduce Figure 1 by measuring peak allocated VRAM on synthetic sequences from 5-60 seconds at 5-second intervals on your target hardware to validate 40% savings claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can extensive hyperparameter optimization allow BioMamba to significantly surpass Transformer-based models in accuracy on bioacoustic tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 4.3 that "hyperparameters for BioMamba are determined primarily to ensure consistency with the baseline model," and suggest that "with more thorough hyperparameter tuning, we believe its performance can be further improved."
- Why unresolved: The current study prioritized a fair, controlled comparison using baseline-consistent settings rather than maximizing the Mamba architecture's specific potential.
- What evidence would resolve it: A follow-up study including grid search or Bayesian optimization over Mamba-specific parameters (e.g., state dimension, convolution width) demonstrating statistically significant gains over AVES.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does BioMamba retain its accuracy advantage on ultra-long audio sequences (>1000s) where Transformer context windows are mathematically restricted?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper demonstrates linear memory growth up to 1000 seconds (Section 4.4), it does not evaluate task performance on these extreme lengths, leaving the "long-range dependency" modeling capability unverified for very long durations.
- Why unresolved: The BEANS benchmark datasets likely contain shorter clips, and memory efficiency does not automatically guarantee that the model is utilizing the extended context effectively for classification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results on datasets with continuous, unedited field recordings (e.g., hours-long soundscape monitoring) comparing detection accuracy between BioMamba and sliding-window Transformer approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the pre-training data composition impact BioMamba's ability to generalize to taxa not seen during pre-training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The model was pre-trained on a specific mix of FSD50K, VGGSound, and AudioSet animal subsets. It is unclear if the "comparable performance" relies on the overlap of these general audio datasets with the specific bioacoustic classes or if the SSM architecture offers better zero-shot generalization.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates transfer learning but does not ablate the pre-training sources to determine if the model is learning universal bioacoustic features or simply matching the distribution of the pre-training data.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing models pre-trained on speech vs. animal sounds only, tested on novel bioacoustic classes (e.g., insects or marine life) excluded from the pre-training corpus.

## Limitations

- Model architecture specifics (Mamba layer count, hidden dimension) are unspecified, preventing exact reproduction
- Pre-training parameters including k-means cluster count and masking ratio are not reported
- Limited ablation studies on the two-phase pre-training design choices
- Detection task performance comparisons lack the granularity of classification results

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in VRAM efficiency claims (40% reduction vs AVES) based on direct measurement data
- **Medium confidence** in comparable performance claims due to missing detailed architecture specifications
- **Low confidence** in generalization of two-phase pre-training benefits without ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. Reconstruct BioMamba architecture with plausible Mamba2 parameters (e.g., 12-24 layers, d_model=512) and verify VRAM scaling matches reported 40% efficiency
2. Implement both Phase 1 and Phase 2 pre-training on FSD50K/VGGSound subsets; compare performance with single-phase baseline to validate pseudo-label refinement benefit
3. Evaluate detection vs classification performance gap on BEANS tasks with same BioMamba model to characterize mean-pooling limitations for temporal localization
