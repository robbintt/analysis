# Balancing Rewards in Text Summarization: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning via HyperVolume Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.19325
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19325
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Hypervolume optimization (HVO) outperforms GRPO in balancing multiple objectives (consistency, coherence, relevance, fluency) for text summarization, achieving state-of-the-art hypervolume and overall scores.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of balancing multiple objectives in text summarization by proposing hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning strategy. HVO integrates hypervolume evaluation into the reward computation framework to guide the model toward the Pareto front, dynamically adjusting scores between groups during reinforcement learning. The method outperforms group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and demonstrates more balanced performance across different dimensions. A 7B foundation model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task while maintaining shorter generation length.

## Method Summary
HVO extends GRPO by incorporating hypervolume-based reward calculation to balance multiple objectives in text summarization. The method uses Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the policy model, generating 8 summaries per prompt. Rewards are computed using UniEval (4 dimensions) plus a conciseness reward based on compression-ratio deviation. The hypervolume aggregator combines these rewards into scalar values per summary, which are then normalized within groups to produce advantages for the GRPO objective. The model is trained with a learning rate of 5e-7 and specific hyperparameters (ε=0.99, δ=0.1, ρ=16, λ=2, w_k=-1) to achieve stable optimization while preventing length collapse.

## Key Results
- HVO outperforms GRPO in overall scores and demonstrates more balanced performance across different dimensions
- A 7B foundation model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in summarization while maintaining shorter generation length
- HVO effectively handles trade-offs between multiple evaluation metrics and achieves state-of-the-art hypervolume and overall scores
- The method successfully prevents length collapse during training through a length constraint mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hypervolume-based Reward Aggregation
- Replaces linear weighted reward combination with hypervolume calculation to produce more balanced multi-objective optimization
- Uses geometric-product structure that penalizes weak dimensions more severely than weighted sums
- Assumes balanced dimension scores indicate higher-quality summaries than imbalanced ones with equal aggregate scores

### Mechanism 2: Length Constraint Regularization for Training Stability
- Prevents summary length collapse during RL training through conciseness reward based on compression-ratio deviation
- Uses sigmoid-like decay that allows exploration near target ratio but sharply penalizes extreme deviations
- Assumes human-written summaries in training set represent appropriate length distribution

### Mechanism 3: Group-Relative Advantage Normalization
- Normalizes rewards within generated groups rather than across batches to stabilize policy gradient estimation
- Compares outputs against each other within groups rather than against fixed baseline
- Assumes within-group variance is meaningful signal for local policy improvement

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pareto optimality and hypervolume indicator**
  - Why needed: HVO's core contribution is maximizing hypervolume to approach the Pareto front
  - Quick check: Given two solutions with equal weighted-sum scores but different dimension balances, which has higher hypervolume?

- **Concept: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - Why needed: HVO builds directly on GRPO's objective function and group-based advantage computation
  - Quick check: How does GRPO's group-relative advantage differ from PPO's advantage estimation using a value function?

- **Concept: Multi-dimensional NLG evaluation (UniEval)**
  - Why needed: HVO uses UniEval dimensions (coherence, consistency, fluency, relevance) as reward signals
  - Quick check: Why might consistency and fluency rewards conflict during optimization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Policy Model (π_θ) -> UniEval Reward Models -> Conciseness Reward -> Hypervolume Aggregator -> Group Advantage Normalizer -> GRPO Objective

- **Critical path**:
  1. Prompt document → Policy Model → Generate 8 candidate summaries
  2. UniEval evaluates each summary on 4 dimensions → raw reward vectors
  3. Conciseness reward computed from compression ratio deviation
  4. Hypervolume aggregator combines all rewards into scalar per summary
  5. Group advantage normalization produces advantages for each summary
  6. GRPO objective computes loss with KL penalty
  7. Backpropagate to update policy model

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - ε and δ hyperparameters control dynamic range of per-dimension contributions
  - Group size G=8 balances advantage estimation quality with memory/compute cost
  - w_k weights default to -1 to align with GRPO; alternative weighting could prioritize specific dimensions

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Length collapse: Summaries become extremely short or long → check conciseness reward contribution
  - Dimension imbalance: One dimension dominates others → inspect per-dimension reward distributions
  - Training instability: KL divergence spikes or loss oscillates → reduce learning rate or increase KL coefficient
  - Low hypervolume despite high average scores: Indicates poor balance → verify hypervolume calculation implementation

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce GRPO baseline with Qwen 2.5 7B and confirm length collapse issue
  2. Ablate hypervolume vs. weighted sum on validation set; measure per-dimension scores and HV
  3. Ablate length constraint; quantify stability differences in training curves and final summary lengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can HVO effectively generalize to other text generation tasks beyond summarization, such as machine translation or open-ended dialogue?
- Basis: Method is formulated specifically for text summarization and evaluated exclusively on summarization datasets
- Why unresolved: Prompt structure, length constraints, and UniEval dimensions are tailored to summarization
- What evidence would resolve it: Application to non-summarization benchmarks with appropriate multi-dimensional reward definitions

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the high standard deviation in rewards observed during HVO training pose risks to convergence stability over extended training periods?
- Basis: Paper notes HVO maintains large standard deviation to facilitate exploration
- Why unresolved: While this aids exploration, it may prevent the model from reaching a stable optimum
- What evidence would resolve it: Longer-step training convergence curves and analysis of reward variance reduction

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the computational efficiency of HVO scale as the number of optimization objectives increases beyond the four tested dimensions?
- Basis: Paper claims efficiency over MDO (PCGrad) but doesn't profile hypervolume calculation overhead as dimensions grow
- Why unresolved: Hypervolume calculation complexity can increase non-linearly with objectives
- What evidence would resolve it: Complexity analysis and runtime comparisons varying number of reward dimensions

## Limitations
- Provides only high-level pseudocode for hypervolume reward aggregation without critical implementation details
- Length constraint mechanism assumes single average compression ratio applies across diverse document types
- Lacks ablation studies on hypervolume aggregation method itself
- Missing specification of KL coefficient β in GRPO objective

## Confidence

- **High Confidence (4/5)**: HVO successfully prevents length collapse compared to vanilla GRPO
- **Medium Confidence (3/5)**: Hypervolume optimization produces more balanced multi-objective performance than weighted-sum aggregation
- **Low Confidence (2/5)**: 7B HVO model performs comparably to GPT-4 on summarization

## Next Checks

1. **Implement ablation study**: Train identical Qwen 2.5 7B models using (a) vanilla GRPO with weighted-sum rewards, (b) HVO with hypervolume rewards, and (c) HVO without length constraint. Compare training stability metrics and final summary quality.

2. **Test cross-domain generalization**: Apply HVO to a different summarization domain (e.g., ArXiv academic abstracts) with distinct compression ratio characteristics. Measure whether the fixed ρ parameter generalizes or requires domain-specific tuning.

3. **Verify hypervolume implementation**: Create synthetic reward vectors with known Pareto front properties. Confirm that HVO's hypervolume calculation correctly ranks solutions according to geometric volume in objective space, and compare against alternative multi-objective ranking methods.
