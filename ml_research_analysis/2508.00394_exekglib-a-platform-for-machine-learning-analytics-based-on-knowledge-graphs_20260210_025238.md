# ExeKGLib: A Platform for Machine Learning Analytics based on Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00394
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00394
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Platform enables non-ML experts to develop ML pipelines through knowledge graphs

## Executive Summary
ExeKGLib is a Python-based platform that enables non-ML experts to develop machine learning pipelines by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs). The system encodes ML knowledge in simple, accessible terms using KGs that can be translated into executable data pipelines. The platform provides both a Python library and graphical interface, allowing users with minimal ML knowledge to build, validate, and execute ML pipelines for tasks including machine learning, statistics, and visualization.

The system was successfully evaluated in an industrial setting at Bosch for applications like welding quality monitoring and optimization. User studies demonstrated that ExeKGLib enhanced communication between domain experts and ML specialists, with scores above 4 for transparency and reusability dimensions on a 5-point scale.

## Method Summary
ExeKGLib utilizes one upper-level and three lower-level KG schemata to describe ML, Statistics, and Visualization tasks, ensuring transparency and reusability. The platform provides a Python-based solution with a graphical interface layer, allowing users to build ML pipelines through knowledge graph representations. The system translates these KG representations into executable data pipelines, making ML accessible to users without extensive ML expertise. The architecture supports the creation, validation, and execution of ML workflows through an intuitive interface that abstracts complex ML concepts.

## Key Results
- Enabled non-ML experts to develop ML pipelines using knowledge graphs
- Successful evaluation in Bosch industrial setting for welding quality monitoring
- User studies showed scores above 4 for transparency and reusability dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ExeKGLib works by translating complex machine learning concepts into accessible knowledge graph representations. By encoding ML knowledge in simple, visual formats, the platform bridges the gap between domain experts and ML specialists. The knowledge graph approach allows users to understand and manipulate ML pipelines without needing deep technical expertise in machine learning algorithms.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graph Schema Design - Understanding how to structure ML concepts in KG format; needed to create intuitive representations; quick check: can users navigate and understand the KG structure
- Pipeline Translation Logic - Converting KG representations to executable code; needed to ensure functional ML pipelines; quick check: do generated pipelines execute correctly
- Domain-ML Integration - Connecting domain knowledge with ML concepts; needed for practical applications; quick check: can users map their domain problems to ML solutions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
KG Schema Designer -> Pipeline Translator -> Execution Engine -> Result Visualizer

Critical Path:
User Input (KG) -> Schema Validation -> Pipeline Generation -> Execution -> Results Display

Design Tradeoffs:
- Simplicity vs. Flexibility: Prioritized accessibility over advanced customization options
- Transparency vs. Abstraction: Balanced clear visualization with necessary technical complexity
- Domain-specific vs. Generic: Focused on practical industrial applications rather than theoretical completeness

Failure Signatures:
- Invalid KG structures causing pipeline generation failures
- Mismatched data types leading to execution errors
- Incomplete pipeline definitions resulting in partial execution

First 3 Experiments:
1. Create a basic KG representation of a linear regression pipeline
2. Test the translation of a visualization KG into an executable plot
3. Validate pipeline execution with sample welding quality data
