core_contribution: This paper addresses modality imbalance and temporal misalignment
  in multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs) by proposing a temporal attention-guided
  adaptive fusion (TAAF) framework. The core idea is to dynamically assign temporal

  learning rates per modality based on these scores to prevent dominant modalities

# Spiking Neural Networks with Temporal Attention-Guided Adaptive Fusion for imbalanced Multi-modal Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.14535
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14535
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes TAAF framework for imbalanced multimodal SNNs with state-of-the-art performance on CREMA-D, AVE, and EAD datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenges of modality imbalance and temporal misalignment in multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs). The authors propose a temporal attention-guided adaptive fusion (TAAF) framework that dynamically assigns temporal importance scores at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of heterogeneous spike-based features. By modulating learning rates per modality based on these scores, the method prevents dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization while resolving temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations. The framework achieves superior performance on three benchmark datasets while maintaining energy efficiency advantages over traditional artificial neural networks.

## Method Summary
The TAAF framework introduces a novel approach to multimodal SNN learning by integrating temporal attention mechanisms with adaptive fusion strategies. At each timestep, the model computes temporal importance scores for each modality, which are then used to dynamically adjust learning rates and weight contributions during feature fusion. The architecture employs hierarchical integration that progressively combines spike-based features across different temporal scales, mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. A key innovation is the learnable time-warping operation that aligns asynchronous multimodal signals in the temporal domain, addressing a fundamental challenge in spike-based learning where precise temporal alignment is crucial for effective information integration.

## Key Results
- Achieves 77.55% accuracy on CREMA-D dataset for emotion recognition
- Reaches 70.65% accuracy on AVE dataset for audio-visual event classification
- Obtains 97.5% accuracy on EAD dataset for action detection
- Demonstrates significant energy efficiency improvements compared to traditional ANNs
- Establishes new state-of-the-art performance for multimodal SNNs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The TAAF framework succeeds by addressing the dual challenges of modality imbalance and temporal misalignment that plague multimodal learning systems. By assigning dynamic temporal importance scores, the model can adapt to the varying reliability and relevance of different modalities at each timestep. The adaptive learning rate modulation ensures that no single modality dominates the optimization process, preventing catastrophic forgetting of weaker modalities. The hierarchical integration structure allows for progressive feature fusion across multiple temporal scales, capturing both fine-grained and long-range dependencies in multimodal data. The temporal attention mechanism effectively mimics how biological systems dynamically weight sensory inputs based on their current relevance and reliability.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Input Spike Encoders -> Temporal Attention Module -> Adaptive Fusion Layer -> Hierarchical Integration Blocks -> Output Classifier
**Critical Path:** Temporal Attention -> Adaptive Fusion -> Hierarchical Integration
**Design Tradeoffs:** Higher temporal resolution improves alignment accuracy but increases computational cost; more hierarchical levels capture longer dependencies but risk overfitting.
**Failure Signatures:** Mode collapse when attention scores become too uniform; temporal misalignment when time-warping parameters diverge; overfitting when hierarchical integration becomes too deep.
**First Experiments:** 1) Ablation study removing temporal attention to measure its contribution. 2) Test with fixed learning rates to quantify adaptive modulation benefits. 3) Evaluate on synthetic misaligned data to validate temporal alignment capabilities.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions including how to extend the temporal attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of modalities without performance degradation, whether the current framework can be adapted for continuous learning scenarios where data distributions change over time, and how to incorporate top-down attention mechanisms that allow higher-level cognitive processes to influence temporal attention allocation. The authors also question the scalability of the learnable time-warping operations when dealing with extremely high-dimensional temporal data.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to three specific datasets, constraining generalizability
- Lack of comparison against non-SNN multimodal approaches for performance attribution
- Energy efficiency claims not supported by concrete measurements or benchmarks
- Temporal alignment mechanism scalability concerns with increasing modalities or temporal resolutions

## Confidence
- Multimodal SNN framework design: **High**
- Performance claims on tested datasets: **Medium**
- Energy efficiency claims: **Low**
- Temporal alignment mechanism scalability: **Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark against traditional ANN multimodal approaches on the same datasets to isolate the contribution of the temporal attention mechanism
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual impact of temporal attention versus adaptive fusion versus hierarchical integration
3. Test the framework on additional multimodal datasets from different domains to assess generalizability
