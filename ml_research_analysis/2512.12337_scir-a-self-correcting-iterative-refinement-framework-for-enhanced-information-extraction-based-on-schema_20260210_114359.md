# SCIR: A Self-Correcting Iterative Refinement Framework for Enhanced Information Extraction Based on Schema

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12337
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12337
- Reference count: 18
- Key result: Achieves 5.27% average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 while reducing training costs by 87% compared to baseline approaches

## Executive Summary
SCIR introduces a self-correcting iterative refinement framework designed to address two critical challenges in LLM-based information extraction: high training costs and alignment with model preferences. The framework employs a Dual-Path Self-Correcting module combined with feedback-driven optimization to enable effective plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs. The authors develop MBSC, a multi-task bilingual dataset specifically designed to capture edge cases and model errors, which is used to train and evaluate the system. Experiments demonstrate SCIR's superior performance across multiple IE tasks and languages, with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while substantially reducing computational overhead.

## Method Summary
SCIR implements a self-correcting iterative refinement framework that processes input through multiple refinement cycles. The system uses a Dual-Path Self-Correcting module that processes information through parallel correction paths, enabling the model to identify and fix errors iteratively. Feedback-driven optimization continuously adjusts the refinement process based on model outputs, creating a self-improving loop. The framework is designed to be compatible with existing LLMs without requiring extensive retraining of the base models. Training is conducted using the MBSC dataset, which captures challenging edge cases and common model errors across multiple information extraction tasks and languages.

## Key Results
- Achieves 5.27% average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 score over baseline methods
- Reduces training costs by 87% compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches
- Demonstrates strong cross-lingual performance with effective transfer between English and Chinese tasks
- Shows robust performance across multiple information extraction tasks including named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its iterative correction approach that allows models to progressively refine their outputs rather than relying on single-pass extraction. The Dual-Path architecture enables parallel processing of different error types and correction strategies, allowing the system to handle complex extraction scenarios more effectively than sequential approaches. The feedback-driven optimization creates a continuous improvement cycle where the model learns from its own mistakes and adapts its correction strategies over time. This combination of iterative refinement and parallel processing addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional LLMs in information extraction, where a single prediction pass often fails to capture the nuanced relationships and contextual dependencies required for accurate extraction.

## Foundational Learning
- **Iterative refinement in NLP**: The concept of processing outputs through multiple correction cycles rather than single predictions. Why needed: Traditional LLMs often make correlated errors that require multiple passes to correct. Quick check: Review examples where single-pass vs. multi-pass extraction yields different accuracy rates.
- **Dual-path architectures**: Parallel processing pathways that handle different aspects of the same task simultaneously. Why needed: Complex IE tasks often involve multiple error types that benefit from specialized correction strategies. Quick check: Verify that each path addresses distinct error categories.
- **Feedback-driven optimization**: Using model outputs to guide subsequent refinement steps and training updates. Why needed: Static correction strategies cannot adapt to the evolving error patterns in complex extraction tasks. Quick check: Measure improvement rates across refinement iterations.
- **Plug-and-play compatibility**: Design principles that allow framework integration without extensive base model modification. Why needed: Reduces deployment barriers and computational overhead for practical applications. Quick check: Test framework integration with different base LLM architectures.
- **Multi-task bilingual datasets**: Training data that spans multiple languages and information extraction tasks. Why needed: Ensures generalization across diverse real-world applications and language pairs. Quick check: Verify balanced representation across tasks and languages.
- **Error analysis in IE**: Systematic identification and categorization of common extraction errors to guide correction strategies. Why needed: Targeted corrections are more effective than generic refinement approaches. Quick check: Compare error reduction rates for targeted vs. non-targeted corrections.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Document -> Dual-Path Self-Correcting Module -> Initial Extraction -> Feedback Analysis -> Refined Extraction -> Output

Critical path: The Dual-Path Self-Correcting Module serves as the core component where initial extraction is analyzed and corrected. This module processes the base LLM's output through two parallel correction paths, each specialized for different types of extraction errors. The feedback analysis component evaluates the quality of corrections and guides subsequent refinement cycles, creating the iterative improvement loop that distinguishes SCIR from traditional approaches.

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes flexibility and efficiency over maximum specialization, trading some potential performance gains for broader applicability across different LLM architectures and tasks. The dual-path approach adds computational overhead compared to single-path correction but enables more comprehensive error handling. The iterative refinement process requires multiple processing cycles, increasing latency but significantly improving accuracy compared to single-pass approaches.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation typically manifests as diminishing returns after 3-4 refinement iterations, where additional cycles provide minimal improvement. The framework may struggle with extremely long documents where context windows limit effective error propagation between refinement cycles. Language-specific failures can occur when the MBSC dataset's coverage is uneven across languages, leading to systematic biases in certain language pairs.

First experiments to run:
1. Baseline comparison: Run the base LLM without SCIR refinement to establish performance floor
2. Single-path ablation: Test a modified version using only one correction path to measure dual-path contribution
3. Iteration limit analysis: Compare performance across 1, 2, 3, and 4 refinement iterations to identify optimal cycle count

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited methodological detail about MBSC dataset construction and validation procedures raises questions about reproducibility
- Plug-and-play compatibility claims need verification across diverse LLM architectures beyond initial implementation
- Bilingual effectiveness requires separate validation with independently constructed datasets for each language
- Framework performance may be sensitive to specific model families or size constraints not fully characterized

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical novelty of Dual-Path Self-Correcting architecture
- Medium confidence in training cost reduction claims due to limited methodological detail
- Medium confidence in Micro-F1 improvements pending independent replication
- Low confidence in generalizability claims without broader architecture testing

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the Dual-Path module to isolate its specific contribution to performance gains
2. Test the framework across diverse LLM architectures (different families and parameter scales) to verify true plug-and-play compatibility
3. Perform cross-lingual validation using separate, independently constructed datasets for each language to verify bilingual effectiveness claims
