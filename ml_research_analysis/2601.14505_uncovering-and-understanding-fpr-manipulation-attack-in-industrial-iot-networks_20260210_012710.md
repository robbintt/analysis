# Uncovering and Understanding FPR Manipulation Attack in Industrial IoT Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14505
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14505
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel FPR manipulation attack (FPA) achieves 80.19% to 100% success rate against ML-based IIoT NIDS by crafting benign MQTT packets that trigger false alerts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FPR Manipulation Attack (FPA), a novel cyberattack that exploits domain knowledge of the MQTT protocol to craft benign packets that evade detection and trigger false positive alerts in machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) for Industrial IoT networks. The attacker systematically pads MQTT topic names with whitespace characters, creating benign packets that are misclassified as malicious attacks by ML-NIDS. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks, FPA does not require gradient-based methods, making it simple yet highly effective. The attack demonstrates significant operational impact, with small fractions of false alerts causing substantial delays in genuine alert investigations.

## Method Summary
The attack crafts MQTT PUBLISH packets by extending topic names with whitespace characters while maintaining protocol validity. The attacker uses the single-level wildcard "+" in MQTT Access Control Lists to ensure valid connections while manipulating data. Crafted packets are sent to an MQTT server, captured via network tap, and processed by feature extraction pipelines to create 61-feature vectors matching the Edge-IIoTset schema. These samples are then evaluated against four pre-existing NIDS architectures (DCNNBiLSTM, CNN-LSTM-GRU, SF-CNN-LSTM, and Hybrid CNN-LSTM) to measure attack success rates and confidence scores.

## Key Results
- FPA achieves 80.19% to 100% attack success rate across four ML-NIDS architectures
- Most models show overconfidence during misclassification (high confidence scores > 0.9)
- 1% to 16% false positive alerts can delay genuine alert investigations by up to 2 hours per day
- Adversarial training eliminates FPA but severely degrades detection of true attack classes like Port Scanning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Whitespace Padding Strategy
If an attacker pads MQTT topic names with whitespace characters, the resulting packets can bypass Deep Packet Inspection while inducing misclassification in ML-based NIDS. MQTT topic names are categorical string features, and appending spaces creates distinct feature values that diverge from training distribution without violating protocol syntax, shifting samples toward attack decision boundaries.

### Mechanism 2: Packet Length Distribution Manipulation
If benign packets are crafted to contain specific payload lengths, the resulting distributional shift in intra-packet features causes traffic to overlap with true attack classes in the model's latent space. The attack manipulates payload content to change secondary features like mqtt.len and tcp.len, making statistical profiles mimic "Uploading" or "Vulnerability scanner" attacks.

### Mechanism 3: Adversarial Training Side Effects
If adversarial training is used to defend against FPA, the model's decision boundary will distort, leading to misclassification of true attack traffic as benign. Augmenting training data with FPA samples forces the model to expand the "benign" decision region, encroaching on regions previously assigned to true attack classes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Operation Point Drift (FNR vs. FPR):** Understanding this distinction is critical to differentiating FPA from standard evasion. Quick check: Does the FPA attack primarily increase False Negative Rate or False Positive Rate?

- **MQTT Protocol & ACLs:** The attack exploits the gap between protocol validity and model expectations. Quick check: Why does the attacker prefer using the single-level wildcard (+) over the multi-level wildcard (#) in the ACL configuration?

- **Black-box Adversarial Machine Learning:** The attacker has no knowledge of model architecture or weights. Quick check: Does this attack require gradient-based optimization (like FGSM) to generate adversarial samples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Compromised Client -> MQTT Server (Broker) -> Network Tap (DPI/Router) -> Feature Extractor -> ML-NIDS -> Alert Queue

- **Critical path:** The attack succeeds only if the MQTT Server accepts the padded topics (validating against wildcard rule) AND the Feature Extractor includes the padded spaces in the feature vector passed to the NIDS.

- **Design tradeoffs:** The paper highlights a critical tradeoff in defense: Robustness vs. Accuracy. Retraining the NIDS with FPA samples achieves 0% ASR but drops detection accuracy for specific attacks like Port Scanning from 99% to 0%.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Model Failure: Overconfidence in wrong predictions (High confidence score > 0.9, Low entropy < 0.5)
  - Operational Failure: Sudden spike in "Uploading" or "Vulnerability Scanner" alerts from devices publishing valid MQTT sensor data

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Protocol Compliance Test: Verify that whitespace-padded topics pass standard MQTT brokers without session termination
  2. Transferability Test: Evaluate FPA packets against four identified NIDS architectures to confirm high ASR
  3. SOC Impact Simulation: Simulate queuing model with varying FPA alert percentages to quantify waiting time increases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can a defense strategy be developed that immunizes models against FPA without significantly degrading detection accuracy of true attack classes? The authors demonstrate the tradeoff exists but do not propose alternatives that avoid the penalty.

### Open Question 2
Does the FPA vulnerability generalize to other common IIoT protocols (CoAP, AMQP, Modbus) that utilize similar packet length encoding? The study is limited to MQTT within Edge-IIoTset dataset.

### Open Question 3
Can feature selection or input normalization (specifically targeting length-based features) mitigate FPA without compromising the model's ability to detect attacks that rely on packet size? SHAP analysis identifies key features but doesn't evaluate removing them as defense.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends on ML-NIDS preprocessing behavior retaining whitespace in MQTT topics, which varies across implementations
- Reported 80.19% to 100% ASR lacks statistical significance testing across multiple runs or datasets
- Defense analysis shows adversarial training eliminates FPA but severely degrades true attack detection without exploring alternative mitigation strategies

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Whitespace padding mechanism to create distributional shifts is technically sound and well-explained; operational impact quantification is methodologically rigorous
- **Medium confidence:** SHAP-based feature importance analysis correctly identifies key features, but causal link to misclassification needs more direct experimental validation
- **Low confidence:** Claim that adversarial training "significantly degrades performance on true attack classes" is supported by observations but lacks quantitative benchmarks comparing alternative defense strategies

## Next Checks

1. **Preprocessing verification:** Test whether common NIDS implementations (Zeek, Suricata) preserve whitespace in MQTT topic strings during feature extraction

2. **Cross-dataset evaluation:** Evaluate FPA against NIDS trained on different IIoT datasets to assess attack transferability and robustness across varying feature distributions

3. **Defense comparison study:** Implement and benchmark alternative FPA defenses (input sanitization, feature clipping, ensemble voting) against adversarial training to quantify accuracy-robustness tradeoff
