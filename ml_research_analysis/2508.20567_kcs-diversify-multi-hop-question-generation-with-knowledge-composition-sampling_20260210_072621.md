# KCS: Diversify Multi-hop Question Generation with Knowledge Composition Sampling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.20567
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20567

- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: 3.9% improvement in knowledge composition selection accuracy and consistent MHQA performance gains

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the data sparsity problem in multi-hop question answering by introducing Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), a framework that diversifies generated multi-hop questions through varied knowledge compositions. Rather than relying on fixed knowledge sets, KCS treats knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional prediction task and employs a probabilistic contrastive loss to learn knowledge coherence. The framework uses stochastic decoding with dynamic nucleus sampling to balance accuracy and diversity. Experiments on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA demonstrate improved knowledge composition selection accuracy and downstream MHQA performance.

## Method Summary
The KCS framework tackles multi-hop question generation by modeling knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional prediction task. It employs a probabilistic contrastive loss to learn potential knowledge coherence relationships, enabling the model to identify diverse yet coherent knowledge compositions from the context. During inference, KCS implements a stochastic decoding strategy that truncates unreliable probability tails and samples from a dynamic nucleus, balancing accuracy with diversity. This approach addresses data sparsity by generating varied multi-hop questions from the same context, improving both the diversity of training data and the generalization capability of downstream MHQA models.

## Key Results
- 3.9% improvement in overall accuracy of knowledge composition selection
- Consistent improvements in downstream MHQA performance on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA
- Enhanced diversity in generated multi-hop questions through varied knowledge compositions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
KCS works by addressing the fundamental limitation of traditional multi-hop question generation approaches that rely on fixed or pre-identified knowledge sets. By treating knowledge composition selection as a conditional prediction task and using probabilistic contrastive loss, the framework learns to identify coherent relationships between different knowledge elements. The stochastic decoding strategy then leverages this learned coherence to generate diverse question variations while maintaining accuracy. This approach effectively expands the training data space by creating multiple valid question paths from the same context, addressing data sparsity and improving model robustness.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Multi-hop QA reasoning** - Why needed: Understanding how questions require reasoning across multiple knowledge pieces; Quick check: Can identify supporting facts spanning multiple documents
2. **Knowledge composition diversity** - Why needed: Recognizing that multiple valid knowledge paths can answer the same question; Quick check: Can enumerate alternative reasoning paths for a given query
3. **Probabilistic contrastive learning** - Why needed: Learning coherent knowledge relationships through relative comparisons; Quick check: Can distinguish between coherent and incoherent knowledge combinations
4. **Stochastic decoding strategies** - Why needed: Balancing generation accuracy with diversity; Quick check: Can implement nucleus sampling with dynamic thresholds
5. **Conditional prediction at sentence level** - Why needed: Modeling knowledge selection as a sequential decision process; Quick check: Can predict next relevant sentence given current context
6. **Data augmentation for QA** - Why needed: Understanding how generated data improves model generalization; Quick check: Can measure impact of augmented data on downstream performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Context -> Knowledge Composition Predictor -> Probabilistic Contrastive Loss -> Stochastic Decoder -> Diverse Questions

**Critical Path:** The knowledge composition predictor selects relevant knowledge pieces using sentence-level conditional prediction, which are then scored using the probabilistic contrastive loss to learn coherence. The stochastic decoder uses these scores to generate diverse questions through dynamic nucleus sampling.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Accuracy vs. diversity balance through stochastic decoding parameters; computational overhead of knowledge composition prediction vs. improved downstream performance; complexity of probabilistic contrastive loss vs. effectiveness in learning coherence.

**Failure Signatures:** Over-conservative sampling leading to limited diversity; unstable nucleus truncation causing generation failures; contrastive loss learning suboptimal knowledge relationships; computational bottlenecks during inference.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Evaluate knowledge composition selection accuracy with and without probabilistic contrastive loss
2. Compare generated question diversity using different stochastic decoding parameters
3. Measure downstream MHQA performance improvement with KCS-generated data augmentation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Diversity improvements lack rigorous semantic validation metrics
- Computational efficiency and runtime overhead not thoroughly analyzed
- Performance generalization to datasets beyond HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA not sufficiently validated

## Confidence

**Confidence Assessment:**
- High confidence in technical implementation of knowledge composition sampling framework
- Medium confidence in reported improvements in knowledge composition selection accuracy
- Low confidence in claimed generalization to diverse question generation scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate impact of probabilistic contrastive loss versus stochastic decoding strategy on question diversity
2. Evaluate computational efficiency and runtime overhead of KCS compared to baselines across different dataset sizes
3. Test framework performance on additional multi-hop QA datasets with varying complexity and domain characteristics to assess generalization capability
