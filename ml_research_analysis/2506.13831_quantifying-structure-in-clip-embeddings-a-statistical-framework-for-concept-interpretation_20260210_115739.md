# Quantifying Structure in CLIP Embeddings: A Statistical Framework for Concept Interpretation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.13831
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13831
- Authors: Jitian Zhao; Chenghui Li; Frederic Sala; Karl Rohe

- Primary result: Introduces statistical framework for identifying interpretable concepts in CLIP embeddings through rotation-sensitive structure detection

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel statistical framework for extracting interpretable concepts from CLIP embeddings by detecting rotation-sensitive structure in embedding spaces. The authors develop a hypothesis testing approach that distinguishes meaningful semantic structure from noise by comparing observed patterns against rotation-invariant null distributions. The method combines statistical rigor with practical interpretability, enabling researchers to identify and analyze concepts within neural embeddings.

The framework is demonstrated on the Waterbirds dataset, where it successfully identifies and removes background-related concepts that contribute to spurious correlations. The approach achieves a 22.6% improvement in worst-group accuracy after eliminating these problematic concepts, showcasing its practical utility for addressing fairness issues in vision-language models. The work bridges statistical hypothesis testing with concept extraction, providing a theoretically grounded method for understanding what vision-language models learn.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a two-stage approach for concept extraction from CLIP embeddings. First, they employ statistical hypothesis testing to detect rotation-sensitive structure by comparing observed embedding patterns against rotation-invariant null distributions. This identifies whether meaningful concepts exist beyond random noise in the embedding space. Second, they apply a post-hoc decomposition method that combines Varimax rotation with singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract sparse, orthogonal concept components. The Varimax rotation ensures interpretable factor loadings while maintaining orthogonality constraints. This decomposition achieves both high reconstruction fidelity of the original embeddings and clear semantic interpretability of the extracted concepts, enabling researchers to understand the latent structure learned by vision-language models.

## Key Results
- Achieved 22.6% improvement in worst-group accuracy on Waterbirds dataset after removing background-related concepts
- Demonstrated high reconstruction fidelity while maintaining interpretability of extracted concepts
- Provided theoretical identifiability guarantees for Varimax rotation and reconstruction error bounds for fixed-concept methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework exploits the observation that meaningful semantic concepts in embedding space manifest as rotation-sensitive structure, while random noise remains rotation-invariant. By statistically testing for this rotation sensitivity, the method can distinguish between genuine semantic patterns and spurious correlations or noise. The Varimax rotation further enhances interpretability by maximizing the variance of squared loadings, producing sparse factor structures where each concept loads strongly on only a subset of dimensions. This combination of statistical testing and orthogonal decomposition creates a principled approach to concept extraction that balances mathematical rigor with practical interpretability.

## Foundational Learning

**Rotation-sensitive structure detection**: The ability to identify patterns in embedding space that change under rotation but remain consistent in semantic meaning. Why needed: To distinguish meaningful concepts from random noise. Quick check: Verify that identified concepts maintain semantic coherence under different rotation transformations.

**Varimax rotation**: An orthogonal rotation technique that maximizes the variance of squared loadings across factors. Why needed: To produce sparse, interpretable concept representations where each concept loads on only a few dimensions. Quick check: Confirm that factor loadings become more polarized (closer to 0 or 1) after Varimax application.

**Hypothesis testing against rotation-invariant null distributions**: Statistical framework for evaluating whether observed structure exceeds what would be expected by chance under rotation invariance. Why needed: To provide statistical significance guarantees for concept identification. Quick check: Validate that p-values correctly control false positive rates under the null hypothesis.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: CLIP embeddings -> Statistical testing -> Rotation-sensitive structure detection -> Varimax + SVD decomposition -> Orthogonal concept components

Critical path: Input CLIP embeddings undergo statistical testing to identify rotation-sensitive structure, which then guides the Varimax-SVD decomposition to extract interpretable concepts. The testing phase determines whether meaningful structure exists before committing computational resources to decomposition.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades some reconstruction accuracy for interpretability by enforcing orthogonality constraints. Alternative non-orthogonal approaches might capture more complex semantic relationships but would sacrifice the clear interpretability that orthogonal concepts provide.

Failure signatures: The method may fail when concepts are inherently non-orthogonal or when rotation sensitivity does not capture the true nature of semantic structure. Additionally, the statistical tests may produce false positives in high-dimensional spaces with complex correlation structures.

First experiments:
1. Test rotation sensitivity detection on synthetic data with known ground truth concepts
2. Compare Varimax-based decomposition against alternative rotation methods (Quartimax, Equamax)
3. Evaluate concept stability across different random seeds and initialization conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The authors acknowledge several open questions regarding their framework. First, the assumption that meaningful concepts manifest as rotation-sensitive structure may not hold universally across all vision-language models or downstream tasks. The framework's effectiveness could vary significantly depending on the specific architecture and training objectives. Second, the sensitivity of statistical tests to comparison set choices is not thoroughly explored, raising questions about the robustness of concept identification across different experimental configurations. Finally, the orthogonal constraint in concept extraction may artificially separate semantically related concepts, potentially limiting the framework's ability to capture nuanced semantic relationships in the data.

## Limitations

- The rotation-sensitive structure assumption may not generalize to all models or tasks
- Orthogonal constraint may force artificial separation of semantically related concepts
- Limited evaluation scope with only Waterbirds dataset testing
- No analysis of computational scalability to larger embedding dimensions or datasets

## Confidence

- High confidence: The statistical framework for detecting rotation-sensitive structure is methodologically sound
- Medium confidence: The Varimax-based decomposition approach is effective for concept extraction
- Low confidence: Generalization claims to other datasets, tasks, and model architectures

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the method on multiple datasets beyond Waterbirds, including those with different types of spurious correlations and concept distributions

2. Test the framework on alternative vision-language models (e.g., Flamingo, BLIP) to assess model-agnostic performance

3. Conduct ablation studies on comparison set selection strategies to quantify their impact on concept identification quality
