# From Classical to Hybrid: A Practical Framework for Quantum-Enhanced Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08205
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08205
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Hybrid quantum-classical models refined using QMetric diagnostics improved accuracy from 0.31 to 0.87 on Iris dataset

## Executive Summary
This work presents a practical three-stage framework enabling classical machine learning practitioners to transition to hybrid quantum-classical workflows without requiring quantum expertise. The approach starts with a classical self-training model, progresses to a minimal hybrid quantum variant, and finally refines the architecture using QMetric diagnostics to identify and address weaknesses. Applied to the Iris dataset with an iterative self-training procedure, the refined hybrid model demonstrated substantial improvement, achieving an accuracy of 0.87 compared to 0.31 for the classical baseline. The QMetric tool guided enhancements by revealing low entanglement and limited feature diversity, leading to targeted adjustments such as deeper entangling circuits and added classical adapter layers.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a three-stage methodology: first establishing a classical PLS-based self-training baseline with index-initialized labels and iterative refinement (max 20 iterations); second, implementing a minimal hybrid quantum model using a 2-qubit EstimatorQNN wrapped in the same training loop; third, running QMetric diagnostics to identify weaknesses and applying targeted architectural refinements including deeper entangling circuits, adapter layers, and weight regularization. The approach uses Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features) and evaluates performance through accuracy, ARI, NMI, and internal consistency metrics, with diagnostics monitoring entanglement, gradients, and feature space properties.

## Key Results
- Classical baseline achieved 0.31 accuracy, refined hybrid model reached 0.87
- QMetric diagnostics identified low entanglement (EEE=0.175, QMI=0.350) as limiting factor
- Targeted architectural refinements (deeper entangling circuits, adapter layers) increased entanglement to EEE=0.718, QMI=1.436 while maintaining training stability
- HybridPlus maintained stable gradients (QGN=0.0258, BPI=0.000042) and avoided barren plateau effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Quantum feature encoding can improve class separation in the learned representation space.
- Mechanism: Data encoded into quantum states via parameterized circuits operates in Hilbert space, which may provide geometrically favorable representations for classification that differ from classical feature mappings.
- Core assumption: The quantum feature space preserves or enhances discriminative structure relevant to the classification task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "refined hybrid model improved accuracy from 0.31 (classical baseline) to 0.87"
  - [section 3]: "showcasing one the strengths of hybrid approach, as the separation of data classes is better in the feature space, after encoding the data for quantum computers"
  - [corpus]: FD4QC report similarly observed improved binary classification with quantum-hybrid models, though on different data.
- Break condition: If quantum encoding destroys discriminative features through noise, decoherence, or inappropriate ansatz choice.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Diagnostic metrics on entanglement and gradients can guide targeted architectural refinements.
- Mechanism: QMetric provides quantitative indicators (EEE, QMI for entanglement; QGN, BPI for gradients; EDQFS, QOS for feature space). Low values signal specific weaknesses that inform concrete modifications—e.g., low EEE/QMI motivates deeper entangling circuits.
- Core assumption: Diagnostic metrics correlate meaningfully with model performance and generalize across similar tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "iterative refinement loop, driven by quantitative diagnostics on entanglement, gradient behavior, and feature space properties, offers a systematic pathway"
  - [section 3]: "low EEE and QMI indicated insufficient entanglement... HybridPlus variant increased entanglement depth and concentrated the feature space representation"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corroboration—related papers emphasize hybrid architectures but not diagnostic-driven refinement specifically.
- Break condition: If increased circuit depth triggers barren plateaus (BPI rising sharply) or if metrics do not transfer across datasets.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Expressiveness gains from deeper entanglement can be achieved without sacrificing trainability when paired with stabilization techniques.
- Mechanism: Weight regularization concentrates the embedding; gradient clipping and early stopping prevent divergence. This allows deeper, fully entangling circuits to improve separation while maintaining stable gradients.
- Core assumption: Trade-offs between expressiveness and trainability are manageable through architectural and optimization choices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1]: "Early stopping and gradient clipping are applied to maintain training stability"
  - [section 3]: HybridPlus shows "training remained stable, TSI=1.0, and gradients did not collapse, QGN=0.0258, BPI=0.000042"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence—corpus papers do not report comparable stability analyses.
- Break condition: If entanglement depth exceeds a threshold where barren plateaus dominate (not observed here with 2-qubit circuits).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression**
  - Why needed here: The classical baseline uses PLS-based self-training for iterative label refinement.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how PLS handles multicollinear features differently from ordinary least squares?

- Concept: **Parameterized Quantum Circuits (Variational Ansätze)**
  - Why needed here: The hybrid models use EstimatorQNN—a parameterized quantum circuit whose gate angles are optimized classically.
  - Quick check question: Can you sketch a single-qubit rotation gate with a trainable parameter and explain how gradients flow through it?

- Concept: **Quantum Entanglement (Two-Qubit Correlations)**
  - Why needed here: EEE and QMI diagnostics measure entanglement; increasing entanglement depth was key to HybridPlus improvements.
  - Quick check question: Why can a CNOT gate create correlations between qubits that single-qubit gates cannot?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input preprocessing: PCA(4) → Optional classical adapter layer (HybridPlus only) → Quantum circuit (2-qubit EstimatorQNN, variable entanglement depth) → Classical neural head (maps quantum outputs → label estimates) → Self-training loop with PLS-based iterative label refinement

- Critical path:
  1. Build and validate classical PLS self-training baseline first
  2. Wrap 2-qubit EstimatorQNN with identical training loop (Quantum-FAST)
  3. Run QMetric diagnostics; identify weak points from EEE, QMI, QGN, BPI, EDQFS, QOS
  4. Apply targeted modifications (deeper entanglement, adapter layer, regularization)
  5. Iterate until diagnostics stabilize and accuracy plateaus

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Deeper entanglement → better separation vs. higher barren plateau risk
  - Higher EDQFS → more expressive vs. potentially unfocused representation
  - Aggressive label updates → faster convergence vs. error propagation

- Failure signatures:
  - TSI < 1.0 → training instability
  - BPI rising toward 1 → entering barren plateau regime
  - Low EEE/QMI with flat accuracy → quantum component underutilized
  - High EDQFS + low accuracy → representation not aligned to task

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce classical PLS self-training baseline on Iris; verify ~0.31 accuracy and internal consistency ~0.83.
  2. Implement Quantum-FAST (2-qubit EstimatorQNN, same training loop); target accuracy ~0.83.
  3. Run QMetric on Quantum-FAST; identify top 2 diagnostic weaknesses and implement one targeted refinement (e.g., add entangling layer if EEE/QMI low).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the proposed framework generalize to more complex, higher-dimensional datasets beyond the intentionally simplified Iris dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge using "an intentionally simplified model on the Iris dataset" and do not demonstrate applicability to other benchmark datasets.
- Why unresolved: The Iris dataset has only 150 samples and 4 features; it remains unclear whether the diagnostic-driven refinement approach scales to datasets with higher dimensionality or more complex class structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the three-stage framework to standard ML benchmarks (e.g., MNIST, UCI repositories) with reporting of accuracy, ARI, and NMI improvements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the framework perform when deployed on actual quantum hardware rather than simulators?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All experiments use Qiskit simulators; no results from real quantum devices are reported, yet noise and decoherence are known challenges for variational quantum circuits.
- Why unresolved: The QMetric diagnostics (TSI, BPI, QGN) measure training behavior in idealized conditions—whether these metrics remain predictive under hardware noise is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the HybridPlus experiments on IBM Quantum or similar hardware, comparing diagnostic readings and final accuracy against simulator baselines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would the hybrid approach still outperform a properly tuned classical baseline, rather than the intentionally weak self-training model?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The classical baseline achieves only 0.31 accuracy by design ("intentionally not well trained baseline"), raising the question of whether quantum enhancements provide genuine advantage over competitive classical methods.
- Why unresolved: The 0.87 accuracy improvement may partially reflect the weak starting point rather than inherent quantum advantage.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparison against established classical classifiers (e.g., SVM, random forests, neural networks) with hyperparameter tuning on the same data splits.

## Limitations

- Key architectural details (ansatz design, neural head configuration, optimization hyperparameters) are unspecified, blocking faithful reproduction
- Diagnostic metrics' generalizability beyond the Iris experiment lacks strong external validation
- Performance claims relative to competitive classical methods are not established, as the baseline is intentionally weak

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Classical-to-hybrid transition workflow is clearly specified; experimental results on Iris are internally consistent; accuracy improvements from 0.31 to 0.87 are documented.
- **Medium confidence**: Diagnostic metrics (EEE, QMI, QGN, BPI) are conceptually sound and showed expected patterns; the self-training loop implementation is straightforward.
- **Low confidence**: Ansatz architecture details, hyperparameter choices, and QMetric implementation specifics are not provided; generalization claims lack external validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Diagnostic Transferability Test**: Apply the QMetric diagnostic suite to Quantum-FAST on two additional small datasets (e.g., Wine, Breast Cancer) to assess whether low EEE/QMI consistently predicts performance gaps requiring architectural refinement.

2. **Barren Plateau Boundary Analysis**: Systematically vary entanglement depth beyond the current 2-qubit setup while monitoring BPI and QGN to empirically map the barren plateau threshold for this specific ansatz family.

3. **Minimal Viable Ansatz Reconstruction**: Based on reported metrics (EEE=0.175→0.718, QMI=0.350→1.436), reconstruct the most likely entangling circuit architecture and validate that it reproduces the documented performance trajectory when applied to Iris.
