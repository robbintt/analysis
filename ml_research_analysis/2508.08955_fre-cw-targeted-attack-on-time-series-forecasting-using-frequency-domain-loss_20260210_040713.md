# Fre-CW: Targeted Attack on Time Series Forecasting using Frequency Domain Loss

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.08955
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08955
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Primary result:** Frequency domain optimization improves targeted adversarial attacks on transformer-based time series forecasting models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of transformer-based time series forecasting models to adversarial attacks by proposing Fre-CW, a targeted attack method that incorporates frequency domain loss into the Carlini and Wagner (C&W) attack framework. The authors transform time series into the frequency domain using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and optimize both time and frequency domain losses to generate adversarial samples that are more effective at deceiving forecasting models while maintaining data realism. Experiments on six benchmark datasets with two forecasting models demonstrate that Fre-CW outperforms baseline methods with significant reductions in attack error metrics.

## Method Summary
Fre-CW extends the Carlini and Wagner attack framework by incorporating frequency domain optimization through Discrete Fourier Transform. The method transforms time series data into the frequency domain, where it optimizes both time domain loss (for attack effectiveness) and frequency domain loss (for maintaining data realism and capturing signal characteristics). This dual-domain approach allows the attack to better preserve low-frequency trends and high-frequency abrupt changes that are characteristic of realistic time series data. The optimization process generates adversarial samples that can effectively deceive transformer-based forecasting models while remaining perceptually similar to legitimate data.

## Key Results
- Fre-CW achieves MAE reductions of 0.009-0.039 compared to baseline attacks on PatchTST model
- MSE reductions of 0.014-0.043 are observed when using Fre-CW versus baseline methods
- The attack outperforms established baselines (FGSM, PGD, C&W) across six benchmark datasets
- Frequency domain optimization improves both attack effectiveness and stealthiness of adversarial samples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The frequency domain optimization in Fre-CW works by capturing both low-frequency trends and high-frequency abrupt changes in time series data, which are critical characteristics that distinguish realistic data from artificial perturbations. By optimizing in both time and frequency domains simultaneously, the attack can generate adversarial samples that maintain the statistical properties of legitimate time series while still effectively deceiving the forecasting model. This dual-domain approach addresses a key limitation of traditional attacks that only operate in the time domain, which can produce samples that are easily detectable due to their unrealistic frequency characteristics.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Carlini and Wagner (C&W) Attack**: A powerful targeted adversarial attack method that formulates attack generation as an optimization problem; needed to understand the baseline framework being extended.
2. **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**: Mathematical transformation that converts time domain signals into frequency domain representation; essential for analyzing and manipulating frequency characteristics of time series.
3. **Time Series Forecasting Models**: Machine learning models designed to predict future values in sequential data; understanding these is crucial for evaluating attack effectiveness.
4. **Adversarial Attack Metrics**: Measures like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) used to quantify attack performance; needed to interpret experimental results.
5. **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Techniques for examining signal characteristics in frequency space rather than time space; provides insights into signal structure and realism.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Time Series -> Discrete Fourier Transform -> Dual-Domain Optimization -> Adversarial Sample Generation -> Forecasting Model Evaluation

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves transforming input data to frequency domain, optimizing adversarial perturbations across both domains, and generating the final adversarial sample that achieves targeted misclassification while maintaining frequency characteristics.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The dual-domain optimization introduces computational overhead compared to single-domain attacks but provides better attack effectiveness and stealthiness. The balance between time and frequency domain losses must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance.

**Failure Signatures:**
Attack failure occurs when the adversarial sample either fails to achieve targeted misclassification or produces unrealistic frequency characteristics that are easily detected. Poor frequency domain loss weighting can result in either ineffective attacks or detectable anomalies.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test Fre-CW against a simple linear forecasting model to establish baseline effectiveness
2. Evaluate attack performance on synthetic time series with known frequency characteristics
3. Compare computational runtime of dual-domain optimization versus single-domain baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on transformer-based models, limiting generalizability to other architectures
- Does not address potential defenses against frequency-based attacks
- Computational overhead of dual-domain optimization is not thoroughly characterized
- Datasets are primarily energy-related, which may limit applicability to other domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Fre-CW's superior performance against established baselines (FGSM, PGD, C&W) is well-supported by experimental data
- The methodology for incorporating frequency domain loss into the C&W framework is clearly described and reproducible

**Medium Confidence:**
- The claim that frequency domain analysis inherently improves attack stealthiness is theoretically motivated but lacks direct empirical validation through perceptual studies

**Low Confidence:**
- Assertions about generalizability to all time series forecasting scenarios are overstated given the limited model and domain coverage in experiments

## Next Checks
1. Test Fre-CW against non-transformer models (LSTM, GRU, ARIMA) to assess architectural generalizability of the frequency-based attack approach
2. Evaluate the computational overhead and runtime performance impact of the dual-domain optimization compared to single-domain baselines
3. Conduct perceptual studies or signal processing analysis to quantify whether frequency-optimized adversarial samples are indeed more "realistic" or harder to detect than traditional attacks
