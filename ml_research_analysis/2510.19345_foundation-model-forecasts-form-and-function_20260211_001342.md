# Foundation Model Forecasts: Form and Function

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.19345
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19345
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Trajectory ensembles are strictly most expressive forecast form; most published TSFMs produce only marginal forecasts despite path-dependent tasks requiring joint distributions.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes that the forecast form—point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble—fundamentally determines the operational tasks a Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM) can support. The authors prove that trajectory ensembles are strictly most expressive, enabling direct conversion to simpler forms via marginalization, while the reverse requires strong assumptions about temporal dependence. They map six core forecasting tasks (e.g., VaR, threshold crossing) to minimal sufficient forecast types and provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. A survey reveals that two-thirds of published TSFMs produce only marginal forecasts, yet many operational tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. The analysis demonstrates that forecast type, not accuracy, often differentiates practical utility when multiple models achieve similar performance.

## Method Summary
The paper provides a theoretical framework mapping TSFM output forms to operational tasks using compatible metrics. It proves that trajectory ensembles are strictly most expressive—capable of direct marginalization to simpler forms without information loss—while marginals cannot uniquely determine joint distributions for path-dependent events. The method involves identifying forecast type, applying task-aligned metrics (e.g., CRPS for marginal calibration, Energy Score for temporal dependence), and converting between forms via marginalization or copula methods when cross-comparison is needed. The framework is validated through survey analysis of published TSFMs and theoretical proofs of equivalence/non-equivalence relationships.

## Key Results
- Trajectory ensembles are strictly most expressive forecast form; all simpler forms can be derived via marginalization without additional assumptions
- Marginals cannot determine path-dependent event probabilities—infinitely many joint distributions share identical marginals but yield different probabilities for threshold crossings
- Two-thirds of published TSFMs produce only point or parametric forecasts, yet many operational tasks require trajectory ensembles
- Forecast form, not accuracy, often differentiates practical utility when multiple models achieve similar marginal performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper works by establishing mathematical relationships between forecast forms and proving which operational tasks each form can support. It demonstrates that temporal dependence structure cannot be recovered from marginals alone, making trajectory ensembles necessary for path-dependent tasks. The framework provides clear conversion rules and metric selection criteria based on the target task's dependence structure requirements.

## Foundational Learning

**Temporal dependence preservation**: Why needed: Path-dependent tasks like VaR and threshold crossing require joint distributions, not just marginals. Quick check: Compare Energy Score (joint) vs CRPS (marginal) on the same forecasts—discrepancies indicate lost temporal structure.

**Copula-based conversion**: Why needed: Converting between forecast forms requires modeling dependence structure when going from marginals to joint distributions. Quick check: Validate reconstructed trajectories against original pathwise metrics to ensure copula assumptions hold.

**Task-aligned metric selection**: Why needed: Different tasks require different forecast properties—marginal tasks need calibration metrics, path-dependent tasks need joint distribution metrics. Quick check: Match evaluation metrics to task requirements using the framework's task-to-metric mapping.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: TSFM outputs -> Forecast Form Classification -> Task Mapping -> Metric Selection -> Evaluation

**Critical path**: Identify forecast form → Select appropriate metrics → Convert forms if needed → Evaluate task performance

**Design tradeoffs**: Trajectory ensembles provide maximum expressiveness but higher computational/storage costs vs. marginal forecasts that are efficient but limited to marginal tasks

**Failure signatures**: High CRPS but poor Energy Score indicates marginal calibration without temporal dependence; independence copula assumptions underestimate persistence in reconstructed trajectories

**First experiments**:
1. Convert Chronos trajectory outputs to quantiles via marginalization and verify identical marginal calibration
2. Apply vine copula to Chronos quantiles and reconstruct trajectories, then compare Energy Score to original
3. Compare VaR estimates from marginal-only models vs. trajectory ensembles on threshold crossing events

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Multi-model ensemble design**: How can practitioners effectively ensemble forecasts from multiple TSFMs that produce different output forms without discarding the joint distribution information of the richer model? The paper notes practitioners must convert to common form, potentially discarding valuable information.

**Copula validation protocols**: What constitutes a rigorous validation protocol for copula-based temporal dependence reconstruction when using marginal-only TSFMs for path-dependent tasks? Standard benchmarks lack specific protocols to verify assumed dependence structures match true temporal dynamics.

**Adaptive architecture design**: Can TSFM architectures be designed to balance the strict expressiveness of trajectory ensembles with the computational efficiency of marginal forecasts? Current models choose either expressiveness or efficiency, leading to suboptimal solutions for mixed-task applications.

## Limitations

- Theoretical framework lacks empirical validation for all conversion pathways, particularly copula-based reconstruction from quantiles to trajectories
- Claims about forecast form determining utility are based on model surveys rather than controlled experiments showing divergent task performance
- Focus on six core tasks doesn't address complex operational scenarios where forecast type interactions may be non-additive

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Theoretical proofs of equivalence between forecast forms; task-to-forecast type mapping; survey results on current TSFM output diversity
- **Medium Confidence**: Practical implications for real-world systems; framework for task-aligned evaluation; recommendations for metric selection
- **Low Confidence**: Universal applicability across all forecasting domains; generalizability of survey findings to future architectures; performance bounds for copula conversions

## Next Checks

1. **Controlled experiment**: Compare two TSFMs with similar CRPS scores but different output types (quantiles vs. trajectories) on path-dependent tasks like VaR estimation to isolate impact of forecast form

2. **Copula conversion validation**: Implement vine copula and ECC methods from Section 4.3.3, apply to convert marginal quantiles to synthetic trajectories, and evaluate reconstructed trajectories on pathwise metrics

3. **Marginal vs. joint calibration**: Generate forecasts from trajectory ensemble model, compute CRPS and Energy Score, systematically degrade temporal dependence, and observe degradation pattern to confirm framework's core claim
