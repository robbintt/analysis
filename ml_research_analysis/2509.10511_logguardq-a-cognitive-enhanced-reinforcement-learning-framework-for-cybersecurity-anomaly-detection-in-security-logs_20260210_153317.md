# LogGuardQ: A Cognitive-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Framework for Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection in Security Logs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.10511
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10511
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Achieves 96.0% detection rate on simulated security logs with 47.9% anomalies using cognitive-enhanced RL framework

## Executive Summary
LogGuardQ introduces a cognitive-enhanced reinforcement learning framework for anomaly detection in security logs, addressing the challenge of detecting threats in high-volume log streams. The framework integrates a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition (short-term frequency tracking and long-term reward statistics) with adaptive exploration strategies driven by temperature decay and curiosity. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes, LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate, with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450. The mean reward is 20.34 ± 44.63 across all episodes, with statistical tests confirming significant performance advantages over DQN and PPO baselines.

## Method Summary
LogGuardQ frames security log analysis as a Markov Decision Process with 5D state vectors (IP frequency, status code, URI length, bytes sent, suspicious user agent flag) and 4 discrete actions (malicious, benign, investigate, ignore). The framework employs a dual-memory architecture: a deque-based short-term memory (size 100) tracking IP frequency for immediate pattern detection, and a list-based long-term memory (size 100) recording reward statistics for adaptive learning rate modulation. Temperature-decayed softmax action selection (1.0→0.6 over 20,000 episodes) combines with curiosity bonuses (1/√(visit_count+1)) to drive exploration. Q-learning updates use variance-modulated plasticity where learning rate η = 0.02 × (1 + 0.1 × σ²), with reward structure heavily penalizing false positives (-60) and false negatives (-5) to reduce alert fatigue.

## Key Results
- **Detection rate**: 96.0% on simulated dataset with 47.9% anomalies
- **Precision-recall trade-off**: Precision 0.4776, Recall 0.9996, F1-score 0.6450
- **Reward dynamics**: Mean reward 20.34 ± 44.63, variance stabilizes below 5 by later episodes
- **Statistical significance**: t-test p < 0.05 compared to DQN and PPO baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Memory Cognitive Architecture
Separating short-term frequency tracking from long-term reward statistics stabilizes learning in volatile log environments. A deque-based short-term memory (size 100) tracks IP frequency for immediate pattern detection (e.g., DDoS spikes), while a list-based long-term memory aggregates reward mean and variance over 100 entries. This mirrors human working and episodic memory, enabling both rapid response and historical trend analysis.

### Mechanism 2: Variance-Modulated Plasticity
Dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on reward variance accelerates adaptation during uncertainty and stabilizes convergence during consistency. Learning rate η = η_base × (1 + k × σ²), where σ² is reward variance. When variance is high (σ² ≈ 44.63), plasticity increases for faster adaptation; when low, learning stabilizes.

### Mechanism 3: Curiosity-Driven Exploration with Temperature Decay
Combining temperature-decayed softmax action selection with visit-count-based curiosity bonuses improves coverage of rare anomaly patterns. Temperature decays from 1.0 to 0.6 over 20,000 episodes, shifting from exploration to exploitation. Curiosity bonus C(s) = 1/√(visit_count + 1) adds intrinsic reward for novel states, countering sparse external rewards.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - Why needed here: LogGuardQ formulates log analysis as an MDP with 5D state space, 4 actions, deterministic transitions, and a custom reward function. Understanding state-action-reward structure is prerequisite to implementing the Q-learning core.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the paper uses a discount factor γ = 0.99 and how this affects the balance between immediate detection and long-term pattern learning?

- **Concept**: Temporal Difference (TD) Learning
  - Why needed here: The weight update rule uses TD error δ = (r + γ × max Q(s', a')) - Q(s, a). Understanding TD learning is essential for debugging convergence issues and implementing variance-modulated updates.
  - Quick check question: Given the reported mean reward of 20.34 ± 44.63, how would high variance affect TD target estimates and what role does the learning rate η = 0.02 play in damping this?

- **Concept**: Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff
  - Why needed here: LogGuardQ uses temperature-decayed softmax (not ε-greedy) plus curiosity bonuses. Understanding why traditional ε-greedy fails in sparse-reward cybersecurity settings explains the architectural choices.
  - Quick check question: With a 47.9% anomaly rate (higher than typical real-world <5%), why does the paper still characterize rewards as "sparse" and how does curiosity bonus address this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Log Stream → Feature Extraction (5D state vector) → Dual Memory (deque + array) → Q-Network (5×4 weights) → Softmax with Temperature → Action Selection → Environment → Reward (+ curiosity bonus + noise) → TD Error → Weight Update → Variance Monitor → Adaptive Learning Rate η

- Critical path: The state vector construction (IP frequency, status code, URI length, bytes, user agent flag) directly determines what patterns the agent can detect. If normalization is incorrect (e.g., URI length / 100 vs. / 1000), Q-values will be dominated by scale differences rather than meaningful features.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Precision vs. Recall: The asymmetric reward function (+10 TP, -60 FP, -5 FN, +2 TN) heavily penalizes false positives to reduce alert fatigue. This yields recall 0.9996 but precision only 0.4776. Adjusting FP penalty trades analyst workload for detection coverage.
  - Memory depth vs. responsiveness: Deque size 100 captures ~100 recent IPs; larger values smooth over transient spikes, smaller values increase noise sensitivity.
  - Temperature floor 0.6 vs. exploration: Maintaining minimum temperature prevents complete exploitation, preserving some adaptability to distribution shift.

- Failure signatures:
  - Action distribution collapses to single action (e.g., [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]) early in training → temperature decay too aggressive or reward function biased toward one class.
  - Reward variance never decreases below ~40 → variance-modulated plasticity may be amplifying noise; check if σ² is computed correctly over reward history.
  - Recall ≈ 1.0 but precision < 0.5 (as reported) → agent classifying most entries as malicious; FP penalty may be insufficient given 47.9% anomaly rate.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline validation: Replicate the 96.0% detection rate on the provided simulated dataset (1M logs, 47.9% anomalies). Confirm precision ≈ 0.48, recall ≈ 1.0. If metrics diverge >5%, check feature normalization and reward function implementation.
  2. Anomaly rate sensitivity: Reduce anomaly rate from 47.9% to 5% (realistic) and measure precision/recall. Hypothesis: precision will degrade further as FP penalty becomes relatively more costly; may require reward rebalancing.
  3. Ablation study: Disable dual-memory (use only immediate state), then disable curiosity bonus, then disable variance-modulated plasticity. Compare detection rates to isolate each mechanism's contribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does LogGuardQ perform on real-world security log streams with naturally occurring anomaly rates (typically <5%) compared to the 47.9% rate in the simulated dataset? The evaluation relied entirely on synthetic logs; no operational data from real Security Operations Centers was tested.

### Open Question 2
Can the high false positive rate (precision ~0.48) be reduced without sacrificing the near-perfect recall (0.9996)? The current reward function heavily penalizes false negatives (-5) but uses a severe false positive penalty (-60); the trade-off remains suboptimal.

### Open Question 3
Does integrating differential privacy or federated learning preserve LogGuardQ's detection efficacy while protecting PII in logs? Privacy mechanisms were proposed but not implemented or evaluated in the study.

### Open Question 4
How does PPO's exploration strategy need to be modified to achieve comparable detection performance to LogGuardQ in sparse-reward log environments? The cognitive enhancements were applied to a Q-learning variant; PPO remained a baseline without adaptation.

## Limitations

- **Simulated data bias**: Performance evaluated on synthetic logs with 47.9% anomaly rate, far exceeding real-world <5% rates, potentially inflating detection metrics
- **Baseline specification gaps**: DQN and PPO architectures, hyperparameters, and implementation details not provided, preventing independent validation of performance claims
- **Precision-recall tradeoff**: Asymmetric reward function yields excellent recall (0.9996) but poor precision (0.4776), indicating over-detection of anomalies in high-rate scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Dual-memory architecture implementation and basic RL training procedure are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Detection rate of 96.0% on simulated data is verifiable, but generalizability to real logs is uncertain
- **Low confidence**: Claims about cognitive-inspired mechanisms providing meaningful advantages over simpler approaches; baseline comparisons are insufficiently detailed for independent assessment

## Next Checks

1. Test LogGuardQ on publicly available cybersecurity datasets (e.g., CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15) with realistic <5% anomaly rates to assess real-world performance degradation
2. Conduct ablation study removing each cognitive component (dual-memory, curiosity bonus, variance-modulated plasticity) to quantify individual contributions versus integrated approach
3. Implement and compare against explicitly specified DQN baseline (network architecture, replay buffer, target network parameters) to verify claimed performance advantages
