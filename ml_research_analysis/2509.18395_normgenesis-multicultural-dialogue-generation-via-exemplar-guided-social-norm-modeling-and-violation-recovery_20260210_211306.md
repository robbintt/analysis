# NormGenesis: Multicultural Dialogue Generation via Exemplar-Guided Social Norm Modeling and Violation Recovery

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.18395
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18395
- **Reference count:** 37
- **Primary result:** Exemplar-based iterative refinement improves linguistic and sociocultural coherence in low-resource language dialogue generation.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces NormGenesis, a framework for generating culturally grounded dialogues in low-resource languages like Korean and Chinese. It addresses challenges of linguistic quality, sociocultural coherence, and pragmatic appropriateness by incorporating exemplar-based iterative refinement into the generation pipeline. The approach enhances norm adherence and emotional appropriateness through dynamic retrieval and application of semantically aligned exemplars. A novel Violation-to-Resolution (V2R) dialogue type models social norm repair strategies, enabling systems to generate socially sensitive interactions. Experiments show significant improvements over baselines in both human and LLM evaluations, with demonstrated generalization benefits across typologically diverse languages.

## Method Summary
The framework generates multicultural dialogues through a pipeline starting with norm taxonomy definition, followed by scenario-situation construction using GPT-4.1, iterative exemplar-based refinement via a Refinement Quality (RQ) protocol, and turn-level dialogue generation with annotations. Refinement retrieves semantically aligned exemplars early in the pipeline to guide iterative revision of scenarios until quality thresholds are met. Each utterance receives fine-grained annotations for norm adherence, speaker reaction, and justification. The method includes a novel V2R dialogue type modeling norm violation recovery trajectories. The approach was validated on Korean and Chinese with pilot studies in Malay and Urdu.

## Key Results
- Iterative exemplar-based refinement improved Korean linguistic quality from 3.589 to 4.910 and Chinese from 3.603 to 4.926 on 5-point scales.
- V2R-trained models were preferred in 82% of PROSOCIALDIALOG evaluations versus baseline models.
- Cross-linguistic sequence patterns differ: English follows X→A→C, Korean follows E→A→X in multi-step recovery.
- >85% of V2R dialogues use multi-step recovery strategies across languages.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Early-stage exemplar-based refinement improves cultural and pragmatic alignment in low-resource language dialogue generation. The framework retrieves semantically aligned exemplars (based on intent, emotional tone, discourse patterns) before dialogue generation begins. These exemplars guide iterative revision of scenario–situation pairs via an RQ protocol that evaluates norm alignment, linguistic quality, and semantic fidelity. Refinement continues until quality scores exceed a threshold (avg. 1.2 rounds). Core assumption: High-quality exemplars encode cultural constraints that can transfer to novel scenarios via in-context learning. Evidence: Korean linguistic quality improved from 3.589 to 4.910; Chinese from 3.603 to 4.926 (5-point scale). Break condition: If exemplars lack cultural coverage or retrieval fails to match novel scenario structure, refinement may not converge.

### Mechanism 2
Modeling Violation-to-Resolution (V2R) as a distinct dialogue type improves pragmatic competence in socially sensitive contexts. V2R dialogues explicitly model the trajectory from norm violation → recognition → repair using strategies such as apology, explanation, empathy, and compensation. The framework annotates turn-level speaker reactions and norm adherence, enabling models to learn multi-step recovery patterns rather than binary violation detection. Core assumption: Social repair is learnable as a structured sequence of communicative acts, not just implicit in dialogue context. Evidence: V2R-trained model preferred in 82% of PROSOCIALDIALOG evaluations vs. baseline; >85% of V2R dialogues use multi-step recovery. Break condition: If downstream models overfit to specific repair patterns without generalizing to novel violation types, V2R benefits will be context-bound.

### Mechanism 3
Turn-level annotation of norm adherence, intent, and emotional response enables fine-grained modeling of social dynamics. Each utterance is labeled with (a) norm adherence status, (b) speaker reaction (e.g., APO, EMP, JUS), and (c) justification. This structure supports supervised learning of social behavior at the utterance level rather than dialogue-level classification only. Core assumption: Fine-grained annotations capture meaningful variation in pragmatic behavior across cultures and contexts. Evidence: 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated at the turn level; high correlation between LLM and human evaluations (r=0.928 Korean, r=0.945 Chinese). Break condition: Annotation subjectivity and cultural bias may affect cross-context reliability; inter-annotator agreement varies across norm categories.

## Foundational Learning

- **Social Norms vs. Pragmatic Competence:** The framework distinguishes norm adherence (sociocultural expectation) from pragmatic coherence (context-appropriate communication). Understanding this distinction is essential to interpret V2R modeling. Quick check: Can you explain why a grammatically correct apology might still violate a cultural norm in Korean hierarchical contexts?

- **Exemplar-Based In-Context Learning:** The refinement mechanism relies on retrieving structurally similar examples to guide generation, not fine-tuning on large corpora. Quick check: What retrieval features (intent, tone, discourse patterns) would you prioritize for matching exemplars to a new scenario?

- **Dialogue Act Theory:** Turn-level annotations are grounded in dialogue act taxonomies (e.g., SWBD-DAMSL). Familiarity with labels like ACK, APO, EMP is required to interpret the dataset schema. Quick check: How would you label a turn that expresses regret while also justifying an action—APO, JUS, or both?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Norm definition → scenario generation → exemplar retrieval → refinement loop → dialogue generation → annotation → evaluation

- **Critical path:** The pipeline begins with defining 12 social norm categories extended from Li et al. (2023), generates scenario-situation pairs, applies iterative exemplar-based refinement guided by RQ protocol, generates dialogues, and annotates at the turn level for norm adherence, intent, and emotional response.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Manual exemplar curation ensures quality but limits scalability; early refinement prevents downstream errors but adds pipeline complexity; V2R provides richer social modeling but requires careful annotation to avoid overfitting to specific repair patterns.

- **Failure signatures:** Lexical redundancy and tone mismatch in low-resource outputs before refinement; honorific inconsistency, register mixing, exaggerated emotional repetition in Chinese/Korean; RQ scores failing to converge if exemplars are poorly matched.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate Table 4 refinement quality evaluation on a held-out set of Korean/Chinese scenario pairs to validate RQ protocol sensitivity.
  2. Ablate V2R data during fine-tuning to measure its marginal contribution to PROSOCIALDIALOG performance.
  3. Test exemplar retrieval on a new language (e.g., Malay/Urdu pilot) to assess generalization beyond East Asian typologies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can the exemplar-based refinement process be automated to scale efficiently to new domains or norms without relying on resource-intensive manual curation? The authors note that scaling to a large number of new norms is currently resource-intensive and suggest exploring "active learning for efficient exemplar selection" or "clustering of culturally aligned regions." This remains unresolved because the current framework relies on a "small number of manually revised exemplars," which acts as a bottleneck. Evidence would include demonstration of an active learning pipeline that reduces the need for manual exemplar creation by X% while maintaining refinement quality scores (RQ).

- **Open Question 2:** Does the NormGenesis framework generalize effectively to typologically diverse languages with divergent pragmatic systems, such as Arabic, Hindi, or Swahili? The Limitations section states that while pilot studies in Malay and Urdu were successful, "Expanding NormGenesis to additional languages—particularly those with... distinct social conventions (e.g., Arabic, Hindi, Swahili)—remains a key avenue for future work." This remains unresolved because the main experiments focused on East Asian languages (Korean, Chinese) and English, leaving non-East Asian typologies under-tested. Evidence would include successful application of the framework to Arabic or Swahili resulting in statistically significant improvements in pragmatic consistency over baselines.

- **Open Question 3:** How can dialogue systems systematically track and adapt to the temporal evolution of social norms? The authors identify "Norm Evolution" as a limitation, noting that "Social norms are dynamic and shift across time, communities, and platforms." This remains unresolved because the current taxonomy provides a "time-bounded snapshot," and the framework currently lacks mechanisms to detect or update norms as societal standards change. Evidence would include a longitudinal study using temporal corpora showing the framework's ability to identify and integrate shifting normative behaviors over time.

## Limitations

- Manual exemplar curation is resource-intensive and limits scalability to new norms or languages.
- The framework's effectiveness in typologically distant languages (e.g., Arabic, Hindi, Swahili) remains under-tested.
- No reported inter-annotator agreement metrics for turn-level norm annotations, introducing potential bias.

## Confidence

- **High:** The core mechanism of exemplar-based iterative refinement and its positive impact on dialogue quality (Sections 3.3, 5.1).
- **Medium:** The effectiveness of the V2R dialogue type and its generalization benefits (Section 5.4, 6).
- **Low:** Cross-linguistic generalization beyond East Asian languages and the scalability of manual exemplar curation (Appendix F.2, Limitations section).

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the RQ protocol evaluation on a held-out set of Korean/Chinese scenario pairs to validate its sensitivity and consistency.
2. Ablate V2R data during fine-tuning to measure its marginal contribution to downstream performance on PROSOCIALDIALOG.
3. Pilot the exemplar retrieval and refinement mechanism on a new language (e.g., Malay or Urdu) to assess generalization beyond typologically similar languages.
