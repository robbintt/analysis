# AudioJailbreak: Jailbreak Attacks against End-to-End Large Audio-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.14103
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14103
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves up to 100% attack success rate against 10 LALMs in weak adversary scenarios using adversarial audio perturbations.

## Executive Summary
AudioJailbreak introduces a novel attack framework targeting end-to-end large audio-language models (LALMs) by generating adversarial suffixal audio perturbations. Unlike prior work, it operates in both strong (full control of prompts) and weak (unknown user prompts) adversary settings, achieving universality through multi-prompt optimization. The method ensures stealthiness via benign audio, sound effects, music, or speeding-up, and maintains over-the-air robustness through reverberation modeling. Evaluated on 10 LALMs, it achieves up to 100% attack success rate in weak adversary scenarios, remains effective when played over the air, and successfully transfers to GPT-4o-Audio.

## Method Summary
AudioJailbreak generates adversarial audio perturbations by appending a carefully crafted suffix to benign audio inputs. The attack is designed to bypass safety guardrails in end-to-end LALMs, working effectively in both strong and weak adversary settings. The method employs multi-prompt optimization to achieve universality across diverse prompts, ensuring stealthiness through benign audio transformations and over-the-air robustness via reverberation modeling. The perturbations are optimized to maximize attack success while maintaining perceptual similarity to the original audio.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 100% attack success rate in weak adversary scenarios across 10 LALMs.
- Maintains effectiveness when audio is played over the air, demonstrating robustness to real-world conditions.
- Successfully transfers to GPT-4o-Audio, indicating potential generalizability to other models.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AudioJailbreak exploits vulnerabilities in end-to-end LALMs by generating adversarial audio perturbations that manipulate the model's output. The method leverages suffixal perturbations, which are appended to benign audio inputs, to bypass safety guardrails. By optimizing these perturbations across multiple prompts, the attack achieves universality, ensuring effectiveness regardless of the specific user input. The use of benign audio transformations (e.g., sound effects, music, speeding-up) enhances stealthiness, while reverberation modeling ensures robustness to over-the-air playback. The success of the attack is attributed to the careful balance between adversarial strength and perceptual similarity, allowing the perturbations to remain undetected while effectively manipulating the model's behavior.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on 10 LALMs, lacking diversity in adversarial scenarios and real-world deployment contexts.
- Does not address potential defenses against AudioJailbreak or scalability across different audio processing pipelines.
- Specific acoustic environments tested for over-the-air robustness are not detailed, raising questions about performance in varied real-world conditions.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Effectiveness of adversarial suffixal audio perturbations against LALMs under controlled conditions.
- **Medium confidence:** Universality of the attack across diverse prompts and applications.
- **Medium confidence:** Stealthiness and over-the-air robustness of the perturbations.
- **Low confidence:** Scalability and generalizability to all real-world deployment scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Test AudioJailbreak across a wider range of acoustic environments and noise conditions to validate over-the-air robustness claims.
2. Evaluate the attack's effectiveness against a broader set of LALMs and audio processing pipelines to assess generalizability.
3. Investigate potential defensive mechanisms and their efficacy in mitigating AudioJailbreak attacks.
