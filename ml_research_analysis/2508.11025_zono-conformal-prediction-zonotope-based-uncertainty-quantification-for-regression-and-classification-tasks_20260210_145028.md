# Zono-Conformal Prediction: Zonotope-Based Uncertainty Quantification for Regression and Classification Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11025
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11025
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: ZCP achieves smaller prediction sets than interval predictor models and standard conformal methods while maintaining similar coverage rates

## Executive Summary
Zono-conformal prediction (ZCP) is a novel uncertainty quantification framework that augments nonlinear predictors with zonotopic prediction sets while guaranteeing statistical coverage. Unlike traditional conformal prediction, which requires separate calibration and training data, ZCP integrates uncertainty modeling and calibration into a single linear program. By using zonotopes instead of axis-aligned intervals, ZCP captures output dependencies and produces less conservative predictions, particularly for multi-output tasks. Experiments demonstrate that ZCP consistently achieves smaller prediction sets than both interval predictor models and standard conformal methods while maintaining similar coverage rates across regression and classification tasks.

## Method Summary
ZCP constructs zonotopic prediction sets for uncertainty quantification by injecting uncertainty parameters into a pre-trained neural network's biases and weights. The method computes the Jacobian of the augmented predictor with respect to these uncertainties, then solves a linear program to find minimal scaling factors that guarantee coverage for all calibration samples. The key innovation is the unified optimization that avoids the two-stage data split required by traditional conformal prediction. Zonotopes, being centrally symmetric polytopes defined by generator vectors, capture correlations between output dimensions, producing tighter prediction sets than axis-aligned intervals. The framework is demonstrated on 14 benchmark datasets including synthetic regression tasks, energy forecasting, and image classification.

## Key Results
- ZCP consistently achieves ≥95% empirical coverage across all tested datasets
- Prediction sets are 20-50% smaller than those produced by standard conformal prediction and interval predictor models
- For multi-output regression tasks, ZCP captures output correlations, producing significantly less conservative sets than interval-based methods
- The method maintains efficiency with linear program complexity, scaling well to moderate output dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dependency-Aware Set Representation
Zonotopes produce smaller, less conservative prediction sets than axis-aligned intervals by capturing correlations between multiple output dimensions. Unlike intervals which are rigid hyper-rectangles, zonotopes are centrally symmetric polytopes that can rotate and stretch to tightly enclose correlated data clouds. The optimization of generator vectors allows the set to minimize volume while maintaining coverage. If the generator matrix is constrained to be diagonal, the mechanism fails and reverts to interval-like performance.

### Mechanism 2: Unified Calibration via Linear Programming
Integrating uncertainty modeling and calibration into a single linear program improves data efficiency compared to two-stage conformal prediction. Standard split-conformal prediction requires separate identification and calibration datasets, but ZCP injects uncertainty parameters directly into the base predictor and optimizes their bounds via LP using only the calibration data. The LP satisfies containment constraints for all samples simultaneously. If the number of outliers is underestimated, the LP becomes infeasible.

### Mechanism 3: Linearization of Nonlinear Uncertainty
First-order Taylor expansion allows non-linear predictors to utilize linear set-theoretic propagation. Instead of propagating sets through non-linear activations directly (computationally hard), the method linearizes the augmented predictor around the nominal uncertainty. This transforms the output set into a linear function of the input zonotope, making optimization tractable. If uncertainties are large or the base predictor is highly non-linear, linearization errors may cause the true output to fall outside the predicted zonotope.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Zonotopes & Set Propagation**
  - Why needed: You must understand how a generator matrix defines a polytope and how linear transformations modify it to interpret prediction sets
  - Quick check: If you apply a rotation matrix R to zonotope Z = ⟨c, G⟩, does the volume change?

- **Concept: Conformal Prediction (Split CP)**
  - Why needed: ZCP modifies the standard CP pipeline; knowing the baseline (quantile calibration on residuals) highlights why ZCP's "single LP" approach is distinct
  - Quick check: Why does standard CP require a separate calibration set distinct from the training set?

- **Concept: Automatic Differentiation**
  - Why needed: You need to compute the Jacobian to linearize the network and build LP constraints
  - Quick check: How do you extract the gradient of the output with respect to an intermediate layer's bias (the uncertainty)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Base Predictor -> Augmenter -> Jacobian Computer -> LP Solver -> Prediction Set Generator
- **Critical path:** The construction of the constraint matrix in Theorem 6 (Eq 14). Specifically, mapping each data point to a constraint involving |R_i D̄(x) G_u| α.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Uncertainty Count (n_u): More uncertainties → tighter sets but looser theoretical coverage guarantees
  - Cost Function: Using "Rotated Intervals" reduces conservatism but increases LP complexity compared to simple "Interval" norms
- **Failure signatures:**
  - LP Infeasibility: Calibration set contains contradictory points or too many outliers
  - Excessive Volume: Predictor yields massive zonotopes; uncertainties are uncorrelated with output error
  - Coverage Drop: Test coverage fails; likely due to linearization error or overfitting calibration data
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run on SD-R2 dataset; visualize 2D zonotope projection vs. rectangular interval baseline
  2. Vary number of sampled parametric uncertainties to plot Pareto frontier of Set Size vs. Empirical Coverage
  3. Compare ZCP performance on tanh network vs. ReLU network to observe Taylor approximation impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can base predictors be trained to inherently promote small uncertainty sets at specific locations, eliminating the need for post-hoc uncertainty placement? The current method relies on heuristic placement strategy (randomly sampling from candidate uncertainties), which risks suboptimal conservatism or overfitting. A training algorithm that produces a base predictor with a Jacobian structure naturally yielding minimal-volume zonotopes would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How can the framework be extended to capture multi-modal output uncertainty that a single zonotope cannot represent? Zonotopes are convex and centrally symmetric, making them fundamentally unable to enclose disjoint probability masses or complex non-convex shapes often found in multi-modal distributions. A theoretical extension using unions of zonotopes or hybrid set representations, validated on datasets known to possess multi-modal output distributions, would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
Can the theoretical coverage guarantees be tightened to better align with the high empirical coverage observed in experiments? The current guarantees rely on general results from the scenario approach, which penalize the high dimensionality of the optimization variables, despite empirical data showing strong coverage. A refined statistical derivation that exploits the specific structure of zonotopes to provide tighter lower bounds on coverage probability would resolve this.

### Open Question 4
Does the zono-conformal prediction framework maintain its efficiency and accuracy when applied to non-feed-forward architectures like Transformers? The method relies on first-order Taylor approximations; it is unclear if uncertainty propagation remains stable or efficient when applied to attention mechanisms or recurrent states. Experimental results applying ZCPs to sequence modeling or attention-based tasks would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes the base predictor is fixed and only optimizes uncertainty bounds, not model parameters
- Linearization via Taylor expansion may fail for highly non-linear predictors or large uncertainty magnitudes, potentially violating coverage guarantees
- Method performance critically depends on proper placement of uncertainties - if uncertainties are uncorrelated with prediction errors, zonotopic sets remain conservative

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core theoretical framework (Theorem 6,7) and unified LP formulation for combining calibration and uncertainty modeling. Empirical coverage results showing ZCP maintains ≥95% coverage.
- **Medium Confidence:** Practical advantages in set size reduction over baselines, particularly for multi-output regression. Claim about linearization validity requires more extensive validation across diverse network architectures.
- **Low Confidence:** Exact sensitivity of results to uncertainty placement strategy (random 10% selection) and scalability to very high-dimensional outputs without significant conservatism.

## Next Checks
1. **Linearization Error Analysis:** Systematically vary uncertainty magnitudes and compute actual vs. predicted output coverage to quantify Taylor approximation errors across different activation functions (tanh vs. ReLU vs. Swish).
2. **Uncertainty Placement Sensitivity:** Compare performance when uncertainties are placed in (a) randomly selected parameters, (b) parameters with highest gradient magnitudes during calibration, and (c) all parameters, measuring the trade-off between coverage and set size.
3. **Multi-Output Scaling Test:** Evaluate ZCP on synthetic datasets with increasing output dimensions (2→50) while maintaining constant input dimension, measuring how quickly zonotope volume growth compares to axis-aligned intervals.
