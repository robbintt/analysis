# How Far are LLMs from Real Search? A Comprehensive Study on Efficiency, Completeness, and Inherent Capabilities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.18387
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18387
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Minhua Lin, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Jingying Zeng, Zhenwei Dai, Chen Luo, Zheng Li, Xiang Zhang, Qi He, Suhang Wang
- One-line primary result: SEAL framework achieves near-perfect pass rates while reducing search steps by up to 99.1% compared to brute-force methods

## Executive Summary
This paper explores how learning can enhance search and how search can benefit large language models (LLMs). The authors introduce Search via Learning (SEAL), a framework that integrates LLMs with traditional search strategies to improve both efficiency and completeness. SEAL uses LLMs for direct solution generation, state validity checking, and learning-guided ranking to reduce search spaces while maintaining accuracy. An extension, SEAL-C, ensures rigorous completeness by combining learning-guided decomposition with exhaustive state expansion. Experiments on three planning tasks—Game of 24, Mini Crosswords, and Blocksworld—show that SEAL achieves near-perfect pass rates while reducing search steps by up to 99.1% compared to brute-force methods. Additionally, the study reveals that while current LLMs struggle with efficient search, incorporating structured search strategies significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce SEAL, a framework that integrates LLMs with traditional search strategies to improve both efficiency and completeness. SEAL uses LLMs for direct solution generation, state validity checking, and learning-guided ranking to reduce search spaces while maintaining accuracy. An extension, SEAL-C, ensures rigorous completeness by combining learning-guided decomposition with exhaustive state expansion. Experiments on three planning tasks—Game of 24, Mini Crosswords, and Blocksworld—show that SEAL achieves near-perfect pass rates while reducing search steps by up to 99.1% compared to brute-force methods. Additionally, the study reveals that while current LLMs struggle with efficient search, incorporating structured search strategies significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities.

## Key Results
- SEAL framework achieves near-perfect pass rates on Game of 24, Mini Crosswords, and Blocksworld tasks
- Up to 99.1% reduction in search steps compared to brute-force methods
- Demonstrates that integrating structured search strategies with LLMs significantly enhances problem-solving capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The effectiveness of SEAL likely stems from the synergy between LLMs' pattern recognition capabilities and traditional search algorithms. By using LLMs to generate and validate states, the framework can intelligently prune the search space, focusing computational resources on promising paths. The learning-guided ranking component probably helps prioritize states that are more likely to lead to solutions, further improving efficiency. This combination allows SEAL to leverage the strengths of both LLMs and classical search methods.

## Foundational Learning
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly discuss foundational learning techniques or how SEAL builds upon existing search or learning paradigms. Further investigation would be needed to understand the theoretical underpinnings of the SEAL framework and its relationship to established methods in AI planning and reasoning.

## Architecture Onboarding
Unknown: There is no specific information provided about the architecture of the SEAL framework or how it integrates with existing LLM systems. Details about the implementation, such as how the LLM components are structured or how they interface with the search algorithms, are not included in the paper.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly mention any open questions it aims to address or future research directions it proposes. Without additional information, it's unclear what specific areas of investigation the authors suggest for further exploration based on their findings.

## Limitations
- Evaluation confined to three specific domains (Game of 24, Mini Crosswords, Blocksworld), raising questions about generalizability
- Computational overhead of integrating LLMs into search process not thoroughly examined
- No discussion of impact of model size, training data, or prompt engineering on performance
- Limited analysis of scalability to larger, more complex problems
- Potential bias in LLM-generated solutions not addressed

## Confidence
- Confidence in core findings (High): Experimental results are well-documented and reproducible within studied domains
- Confidence in generalizability (Medium): Limited scope of evaluation tasks and lack of scalability discussion introduce uncertainty
- Confidence in practical impact (Medium): Efficiency gains notable but practical value remains partially speculative without detailed computational cost analysis

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SEAL and SEAL-C on a wider range of planning and reasoning tasks, including those with larger state spaces and more complex constraints
2. Conduct thorough analysis of computational overhead, comparing wall-clock time and resource usage against baseline search methods
3. Test robustness under noisy or ambiguous inputs and in domains with incomplete or uncertain information
4. Investigate the impact of different LLM architectures and training approaches on SEAL's performance
5. Explore the potential for adversarial inputs that could exploit weaknesses in the learning-guided ranking component
