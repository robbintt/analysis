# Degree-Optimized Cumulative Polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.15228
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15228
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces CP-KAN, reformulating degree selection as QUBO to reduce complexity from O(D^N) to single optimization per layer, demonstrating competitive regression performance with parameter efficiency.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CP-KAN, a neural architecture combining Chebyshev polynomial basis functions with quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) to address the degree selection problem in Kolmogorov-Arnold networks. The primary contribution is reformulating degree selection as a QUBO task, reducing complexity from O(D^N) to a single optimization step per layer using simulated annealing. This enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture demonstrates competitive performance in regression tasks, particularly with limited data, showing robustness to input scales and natural regularization properties.

## Method Summary
CP-KAN reformulates the degree selection problem in Kolmogorov-Arnold networks as a QUBO task, replacing exhaustive O(D^N) search with a single optimization step per layer. The architecture uses Chebyshev polynomials as the basis function and employs simulated annealing to solve the QUBO formulation. The method operates in two phases: first selecting optimal degrees for each neuron through QUBO optimization, then training the network weights using gradient descent. This two-phase separation of structure and parameter optimization provides stability in low-data regimes and prevents overfitting.

## Key Results
- Achieves R2 score of 0.0376 on financial time series prediction using only 1,571-2,547 parameters versus 17,185-506,701 for traditional deep learning models
- Demonstrates strong performance on house price prediction and image classification tasks
- Shows parameter efficiency and stability advantages over MLPs and other KAN variants
- Exhibits robustness to input scales and natural regularization properties beneficial for regression tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Discrete Degree Selection via QUBO
The architecture automates polynomial degree selection for each neuron, preventing combinatorial explosion through QUBO reformulation. A binary matrix represents degree choices where each variable $q_{(i,d)}$ indicates "neuron $i$ uses degree $d$." The optimization minimizes MSE weighted by a one-hot penalty enforcing exactly one degree per neuron. This layer-wise independent optimization reduces complexity from O(D^N) to a single step per layer. Break condition: layer-wise optimization may converge to sub-optimal architectures if optimal degrees depend heavily on neighboring layers.

### Mechanism 2: Chebyshev Basis Regularization
Chebyshev polynomials provide natural regularization and stability through their bounded, orthogonal nature on [-1, 1]. Unlike monomials, they prevent coefficient explosion and ensure higher-degree terms contribute diminishing refinement rather than noise. This implicit regularization is particularly effective for regression tasks with limited data assuming target functions possess smoothness allowing efficient spectral approximation. Break condition: smooth polynomial basis may underfit tasks requiring sharp, discontinuous decision boundaries.

### Mechanism 3: Two-Phase Separation of Structure and Weights
Decoupling structure optimization (degrees) from parameter optimization (weights) stabilizes training in low-data regimes. Phase 1 uses QUBO/Simulated Annealing to determine capacity per neuron, while Phase 2 employs gradient descent for weight tuning. This prevents simultaneous learning of function shape and model capacity. Break condition: if Phase 1 degree selection uses noisy or unrepresentative data, the locked structure becomes suboptimal before Phase 2 begins.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - Why needed here: Justifies KAN architecture by placing learnable activation functions on edges rather than nodes
  - Quick check question: In a standard MLP, where do fixed non-linearities sit, and where does CP-KAN place its learnable Chebyshev polynomials?

- **Concept: QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)**
  - Why needed here: Core algorithmic contribution for degree selection mechanism
  - Quick check question: How does one enforce "pick exactly one degree" constraint in QUBO without explicit inequality constraints?

- **Concept: Chebyshev Polynomials (First Kind)**
  - Why needed here: Paper relies on specific numerical properties (orthogonality, recursive definition)
  - Quick check question: Why are Chebyshev polynomials preferred over Taylor series for numerical function approximation regarding numerical stability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input -> Projection (Linear layer w,b) -> Basis Function (Chebyshev polynomials T_0 to T_d) -> Optimizer (QUBO/Simulated Annealing selects d) -> Combiner (Linear combination of polynomial outputs)

- **Critical path:** Construction of QUBO matrix requires computing MSE for every neuron at every possible degree (0 to D_max) to populate cost matrix before solver runs

- **Design tradeoffs:** Threshold T limits variables (N × (D+1)); exceeds triggers fixed degree fallback (Algorithm 1, line 3); simulated annealing used classically but formulation is quantum-ready

- **Failure signatures:** Negative R2 in standard Chebyshev KANs when degree selection fails; memory overflow during Phase 1 if N_neurons × D_max too large; smoothness bias causing poor classification performance on sharp boundary tasks

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check: Fit smooth 1D function (e.g., sin(x)) using CP-KAN vs MLP; verify QUBO selects low degrees for linear regions and higher degrees for curved regions
  2. Scaling Stress Test: Profile Phase 1 QUBO time; increase layer width N until "skip QUBO" threshold T triggers to verify fallback logic
  3. Ablation: Compare "QUBO" vs "Greedy Heuristic" (Appendix B.3) on Jane Street subset; check if global QUBO search outperforms faster greedy local search

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can adaptive degree selection during training improve performance compared to static selection? The authors note that while current approach selects degrees once, adaptive systems could evolve degrees during training, leading to architectures adjusting complexity to local feature importance. This remains unexplored as the current implementation fixes degrees before gradient descent. Empirical validation would require re-triggering QUBO optimization at specific epochs.

### Open Question 2
How can CP-KAN be effectively hybridized with decision trees to handle sharp decision boundaries? The paper suggests hybrid models combining CP-KAN's regression capabilities with tree-based mechanisms to address classification limitations observed in Forest Covertype experiments. This proposed hybrid architecture remains unimplemented. Evidence would require designing a hybrid layer or ensemble method and benchmarking against standard CP-KAN and tree-based models.

### Open Question 3
Does quantum annealing provide practical advantage over simulated annealing for CP-KAN QUBO formulation? The authors note quantum annealing could offer a framework for optimizing network parameters, positioning the architecture for future quantum-based optimizations. All experiments use simulated annealing on classical hardware. Evidence would require comparative study running degree selection QUBO on both quantum annealing hardware and classical solvers, measuring solution quality and Time-to-Solution.

## Limitations
- QUBO formulation assumes layer-wise optimization suffices, potentially missing global optima when layer interactions are strong
- Fixed degree fallback when variable count exceeds threshold T could introduce performance gaps
- Layer-wise optimization may not capture inter-layer dependencies in complex architectures

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Polynomial basis regularization benefits and numerical stability properties
- **Medium Confidence:** QUBO formulation effectiveness and degree selection optimization
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization to classification tasks and scalability beyond moderate layer widths

## Next Checks
1. **Layer Coupling Analysis:** Systematically evaluate how layer-wise independent QUBO optimization performs versus global optimization on synthetic functions with known optimal degree distributions.

2. **Scalability Benchmark:** Profile CP-KAN performance on progressively larger networks (increasing N and D) to determine exact thresholds where QUBO becomes computationally prohibitive and evaluate the impact of the fixed-degree fallback.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization:** Test CP-KAN on classification tasks requiring sharp decision boundaries (e.g., CIFAR-10) to quantify the smoothness bias limitation and compare against piecewise linear activation functions.
