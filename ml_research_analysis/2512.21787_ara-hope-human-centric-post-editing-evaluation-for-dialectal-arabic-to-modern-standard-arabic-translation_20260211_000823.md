# Ara-HOPE: Human-Centric Post-Editing Evaluation for Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.21787
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21787
- Reference count: 22
- Ara-HOPE is a human-centric evaluation framework designed to assess Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic (DA-MSA) translation quality using a five-category error taxonomy and decision-tree annotation protocol.

## Executive Summary
Ara-HOPE addresses the challenge of evaluating Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic translation quality, where existing automatic metrics fail to capture dialect-specific translation errors. The framework introduces a structured error taxonomy (fluency, meaning transfer with three subcategories, and adaptation) combined with a decision-tree annotation protocol that guides annotators through hierarchical error identification. Evaluated on 200 Arabic tweets across three MT systems, Ara-HOPE demonstrated inter-annotator agreement scores of 0.5-0.63 and revealed that dialect-specific terminology and semantic preservation are the most persistent challenges in DA-MSA translation.

## Method Summary
Ara-HOPE is a human-centric post-editing evaluation framework for DA-MSA translation quality. It employs a five-category error taxonomy (Fluency, Proper Name, Dialect-Specific Term, General Semantic Mistranslation, and Adaptation) with a decision-tree annotation protocol. The framework was evaluated on 200 tweets from the Levantine development set of Dial2MSA-Verified dataset, with translations generated by three MT systems (Jais, GPT-3.5, and NLLB-200) under zero-shot prompting. Two native Syrian Levantine Arabic speakers with Arabic Language undergraduate degrees served as annotators, trained via a 25-minute video and supplementary materials. Errors are scored on a 0-2 severity scale, with adaptation errors weighted at 50% in the total error calculation.

## Key Results
- Inter-annotator agreement scores ranged from 0.5 to 0.63 across error types, with adaptation errors showing particularly low agreement (0.12-0.28)
- Jais and GPT-3.5 outperformed NLLB-200, with Jais achieving the lowest average segment error score (0.84)
- Dialect-specific terminology (TRM) and general semantic mistranslation (GSMIS) errors constituted the majority of total errors across all systems
- The framework successfully identified dialect-specific translation challenges that automatic metrics typically miss

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The decision-tree annotation protocol reduces cognitive load and improves consistency for minimally trained annotators. The hierarchical yes/no questions guide annotators through error categories sequentially, forcing systematic traversal: fluency → meaning transfer (PRN, TRM, GSMIS) → adaptation. This structure eliminates the need to simultaneously consider all error types. The core assumption is that annotators can reliably make binary judgments about error presence but struggle with multi-way categorization without guidance. Evidence shows annotators received only 25 minutes of training yet achieved IAA scores of 0.5-0.63. The mechanism breaks if adaptation errors are assessed without first clearing meaning transfer errors.

### Mechanism 2
The five-category error taxonomy captures dialect-specific translation failures that automatic metrics miss. By separating meaning transfer errors into three distinct subtypes, with TRM specifically targeting untranslated or mistranslated dialectal expressions, the framework exposes the lexical-semantic transfer problem that BLEU-style metrics cannot detect due to their reliance on surface-form overlap. The core assumption is that dialect-specific terminology errors are fundamentally different from general semantic errors and require specialized identification. Evidence shows TRM and GSMIS errors constitute the majority of total errors, indicating the taxonomy's diagnostic value for system improvement.

### Mechanism 3
Weighted adaptation scoring prevents over-penalizing systems that preserve meaning but struggle with tone/register. Adaptation errors are only assessed when no meaning transfer errors are present, and are weighted at 50% in the segment total error score calculation. This reflects the pragmatic reality that stylistic appropriateness matters only when semantic content is intact. The core assumption is that meaning preservation is a prerequisite for evaluating stylistic appropriateness. Evidence shows low adaptation error rates across all systems are largely due to this error type being assessed only when meaning transfer errors are absent.

## Foundational Learning

- **Arabic Diglossia (DA vs. MSA)**: Why needed here: The framework is built on the premise that DA and MSA differ systematically in orthography, morphology, lexicon, syntax, and code-switching patterns. Without understanding these differences, annotators cannot identify what constitutes a translation error versus a legitimate dialectal feature. Quick check question: Can you explain why a word spelled differently in Levantine social media text might still be semantically correct, and how this affects error annotation?

- **Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) via Quadratic Weighted Kappa**: Why needed here: The framework's reliability depends on demonstrating that minimally trained annotators can apply the error taxonomy consistently. Understanding QWK is essential for interpreting whether the 0.5-0.63 scores represent acceptable reproducibility. Quick check question: Why would quadratic weighted kappa be more appropriate than simple percent agreement for a 0-2 severity scale?

- **Post-Editing Evaluation Methodology**: Why needed here: Ara-HOPE builds on the HOPE framework, which itself simplifies MQM. Understanding the post-editing paradigm—where human annotators identify and categorize errors in machine output—is prerequisite to implementing the decision-tree workflow. Quick check question: How does post-editing evaluation differ from both automatic metrics (BLEU, COMET) and direct assessment (Likert-scale fluency/adequacy ratings)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Error Taxonomy (FLU → PRN/TRM/GSMIS → ADP) → Decision Tree → Scoring System (0-2 severity, ADP × 0.5) → Annotation Interface (Excel-based)
- **Critical path**: 1) Present DA source + MSA gold reference + MT output to annotator 2) Annotator reads all three to establish intended meaning 3) Traverse decision tree: check FLU first, then meaning transfer subcategories in sequence, then ADP only if no meaning transfer errors 4) Assign severity (0, 1, or 2) for each identified error 5) Calculate SEGS = Σ(error scores), with ADP × 0.5
- **Design tradeoffs**: Taxonomy size vs. usability (5 categories balance granularity with manageability), annotator expertise vs. scalability (requiring native DA speakers limits pool), conditional ADP scoring vs. comparability (prevents over-penalization but complicates cross-system comparison)
- **Failure signatures**: Low IAA on Adaptation (0.12-0.28) signals inherent subjectivity in tone/style assessment, high PRN errors for Jais suggests over-normalization of transliterated names, high TRM/GSMIS errors for NLLB-200 indicates encoder-decoder architecture struggles with idiomatic expressions
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Validate framework on different Arabic dialect (Maghrebi or Gulf) using Dial2MSA-Verified's multi-dialect coverage 2) Compare Ara-HOPE annotations against COMET/BLEU scores on same 200-tweet corpus 3) Run ablation study removing decision tree to measure impact on annotation time and IAA scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **LLM-as-a-judge approaches**: Can LLM-based annotation reliably automate or partially automate the Ara-HOPE annotation process while maintaining evaluation quality? The current framework relies entirely on human annotators, which is time-consuming (approximately 12 hours per annotator for 200 examples). Comparative study showing LLM-based annotation achieves comparable IAA and error detection accuracy would resolve this.

- **Alternative prompting strategies**: How do few-shot or chain-of-thought prompting strategies affect DA-MSA translation quality and error distribution patterns? Only zero-shot prompting was evaluated; different prompting approaches may change relative system performance. Human evaluation using Ara-HOPE on translations generated with these prompting strategies would provide evidence.

- **Adaptation error refinement**: How can the Adaptation error category be refined to improve inter-annotator agreement from observed low scores (0.122-0.28)? The subjective judgment required for assessing contextual appropriateness creates annotator disagreement, limiting reliability. Redesigned adaptation subcategories with more concrete criteria achieving IAA scores comparable to other error types would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Inter-annotator agreement scores of 0.5-0.63 represent moderate reproducibility, with adaptation errors showing particularly low agreement (0.12-0.28), suggesting inherent subjectivity in assessing tone and register appropriateness
- Reliance on only two annotators from the same dialect background (Syrian Levantine) raises questions about generalizability across different Arabic dialects and annotator populations
- Framework's performance on informal, code-switched social media text may not extend to other DA genres like news or formal communication

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The decision-tree protocol's effectiveness in reducing cognitive load for minimally trained annotators is well-supported by systematic IAA scores and clear hierarchical workflow design. The framework's ability to identify dialect-specific terminology errors as a distinct challenge is validated by quantitative error distribution.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that Ara-HOPE captures translation failures missed by automatic metrics is supported by error analysis showing TRM and GSMIS as dominant error types, but direct comparison with BLEU/COMET scores would strengthen this assertion. Applicability beyond Levantine Arabic is plausible but untested.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that weighted adaptation scoring (50%) appropriately balances meaning preservation and stylistic assessment lacks empirical validation. The choice of 0.5 weighting appears pragmatic rather than evidence-based.

## Next Checks

1. Test framework generalizability across Arabic dialects by applying Ara-HOPE to Maghrebi or Gulf Arabic datasets to verify the taxonomy captures dialect-specific errors beyond Levantine.

2. Conduct direct comparison between Ara-HOPE scores and automatic metrics (BLEU, COMET) on the same 200-tweet corpus to quantify the gap between human dialect-aware and automatic evaluation.

3. Perform IAA validation with annotators from different Arabic dialect backgrounds (Egyptian, Gulf, Maghrebi) to assess framework robustness across dialectal variation and annotator familiarity.
