# KAN-Dreamer: Benchmarking Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks as Function Approximators in World Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.07437
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07437
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: FastKAN achieves MLP-level performance in reward/continue prediction while struggling with visual perception and policy optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper benchmarks Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and FastKANs as replacements for MLPs in the DreamerV3 world model framework for reinforcement learning. The authors evaluate performance on the walker_walk task from DeepMind Control Suite using iso-parameter settings (~10.5M parameters). Results demonstrate that FastKAN-based reward and continue predictors match MLP baseline performance, while KANs face challenges with visual perception due to missing spatial inductive biases and struggle with policy optimization due to task complexity.

## Method Summary
The authors integrated both KAN and FastKAN architectures into the DreamerV3 world model pipeline, replacing components including visual encoders/decoders and reward/continue predictors. The evaluation focused on the walker_walk task from DeepMind Control Suite under iso-parameter settings (~10.5M parameters). Performance metrics included sample efficiency and training speed, with comparisons made against MLP baselines across multiple runs to establish statistical significance.

## Key Results
- FastKAN-based reward and continue predictors achieve performance parity with MLP baselines
- KANs underperform in visual perception tasks due to lack of spatial inductive biases
- Policy optimization with KANs shows poor performance, likely due to task complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: FastKAN achieves MLP-level performance in reward/continue prediction by maintaining similar function approximation capabilities while offering potential computational benefits through optimized spline computations. The parity suggests that the core nonlinear approximation properties needed for low-dimensional predictions are preserved in the FastKAN architecture.

Unknown: The exact computational advantages of FastKAN over standard KANs in this specific deployment context remain unspecified, including whether inference speed improvements translate to meaningful training efficiency gains in the DreamerV3 pipeline.

## Foundational Learning
- Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: Nonlinear function approximators using spline-based activation functions, needed for replacing MLPs in neural architectures; quick check: verify activation function implementation
- FastKAN architecture: Optimized variant of KANs with improved computational efficiency, needed for practical deployment; quick check: compare inference speeds against standard KANs
- DreamerV3 world model: Model-based reinforcement learning framework using latent dynamics, needed as benchmark environment; quick check: confirm latent space dimensionality matches original implementation

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input -> Visual Encoder -> Latent State -> Reward/Continue Predictors -> Policy Network -> Output

Critical path: Visual input flows through encoder to latent representation, which feeds into reward/continue predictors and policy network for decision-making

Design tradeoffs: KANs offer flexibility in function approximation but lack spatial inductive biases present in CNNs, making them unsuitable for visual tasks but viable for low-dimensional predictions

Failure signatures: Poor performance in visual tasks indicates missing spatial structure handling; policy optimization failures suggest limitations in complex value function approximation

First experiments:
1. Replace MLP reward predictor with FastKAN in existing DreamerV3 setup
2. Compare inference speeds between FastKAN and MLP components
3. Evaluate visual encoder performance with KAN vs CNN architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, suggesting either a focus on empirical results over theoretical implications or incomplete documentation of broader research directions.

## Limitations
- Single-task evaluation (walker_walk) limits generalizability to other domains and RL frameworks
- No exploration of computational efficiency or memory usage trade-offs for practical deployment
- Claims about KAN limitations for visual perception need broader validation across multiple visual benchmarks

## Confidence
High: FastKAN viability for low-dimensional prediction tasks
Medium: KAN limitations for visual perception
Low: Policy optimization difficulties due to task complexity

## Next Checks
1. Test FastKAN integration across multiple DeepMind Control Suite tasks to verify generalizability beyond walker_walk
2. Implement explicit spatial bias mechanisms in KAN architectures and re-evaluate visual performance
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing FastKAN to MLP on varying reward/continue prediction complexities
