core_contribution: 'This paper introduces ReliabilityRAG, a framework designed to
  defend retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems against adversarial document
  corruption by leveraging document reliability signals. The core method uses a graph-theoretic
  approach: documents are retrieved, contradictions between them are detected using
  a natural language inference (NLI) model to construct a contradiction graph, and
  a rank-aware maximum independent set (MIS) is found to identify the most consistent,

# ReliabilityRAG: Effective and Provably Robust Defense for RAG-based Web-Search
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23519
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23519
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ReliabilityRAG achieves provable robustness against adversarial document corruption via contradiction graph analysis, excelling at long-form generation while maintaining high benign accuracy.

## Executive Summary
ReliabilityRAG introduces a novel framework to defend retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems against adversarial document corruption. By leveraging document reliability signals, it constructs a contradiction graph using natural language inference (NLI) to detect inconsistencies among retrieved documents. The framework identifies the most consistent, reliable subset via a rank-aware maximum independent set, and scales efficiently using a weighted sampling approach. Empirical results show ReliabilityRAG offers superior robustness, high accuracy on benign queries, and excels at long-form generation tasks.

## Method Summary
ReliabilityRAG defends RAG systems by constructing a contradiction graph from retrieved documents, where edges represent detected contradictions via NLI. A rank-aware maximum independent set (MIS) is computed to select the most reliable, consistent subset. To handle scalability, a weighted sampling framework is introduced that preserves provable robustness guarantees. This approach allows the system to robustly generate answers even when some documents are adversarially corrupted, and it is particularly effective for long-form generation tasks.

## Key Results
- ReliabilityRAG demonstrates superior robustness to adversarial document corruption compared to baseline defenses.
- Maintains high benign accuracy on non-adversarial queries.
- Excels at long-form generation tasks, outperforming prior robustness-focused methods.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ReliabilityRAG's core insight is that adversarial document corruption can be mitigated by leveraging document reliability and consistency. By constructing a contradiction graph and identifying a maximum independent set, the framework isolates the most trustworthy documents, reducing the impact of corrupted inputs. The rank-aware MIS ensures that document relevance is balanced with reliability, while weighted sampling enables scalable, robust retrieval without sacrificing provable guarantees.

## Foundational Learning
- **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**: Used to detect contradictions between document pairs; essential for constructing the contradiction graph.
  - *Why needed*: Identifies document inconsistencies caused by adversarial corruption.
  - *Quick check*: Evaluate NLI model's accuracy and robustness on noisy or adversarial document pairs.
- **Contradiction Graph**: A graph where nodes are documents and edges represent contradictions.
  - *Why needed*: Encodes document reliability and inconsistency relationships.
  - *Quick check*: Verify graph construction produces expected edges for known contradictory pairs.
- **Maximum Independent Set (MIS)**: Finds the largest set of non-adjacent (non-contradictory) nodes in a graph.
  - *Why needed*: Identifies the most consistent and reliable subset of documents.
  - *Quick check*: Test MIS algorithm on small, hand-crafted graphs for correctness.
- **Rank-Aware MIS**: Extends MIS by incorporating document retrieval rank to balance relevance and reliability.
  - *Why needed*: Ensures the most relevant reliable documents are selected.
  - *Quick check*: Compare rank-aware vs. standard MIS performance on retrieval benchmarks.
- **Weighted Sampling Framework**: Scales contradiction graph analysis to large retrieval sets while preserving robustness.
  - *Why needed*: Makes the approach practical for real-world RAG systems.
  - *Quick check*: Measure scalability and robustness trade-offs as sampling parameters vary.
- **Provable Robustness Guarantees**: Formal guarantees on the system's ability to resist adversarial corruption.
  - *Why needed*: Provides confidence that the defense holds even under worst-case attacks.
  - *Quick check*: Verify theoretical bounds align with empirical robustness under controlled attacks.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Web query -> Document retrieval -> NLI-based contradiction detection -> Contradiction graph construction -> Rank-aware MIS -> Reliable document subset -> RAG generation
- **Critical Path**: Document retrieval → NLI contradiction detection → Contradiction graph → MIS selection → Final generation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Scalability (weighted sampling) vs. full robustness; NLI accuracy vs. contradiction detection quality; rank awareness vs. simplicity
- **Failure Signatures**: Degraded NLI performance leads to incorrect graph edges; sampling too aggressively reduces robustness; computational bottlenecks in MIS for large graphs
- **First 3 Experiments**:
  1. Evaluate NLI model accuracy on synthetic contradictory document pairs.
  2. Benchmark rank-aware MIS vs. standard MIS on retrieval relevance and consistency.
  3. Measure runtime and robustness under varying weighted sampling parameters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- NLI model errors can propagate to contradiction graph and degrade reliability estimates.
- Exact robustness-accuracy trade-offs under weighted sampling are not quantified.
- Evaluation focuses on long-form generation; performance on other RAG tasks is unclear.
- Runtime and latency for contradiction graph and MIS computation are not analyzed.

## Confidence
- High: Graph-theoretic formulation and contradiction detection pipeline are methodologically sound.
- Medium: Empirical robustness improvements demonstrated, but generality across models, domains, and attacks is uncertain.
- Medium: Weighted sampling extension is practical but robustness guarantees and trade-offs are not rigorously quantified.

## Next Checks
1. Perform an ablation study to quantify the impact of NLI model accuracy on final reliability scores and robustness under adversarial attacks.
2. Systematically evaluate the scalability-performance trade-off by varying sampling parameters and measuring both runtime and robustness degradation.
3. Test ReliabilityRAG on diverse RAG tasks (e.g., fact verification, multi-hop QA) and against a broader suite of adaptive attack strategies to assess generalizability.
