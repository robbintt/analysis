# Optimizing Drivers' Discount Order Acceptance Strategies: A Policy-Improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.11865
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11865
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: pi-DDPG achieves faster early-stage convergence, higher episode rewards, and improved stability compared to baseline DDPG in multi-platform ride-hailing discount order acceptance

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the operational challenge of optimizing drivers' acceptance of Discount Express orders in a multi-platform ride-hailing market. The authors propose a policy-improved deep deterministic policy gradient (pi-DDPG) framework that dynamically manages the proportion of drivers accepting discount orders. The framework introduces a refiner module for online action optimization guided by critic feedback, incorporates a ConvLSTM network to capture spatiotemporal demand-supply patterns, and applies prioritized experience replay to improve sample efficiency. The approach is validated using a simulator calibrated with real-world data from Beijing, showing superior performance under competitive multi-platform conditions.

## Method Summary
The pi-DDPG framework extends DDPG with three key innovations: (1) a refiner module that performs online action refinement via K gradient ascent steps to maximize critic-estimated Q-values, (2) a ConvLSTM encoder that captures spatiotemporal demand-supply dynamics through grid-based memory sequences, and (3) prioritized experience replay that samples transitions based on TD-error magnitude to accelerate critic learning. The method is evaluated in a simulator calibrated with real-world Beijing data, where the agent controls the proportion of drivers accepting discount orders to maximize platform revenue under multi-platform competition.

## Key Results
- pi-DDPG achieves 0-2% median Q-value improvement during refinement in early training episodes
- Faster early-stage convergence compared to baseline DDPG, particularly in high- and medium-supply scenarios
- Higher episode rewards and improved stability across 20 independent runs
- Performance degrades in low-supply environments where discretization artifacts reduce policy complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Critic-Guided Online Action Refinement
The refiner module improves early-stage policy performance by locally optimizing actor outputs using critic feedback before execution. Given an actor-produced action, the refiner applies a lightweight affine transformation and performs K gradient ascent steps to maximize Q-value estimates. This mechanism assumes the critic's value landscape provides meaningful local guidance for action improvement, even if imperfectly estimated.

### Mechanism 2: ConvLSTM-Based Spatiotemporal Encoding
Encoding historical supply-demand dynamics via ConvLSTM enables the policy to capture temporal dependencies and spatial correlations simultaneously. The state representation is augmented with memory organized as 3D tensors over hexagonal grids, where ConvLSTM processes this sequence using convolutional operations within LSTM cells. This assumes supply-demand patterns exhibit learnable spatiotemporal regularities that can be captured through historical patterns.

### Mechanism 3: Prioritized Experience Replay for Sample Efficiency
Sampling transitions proportional to TD-error rank accelerates critic learning by focusing on high-information experiences. Transitions are ranked by |TD-error|, with sampling probability proportional to rank-based weights. This assumes TD-error magnitude correlates with learning potential, where high-error transitions represent under-explored or poorly estimated state-action regions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Actor-Critic Architecture with Deterministic Policy Gradient**
  - Why needed here: The framework extends DDPG, requiring understanding how the actor maps states to actions and how the critic evaluates state-action pairs
  - Quick check question: Can you derive the deterministic policy gradient and explain why target networks are necessary for stability?

- **Concept: Continuous Action Spaces and Bounded Outputs**
  - Why needed here: The decision variable is a proportion in [0,1] per grid, requiring continuous control
  - Quick check question: How does clipping in the refiner ensure valid actions, and what happens to gradients when the pre-clipped value falls outside (0,1)?

- **Concept: Spatiotemporal State Representation**
  - Why needed here: The policy must reason over both current state and historical memory encoded as grid-based sequences
  - Quick check question: Given hexagonal grid coordinates and memory length L, what is the shape of the input tensor to ConvLSTM, and how does convolutional processing preserve spatial relationships?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Environment (Simulator) → ConvLSTM Encoder (shared by actor/critic) → Actor Network → Refiner Module → Environment Execution → Prioritized Replay Buffer → Critic Update + Actor Update → Target Networks

- **Critical path:** 1. Data preprocessing: Calibrate Poisson arrival rates and driver online/offline probabilities from real-world trip data 2. Simulator construction: Implement order matching logic, driver transitions, and multi-platform competition 3. Network initialization: Actor/critic with He Normal (ReLU), Glorot (tanh), Random Uniform (critic output); target networks copied initially 4. Training loop: For each episode, observe state → ConvLSTM encode → actor forward → refine action → execute → store transition → PER sample → update critic/actor → soft-update targets → decay noise

- **Design tradeoffs:** 1. Refinement step schedule: Progressive K_refine = min(ep, K_max) prevents unreliable early-critic guidance but delays full refinement benefits 2. Prioritization exponent α: Higher α increases focus on high-TD-error samples, improving convergence speed but risking sample diversity loss 3. Hexagonal grid resolution: Level 6 (37 grids) balances spatial granularity with computational tractability

- **Failure signatures:** 1. Early-stage oscillations: If noise σ is too large, early episodes show erratic rewards due to irrational actions 2. Low-supply discretization artifacts: In sparse grids with single drivers, continuous proportions degenerate to binary decisions 3. Refiner gradient vanishing: When affine transformation output is clipped to boundary (0 or 1), refinement halts for that dimension

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Actor learning rate sweep (10^-2 to 10^-5): Identify rate that balances early convergence speed and long-term stability 2. Exploration noise sensitivity (σ = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5): Quantify trade-off between exploration adequacy and early-episode performance loss 3. Refinement step ablation (K_max = 5, 10, 20): Measure Q-value improvement percentage before/after refinement at different training stages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question 1:** How can a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework be designed to balance total platform profit against equity in order matching opportunities for drivers?
  - Basis: Conclusion states future work should incorporate "drivers' equity... by formulating a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework"
  - Why unresolved: Current study focuses solely on maximizing total service rewards (profit), leaving the trade-off between platform efficiency and driver fairness unexplored

- **Question 2:** How does the pi-DDPG policy perform in a market where competing platforms also employ adaptive reinforcement learning strategies rather than fixed heuristic policies?
  - Basis: Conclusion suggests investigating "multi-agent reinforcement learning under a competitive environment"
  - Why unresolved: Current experiments assume competitors use simple fixed strategies, failing to capture complex dynamics of co-evolving strategic competition

- **Question 3:** To what extent does the assumption of full driver compliance bias the optimal policy, and how robust is the framework under partial non-compliance?
  - Basis: Section 3.1 assumes "drivers are fully compliant with the individual platform's guidance"
  - Why unresolved: If drivers reject recommendations that lower their immediate utility, the controlled proportion may diverge significantly from executed proportion

## Limitations

- Architecture specifications missing: Exact ConvLSTM and MLP layer dimensions, memory length L, and refiner network architecture are not provided
- Simulator details incomplete: Order matching algorithm, spatial search logic, and competitor behavior modeling are underspecified
- External validity constraints: Results validated only on Beijing data with 37-grid hexagonal discretization; generalization untested
- Baseline comparability issues: Competing methods are not in corpus and differ in architecture details

## Confidence

- **High**: Core mechanisms (critic-guided refinement, ConvLSTM encoding, PER) are theoretically sound and experimentally validated within controlled setup
- **Medium**: Claims about early-stage convergence speed improvements and multi-platform competitive effects are supported by within-study comparisons but lack external benchmark validation
- **Low**: Claims about robustness across supply-demand regimes rely on limited scenario variations and may not hold under different demand distributions

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce ablation study: Implement pi-DDPG without refiner and PER, compare early-stage Q-value improvements and convergence curves against reported results
2. Generalize to new data: Calibrate the simulator with independent ride-hailing data (e.g., different city/month) and measure policy performance degradation
3. Stress-test discretization sensitivity: Vary hexagonal grid resolution (e.g., level 5 vs. level 7) and observe changes in learned action distributions and episode rewards
