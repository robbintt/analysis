# HACTS: a Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System for Robot Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.24070
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24070
- Reference count: 29
- Low-cost bilateral teleoperation system enabling human-as-copilot robot learning

## Executive Summary
HACTS introduces a bilateral teleoperation system that enables real-time joint synchronization between a robot arm and human operator hardware, allowing humans to intervene during autonomous execution and collect high-quality action-correction data. The system is built with 3D-printed parts and servo motors, costs under $300, and achieves significant performance improvements in both imitation and reinforcement learning tasks. It enables zero-shot generalization to unseen object placements and reduces human intervention time as the robot learns, offering a scalable solution for enhancing robot learning through interactive human feedback.

## Method Summary
HACTS is a bilateral teleoperation system that physically connects a human operator to a robot arm through synchronized joint movements, enabling the human to act as a copilot during autonomous execution. The system uses 3D-printed components and servo motors to achieve real-time mechanical feedback, allowing the operator to feel and correct the robot's actions. During training, the human can intervene when the robot makes mistakes, providing corrective demonstrations that are recorded as high-quality action-correction data. This data is then used to improve the robot's policy through imitation learning (HACTS-ACT) or reinforcement learning with policy distillation (RLPD-HACTS). The system is designed to be compatible with most robotic platforms and costs under $300, making it an affordable solution for robot learning research.

## Key Results
- HACTS-ACT improved imitation learning success rates from 40% to 70% on failure correction tasks
- Enabled zero-shot generalization to unseen object placements, achieving 30-50% success where baselines failed
- RLPD-HACTS achieved 80% success rate after 45 minutes of online training, with decreasing intervention length over time

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by providing immediate mechanical feedback through synchronized joint movements, allowing the human operator to physically feel and correct the robot's actions in real-time. This creates a closed-loop control system where the human can intervene precisely when and how the robot makes mistakes, generating high-quality corrective demonstrations. The bilateral nature ensures that both parties experience the same forces and movements, enabling intuitive control and feedback. As training progresses, the robot learns from these corrections, reducing the need for human intervention over time.

## Foundational Learning
- Bilateral teleoperation: Why needed - enables intuitive human-robot interaction; Quick check - verify force feedback matches between human and robot
- Joint synchronization: Why needed - ensures coordinated movement for precise corrections; Quick check - measure synchronization latency and accuracy
- Action-correction data collection: Why needed - provides high-quality training examples for policy improvement; Quick check - validate correction quality through human-in-the-loop evaluation
- Reinforcement learning with policy distillation: Why needed - efficiently learns from human corrections; Quick check - compare performance against standard RL baselines
- Zero-shot generalization: Why needed - demonstrates robust learning beyond training scenarios; Quick check - test on completely unseen task variations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Human Operator Hardware -> Servo Motor Interface -> Robot Arm Controller -> Joint Actuators

**Critical Path:**
Human operator initiates movement → Servo motors synchronize joints → Robot arm executes motion → Force feedback returns to operator → Corrections are recorded → Policy is updated

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Low cost vs. precision: 3D-printed components reduce cost but may limit long-term durability
- Real-time feedback vs. system latency: Synchronization must be fast enough for intuitive control
- Human intervention vs. autonomous performance: System must balance learning from corrections with independent execution

**Failure Signatures:**
- High intervention frequency indicates poor initial policy performance
- Inconsistent force feedback suggests synchronization issues
- Failed zero-shot generalization reveals overfitting to training scenarios

**First Experiments:**
1. Test basic joint synchronization accuracy between human hardware and robot arm
2. Measure intervention frequency reduction over training episodes
3. Evaluate zero-shot generalization on simple object relocation tasks
