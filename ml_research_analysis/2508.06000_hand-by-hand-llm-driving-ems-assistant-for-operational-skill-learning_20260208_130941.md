# Hand by Hand: LLM Driving EMS Assistant for Operational Skill Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06000
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06000
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: EMS-LLM system improved flight training altitude maintenance with positive user feedback on kinesthetic learning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an EMS-LLM system for kinesthetic flight skill training that combines Large Language Models with Electrical Muscle Stimulation to provide real-time guidance. The system uses an "Align-Analyze-Adjust" workflow where the LLM retrieves flight procedures via RAG, analyzes real-time flight data, and generates EMS patterns to guide arm movements during simulated flight tasks. A user study with 36 participants demonstrated significant improvements in altitude maintenance for the EMS-assisted group compared to solo training, with users reporting enhanced situational awareness and engagement through kinesthetic feedback.

## Method Summary
The system integrates Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) 2020 with a Python-SimConnect data pipeline, an FAA knowledge base stored in FAISS vector database, GPT-4o LLM, and a custom EMS controller ("FlightAxis circuit"). The "Align-Analyze-Adjust" workflow processes 1Hz flight data (altitude, angles, velocities) to retrieve relevant procedures, detect deviations, and output EMS commands (Mode 2 for correction, Mode 3 for initiation) synchronized with voice prompts. The EMS system uses specific waveforms calibrated through pre-experiment testing with 5 participants to balance guidance strength and user autonomy.

## Key Results
- EMS-assisted trainees showed significantly improved altitude maintenance (p < 0.001) compared to solo training
- System received positive feedback for comfort (74.2), process memory assistance (76.8), operational learning support (79.4), and enhanced situational awareness
- RAG retrieval achieved 93.2% judgment accuracy across all tasks, with 95.6% accuracy under normal flight conditions
- Users reported kinesthetic feedback helped identify operation flaws and increased engagement in training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented LLMs can produce domain-accurate operational guidance when grounded in structured knowledge bases
- Mechanism: RAG with hierarchical flight knowledge (basic → aircraft type → mission-specific) stored in FAISS reduces hallucination by constraining outputs to retrieved context
- Core assumption: Knowledge base comprehensiveness translates to guidance accuracy
- Evidence: 93.2% judgment accuracy across tasks, though 7% error rate remains

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Kinesthetic feedback via EMS enhances error awareness and skill acquisition by engaging proprioceptive learning pathways
- Mechanism: EMS induces involuntary muscle contractions using Mode 2 (weak-strong) for correction and Mode 3 (weak-strong-weak) for initiation
- Core assumption: Users tolerate EMS-induced movement and benefit from physical guidance
- Evidence: Mode 3 had highest autonomy sense (76.8) and comfort (74.2); users reported identifying operation flaws through kinesthetic feedback

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-modal feedback (EMS + voice) improves situational awareness by parallel-processing different feedback channels
- Mechanism: EMS handles "how to move" while voice identifies "where to attend," reducing cognitive load
- Core assumption: Modalities don't interfere and users can integrate both channels
- Evidence: Enhanced situational awareness reported, though no direct corpus evidence for EMS+voice integration exists

## Foundational Learning

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Grounds LLM guidance in actual procedures rather than generic knowledge; reduces hallucinations
  - Quick check: Can you explain why RAG reduces hallucination compared to vanilla LLM prompting?

- **Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) for force feedback**: Converts digital guidance into physical muscle contractions for kinesthetic learning
  - Quick check: What safety protocols are required before applying EMS to a new user?

- **Embodied cognition in motor learning**: Physical skills require proprioceptive feedback loops; physical guidance creates different learning outcomes than verbal instruction
  - Quick check: Why might kinesthetic feedback outperform verbal feedback for procedural motor skills?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: MSFS -> Python-SimConnect -> Flight Data (JSON, 1Hz) -> LLM Workflow (Align-Analyze-Adjust) -> EMS Controller + Voice Output -> User
- **Critical path**: Flight data ingestion → RAG retrieval → LLM guidance generation → EMS pattern selection → Synchronized voice prompts
- **Design tradeoffs**: Latency vs. accuracy (cloud LLM introduces seconds of delay); guidance strength vs. autonomy; RAG coverage vs. maintenance
- **Failure signatures**: LLM hallucination → incorrect guidance; EMS calibration mismatch → discomfort; feedback timing lag → user frustration
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate RAG accuracy test with target flight scenarios
  2. Conduct EMS calibration session with 3-5 pilot users
  3. Run A/B comparison: text-only vs. EMS+voice feedback on single maneuver

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does RAG-augmented LLM kinesthetic guidance compare to traditional rule-based or machine learning systems in terms of guidance quality and user experience?
- Can LLM-driven kinesthetic assistance be effectively applied to highly time-sensitive operational tasks given inherent processing latency?
- What specific strategies are most effective for mitigating LLM randomness and hallucination risks in embodied, safety-critical control?

## Limitations

- EMS system effectiveness depends heavily on proper calibration tested with only 5 participants
- Real-time responsiveness questionable given cloud LLM latency not quantified in study
- User study limited to 36 participants and single aircraft type (DA40), restricting external validity
- Knowledge base construction and maintenance burden not addressed despite being significant

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: EMS-LLM assistance improves altitude maintenance in flight training (p < 0.001), system feasibility, and general positive reception are well-supported

**Medium Confidence**: Embodied cognition mechanism and cognitive load reduction claims are plausible but lack direct evidence and comparative studies

**Low Confidence**: Real-time applicability in high-stress scenarios is speculative; long-term skill retention and handling of novel situations outside knowledge base are unaddressed

## Next Checks

1. Test system with diverse flight scenarios (takeoff, landing, emergency procedures) and multiple aircraft types to assess knowledge base coverage
2. Conduct multi-session study tracking skill retention over weeks comparing EMS-assisted training to traditional methods
3. Instrument system to log end-to-end latency and conduct user testing with induced time pressure to identify breaking points
