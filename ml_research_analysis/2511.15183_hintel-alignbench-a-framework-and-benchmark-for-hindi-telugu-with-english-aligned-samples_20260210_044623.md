# HinTel-AlignBench: A Framework and Benchmark for Hindi-Telugu with English-Aligned Samples

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.15183
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15183
- **Reference count:** 26
- **Primary result:** Introduces semi-automated framework for creating multilingual VLM benchmarks with verified translations and cultural grounding

## Executive Summary
This paper presents HinTel-AlignBench, a comprehensive framework and benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal models in Hindi and Telugu languages. The framework addresses critical limitations in current multilingual VLM evaluations, including unverified auto-translations, narrow task coverage, and lack of cultural grounding. By employing a semi-automated dataset creation process combining back-translation, filtering, and human verification, the benchmark generates approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language with English-aligned samples for precise cross-language comparison.

The benchmark includes both adapted English datasets (VQAv2, RealWorldQA, CLEVR-Math) and native Indic datasets (JEE for STEM, VAANI for cultural grounding). Comprehensive evaluations reveal performance regressions from English to Indian languages, with an average 8.3-point drop in Hindi and 5.5-point drop in Telugu across 4 out of 5 tasks. The study identifies common failure modes and highlights the need for improved multilingual multimodal understanding, particularly in culturally-specific contexts and reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a semi-automated dataset creation pipeline that combines back-translation, filtering, and human verification to generate multilingual benchmarks efficiently while maintaining linguistic fidelity. The framework adapts existing English datasets (VQAv2, RealWorldQA, CLEVR-Math) and creates native Indic datasets (JEE for STEM, VAANI for cultural grounding). The benchmark provides approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language with English-aligned samples, enabling exact cross-language comparison. The methodology emphasizes cultural grounding and domain diversity beyond traditional VQA tasks.

## Key Results
- Performance regressions observed: average 8.3-point drop in Hindi and 5.5-point drop in Telugu across 4 out of 5 tasks
- State-of-the-art models show significant performance gaps between English and Indian language evaluations
- Native Indic datasets (JEE, VAANI) reveal cultural grounding challenges not captured by adapted English datasets
- Common failure modes identified include culturally-specific context understanding and reasoning task difficulties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by addressing fundamental limitations in multilingual VLM evaluation through verified translations and culturally-grounded content. The semi-automated pipeline accelerates benchmark creation while maintaining quality through human verification. The English-aligned samples enable precise cross-language performance comparison, isolating language-specific effects from other factors.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semi-automated dataset creation**: Back-translation + filtering + human verification needed to scale benchmark generation while maintaining quality; quick check: validate translation accuracy metrics
- **Cultural grounding**: Native Indic datasets required to evaluate culturally-specific understanding beyond generic VQA; quick check: measure performance gaps on cultural vs non-cultural tasks
- **English-aligned samples**: Exact cross-language comparison needed to isolate language-specific effects; quick check: compare performance drops between aligned and non-aligned samples
- **Multilingual multimodal evaluation**: Comprehensive framework needed to assess cross-lingual performance beyond text-only tasks; quick check: evaluate across diverse task types
- **Domain diversity**: STEM and cultural grounding tasks needed beyond traditional VQA; quick check: analyze performance across different domain types

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Dataset Creation Pipeline -> Benchmark Generation -> Model Evaluation -> Performance Analysis
- **Critical path**: Semi-automated translation → Human verification → Benchmark construction → Model evaluation → Gap analysis
- **Design tradeoffs**: Automation vs quality (human verification required), dataset size vs coverage (4,000 pairs per language), cultural specificity vs generalizability
- **Failure signatures**: Large performance drops on culturally-specific tasks, reasoning task failures, translation quality issues
- **First experiments**: 1) Run baseline models on English vs Hindi/Telugu to measure performance gaps, 2) Analyze failure patterns on cultural grounding tasks, 3) Test translation quality impact by comparing verified vs unverified samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Relatively small sample size of approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language may not capture full complexity
- Focus on specific domains (STEM, cultural grounding, VQA) may not represent broader deployment scenarios
- Human verification process lacks detailed documentation regarding inter-annotator agreement and quality control

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Framework design and methodology documentation is comprehensive and well-established
- **Medium confidence**: Performance evaluation results based on limited model evaluations (4 out of 5 tasks showing drops)
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability beyond specific languages and tasks examined, as benchmark focuses exclusively on Hindi and Telugu

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify impact of different semi-automated pipeline components on final benchmark quality
2. Expand model evaluations to include additional state-of-the-art VLMs and alternative evaluation metrics beyond accuracy scores
3. Test benchmark transferability by evaluating models trained on different data distributions and architectures to assess consistency of observed performance gaps across model families
