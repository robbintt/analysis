# On Learning Representations for Tabular Data Distillation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.13905
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13905
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces TDColER, a framework for tabular data distillation that addresses the unique challenges of heterogeneous tabular features and non-differentiable downstream models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TDColER, a framework for tabular data distillation that addresses the unique challenges of heterogeneous tabular features and non-differentiable downstream models. The core innovation is using column embeddings and learned latent representations to enable distillation methods designed for homogeneous image data to work effectively on tabular datasets. TDColER incorporates encoder architectures like Transformers and Graph Neural Networks to create compact, information-rich representations, followed by a decoder for reconstruction.

The framework is evaluated on TDBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 23 datasets, 7 model classes, and 11 distillation schemes. Results demonstrate that TDColER significantly improves distilled data quality, achieving 0.5-143% performance gains across downstream models when trained on distilled data with as few as 10 instances per class. Notably, k-means clustering in latent space combined with supervised fine-tuned transformer encoders consistently outperformed other methods. The study also highlights that GNN-based encoders, while slightly less effective than transformers, offer superior parameter efficiency. Additionally, the framework shows strong performance under class imbalance and preserves feature correlations in distilled datasets, making it a robust solution for tabular data distillation across diverse scenarios.

## Method Summary
TDColER uses column embeddings to handle heterogeneous tabular features, followed by an encoder (Transformer, GNN, or FFN) to learn latent representations, and a decoder for reconstruction. The framework preprocesses data through one-hot encoding of categorical features, binning of numerical features, and imputation of missing values. It then trains an autoencoder minimizing reconstruction loss, optionally fine-tunes with a classifier head, and performs distillation in the latent space using clustering methods like k-means or agglomerative clustering. The distilled data can be decoded back to the original feature space for interpretability.

## Key Results
- TDColER achieves 0.5-143% performance gains across downstream models when trained on distilled data with as few as 10 instances per class
- K-means clustering in latent space combined with supervised fine-tuned transformer encoders consistently outperformed other methods
- GNN-based encoders, while slightly less effective than transformers, offer superior parameter efficiency
- The framework shows strong performance under class imbalance and preserves feature correlations in distilled datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TDColER addresses the challenge of distilling heterogeneous tabular data by learning column embeddings that capture feature-specific information, then using encoder architectures like Transformers and GNNs to create compact, information-rich latent representations. This approach enables distillation methods designed for homogeneous image data to work effectively on tabular datasets by operating in a unified latent space where feature heterogeneity is abstracted away. The framework's success stems from its ability to preserve both global structure (through reconstruction loss) and task-specific information (through supervised fine-tuning), while clustering methods like k-means effectively select representative samples from the latent space.

## Foundational Learning
- **Column Embeddings**: Learnable representations for each feature/column to handle heterogeneous data types. Why needed: Tabular data combines numerical and categorical features with different scales and distributions. Quick check: Verify embeddings capture feature semantics through reconstruction quality.
- **Latent Space Distillation**: Performing data selection in learned representations rather than original space. Why needed: Original space distillation fails due to feature heterogeneity. Quick check: Compare performance between latent vs original space distillation.
- **Autoencoder Architecture**: Encoder-decoder structure for learning compressed representations. Why needed: Enables dimensionality reduction while preserving information. Quick check: Measure reconstruction loss on validation data.
- **Clustering-based Selection**: Using k-means or agglomerative clustering for sample selection. Why needed: Simple clustering outperforms complex gradient-based methods on tabular data. Quick check: Evaluate downstream performance using different clustering algorithms.
- **Supervised Fine-tuning**: Joint training of encoder with classifier head. Why needed: Ensures latent representations capture task-relevant information. Quick check: Compare performance with and without supervised fine-tuning.
- **Relative Regret Metric**: (AF - A) / (AF - AR10) for evaluating distilled data quality. Why needed: Provides normalized measure of performance degradation. Quick check: Verify metric correctly captures relative performance changes.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Data -> Preprocessing (Binning + Encoding) -> Column Embedding Layer -> Encoder (Transformer/GNN/FFN) -> Latent Space -> Clustering (k-means/agglomerative) -> Distilled Samples -> Decoder (optional) -> Output Data

### Critical Path
The critical path is: Column Embedding Layer -> Encoder -> Latent Space -> Clustering -> Distilled Samples. This path directly determines the quality of the distilled data and downstream model performance.

### Design Tradeoffs
The framework balances performance and interpretability: using latent space improves distillation quality but reduces direct interpretability, while decoding back to original space sacrifices some performance for feature-level understanding. Transformer encoders offer better performance but higher computational cost compared to GNNs, which provide better parameter efficiency.

### Failure Signatures
- Poor reconstruction loss indicates the autoencoder isn't learning useful representations
- Similar performance between original and distilled data suggests ineffective distillation
- Performance degradation when decoding back to original space indicates information loss
- Gradient-based methods (KIP, GM) underperforming clustering methods suggests tabular data structure doesn't align with trajectory matching

### First Experiments
1. Implement and train the Transformer encoder with column embeddings, measuring reconstruction loss
2. Apply k-means clustering in latent space and evaluate distilled sample quality using downstream classifiers
3. Compare performance between latent space training ("Enc.") and decoded training ("Rec.") to quantify the interpretability-performance tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Why do simple clustering methods like k-means significantly outperform complex gradient-based distillation schemes (e.g., GM, MTT) specifically on tabular data? The authors observe that k-means dominates recent methods like MTT and DATM, suggesting the latter may overfit to the teacher network's architecture, but they do not provide a definitive theoretical explanation.

2. Can the TDColER framework effectively generalize to regression tasks and multi-class classification without performance degradation? The authors state that regression can be easily added to their framework, but the entire benchmark and evaluation metrics are tailored exclusively for binary classification.

3. How can the performance gap between training in the latent space versus the decoded original space be bridged to maintain interpretability? Results show latent space training outperforms decoded training, but the authors note that using the original representation is required for interpretability in terms of the original features.

## Limitations
- The framework's evaluation is limited to binary classification tasks, with no testing on multi-class or regression problems
- The selection criteria for optimal hyperparameters (particularly alpha for supervised fine-tuning) are not explicitly defined
- Claims about computational efficiency and parameter reduction for GNN encoders lack quantitative comparison with transformers

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- The core methodology of using latent space representations with column embeddings for tabular data distillation is well-founded and the experimental design is rigorous

Medium Confidence:
- The reported performance gains (0.5-143% improvements) are substantial, but the exact magnitude depends on hyperparameter choices not fully specified
- The superiority of transformer-based encoders over GNNs, while demonstrated, may vary with different architectural choices or larger datasets

Low Confidence:
- Claims about computational efficiency and parameter reduction for GNN encoders lack quantitative comparison with transformers
- The framework's behavior under extreme class imbalance scenarios beyond what was tested remains unverified

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary binning strategies, alpha values, and cluster counts to establish robustness ranges and identify critical sensitivity points in the framework.

2. **Multi-class Extension**: Apply TDColER to multi-class classification and regression tasks to verify the framework's generalizability beyond binary classification.

3. **Scalability Testing**: Evaluate performance and computational efficiency on larger tabular datasets (100K+ samples) to assess real-world applicability and identify potential bottlenecks in the distillation process.
