# VEU-Bench: Towards Comprehensive Understanding of Video Editing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.17828
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17828
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces VEU-Bench benchmark for evaluating video editing understanding in LLMs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VEU-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating video editing understanding in large language models. The benchmark covers 19 fine-grained tasks across 10 dimensions and three levels: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To create high-quality annotations, the authors developed an ontology-based annotation pipeline integrated with a knowledge base. Extensive experiments with 11 state-of-the-art video language models revealed significant challenges in video editing understanding, with some models performing worse than random choice. To address this, the authors developed Oscars, a fine-tuned expert model trained on the VEU-Bench dataset, which outperforms existing open-source models by 28.3% in accuracy and achieves performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o. Additionally, incorporating VEU data significantly enhances the performance of video language models on general video understanding benchmarks, with an average improvement of 8.3% across nine reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The VEU-Bench benchmark was constructed through an ontology-based annotation pipeline that leverages a knowledge base to create high-quality annotations across 19 fine-grained tasks spanning 10 dimensions. The benchmark evaluates video editing understanding at three levels: recognition, reasoning, and judging. The authors trained Oscars, a fine-tuned expert model, on the VEU-Bench dataset to address the identified challenges. Performance was evaluated against 11 state-of-the-art video language models, including both open-source and commercial systems, with comparisons made across multiple accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- VEU-Bench covers 19 fine-grained tasks across 10 dimensions and three levels (recognition, reasoning, judging)
- Some video language models performed worse than random choice on editing understanding tasks
- Oscars fine-tuned model achieved 28.3% higher accuracy than existing open-source models and matched commercial model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ontology-based annotation pipeline ensures high-quality, structured annotations by systematically mapping video editing concepts to a knowledge base. This structured approach enables precise task definition across multiple dimensions of video editing understanding. The multi-level evaluation framework (recognition, reasoning, judging) captures both surface-level and deep comprehension of editing techniques. By training Oscars specifically on this curated dataset, the model develops specialized expertise in video editing concepts that general video language models lack.

## Foundational Learning
- Video editing ontology: Systematic categorization of editing techniques and concepts needed to structure evaluation criteria
  - Quick check: Can the ontology map all common editing operations without overlap?
- Knowledge base integration: Linking visual editing patterns to semantic understanding
  - Quick check: Does the knowledge base cover both technical and creative editing aspects?
- Multi-level task design: Recognition vs. reasoning vs. judging distinctions
  - Quick check: Are the task difficulty levels appropriately calibrated?
- Annotation pipeline: Automated quality control for benchmark construction
  - Quick check: What's the inter-annotator agreement rate?
- Video-language model evaluation: Metrics for assessing understanding vs. pattern matching
  - Quick check: How does performance differ from random guessing baselines?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Video input -> Processing pipeline -> Feature extraction -> Question understanding -> Answer generation -> Evaluation

Critical path: Video processing and understanding → Question comprehension → Context integration → Answer formulation

Design tradeoffs: The benchmark prioritizes comprehensive coverage of editing tasks over real-time performance, sacrificing some efficiency for thoroughness. The ontology-based approach trades flexibility for precision in task definition.

Failure signatures: Models performing worse than random choice indicate fundamental gaps in editing comprehension. Low performance on reasoning tasks suggests inability to infer editing intent. Poor judging task performance reveals difficulty in evaluating editing quality.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline models on single-dimension tasks to identify specific weaknesses
2. Test transfer learning from general video understanding to editing tasks
3. Compare human performance vs. model performance to establish upper bounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Major uncertainties remain regarding the generalizability of VEU-Bench's findings to broader video understanding tasks beyond editing. While the benchmark demonstrates significant challenges for current video language models, the specialized nature of editing-focused questions may not fully represent general video comprehension capabilities. The 28.3% improvement of Oscars over open-source models is impressive but requires further validation on independent datasets to rule out potential overfitting to the VEU-Bench training data.

## Limitations
- Specialized editing focus may not generalize to broader video understanding capabilities
- Performance improvements may result from overfitting to VEU-Bench training data
- Direct comparisons between open-source and commercial models are complicated by access differences and evaluation protocols

## Confidence

High confidence in the benchmark construction methodology and annotation quality
Medium confidence in the relative performance rankings of tested models
Medium confidence in the effectiveness of VEU data for general video understanding
Low confidence in long-term generalization beyond editing-specific tasks

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate Oscars and other models on independent video editing datasets not used in VEU-Bench training to assess true generalization capability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate which specific aspects of VEU-Bench training data contribute most to performance improvements
3. Test whether performance gains transfer to non-editing video comprehension tasks using established benchmarks like MSR-VTT or ActivityNet
