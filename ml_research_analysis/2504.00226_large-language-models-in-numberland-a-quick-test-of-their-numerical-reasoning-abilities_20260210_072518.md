# Large Language Models in Numberland: A Quick Test of Their Numerical Reasoning Abilities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.00226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00226
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: LLMs show strong performance on deterministic arithmetic tasks (74-95%) but significant degradation in trial-and-error search problems like the 24 Game (10-73%).

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates numerical reasoning in large language models using a 100-problem benchmark called "Numberland," which tests basic operations, advanced calculations, prime-checking, and the 24 game. Five LLM agents (OpenAI o1/o1-mini, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Anthropic Claude) were assessed. While models scored 74-95% on deterministic tasks, performance dropped sharply to 10-73% in the 24 game, which requires trial-and-error search. The results reveal a fragile number sense in LLMs despite deterministic strengths, highlighting persistent limits in trial-and-error reasoning and state-tracking during extended problem-solving chains.

## Method Summary
The study tested five LLM agents on 100 numerical reasoning problems across four categories: basic operations, advanced calculations, prime checking, and the 24 game. Problems were presented through six sequential prompts via web interfaces over seven days. Models scoring below 80% on basic operations were excluded. Binary scoring was used (1=correct, 0=incorrect), with decimal fractions requiring first two digits correct for full credit. Average accuracy was calculated over three trials for each category and overall. The 24 game problems required using four numbers and basic operations to reach 24, testing the models' ability to perform informed trial-and-error search.

## Key Results
- Models scored 74-95% on deterministic tasks (basic operations, advanced calculations, prime checking)
- Performance dropped to 10-73% in the 24 game requiring trial-and-error search
- OpenAI o1 achieved the highest 24 game score at 73%, but accuracy fell to 27% on 25 harder problems
- Common errors included assuming no solution existed, breaking game rules (reusing/omitting numbers), and miscalculating expressions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** LLMs exhibit a dichotomy where deterministic algorithmic execution remains robust, but performance collapses when informed trial-and-error search is required.
- **Mechanism:** Models effectively retrieve or chain known algorithms for deterministic tasks but lack the heuristic "number sense" to prune the vast combinatorial space of the 24 Game, leading to search bottlenecks.
- **Core assumption:** The performance drop is intrinsic to the model's reasoning architecture rather than solely a lack of knowledge about game rules.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "In the 24 game, which needs trial-and-error search, performance dropped to 10–73%."
  - [section 5.2] "All agents scored between 74% and 95% on the first three sets, whereas the agents scored between 11% and 73% in the games of 24."
  - [corpus] "Exposing Numeracy Gaps" confirms that basic arithmetic retrieval often fails in LLMs, which compounds when sequential retrieval is required for search.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Elementary numerical skills degrade when embedded in extended reasoning chains, suggesting a lack of compositional stability.
- **Mechanism:** As the reasoning chain lengthens, the probability of "hallucinating" a valid state increases, indicating fragile state-tracking.
- **Core assumption:** Models possess isolated skills but lose fidelity when managing the working memory load of multi-step puzzles.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5.3] "A common mistake was assuming a solution did not exist... [and] frequently broke the rules... mainly in two ways: (1) not using all the numbers and (2) using some numbers more than once."
  - [section 6] "The errors strongly suggest a fragile number sense that breaks under increased informational load during long chains of reasoning."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** LLMs fail to replicate human "bounded rationality" (using heuristics to satisfice), instead relying on probabilistic next-token prediction which is inefficient for navigating large number spaces.
- **Mechanism:** Humans use intuition (e.g., "look for factors of 24") to reduce search depth. LLMs lack this hierarchical sub-goal generation, attempting solutions via less efficient path sampling.
- **Core assumption:** The "number sense" described is analogous to a search-heuristic optimization missing from current transformer architectures.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2] "Complex problem solving can be described as a search for paths... humans demonstrate rationality bounded by their computational limits... using a set of heuristics."
  - [section 6] "The sharp performance drop... suggests that current LLMs lack the hierarchical reasoning capabilities that humans possess in punching above their weight."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Number Sense**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper defines this as an "abstract understanding of numbers" essential for guiding search heuristics.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain *why* knowing that 24 is divisible by 3 helps a human prune the search tree in the 24 Game, and how an LLM might miss this?

- **Concept:** **Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic Search**
  - **Why needed here:** The core finding relies on the contrast between tasks with fixed solution paths and tasks requiring exploration.
  - **Quick check question:** Is "Check if 7 is prime" a deterministic search or a trial-and-error search in the context of this paper?

- **Concept:** **Bounded Rationality**
  - **Why needed here:** This frames the discussion of human vs. AI efficiency, explaining why humans succeed with limited compute while LLMs struggle despite massive resources.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the paper suggest LLMs fail because they *cannot* calculate, or because they cannot efficiently select *which* calculation to perform next?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Numberland (4 sets: Basic Ops, Advanced Ops, Primes, 24 Game) -> Agents (o1, Claude, Gemini, etc.) -> Error Taxonomy (Rule breaking, Miscalculation, False Negative)
- **Critical path:**
  1. **Inclusion Screening:** Run Set 1 (Basic Ops); discard models scoring < 80%
  2. **Capability Mapping:** Run Sets 2 & 3 (Advanced/Primes) to establish deterministic reasoning proficiency
  3. **Stress Test:** Run Set 4 (24 Game) to probe search limits and state tracking
  4. **Failure Analysis:** Classify errors (e.g., "unused numbers" vs. "calculation error")
- **Design tradeoffs:** Prioritizes explainability (targeted, low-level tasks) over generality (large benchmarks like MATH), accepting small sample size (100 problems) for granular error visibility
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **The "False Negative" Hallucination:** Model claims "No solution exists" when one does (most common in 24 Game)
  - **State Drift:** Model reuses numbers or drops numbers from the set mid-reasoning
  - **Precision Loss:** Failures on fractional exponents or unusual log bases
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Replication:** Run the "Numberland" set on a target model (e.g., GPT-4o vs. o1) to replicate the 74-95% vs. 10-73% gap
  2. **Prompt Sensitivity:** Test if "Tree of Thoughts" prompting reduces the "False Negative" rate in the 24 Game
  3. **State-Tracking Intervention:** Force the model to output a "Remaining Numbers" list after every operation to see if "State Drift" errors decrease

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) successfully identify specific neural circuits or features that cause the breakdown of elementary skills during extended reasoning chains?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly suggest using MI to reverse-engineer the "fragile number sense" and "breakdowns of reasoning chains" to find "building blocks" involved in reasoning errors.
- **Why unresolved:** Current MI approaches face scalability challenges and lack automation, making it difficult to map complex behaviors to specific neurons or circuits.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The identification of specific motifs or circuits in an LLM that, when intervened upon, predictably fix or replicate the calculation errors and rule-breaking observed in the 24 game.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do the specific limitations found in the 24 game—specifically the inability to perform informed trial-and-error search—generalize to other computationally complex tasks (e.g., NP-Hard problems)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that results need to be replicated in "larger sets of computationally complex tasks" and suggest candidates like Cryptoarithmetic and synthetic number problems.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study is limited to a "Numberland" test of 100 problems; it is unclear if this "fragile number sense" is a universal trait or specific to the 24 game mechanics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Testing a broader set of LLMs on established NP-Hard benchmarks (e.g., Sudoku, Graph Coloring) and observing similar failure rates in search-heavy phases compared to deterministic phases.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the improved performance of reasoning models (like o1) over standard models stem from a genuine improvement in "number sense" or merely from increased computational resources allocated to search?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper notes that reasoning models perform better but suggests their "superiority... seems to stem primarily from increases in computational resources rather than improved number senses," citing increased error rates in longer chains.
- **Why unresolved:** The internal reasoning processes of proprietary models are opaque; it is difficult to distinguish between better heuristics (sense) and brute-force computation (search).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis showing whether reasoning models utilize fewer steps or more efficient heuristics (indicating sense) versus simply generating more reasoning paths to find solutions.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (100 problems) may not capture full variability in LLM performance
- Use of only free/public web interfaces for some models introduces potential variability
- Model versions beyond high-level names are unspecified, which could affect reproducibility
- Benchmark focuses on elemental skills rather than compositional complexity, potentially missing higher-order reasoning failures

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Deterministic task performance (74-95% accuracy on Sets 1-3) and the stark contrast with 24 Game performance (10-73%)
- **Medium Confidence**: Error taxonomy and the characterization of "fragile number sense" based on observed failure patterns
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that the performance gap stems from a lack of search heuristics rather than pure knowledge gaps, though this requires further validation

## Next Checks
1. **Version Control**: Repeat the experiment using explicitly versioned models and controlled sampling parameters (temperature, top-p) to isolate the effect of model updates
2. **Tool Augmentation**: Test whether enabling code interpreters or external solvers for the 24 Game eliminates the performance gap, distinguishing between internal search failure and lack of computational resources
3. **Hierarchical Prompting**: Implement a "Tree of Thoughts" or similar hierarchical prompting strategy to test if explicit sub-goal generation (e.g., "Find factors of 24 first") mitigates the search bottleneck in the 24 Game
