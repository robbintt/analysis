# The Sample Complexity of Online Strategic Decision Making with Information Asymmetry and Knowledge Transportability

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.09940
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09940
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** Achieves $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity for $\epsilon$-optimal policy in strategic MDPs with information asymmetry

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles online strategic decision making where agents act based on private information while a principal learns optimal policies. The key challenge is information asymmetry combined with knowledge transportability across source and target populations. The authors propose a model-based algorithm using nonparametric instrumental variables to handle unobserved agent types while enabling transfer learning. The method achieves optimal sample complexity by constructing confidence sets for rewards and transitions, then applying optimistic planning under the target distribution.

## Method Summary
The approach uses model-based optimistic planning with NPIV for identification. The algorithm collects trajectories from a source population where agents act strategically, then constructs high-probability confidence sets for rewards and transitions using minimax estimation. These confidence sets account for confounding from unobserved agent types by treating $(s,a)$ pairs as instruments. The algorithm then aggregates models under the target distribution and selects the optimistic model to define the next exploration policy. The NPIV estimation handles the ill-posedness of inferring rewards and transitions from confounded data while enabling knowledge transfer between populations.

## Key Results
- Achieves $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity for $\epsilon$-optimal policy, which is tight up to logarithmic factors
- Theoretical analysis identifies conditions for causal identification under non-i.i.d. data from strategic agents
- Characterizes impact of distributional shift through multiplicative transfer term $C_f$
- Analyzes how ill-posedness and Eluder dimension affect sample complexity
- Proves optimality regarding $\epsilon$ dependence with explicit problem-dependent parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging instrumental variables to break the confounding between agent types and observed outcomes. By treating $(s,a)$ pairs as instruments, the algorithm can identify the causal effect of actions on rewards and transitions despite unobserved types. The minimax estimation framework handles the ill-posed nature of this inverse problem while maintaining statistical efficiency. Knowledge transfer is enabled through the explicit characterization of distributional shift between source and target populations.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Strategic MDPs:** Reinforcement learning framework where agents act strategically based on private information
   *Why needed:* Captures realistic multi-agent decision making with information asymmetry
   *Quick check:* Verify agent policies depend on private types

2. **Nonparametric Instrumental Variables (NPIV):** Statistical technique for causal inference with unobserved confounders
   *Why needed:* Handles confounding from unobserved agent types
   *Quick check:* Instrument strength correlates with outcome

3. **Minimax Estimation:** Optimization framework for estimating parameters under worst-case assumptions
   *Why needed:* Provides robust estimation for ill-posed inverse problems
   *Quick check:* Convergence of projected MSE

4. **Knowledge Transfer Theory:** Framework for characterizing sample complexity under distribution shift
   *Why needed:* Enables learning from source population to apply to target population
   *Quick check:* Transfer term $C_f$ scales with distribution distance

5. **Optimistic Planning:** Algorithm design principle that explores by assuming best-case outcomes within confidence sets
   *Why needed:* Balances exploration and exploitation in uncertain environments
   *Quick check:* Regret grows sublinearly with episodes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Source Data Collection -> NPIV Estimation -> Confidence Set Construction -> Optimistic Planning -> Target Policy

**Critical Path:** The most time-consuming component is the NPIV minimax estimation, which requires solving non-convex optimization problems. This bottleneck determines the overall runtime and must be carefully implemented.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The algorithm trades computational complexity (solving minimax problems) for statistical efficiency (handling ill-posedness and enabling transfer). Using finite function classes simplifies optimization but may limit expressiveness.

**Failure Signatures:** NPIV estimation diverges when instruments are weak or function classes are misspecified. Large $C_f$ values indicate distribution shift too large for effective transfer.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Implement Algorithm 2 on a linear strategic MDP with known ground truth
2. Test NPIV estimator convergence with increasing sample size
3. Measure regret growth rate on simulated strategic environments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on NPIV estimation requiring strong assumptions about instrument strength and ill-posedness bounds
- Theoretical analysis assumes known target distribution or access to estimator, but practical implementation is not addressed
- Uses finite-cardinality function classes which may limit expressiveness in complex strategic environments

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Sample complexity bound $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ and optimality claim
- **Medium Confidence:** Theoretical identification conditions under non-i.i.d. data
- **Medium Confidence:** Characterization of knowledge transfer impact through multiplicative term

## Next Checks
1. Implement Algorithm 2 on a linear strategic MDP with known ground truth to verify minimax estimator convergence and monitor projected MSE

2. Systematically vary distance between source and target distributions to measure degradation in learning rate and empirically validate multiplicative transfer term prediction

3. Quantify correlation between instruments $(s,a)$ and outcomes $e$ across different strategic environments to establish conditions for NPIV stability versus breakdown
