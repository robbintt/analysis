core_contribution: The paper introduces CARE-RAG, a benchmark that evaluates whether
  large language models can reason with retrieved evidence in clinical contexts. Using
  Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines, it tests model responses under three
  retrieval conditions (correct, noisy, and misleading) and three reasoning levels
  (none, light, heavy).

# CARE-RAG - Clinical Assessment and Reasoning in RAG

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.15994
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15994
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: CARE-RAG benchmark reveals models can retrieve correct information but often fail to reason with it in clinical contexts

## Executive Summary
CARE-RAG is a novel benchmark that evaluates large language models' ability to reason with retrieved evidence in clinical settings. Using Written Exposure Therapy guidelines, the benchmark tests model responses across three retrieval conditions (correct, noisy, and misleading) and three reasoning levels (none, light, heavy). The study found that while model accuracy on multiple-choice questions was generally high across 20 tested models, reasoning fidelity—measured by whether answers were grounded in context—varied significantly. Models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and BioMistral-7B demonstrated stronger context sensitivity, highlighting the gap between information retrieval and clinical reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The CARE-RAG benchmark evaluates clinical reasoning by presenting models with multiple-choice questions derived from Written Exposure Therapy guidelines. Models are tested under three retrieval conditions: correct context, noisy context with irrelevant information, and misleading context with contradictory information. Three reasoning levels are assessed: no reasoning (direct answer), light reasoning (simple inference), and heavy reasoning (complex inference requiring multiple steps). The benchmark measures both accuracy (correctness of answer) and reasoning fidelity (whether the answer is properly grounded in the provided context).

## Key Results
- High accuracy on multiple-choice questions across all 20 tested models
- Significant variation in reasoning fidelity between models
- Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and BioMistral-7B showed stronger context sensitivity
- Models often retrieve correct information but fail to properly reason with it

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CARE-RAG benchmark works by systematically testing how models handle information retrieval and reasoning under controlled conditions. By varying the quality and nature of the context provided, the benchmark isolates whether models can distinguish relevant from irrelevant information and properly ground their reasoning in the provided evidence rather than their pre-trained knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- **Clinical Reasoning**: The ability to apply medical knowledge to specific patient scenarios - needed to evaluate models in realistic healthcare contexts, quick check: can the model explain its reasoning path
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: The process of retrieving external knowledge before generating responses - needed to test how models integrate retrieved evidence, quick check: does the model reference specific context elements
- **Context Sensitivity**: The model's ability to adapt responses based on provided context rather than general knowledge - needed to ensure clinical safety, quick check: does the model's answer change appropriately with different contexts

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Question -> Context Retrieval -> Model Processing -> Answer Generation -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Question input → Context selection (correct/noisy/misleading) → Model inference → Answer output → Reasoning fidelity assessment

**Design Tradeoffs**: Multiple-choice format enables quantitative comparison but may not capture full clinical decision complexity; limited to single guideline may reduce generalizability; controlled conditions enable isolation of reasoning capabilities but may not reflect real-world variability

**Failure Signatures**: High accuracy with low reasoning fidelity indicates models may be guessing or using pre-trained knowledge rather than reasoning with provided evidence; sensitivity to context manipulation reveals robustness issues

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test model performance on single-answer vs. multiple-answer questions within the same guideline
2. Vary the length and complexity of the context provided while keeping questions constant
3. Evaluate human expert agreement with model answers to establish ground truth reasoning quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on single clinical guideline (Written Exposure Therapy) may limit generalizability to other medical domains
- Multiple-choice format may not fully capture complexity of real-world clinical decision-making
- Limited scope (20 models, single guideline) may not generalize across all clinical contexts or model architectures

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Finding that model accuracy is high while reasoning fidelity is low is well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium confidence**: Benchmarking framework is sound but limited scope means results may not generalize
- **Medium confidence**: Conclusion about need for improved prompt design and guardrails is reasonable but requires further validation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the benchmark across multiple clinical guidelines and medical specialties to assess domain generalizability
2. Implement human-in-the-loop validation where clinicians evaluate model responses for clinical appropriateness beyond factual accuracy
3. Test the benchmark with real-time clinical documentation to evaluate performance under production conditions with dynamic retrieval contexts
