# Zero-Shot Belief: A Hard Problem for LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.08777
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08777
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** Hybrid approach achieves 72.0% F1 (full predictions) and 77.6% F1 (author predictions) on FactBank

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenging problem of zero-shot belief detection using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a hybrid system that combines a fine-tuned DeBERTa event tagger with LLM-based source and belief labeling to predict the factuality of events from both authors and nested sources in the FactBank corpus. Their approach sets new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating that LLMs can effectively handle this complex task despite struggling with nested beliefs and event identification. The work also shows promising multilingual generalization on the Italian ModaFact corpus.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two LLM-based approaches for zero-shot belief detection: a unified end-to-end system and a hybrid system. The hybrid approach uses a fine-tuned DeBERTa model for event identification and argument extraction, while LLM-based prompts handle source and belief labeling. They evaluate multiple open-source (DeepSeek, LLaMA-3.3), closed-source (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet), and reasoning-based (o1, o3-mini) LLMs. The system predicts factuality at the source level, then aggregates to author-level predictions, and finally to full predictions across all events. The approach is tested on FactBank and demonstrates multilingual capabilities on the Italian ModaFact corpus.

## Key Results
- Hybrid approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on FactBank: 72.0% F1 for full predictions and 77.6% F1 for author predictions
- Strong multilingual generalization demonstrated on Italian ModaFact corpus
- Error analysis reveals LLMs struggle particularly with nested beliefs and event identification
- Performance varies significantly across different LLM models, with reasoning-based models showing advantages in certain scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach works by decomposing the complex belief detection task into specialized components. The DeBERTa event tagger handles the structured prediction of events and arguments with high precision, while LLMs leverage their broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities for the more contextual task of source and belief labeling. This decomposition allows each component to focus on its strengths - structured prediction for DeBERTa and contextual understanding for LLMs - resulting in better overall performance than either approach alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Factuality detection**: Understanding whether events reported in text are presented as facts, possibilities, or negations - needed because belief detection requires distinguishing between different levels of certainty
- **Nested belief structures**: Handling beliefs within beliefs (e.g., when a source attributes a statement to another source) - needed because real-world text often contains multiple layers of attribution
- **Zero-shot learning**: Making predictions without task-specific training examples - needed because belief detection requires handling diverse linguistic expressions and domain-specific knowledge
- **Cross-linguistic generalization**: Applying models trained on one language to another - needed because belief detection patterns often transfer across languages despite different surface forms
- **Source attribution**: Identifying who is responsible for a given statement or belief - needed because factuality depends on both what is said and who said it
- **Event-argument extraction**: Identifying events and their participants in text - needed as a prerequisite for determining which entities are involved in belief statements

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** DeBERTa event tagger -> LLM source labeling -> LLM belief labeling -> Aggregation module

**Critical Path:** Event extraction (DeBERTa) -> Source identification (LLM) -> Belief classification (LLM) -> Aggregation (rule-based)

**Design Tradeoffs:** The authors chose to use a fine-tuned DeBERTa for event extraction rather than relying solely on LLMs to ensure consistent and accurate event identification, which is crucial for downstream belief detection. This creates a hybrid system that balances the precision of specialized models with the flexibility of LLMs.

**Failure Signatures:** The system struggles particularly with nested beliefs where multiple layers of attribution exist, and with event identification when events are expressed through complex linguistic constructions or implicit references.

**First Experiments:** 1) Compare DeBERTa-only event extraction against LLM-based approaches on the same data, 2) Test different LLM prompting strategies (zero-shot vs. few-shot) for belief classification, 3) Evaluate the impact of different aggregation strategies on final performance metrics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The authors acknowledge that while their hybrid approach achieves strong performance on FactBank and ModaFact, significant uncertainties remain regarding its robustness across different domains and document types. The generalizability to other factuality detection tasks with different annotation schemes or linguistic phenomena is unclear. Additionally, the error analysis reveals that LLMs struggle with nested beliefs, but does not fully explain whether this limitation stems from model capabilities or inherent difficulties in the annotation scheme itself.

## Limitations
- Performance varies significantly across different LLM models, with no clear winner across all scenarios
- Limited evaluation on languages other than English and Italian, raising questions about cross-linguistic generalization
- The error analysis does not fully distinguish between model limitations and annotation scheme difficulties
- No ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component to overall performance
- Results may not generalize to domains beyond news articles and similar text types

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in state-of-the-art claims for FactBank results (72.0% F1 full predictions, 77.6% F1 author predictions)
- **Medium confidence** in multilingual generalization claims due to limited evaluation on only Italian
- **Medium confidence** in comparative LLM performance analysis due to lack of isolation of model vs. prompting effects

## Next Checks
1. Test the hybrid approach on out-of-domain datasets with different event types and source structures to assess generalizability beyond news articles
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the contribution of each component (DeBERTa event tagger vs. LLM belief labeling) to overall performance
3. Evaluate the impact of different prompting strategies and few-shot examples on LLM performance to determine whether zero-shot results can be improved with minimal supervision
