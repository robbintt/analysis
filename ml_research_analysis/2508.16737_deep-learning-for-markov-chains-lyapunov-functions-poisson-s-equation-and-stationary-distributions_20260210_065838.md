# Deep Learning for Markov Chains: Lyapunov Functions, Poisson's Equation, and Stationary Distributions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.16737
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16737
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** Neural network framework for solving Lyapunov functions, Poisson's equation, and stationary distributions via SGD on integral equations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a deep learning framework for solving fundamental integral equations in Markov chain analysis, including Lyapunov function construction, Poisson's equation, and stationary distribution estimation. The method uses neural networks trained via stochastic gradient descent to satisfy integral equations derived from first-transition analysis, employing a double-sampling trick to obtain unbiased gradient estimators. The approach is effective even for Markov chains on non-compact state spaces, with theoretical analysis establishing finite-sample convergence rates.

## Method Summary
The method trains neural networks to approximate solutions to integral equations by minimizing a loss function that enforces the equation constraints. A double-sampling technique provides unbiased gradient estimates, enabling stochastic optimization. The framework handles Lyapunov functions, Poisson equation solutions, and stationary distributions through appropriate loss formulations. Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees for H"older continuous functions.

## Key Results
- Neural network framework successfully computes Lyapunov functions, Poisson equation solutions, and stationary distributions
- Double-sampling trick provides unbiased gradient estimates for SGD training
- Theoretical convergence rate of O(n^{-2s/(2s+d)}) established for H"older continuous functions
- Method effective for Markov chains on non-compact state spaces
- Numerical experiments validate approach on queueing models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages the universal approximation properties of neural networks combined with stochastic optimization to solve integral equations that characterize key Markov chain properties. By formulating these properties as integral equations and using first-transition analysis, the framework can learn the required functions directly from samples. The double-sampling trick ensures unbiased gradient estimates despite the expectation operators in the integral equations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Integral equations in Markov chains** - Why needed: Fundamental to characterizing stationary distributions and solution to Poisson equation; Quick check: Verify understanding of first-transition formula
- **Lyapunov functions for stability** - Why needed: Essential for analyzing transient behavior and stability of Markov chains; Quick check: Confirm ability to verify Lyapunov drift conditions
- **Double-sampling technique** - Why needed: Provides unbiased gradient estimates for SGD despite nested expectations; Quick check: Understand variance reduction compared to single sampling
- **H"older continuity** - Why needed: Regularity condition required for convergence rate analysis; Quick check: Verify understanding of H"older exponent implications
- **First-transition analysis** - Why needed: Basis for deriving integral equations from Markov chain properties; Quick check: Confirm ability to derive integral equations from transition kernels

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Markov chain samples -> Neural network parameterization -> Loss function (integral equation) -> SGD with double-sampling -> Trained function

**Critical path:** Sample generation → Network evaluation → Loss computation → Gradient estimation → Parameter update

**Design tradeoffs:** The double-sampling trick increases computational cost per iteration but provides unbiased gradients, enabling proper convergence. Neural network architecture must balance expressiveness with generalization.

**Failure signatures:** High variance in gradient estimates indicates insufficient sampling; poor convergence suggests inadequate network capacity or inappropriate learning rate.

**First experiments:**
1. Test on simple symmetric random walk with known Lyapunov function
2. Verify double-sampling gradient estimates on a small finite state space
3. Compare convergence rates for different network architectures on a basic Poisson equation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Finite-sample convergence rate analysis relies on regularity assumptions that may not hold for complex chains
- Double-sampling trick could suffer from high variance affecting practical convergence
- Scalability to very high-dimensional state spaces remains untested
- Performance on strongly transient chains not evaluated

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Neural network framework can approximate solutions to Lyapunov functions, Poisson equations, and stationary distributions | High |
| Stochastic gradient descent with double-sampling provides computationally efficient solutions | Medium |
| O(n^{-2s/(2s+d)}) convergence rate holds uniformly across all Markov chain classes | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the algorithm on a simple random walk with known analytical solutions to verify the convergence rate empirically.
2. Conduct variance analysis of the gradient estimates from the double-sampling trick across different Markov chain structures.
3. Evaluate performance on a high-dimensional queueing model (e.g., 10+ dimensions) to assess scalability limitations.
