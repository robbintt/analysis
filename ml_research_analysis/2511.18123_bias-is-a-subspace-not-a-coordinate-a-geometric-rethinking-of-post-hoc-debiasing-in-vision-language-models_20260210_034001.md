# Bias Is a Subspace, Not a Coordinate: A Geometric Rethinking of Post-hoc Debiasing in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18123
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18123
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Subspace Projection Debiasing (SPD) reduces demographic disparities by 18.5% average across four fairness metrics while maintaining or slightly improving task performance

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the conventional assumption that bias in vision-language models (VLMs) resides in specific embedding coordinates. Through systematic experiments, the authors demonstrate that bias is distributed across low-rank linear subspaces rather than localized dimensions. They propose Subspace Projection Debiasing (SPD), a geometrically principled method that removes attribute-specific information by projecting embeddings onto the null space of learned bias directions, then reinjects a neutral mean to preserve semantic fidelity. SPD consistently outperforms coordinate-wise debiasing methods across three downstream tasks, reducing demographic disparities while maintaining or slightly improving task performance.

## Method Summary
SPD identifies bias subspaces through Iterative Null-space Projection (INLP), which iteratively trains linear classifiers to extract discriminative directions, then projects embeddings onto the null space of these directions. A Random Forest classifier identifies low-confidence samples to compute a neutral mean, which is reinjected after projection to preserve semantic information. The method operates on frozen VLM embeddings and removes multiple bias directions simultaneously, addressing the limitation of coordinate-wise approaches that leave residual bias due to feature entanglement.

## Key Results
- Bias information in VLM embeddings is distributed across subspaces rather than specific coordinates
- SPD achieves 18.5% average improvement across four fairness metrics compared to best baseline
- Coordinate-wise debiasing methods like SFID suffer from feature entanglement and poor cross-dataset generalization
- SPD maintains or slightly improves task performance while reducing demographic disparities across three downstream tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bias information in VLM embeddings is distributed across low-rank linear subspaces rather than localized to specific coordinate dimensions.
- Mechanism: The paper demonstrates that sensitive attributes (gender, race, age) can be predicted from multiple distributed directions in embedding space. INLP iteratively trains linear classifiers to identify discriminative directions, extracts orthonormal bases via QR decomposition, and constructs projection matrices that remove these directions while preserving orthogonal components.
- Core assumption: Sensitive attribute information is at least partially linearly decodable from frozen VLM embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "bias is not localized to specific embedding dimensions but is instead distributed across low-rank linear subspaces"
  - [Section 3.2, Table 1] Top-100 dimensions for age/gender/race show 20-37 pairwise overlap, demonstrating shared dimensions across attributes
  - [Section 3.4, Table 3] Replacing 100/512 coordinates via SFID reduces attribute prediction accuracy by less than 1%, leaving substantial residual bias
  - [corpus] Weak direct validation; related work (FairImagen, DetoxAI) addresses bias mitigation but does not specifically confirm subspace vs. coordinate structure
- Break condition: If attribute information is encoded non-linearly or in extremely high-rank manifolds, linear subspace projection would leave significant residual bias.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Orthogonal projection followed by neutral reinjection removes bias while preserving task-relevant semantics.
- Mechanism: After projecting embeddings onto the null space of bias directions (Equation 6), the method reinjects the projection of a neutral mean computed from low-confidence samples along the removed subspace (Equation 7). This recenters embeddings without reintroducing attribute-discriminative variance.
- Core assumption: Low-confidence samples from a Random Forest classifier provide a reasonable neutral baseline that captures on-manifold semantics without strong attribute correlations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "reinserts a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity"
  - [Section 4.3, Equations 6-7] Formal definition of projection and reinjection operations
  - [Section 6.3, Table 6] Ablation shows reinjection improves accuracy (e.g., CLIP ResNet50: 50.16→51.44) with minimal fairness impact
  - [corpus] Not directly validated in neighboring papers
- Break condition: If low-confidence samples do not adequately represent neutral semantics or contain systematic biases, reinjection could reintroduce bias or fail to prevent semantic degradation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Subspace-level operations generalize better across datasets and attributes than coordinate-level interventions.
- Mechanism: Learned bias subspaces capture continuous geometric structures that remain relatively stable across distribution shifts, whereas coordinate indices drift significantly between datasets. The projection operation is differentiable and architecture-agnostic.
- Core assumption: The bias subspace learned on one dataset transfers meaningfully to embeddings from different distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "18.5% average improvement across four fairness metrics" compared to best baseline
  - [Section 3.3, Table 2] Cross-dataset dimension overlap (FairFace vs. FACET) is only 24-40 for m=50-100, showing coordinate drift
  - [Section 6.2] SPD consistently outperforms baselines across three tasks with different datasets (FACET, Flickr30K, generation benchmarks)
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Data Matters Most" emphasizes training-data source as key factor, suggesting subspace transfer may depend on data distribution similarity
- Break condition: If target distribution has fundamentally different bias geometry (e.g., different cultural contexts, intersectional attributes), learned subspaces may not transfer effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear subspaces and orthogonal projection
  - Why needed here: The entire method relies on identifying bias directions, constructing orthonormal bases, and projecting onto null spaces. Without understanding subspace geometry, the mechanism remains opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given a matrix U whose rows form an orthonormal basis for a subspace, what does (I - U^T U) compute?

- Concept: Iterative Null-space Projection (INLP)
  - Why needed here: INLP is the core algorithm for extracting bias directions. Understanding its iterative refinement process clarifies why multiple projection steps are needed for complete bias removal.
  - Quick check question: Why does INLP iterate rather than extract all discriminative directions in a single classifier training step?

- Concept: VLM embedding spaces and multimodal alignment
  - Why needed here: The method operates on frozen embeddings from models like CLIP. Understanding how image and text embeddings are aligned via contrastive learning helps explain why debiasing one modality can affect cross-modal tasks.
  - Quick check question: In CLIP-style models, what objective function encourages image and text embeddings of the same concept to cluster together?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. **Bias Subspace Identifier**: Trains T iterative logistic regression classifiers on labeled embeddings; extracts orthonormal bases via QR decomposition; concatenates into final subspace U
  2. **Low-Confidence Mean Estimator**: Trains Random Forest on same labels; identifies bottom τ% confidence samples; computes neutral mean x̄_low
  3. **Projection Module (inference)**: Applies null-space projection (I - U^T U) to query embeddings; reinjects U^T (U x̄_low)

- Critical path: Labeled validation data → INLP training (T iterations) → subspace U extraction ‖ Random Forest training → low-confidence selection → neutral mean → frozen until inference

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of projection directions (r): Higher r removes more bias but risks semantic degradation. Paper finds r=5 optimal for downstream tasks (Table 8).
  - Confidence threshold (τ): Lower τ uses fewer "more neutral" samples but may increase variance. Paper uses τ=0.7 (Table 7).
  - Projection depth vs. reinjection balance: Pure projection preserves fairness but loses accuracy; reinjection restores semantics with minimal fairness cost (Table 6).

- Failure signatures:
  - **Excessive projection (r>10)**: Target attribute removal succeeds but non-target attributes degrade significantly (Table 3, r=10 column)
  - **No reinjection**: Fairness maintained but task accuracy drops 0.5-1.3 percentage points (Table 6)
  - **Cross-domain transfer failure**: If source and target datasets have different bias structures, fairness gains may not materialize

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Probe-based validation**: Train linear classifiers on SPD-debiased embeddings for the target attribute. If accuracy remains high, projection depth r is insufficient; if accuracy drops to random baseline, bias removal is complete.
  2. **Collateral attribute check**: After debiasing for attribute A, probe for attributes B and C. Large accuracy drops indicate over-projection causing semantic entanglement damage.
  3. **Ablation without reinjection**: Run inference with projection only (Equation 6, no Equation 7). Compare downstream task accuracy to full method to quantify semantic preservation contribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** To what extent does bias reside in non-linear manifolds that linear subspace projection methods like SPD fail to remove?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The methodology relies on Iterative Null-space Projection (INLP) (Section 4.2), which guarantees the removal of *linearly* decodable bias directions but does not address non-linear dependencies.
- **Why unresolved:** The evaluation uses linear probes to demonstrate efficacy, leaving the potential for non-linearly encoded bias preservation unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Testing debiased embeddings with non-linear classifiers (e.g., kernel SVMs or MLPs) to determine if sensitive attributes can still be recovered.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the number of projection directions ($r$) be determined automatically to optimize the trade-off between semantic preservation and debiasing completeness?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 6.1 identifies a "clear trade-off" where increasing $r$ removes more bias but degrades semantic performance, yet the paper manually fixes $r=5$ for downstream tasks (Section 5.2).
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not propose a theoretical or data-driven criterion for selecting $r$, relying instead on empirical observation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A mechanism that adaptively selects $r$ based on the geometry of the embedding space (e.g., variance thresholds) that matches or outperforms manual tuning.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does simultaneous projection of multiple attribute subspaces affect the structural integrity of the embedding space and intersectional fairness?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 3.2 demonstrates "severe entanglement" where dimensions for Age, Gender, and Race overlap significantly.
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper shows that removing one attribute's subspace has "minimal collateral impact" on others (Section 6.1), it does not extensively analyze the cumulative degradation or effectiveness when applying SPD to multiple attributes at once.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments applying SPD to remove multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously and evaluating performance on intersectional subgroups.

## Limitations

- The method assumes bias information is linearly decodable from VLM embeddings, potentially missing non-linear bias patterns
- Cross-dataset generalization is demonstrated but limited to CLIP-based embeddings; transfer to other VLM architectures remains untested
- The neutral mean reinjection mechanism lacks rigorous validation and may reintroduce subtle demographic correlations

## Confidence

- High confidence: Bias is distributed across subspaces rather than individual coordinates (Section 3.1-3.2 experimental evidence is direct and compelling)
- Medium confidence: Subspace projection + neutral reinjection preserves semantics while removing bias (downstream task improvements support this, but ablation studies have small effect sizes)
- Medium confidence: SPD generalizes better than coordinate-wise methods (cross-dataset results show consistent trends but sample sizes are modest)

## Next Checks

1. **Non-linear bias probe**: Apply a small MLP classifier to SPD-debiased embeddings for target attributes. If accuracy remains above random baseline, linear projection leaves residual bias requiring non-linear removal methods.

2. **Bias subspace stability**: Extract bias subspaces from FACET, then apply to FairFace embeddings from a different time period or geographic region. Measure whether fairness gains persist when demographic distributions shift.

3. **Intersectional bias analysis**: After debiasing for individual attributes (age, gender, race), measure bias in intersectional groups (e.g., young Asian females). This tests whether subspace operations adequately handle multi-attribute correlations.
