# A Multi-Axial Mindset for Ontology Design Lessons from Wikidata's Polyhierarchical Structure

- Primary result: Wikidata's polyhierarchical ontology design enables multi-axial classification, but current usage reveals incomplete axis coverage

## Executive Summary
Wikidata's polyhierarchical ontology design enables multi-axial classification, allowing entities to be classified along several orthogonal and overlapping axes (e.g., abstract/concrete, individual/collective) simultaneously. This contrasts with traditional foundational ontologies that enforce a single, exhaustive primary split. The paper shows that while Wikidata's architecture supports modular and scalable ontology construction, current usage reveals incomplete axis coverage—only about 4% of classes are typed along the abstract/concrete axis, and fewer than 0.002% of classes are classified along all five examined axes. Multi-axial classification is structurally feasible but underutilized, with only 61 classes typed along five axes. The analysis suggests that expanding and documenting primary splits under `entity`, with formal mapping to external ontologies, would enhance Wikidata's ontological coherence and interoperability.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive analysis of Wikidata's polyhierarchical structure by examining the coverage and usage of five primary classification axes: abstract/concrete, individual/collective, human/non-human animal, female/male, and organization/individual. They quantified axis adoption rates, mapped classes to external ontologies, and evaluated the completeness of multi-axial classification across Wikidata's knowledge graph. The study combined structural analysis with empirical metrics to assess the practical implementation of multi-axial ontology design.

## Key Results
- Wikidata's polyhierarchical structure enables entities to be classified along multiple orthogonal axes simultaneously
- Only about 4% of classes are typed along the abstract/concrete axis, and fewer than 0.002% along all five examined axes
- Only 61 classes are classified along five axes, demonstrating significant underutilization of multi-axial classification capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works because Wikidata's polyhierarchical structure allows entities to be classified along multiple orthogonal axes simultaneously, rather than being constrained to a single hierarchical path. This enables more nuanced and flexible ontology construction that can capture complex relationships and multiple classification perspectives within a single knowledge graph.

## Foundational Learning
- **Polyhierarchical classification**: Allows entities to have multiple parent classes across different axes - needed for representing complex real-world relationships
- **Multi-axial ontology design**: Enables classification along orthogonal dimensions rather than single hierarchical paths - needed for capturing nuanced distinctions
- **Modular ontology construction**: Supports independent development of classification axes - needed for scalable and maintainable ontology evolution
- **Quick check**: Verify that entities can be classified along multiple axes without creating logical contradictions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Entity -> Primary Axes -> Classifications -> External Ontology Mappings

**Critical Path**: Entity definition → Axis selection → Class classification → Multi-axial typing → Ontology mapping

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Flexibility vs. consistency: Multi-axial classification offers flexibility but risks inconsistent usage
- Complexity vs. usability: More axes enable nuanced classification but increase cognitive load
- Modularity vs. integration: Independent axis development enables scalability but requires careful integration

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Incomplete axis coverage (only 4% of classes typed along abstract/concrete)
- Low multi-axial adoption (fewer than 0.002% of classes classified along all five axes)
- Lack of formal mappings to external ontologies

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Measure axis adoption rates across different knowledge domains
2. Test multi-axial classification consistency on a random sample of 100 classes
3. Map Wikidata classes to DOLCE and BFO ontologies to assess interoperability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent is the primacy of the "human vs. non-human animal" axis in Wikidata driven by anthropocentrism rather than logical necessity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 states, "it would be worthy to investigate if the primacy of this axis is driven by anthropocentrism."
- Why unresolved: This split resembles the arbitrary "apples/non-apples" distinction logically, yet it is widely used in legal and social contexts, making its ontological justification ambiguous.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of the usage frequency and semantic consistency of this axis against other biological taxonomic splits within the knowledge graph.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can Wikidata implement machine-readable definitions to infer class membership (e.g., typing a human as a "plumber" based on occupation properties) without generating an explosion of statements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3 notes that while some areas follow a "universals" methodology, "this facility does not exist in Wikidata," leaving the inference of classes like "plumber" unsupported.
- Why unresolved: Current architecture requires explicit "instance of" statements; defining classes via property constraints (e.g., occupation=plumber) is not functionally supported for automated typing.
- What evidence would resolve it: A prototype implementation of property-based class definitions that successfully infers instance relationships without requiring manual materialization of every statement.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Which foundational distinctions, such as the continuant/occurrent split, should be added as new axes under `entity` to enhance interoperability with formal ontologies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 10 identifies missing splits, noting "the foundational split between continuants and occurrents... is not represented under entity."
- Why unresolved: The current set of axes is described as "insufficient and poorly curated," lacking mappings to established ontologies like BFO or OBO.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical metrics showing improved alignment or reduced mapping conflicts between Wikidata and BFO-derived ontologies after the adoption of these axes.

## Limitations
- Only 4% of classes are typed along the abstract/concrete axis, indicating limited adoption of multi-axial classification
- Fewer than 0.002% of classes are classified along all five examined axes, suggesting significant underutilization
- The paper lacks data on user behavior, governance practices, and external ontology mapping efforts

## Confidence
- High: The claim that Wikidata's polyhierarchical structure enables multi-axial classification is supported by technical architecture and demonstrated analysis
- Medium: Claims about current underutilization and implications for ontological coherence are supported but lack behavioral and governance data
- Low: No claims identified as low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal study to assess whether increased documentation and tooling for multi-axial classification leads to higher adoption rates over time
2. Evaluate the consistency and correctness of multi-axial classifications across a larger, random sample of Wikidata classes to quantify the quality of current usage
3. Perform interoperability tests by mapping Wikidata's multi-axial classifications to established ontologies (e.g., DOLCE, BFO) to measure practical benefits for cross-ontology integration
