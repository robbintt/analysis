# A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Fine Tuned BERT for Text Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17677
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17677
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Hybrid model achieves competitive F1 scores with BERT/MLP baselines across 5 datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a hybrid classical-quantum approach for text classification that integrates a variational quantum circuit with pre-trained BERT embeddings. The method encodes BERT embeddings into quantum states using angle encoding, processes them through an n-qubit quantum circuit, and achieves competitive or better performance than classical BERT and MLP baselines. The approach demonstrates consistent F1 scores across multiple benchmark datasets, with notable improvements on the Twitter dataset. The work highlights the potential of quantum computing to enhance language model performance in NLP tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines pre-trained BERT embeddings with quantum circuit processing through angle encoding. Text inputs are first processed by BERT to generate contextual embeddings, which are then converted into quantum states via rotation gates. These quantum states are processed by a variational quantum circuit with learnable parameters. The final quantum measurement outputs are decoded back to classical representations for classification. The hybrid model is trained end-to-end using standard optimization techniques, with the quantum circuit parameters updated alongside BERT fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Hybrid model achieves competitive F1 scores compared to BERT and MLP baselines across 5 benchmark datasets
- Notable performance improvement on Twitter dataset with F1 score of 0.86
- Consistent performance across diverse datasets (IMDb, Spam, SST, Yelp, Twitter)
- Demonstrates quantum computing's potential to enhance NLP model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach leverages quantum circuits' ability to process high-dimensional embeddings in superposition states, potentially capturing complex relationships that classical models might miss. Angle encoding transforms classical embeddings into quantum amplitudes, allowing the variational circuit to explore solution spaces through quantum parallelism. The combination of BERT's contextual understanding with quantum circuit's non-linear transformations creates a powerful feature extraction pipeline.

## Foundational Learning

**Angle Encoding**
- Why needed: Converts classical embeddings into quantum states by mapping values to rotation angles
- Quick check: Verify that embedding values are properly normalized to stay within valid rotation ranges

**Variational Quantum Circuits**
- Why needed: Learnable quantum circuits that can adapt parameters during training for task-specific optimization
- Quick check: Confirm circuit depth and parameter initialization follow quantum hardware constraints

**Quantum Measurement**
- Why needed: Extracts classical information from quantum states for final classification decisions
- Quick check: Ensure measurement basis selection aligns with classification task requirements

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: BERT embeddings -> Angle encoding -> Variational quantum circuit -> Quantum measurement -> Classification layer

Critical path: The bottleneck occurs during angle encoding where embedding dimensionality must match quantum circuit qubit count. This creates a constraint on sequence length processing.

Design tradeoffs: The approach trades off quantum circuit depth (computational cost) against representational capacity. Fewer qubits mean coarser embedding resolution but faster execution.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation typically manifests as quantum measurement variance exceeding classical model stability, particularly for longer sequences where entanglement fidelity decreases.

3 first experiments:
1. Benchmark single-qubit vs multi-qubit circuits on same dataset to isolate quantum advantage
2. Test angle encoding sensitivity by varying embedding normalization ranges
3. Compare performance with frozen vs trainable quantum circuit parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Modest performance gains over classical baselines don't definitively establish quantum superiority
- Lack of detailed quantum circuit specifications makes contribution assessment difficult
- Scalability concerns for longer text sequences due to qubit constraints and entanglement degradation

## Confidence

High: Technical feasibility of hybrid BERT-quantum integration
Medium: General applicability across diverse NLP tasks
Low: Claims of quantum advantage over classical methods

## Next Checks

1. Test the hybrid model on additional diverse text classification datasets to verify generalizability beyond the five benchmarks
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the quantum circuit component to quantify its specific contribution to performance
3. Perform scalability tests with varying text lengths and qubit counts to assess practical limitations and identify breaking points
