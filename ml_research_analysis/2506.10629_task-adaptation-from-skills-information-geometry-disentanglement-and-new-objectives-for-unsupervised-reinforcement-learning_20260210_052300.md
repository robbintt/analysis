# Task Adaptation from Skills: Information Geometry, Disentanglement, and New Objectives for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.10629
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10629
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Skill diversity and separability are critical for downstream task adaptation in unsupervised reinforcement learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning, showing that skill diversity and separability are critical for effective downstream task adaptation. The authors introduce LSEPIN (Least SEParability and INformativeness), a novel disentanglement metric that measures the minimum mutual information between states and individual skills, and prove its connection to adaptation cost. They also propose WSEP (Wasserstein SEParability), which replaces KL divergence with Wasserstein distance to discover more potentially optimal skills, and PWSEP, an algorithm that can theoretically discover all optimal skills for downstream tasks. The theoretical results are supported by empirical validation in maze and Ant environments.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces three main contributions to unsupervised skill learning. First, LSEPIN measures skill disentanglement by computing the minimum mutual information $I(S; 1_z)$ for each skill, ensuring individual skills are distinguishable from others. Second, WSEP maximizes pairwise Wasserstein distances between skill state distributions, leveraging the metric's geometric properties to discover skills at polytope vertices that KL-based methods miss. Third, PWSEP iteratively projects new skills against the convex hull of previously discovered skills to guarantee discovery of all optimal vertices. These methods are implemented using discriminators that provide intrinsic rewards for policy updates, with downstream evaluation showing improved adaptation performance.

## Key Results
- LSEPIN metric effectively captures skill diversity and correlates with downstream task performance
- WSEP discovers more potentially optimal skills than traditional mutual information approaches
- PWSEP algorithm can theoretically discover all optimal skills for downstream tasks
- Empirical validation demonstrates improvements over baselines in maze and Ant environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Maximizing disentanglement lowers adaptation cost for downstream tasks.
- **Mechanism:** LSEPIN ensures individual skills are distinguishable by measuring minimum mutual information $I(S; 1_z)$, unlike standard MISL which only pushes skills away from the average. Theorem 3.1 shows higher $I(S; 1_z)$ correlates with lower adaptation cost.
- **Core assumption:** Downstream optimal states are far from average skill distribution in large state spaces.
- **Evidence:** Theorem 3.1 and related work on skill diversity (arXiv:2507.14748).
- **Break condition:** Benefits diminish if state space is small or optimal states near average skill distribution.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Wasserstein distance discovers more optimal skills than KL divergence.
- **Mechanism:** WSEP maximizes pairwise Wasserstein distances between skills, leveraging metric properties to push skills to distinct polytope vertices, unlike MISL's "circle" limitation.
- **Core assumption:** Wasserstein distance accurately reflects polytope geometry.
- **Evidence:** Abstract claims WSEP discovers more optimal skills; geometric analysis in section 3.3.1.
- **Break condition:** Poor transport cost definition breaks geometric benefits.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** PWSEP guarantees discovery of all optimal vertices.
- **Mechanism:** Iteratively maximizes Wasserstein distance to convex hull of existing skills, ensuring new skills lie at undiscovered vertices by Theorem 3.5.
- **Core assumption:** Efficient projection onto convex hull is feasible.
- **Evidence:** Theorem 3.5 and iterative algorithm description.
- **Break condition:** Infinite vertices or local optima prevent finding distinct vertices.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL)**
  - **Why needed:** Baseline the paper critiques; understand its limitation of creating "concyclic" skills without pairwise separability.
  - **Quick check:** If $I(S; Z)$ is maximized, does that guarantee skills are distinguishable from each other pairwise? (Answer: No).

- **Concept: Information Geometry & Polytope Vertices**
  - **Why needed:** Visualizes policies as points in convex polytope; optimal skills for any reward lie at vertices.
  - **Quick check:** Why does policy location in polytope matter for downstream tasks? (Answer: Linear rewards are maximized at vertices).

- **Concept: Wasserstein Distance vs. KL Divergence**
  - **Why needed:** WSEP relies on Wasserstein metric properties (symmetry, triangle inequality) to solve MISL limitations.
  - **Quick check:** Why does triangle inequality help discover diverse skills? (Answer: Enables meaningful distances between non-overlapping supports, ensuring skills spread across geometry).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** State S -> Skill Latent Z -> Skill-conditioned policy π(A|S,Z) -> Distance/Metric Module -> Intrinsic Reward -> Policy Update
- **Critical path:** 1) Initialize π, 2) Sample skill z, 3) Generate trajectories, 4) Calculate intrinsic reward (LSEPIN/WSEP), 5) Update policy, 6) (PWSEP) Iteratively add skills by maximizing distance to convex hull.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - MISL vs. LSEPIN: LSEPIN adds complexity but guarantees better adaptation properties.
  - WSEP vs. MISL: WSEP requires heavier Wasserstein computation but covers more vertices.
  - PWSEP: Theoretically optimal but slower due to iterative training.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Mode Collapse: Multiple skills produce identical state distributions.
  - Infinite Distance: Skills diverge to invalid states with poor transport costs.
  - Stuck Projection: Algorithm fails to find new vertices, rediscovers existing ones.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Diversity Check: Train MISL, visualize if skills cluster on "circle" or cover all corners.
  2. Metric Correlation: Implement LSEPIN/WSEP, correlate metrics with downstream task performance.
  3. Vertex Discovery (PWSEP): Implement on known MDP polytope, verify discovery of distinct behaviors.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can deep representations be learned such that standard transport costs accurately reflect traversal difficulty for Wasserstein skill learning?
- **Open Question 2:** Under what geometric conditions does WSEP fail to discover all vertices?
- **Open Question 3:** Can the convex projection step in PWSEP be solved efficiently and differentiably for high-dimensional state spaces?

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies on convex polytope assumptions that may not hold in high-dimensional continuous environments
- LSEPIN requires challenging mutual information estimation for individual skills
- Wasserstein distance computation depends on accurate transport cost estimation that may not scale well
- Empirical validation limited to relatively simple environments

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Theoretical connection between skill separability and adaptation cost (Theorem 3.1) through information theory
- **Medium Confidence:** Practical effectiveness of LSEPIN and WSEP in discovering diverse skills based on empirical results
- **Low Confidence:** PWSEP's claim to discover all optimal vertices depends on computationally intensive projections

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Test:** Implement and evaluate WSEP on Humanoid environment to assess effectiveness as state dimensionality increases

2. **Robustness Analysis:** Systematically vary discriminator architecture and learning rates in LSEPIN to identify failure modes and hyperparameter sensitivity

3. **Geometric Verification:** In controlled MDP with known polytope structure, verify PWSEP discovers all vertices by comparing against ground-truth optimal policies
