# From Predictions to Explanations: Explainable AI for Autism Diagnosis and Identification of Critical Brain Regions

## Quick Facts

- Dual-module AI framework achieves 76.62% ASD classification accuracy using fMRI data and identifies neuroanatomically critical regions

## Executive Summary
This study presents a dual-module AI framework for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis using functional MRI data. The first module employs cross-domain transfer learning with knowledge distillation to fine-tune a compact TinyViT model, achieving 76.62% classification accuracy on the ABIDE dataset—outperforming conventional CNN approaches and larger transformer models. The second module integrates three explainable AI techniques (saliency mapping, Grad-CAM, and SHAP analysis) to identify neuroanatomically critical regions for ASD classification. Key consensus regions include the calcarine sulcus/cuneus (BA 17), insula (BA 13 & 16), parietal lobe (BA 5), and temporal gyri (BA 20 & 21). These findings align with established neurobiological evidence of sensory processing deficits, social interaction challenges, and language impairments in ASD. The framework provides both accurate diagnostic capability and clinically interpretable insights, bridging artificial intelligence with neuropsychiatric expertise to support earlier, more transparent interventions for ASD.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of two modules: (1) a classification module using cross-domain transfer learning with knowledge distillation, where a ViT_B_16 teacher model pre-trained on ImageNet is fine-tuned on ABIDE fMRI data and guides a TinyViT student model via composite loss function; (2) an explanation module combining three XAI techniques (saliency mapping, Grad-CAM, and SHAP) to identify consensus neuroanatomical biomarkers. The model is trained on 2D fMRI slices converted from 4D rs-fMRI volumes, with teacher fine-tuned on ABIDE (65 epochs) and student distilled on CMI-HBN (40 epochs) using AdamW optimizer.

## Key Results
- Achieves 76.62% classification accuracy on ABIDE dataset, outperforming conventional CNN approaches
- TinyViT_21m model shows high Recall (86.48%) but lower Specificity (66.75%) compared to ViT_B_32
- Consensus XAI analysis identifies key ASD-related regions: calcarine sulcus/cuneus (BA 17), insula (BA 13 & 16), parietal lobe (BA 5), and temporal gyri (BA 20 & 21)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-domain transfer learning combined with knowledge distillation (KD) enables robust classification on limited neuroimaging data by bridging the feature gap between natural images and brain scans.
- Mechanism: A large teacher model (ViT_B_16), pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on ABIDE fMRI data, guides a smaller student model (TinyViT) via a composite loss function ($L_{final} = L_{model} * \alpha + L_{distill} * (1 - \alpha)$). This aligns the student's logits with the teacher's "soft labels," transferring generalizable feature hierarchies (edges, shapes) to the specialized domain of brain activity maps.
- Core assumption: The structural and textural features learned from natural images (ImageNet) provide a non-random initialization that effectively transfers to the distinct statistical distribution of fMRI voxels, despite the domain shift.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "...first module employs cross-domain transfer learning with knowledge distillation to fine-tune a compact TinyViT model... outperforming conventional CNN approaches..."
  - [section 4.1]: "Knowledge transfer from the teacher model to the compact student model is facilitated via distillation... Teacher logits are utilized to optimize training efficiency..."
  - [corpus]: Related work "ASDFormer" also utilizes Transformers for robust ASD diagnosis, supporting the architectural choice, though specific KD mechanisms are unique to this paper's claim.
- Break condition: The mechanism likely fails if the domain gap between natural images and fMRI is too wide for the pre-trained weights to be relevant, resulting in "negative transfer" where fine-tuning performs worse than training from scratch.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Triangulating multiple distinct XAI techniques (Saliency, Grad-CAM, SHAP) isolates consistent neuroanatomical biomarkers by filtering out method-specific biases.
- Mechanism: The framework employs three distinct interpretability methods: Saliency maps (gradient-based pixel importance), Grad-CAM (region-based activation mapping), and SHAP (game-theoretic feature contribution). By identifying the intersection of regions highlighted by all three methods (specifically BA 17, 13, 16, 5), the system filters out the specific noise or artifacts associated with any single XAI algorithm.
- Core assumption: A true pathological feature for ASD will be detectable by gradient-based, activation-based, and perturbation-based explanation methods simultaneously, whereas artifacts will appear in only one.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "...integrates three explainable AI techniques... to identify neuroanatomically critical regions... Key consensus regions include the calcarine sulcus/cuneus..."
  - [section 4.2]: "The results obtained from the single-explanation technique are susceptible to methodological biases... Intersecting features across all three methodologies were prioritized..."
  - [corpus]: Corpus papers generally focus on single-modality or specific biomarker discovery but do not explicitly refute the multi-method triangulation approach.
- Break condition: If the XAI methods produce fundamentally incompatible spatial maps (e.g., Saliency focuses on edges while SHAP focuses on distributed context), the "consensus" intersection might be empty or statistically insignificant.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The hierarchical transformer architecture (TinyViT) captures long-range dependencies in fMRI data more effectively than local-receptive-field CNNs.
- Mechanism: Unlike CNNs, which process images through localized convolutional kernels, TinyViT processes fMRI slices as sequential patches. It uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the relationship between distant spatial regions, allowing it to model complex global interactions between disconnected brain areas within a 2D slice.
- Core assumption: The diagnostic features of ASD in fMRI are not purely local textures but rely on the global spatial context and relationships between distant voxels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "...outperforming conventional CNN approaches and larger transformer models."
  - [section 2]: "...CNNs exhibit inherent constraints... inherent locality presumptions are overcome [by transformers]... permitting more intricate data representations to be learned."
  - [corpus]: "ASD Classification on Dynamic Brain Connectome..." supports the use of Transformers for capturing complex brain dynamics/connectivity over standard methods.
- Break condition: Performance degrades if the input resolution is too low or if the patches destroy the local continuity required to identify subtle microstructural changes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Knowledge Distillation (KD) Loss**
  - Why needed here: This is the core training engine for Module 1. You must understand how Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to force a "student" model to mimic the probability distribution of a "teacher" model, rather than just learning hard labels.
  - Quick check question: How does the parameter $\alpha$ in the loss function balance the ground truth label vs. the teacher's logits?

- Concept: **Vision Transformers (ViT) & Patch Embedding**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses TinyViT instead of a standard CNN. You need to understand how a 2D brain slice is split into "patches" (tokens) and processed via self-attention to grasp why this architecture handles global context better.
  - Quick check question: Why might a standard CNN struggle to capture the relationship between two distant brain regions in a single slice compared to a Transformer?

- Concept: **Explainable AI (XAI) Taxonomy**
  - Why needed here: Module 2 relies on the distinct properties of Saliency, Grad-CAM, and SHAP. Distinguishing between gradient-based methods (saliency/Grad-CAM) and perturbation-based methods (SHAP) is required to understand why consensus is valuable.
  - Quick check question: Why would SHAP (which tests feature importance by removing/hiding features) potentially yield different results than a Saliency Map (which looks at gradients)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Input**: Preprocessed 2D rs-fMRI slices (ABIDE/CMI-HBN)
  - **Module 1 (Classifier)**:
    - *Teacher*: ViT_B_16 (Pre-trained ImageNet -> Fine-tuned ABIDE)
    - *Student*: TinyViT (Pre-trained ImageNet -> Distilled on CMI-HBN)
    - *Loss*: Composite of Cross-Entropy ($L_{model}$) and KL-Divergence ($L_{distill}$)
  - **Module 2 (Explainer)**:
    - *Gradient Path*: Saliency Maps, Grad-CAM
    - *Perturbation Path*: SHAP
    - *Consensus Logic*: Intersection of identified Brodmann Areas (BA)

- Critical path: The high-impact sequence is: **Teacher Fine-Tuning** (adapting natural image features to brains) -> **Student Distillation** (compressing knowledge) -> **Inference** -> **XAI Consensus** (mapping activation to BA labels)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Accuracy vs. Efficiency**: Using TinyViT (21M params) instead of ViT_B (86M params) sacrifices potential capacity for a 75% parameter reduction, yet maintains higher accuracy (76.62%) due to efficient distillation
  - **Precision vs. Recall**: The TinyViT_21m shows high Recall (86.48%) but lower Specificity (66.75%), meaning it flags more true positives at the cost of false positives compared to ViT_B_32

- Failure signatures:
  - **Negative Transfer**: Student accuracy drops below 50% or fails to converge, indicating the teacher's ImageNet features are misleading for fMRI
  - **XAI Disagreement**: Saliency maps highlight the skull/edges while Grad-CAM highlights the brain stem, with no overlap in known ASD regions (BA 17/13)
  - **Overfitting**: High training accuracy but validation accuracy drops significantly (watch the 40-epoch mark on CMI-HBN)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline ViT**: Train a standard ViT_B_16 from scratch on ABIDE without distillation to confirm the "data scarcity" problem the paper claims to solve
  2. **Loss Ablation**: Train TinyViT using only $L_{model}$ (no distillation) vs. the full composite loss to quantify the specific contribution of the teacher model
  3. **XAI Sensitivity**: Run inference on a "noisy" scan (added Gaussian noise) to see if the XAI consensus regions shift randomly or remain fixed on BA 17/13 (robustness check)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the identified neuroanatomical biomarkers (e.g., BA 17, BA 13) generalize effectively across diverse, independent cohorts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion explicitly states that future work is required to validate these biomarkers "across diverse cohorts."
- Why unresolved: The current study validates findings on ABIDE and CMI-HBN, but the heterogeneity of ASD requires broader demographic testing.
- Evidence to resolve: Successful replication of classification and explainability results on datasets from different geographic regions and ethnic populations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can diagnostic precision be improved by integrating multimodal data sources into the current framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion lists "integrating multimodal data to further refine diagnostic precision" as a primary goal for future research.
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies exclusively on rs-fMRI data, potentially missing behavioral or genetic markers.
- Evidence to resolve: Comparative performance analysis of the model when augmented with tabular phenotypic data or other imaging modalities.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the integration of XAI outputs actually improve diagnostic confidence and accuracy for clinicians in a live setting?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Discussion claims the framework aids "evidence-based clinical decisions," but the study evaluates technical performance rather than clinical utility.
- Why unresolved: While the XAI outputs align with literature, the actual impact on a clinician's diagnostic workflow remains untested.
- Evidence to resolve: A user study where clinicians diagnose cases with and without the XAI visualizations to measure improvements in speed and accuracy.

## Limitations

- The conversion of 4D fMRI data into 2D TinyViT inputs is not explicitly detailed, creating a critical reproducibility gap
- The study relies on cross-dataset training (ABIDE → CMI-HBN) which may introduce domain shift effects not quantified
- The XAI consensus approach assumes equal validity of three distinct methods without quantifying agreement strength or statistical significance of the identified Brodmann Areas

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The general architecture (ViT + TinyViT + distillation) is technically sound and aligns with established transfer learning principles
- **Medium Confidence**: The 76.62% accuracy result is plausible given the dataset size and methodology, though exact reproducibility is uncertain due to preprocessing ambiguities
- **Low Confidence**: The specific neuroanatomical claims (BA 17, 13, 16, 5 as definitive ASD markers) require external validation beyond the consensus of three XAI methods

## Next Checks

1. **Input Transformation Validation**: Systematically test different 2D projection methods (mean intensity, specific slice extraction, multiple slices) to determine their impact on classification accuracy

2. **XAI Consensus Robustness**: Perform statistical analysis (e.g., Jaccard similarity, permutation tests) on the overlap between Saliency, Grad-CAM, and SHAP maps across multiple subjects to quantify the significance of the identified BA regions

3. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Evaluate the trained model on a held-out test set from the same distribution as the training data (e.g., split CMI-HBN) to isolate the contribution of cross-dataset distillation from potential data leakage or domain adaptation effects
