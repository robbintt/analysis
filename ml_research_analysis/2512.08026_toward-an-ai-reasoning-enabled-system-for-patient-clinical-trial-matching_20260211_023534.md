# Toward an AI Reasoning-Enabled System for Patient-Clinical Trial Matching

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08026
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08026
- Reference count: 30
- This paper presents a proof-of-concept AI system for patient-clinical trial matching that uses reasoning-enabled large language models to augment manual screening processes.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a reasoning-enabled AI system for matching patients to clinical trials, addressing the challenge of manually reviewing thousands of trials for each patient. The system integrates heterogeneous EHR data, retrieves candidate trials from ClinicalTrials.gov, and generates structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains. Using synthetic patient data, the system evaluated patients against an average of 950 trials each, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations for future eligibility. The system demonstrated ability to scale appropriately with condition prevalence, finding eight matches for a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma versus one for a rarer cancer type, while maintaining transparency and auditability throughout the matching process.

## Method Summary
The system employs a four-step pipeline: (1) Patient Information Extraction (PIE) via Jinja2 template extracts 14 clinical categories from raw EHR input, (2) multi-tiered ClinicalTrials.gov API search with diagnosis synonyms and minimum criteria filters, (3) Patient-Trial Eligibility Evaluator (PTEE) template using DeepSeek-R1 (128K context, reasoning via `<think>` tags) to generate structured eligibility assessments, and (4) JSON output conversion to Word/PDF reports. The system prioritizes recall over precision in trial retrieval and represents eligibility as a dynamic state with four classifications (Eligible Now, Could Be Eligible in Future, Not Eligible, Need More Information).

## Key Results
- System evaluated an average of 950 trials per patient using multi-tiered search strategy
- Found eight matching trials for Hodgkin lymphoma patient versus one for rare cancer type, demonstrating condition prevalence scaling
- 88% of trials classified as Not Eligible, 12% as potentially eligible (including future eligibility)
- Local DeepSeek-R1 deployment enabled HIPAA-compliant processing with interpretable reasoning chains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Reasoning-enabled LLMs produce interpretable eligibility assessments that support human verification.
- **Mechanism:** DeepSeek-R1 generates intermediate reasoning steps in `<think>` tags before final outputs, creating auditable chains that clinicians can trace to verify logic, identify misinterpretations, and make informed judgments about matches.
- **Core assumption:** Clinicians will trust and effectively use reasoning chains to validate AI recommendations rather than deferring blindly.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states system "generates structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains"; Methods describes "trained reasoning capability, similar to chain-of-thought prompting, helps with complex tasks requiring multi-step problem solving"; related work (MatchMiner-AI, MSK-MATCH) similarly emphasizes explainability.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Multi-tiered keyword search retrieval maximizes trial coverage while avoiding false negatives.
- **Mechanism:** The system performs sequential searches using descending specificity—precise primary diagnosis first, then base diagnosis, then synonyms—prioritizing recall over precision since AI (not humans) performs initial filtering.
- **Core assumption:** ClinicalTrials.gov's keyword-based API lacks semantic similarity, so manual term expansion is necessary.
- **Evidence anchors:** Methods states "we employ custom logic using a multi-tiered keyword search strategy that balances specificity with comprehensive trial retrieval"; Methods notes "we prioritized recall over precision—making our system more tolerant of false positives...while avoiding false negatives"; related work (TrialMatchAI) notes similar challenges with heterogeneous clinical data integration.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Representing eligibility as a dynamic state rather than binary classification preserves future enrollment opportunities.
- **Mechanism:** The PTEE template assigns four categories (Eligible Now, Could Be Eligible in Future, Not Eligible, Need More Information) with reasoning that identifies temporal prerequisites and actionable recommendations.
- **Core assumption:** Many exclusion criteria are time-dependent or resolvable through additional testing, not permanent disqualifications.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states system "represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination"; Discussion provides example of chemotherapy duration requirement recognized as "deterministic temporal prerequisite"; related papers do not explicitly test dynamic eligibility representation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The system depends on DeepSeek's explicit reasoning steps (`<think>` tags) to generate auditable eligibility logic.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how chain-of-thought differs from standard prompt-response patterns?

- **Concept: EHR data heterogeneity**
  - Why needed here: The PIE template must extract 14 structured categories from mixed formats (free text, tables, PDFs) with missing fields.
  - Quick check question: What are three common formats clinical data might appear in within an EHR?

- **Concept: Multi-threaded LLM inference**
  - Why needed here: Evaluating ~950 trials per patient sequentially would be prohibitively slow; parallel batching improves throughput.
  - Quick check question: Why does multi-threading help specifically with LLM workloads compared to CPU-bound tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** EHR ingestion -> PIE Template (14 categories extraction) -> ClinicalTrials.gov API Client (multi-tiered search) -> PTEE Template (eligibility assessment) -> Report Generator (JSON -> Word/PDF) -> DeepSeek-R1 (local containerized inference)

- **Critical path:** EHR ingestion → PIE extraction → API retrieval (~950 trials avg) → PTEE evaluation (multi-threaded) → JSON output → Formatted reports. The PTEE step is the computational bottleneck.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Recall vs. precision: Broad retrieval creates more downstream evaluation work but avoids missing trials.
  - Open-source vs. proprietary: DeepSeek enables local HIPAA-compliant deployment but may lag behind commercial model capabilities.
  - Template rigidity vs. flexibility: Jinja2 templates standardize outputs but require manual updates for new extraction categories.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Diagnosis extraction too specific → ClinicalTrials.gov API returns zero results
  - Missing EHR fields cascade → "Need More Information" classifications dominate
  - Context window exceeded → Trial protocol truncation causes incomplete evaluation
  - Rare conditions → Fewer than 100 trials retrieved, limited match opportunities

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate extraction accuracy: Run PIE template on 10 synthetic EHR records with known ground truth; measure precision/recall for each of the 14 categories.
  2. Stress-test retrieval breadth: Compare trial counts returned by single-diagnosis search vs. multi-tiered synonym expansion across 5 cancer types with varying prevalence.
  3. Calibrate eligibility thresholds: Evaluate same patient-trial pairs with modified PTEE templates (conservative vs. permissive); measure distribution shifts across the four eligibility categories.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does system performance compare between synthetic and real patient EHR data?
- Basis in paper: Authors state "the system will advance to the next phase: expert-reviewed validation on a set of real patient cases" and that synthetic data evaluation "establishes a foundation for future tests with real-world data."
- Why unresolved: The proof-of-concept used only AI-generated synthetic records with simulated variability, which may not capture the full complexity, missingness patterns, and inconsistencies of actual clinical documentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validation study comparing extraction accuracy, trial retrieval recall, and eligibility assessment concordance between matched synthetic-real patient pairs, with expert-labeled ground truth.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can reinforcement learning from expert feedback measurably improve system performance over time?
- Basis in paper: "Systematic capture of expert review data could be leveraged through reinforcement learning to improve the system's performance over time, establishing an iterative refinement loop grounded in real-world clinical expertise."
- Why unresolved: Current templates are static; no mechanism exists to learn from coordinator corrections, rejected recommendations, or preference patterns expressed during human-in-the-loop review.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment measuring eligibility assessment accuracy and agreement rates before and after RL fine-tuning on accumulated expert feedback from production use.

## Limitations
- Performance relies heavily on synthetic data, limiting generalizability to real-world EHR heterogeneity and clinical nuance
- Multi-tiered search strategy may struggle with rare conditions lacking sufficient synonym mappings
- Reasoning chains remain vulnerable to LLM hallucinations that could propagate through eligibility assessments
- Local deployment requirement restricts scalability and may limit access to state-of-the-art model capabilities

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The multi-tiered keyword search approach and reasoning-enabled eligibility assessment framework are well-grounded in the methodology. The dynamic eligibility representation addresses a genuine clinical need for preserving future enrollment opportunities.

**Medium Confidence:** The system's ability to handle real-world EHR heterogeneity remains unproven without testing on actual clinical data. The scalability claims depend on specific model deployment configurations that may not generalize.

**Low Confidence:** The clinical utility of the system depends entirely on whether clinicians trust and effectively use the reasoning chains for verification. No evidence demonstrates clinician adoption or validation of the interpretability benefits.

## Next Checks

1. **Real-World EHR Testing:** Deploy the system on 50 real patient records from multiple healthcare institutions to measure performance degradation compared to synthetic data benchmarks.

2. **Clinician Validation Study:** Conduct a randomized controlled trial where clinicians review AI-generated eligibility assessments with and without reasoning chains to quantify the impact on verification accuracy and time.

3. **Scalability Stress Test:** Evaluate system performance with increasing trial counts (10,000+ trials per patient) and varying model deployment configurations to identify computational bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
