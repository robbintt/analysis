# When Single-Agent with Skills Replace Multi-Agent Systems and When They Fail

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.04748
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04748

- This paper demonstrates that single-agent systems with skill libraries can replace multi-agent systems while reducing token usage by 54% and latency by 50%, but selection accuracy degrades sharply beyond a critical library size threshold.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic study of replacing multi-agent systems (MAS) with single-agent systems that use a library of specialized skills. The core innovation is compiling specialized agent behaviors into selectable skills within a single model, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Through experiments on reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K, HumanEval, and HotpotQA, the research establishes both the viability and limitations of this approach. The work reveals a phase transition in selection accuracy as skill libraries grow, where performance degrades sharply beyond a critical threshold. This degradation is driven by semantic confusability among similar skills rather than library size alone, and hierarchical routing is shown to mitigate this limitation by decomposing selection into coarse-to-fine decisions.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a single-agent system that compiles multiple specialized agents into a unified model with a skill library. Each skill represents a specialized capability (like mathematical reasoning or code generation) previously handled by separate agents. The system learns to select appropriate skills for different parts of a task through a selection module. The approach is evaluated against traditional multi-agent systems across three reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (math word problems), HumanEval (code generation), and HotpotQA (multi-hop question answering). The compilation process transforms inter-agent communication into internal skill selection, and experiments systematically vary skill library sizes to identify scaling limits. Hierarchical routing is introduced as a solution to selection accuracy degradation, implementing a coarse-to-fine decision process for skill selection.

## Key Results
- Single-agent with skills achieves comparable accuracy to multi-agent systems while reducing token usage by 54% and latency by 50%
- Selection accuracy exhibits a phase transition, degrading sharply beyond a critical library size threshold
- Hierarchical routing effectively mitigates selection degradation by implementing coarse-to-fine skill selection
- Semantic confusability between similar skills drives selection failure more than library size alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by compiling specialized agent behaviors into selectable skills within a single model, effectively trading the overhead of inter-agent communication for the challenge of skill selection. The single agent learns to route tasks to appropriate skills through a learned selection module, maintaining reasoning capabilities while reducing computational costs. The system succeeds when skills are semantically distinct enough for reliable selection, but fails when skills become too similar and confusable. Hierarchical routing restores scalability by breaking down the selection problem into manageable sub-problems through multi-level decision making.

## Foundational Learning
- **Skill Library Compilation**: Converting specialized agent behaviors into selectable skills within a single model - needed to reduce inter-agent communication overhead and enable unified reasoning
- **Phase Transition in Selection Accuracy**: Sharp degradation in skill selection performance beyond a critical library size - needed to understand fundamental scaling limits of skill-based approaches
- **Semantic Confusability**: The degree to which similar skills interfere with accurate selection - needed to explain why selection fails and guide skill library design
- **Hierarchical Routing**: Decomposing skill selection into coarse-to-fine decisions across multiple levels - needed to restore scalability beyond the phase transition threshold
- **Cognitive Capacity Limits**: Theoretical framework connecting observed phase transitions to human cognitive constraints - needed to provide principled understanding of selection limitations
- **Skill Diversity vs Similarity Trade-off**: Balancing library size with skill distinctiveness - needed to optimize practical deployment of skill-based systems

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input -> Selection Module -> Skill Library -> Output Generation

Critical Path: User query → Skill selection decision → Appropriate skill activation → Skill-specific processing → Response generation

Design Tradeoffs: Single-agent with skills reduces token usage and latency by eliminating inter-agent communication, but introduces selection accuracy challenges that worsen with library size. Hierarchical routing improves accuracy at the cost of additional computation. The optimal configuration balances skill diversity against selection reliability.

Failure Signatures: Sharp accuracy drops when library size exceeds critical threshold, particularly for semantically similar skills. Selection becomes increasingly unreliable as confusability increases, manifesting as incorrect skill routing even when correct skills exist in the library.

First Experiments:
1. Compare single-agent with skills against traditional MAS on GSM8K benchmark, measuring accuracy, token usage, and latency
2. Systematically vary skill library sizes (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 skills) to identify phase transition point in selection accuracy
3. Implement hierarchical routing with 2-level and 3-level selection to evaluate effectiveness in mitigating accuracy degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The phase transition threshold for selection accuracy varies across different benchmarks, suggesting dataset-dependent scaling limits
- Computational overhead of hierarchical routing is not fully characterized, leaving practical viability uncertain
- Real-world applicability to diverse, complex skill libraries beyond controlled experimental conditions remains unproven

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- The existence of a phase transition in selection accuracy as skill libraries grow
- Hierarchical routing effectively mitigates selection degradation
- Semantic similarity between skills drives selection failure more than library size alone
- Compilation achieves 54% token reduction and 50% latency improvement compared to MAS

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Connection between observed phase transitions and cognitive capacity limits
- Scalability of hierarchical routing to very large skill libraries (>50 skills)
- Generalizability of semantic confusability findings to real-world applications

**Low Confidence Claims:**
None identified

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate the phase transition phenomenon and hierarchical routing effectiveness on non-reasoning tasks (e.g., code generation, creative writing, or multi-step planning) to determine if the findings generalize beyond mathematical and QA benchmarks.

2. **Scalability boundary analysis**: Systematically test hierarchical routing with skill libraries of 100+, measuring both accuracy and computational overhead to identify practical limits and optimal routing depths for different task types.

3. **Real-world deployment stress test**: Implement the single-agent-with-skills approach in an autonomous agent system handling heterogeneous tasks over extended periods, measuring performance degradation, maintenance requirements, and human-in-the-loop intervention frequency compared to traditional MAS approaches.
