# Could you be wrong: Debiasing LLMs using a metacognitive prompt for improving human decision making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10124
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10124
- Authors: Thomas T. Hills

- The paper introduces a metacognitive prompt—"Could you be wrong?"—to debias LLMs by encouraging self-critical evaluation and surfacing latent knowledge about biases and counterarguments.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to improving large language model outputs by prompting them with the question "Could you be wrong?" The method leverages the LLM's existing knowledge about biases, contradictory evidence, and counterarguments that may not surface in standard responses. Tested across multiple scenarios including discriminatory bias, metacognitive limitations, and evidence omission, the prompt consistently elicited deeper reflection and self-correction from the models. The approach shows promise as a general debiasing strategy that aligns with human decision-making techniques.

## Method Summary
The study employs a metacognitive prompting strategy where LLMs are asked to critically evaluate their own outputs by considering potential errors and alternative perspectives. The core intervention involves appending the prompt "Could you be wrong?" to initial LLM responses, encouraging the model to surface latent knowledge about biases, counterarguments, and contradictory evidence. The method was tested across various scenarios including medical reasoning tasks (where ChatGPT-4o identified a fictional condition and provided multiple reasons for potential error), and cases involving omitted evidence (such as surfacing contradictory research on the "too much choice" effect). The approach relies on the LLM's pre-existing knowledge rather than generating new information, functioning as a retrieval and articulation tool.

## Key Results
- ChatGPT-4o identified the fictional nature of a medical condition and provided multiple reasons for potential error when prompted with "Could you be wrong?"
- In the "too much choice" effect scenario, the prompt surfaced contradictory evidence absent from the initial response
- The method consistently elicited deeper reflection, self-correction, and more nuanced responses across discriminatory bias, metacognitive limitations, and evidence omission scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by triggering the LLM's internal adversarial critique mechanisms, similar to how human metacognition helps identify and correct cognitive biases. When prompted to consider potential errors, the model accesses its latent knowledge about biases, counterarguments, and contradictory evidence that remained unexpressed in the initial response. This self-reflective process mirrors human debiasing techniques where questioning one's own assumptions leads to more balanced decision-making.

## Foundational Learning
- **Metacognition**: The ability to think about one's own thinking processes - needed to understand how self-reflection triggers bias correction; quick check: Can you explain how humans use metacognition to catch errors?
- **Adversarial internal critique**: The model's capacity to generate counterarguments against its own outputs - needed to understand how the prompt activates internal debate; quick check: Does the model need to generate opposing viewpoints when prompted?
- **Latent knowledge retrieval**: The process of accessing information already present in the model but not initially expressed - needed to understand the mechanism behind surfacing counterarguments; quick check: Is the prompt generating new knowledge or retrieving existing knowledge?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Input -> LLM Initial Response -> Metacognitive Prompt ("Could you be wrong?") -> Self-Critical Response

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves the initial response generation, prompt injection, and the model's subsequent self-evaluation. The most sensitive point is the model's willingness to engage in genuine self-critique rather than superficial acknowledgment of potential errors.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead (additional inference steps) for improved output quality. It requires no model fine-tuning but depends entirely on the model's existing knowledge base. The simplicity of a single prompt phrase makes it broadly applicable but may limit depth of reflection compared to more structured prompting approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: The approach fails when the model lacks relevant contradictory evidence in its training data, when the model provides superficial acknowledgment without substantive self-correction, or when the model's architecture does not support meaningful self-reflection. It may also fail in time-sensitive applications where excessive hedging becomes counterproductive.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test the prompt across multiple model architectures (GPT-4, Claude, open-source models) to assess generalizability
2. Compare response quality with and without the metacognitive prompt on standardized bias detection benchmarks
3. Measure the impact on human decision-making outcomes when using LLM outputs with and without the prompt

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach depends on the LLM's pre-existing knowledge of biases and counterarguments, unable to surface information the model does not already possess
- Effectiveness may vary significantly across different model architectures, training paradigms, and domain-specific contexts
- The study's examples represent a limited set of scenarios, with generalizability to complex, real-world decision-making contexts remaining uncertain

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Metacognitive prompt elicits more comprehensive and self-critical responses | High |
| This approach constitutes a general debiasing strategy for improving human decision-making | Medium |
| The method aligns with human metacognitive debiasing techniques | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment measuring whether LLM outputs post-prompting lead to measurably better human decision outcomes compared to baseline responses
2. Test the prompt's effectiveness across a broader range of model sizes and architectures, including open-source models with varying training data and objectives
3. Evaluate the method's performance on highly specialized domains where the LLM's pre-existing knowledge may be limited or where domain-specific biases dominate
