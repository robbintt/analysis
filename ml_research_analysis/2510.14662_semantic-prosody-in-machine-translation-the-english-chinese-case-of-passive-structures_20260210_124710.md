# Semantic Prosody in Machine Translation: the English-Chinese Case of Passive Structures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.14662
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14662

- Primary result: Fine-tuning MT models with contrastive positive and negative evidence improves their use of Chinese BEI passives based on semantic prosody

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how to teach machine translation models the semantic prosody of Chinese BEI passives - that they are typically associated with unfavorable events. The authors create a dataset of 900 English-Chinese sentence pairs demonstrating this negative prosody and fine-tune three seq2seq models (OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M, mBART50) with contrastive evidence. They show that fine-tuning improves model accuracy in using BEI passives appropriately for negative content while avoiding them for neutral/favorable content. Additionally, they demonstrate that in multilingual models like NLLB-600M, this prosody knowledge can transfer from English-Chinese to Spanish-Chinese translation.

## Method Summary
The authors create a dataset of 900 English-Chinese literary sentence pairs to demonstrate the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. They fine-tune three pretrained seq2seq models (OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M, mBART50) using this data with contrastive positive evidence (BE passives → BEI passives for unfavorable content) and negative evidence (BE passives → active voice for neutral/favorable content). They evaluate translation quality using general metrics (BLEU, chrF2, CometKiwi) on Flores+ and Tatoeba, and measure prosody-specific accuracy on their test set. They also use probing classifiers to examine where semantic prosody information is stored in model representations.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned models achieved significantly higher accuracy on the BEI test set compared to pretrained baselines
- NLLB-600M showed improved accuracy on both positive and negative evidence sentences when translating Spanish passives into Chinese
- Decoder representations showed greater enrichment with semantic prosody information post-fine-tuning compared to encoder representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Contrastive fine-tuning with positive and negative evidence teaches MT models when to use or avoid a target structure based on semantic prosody. Positive evidence (BEI passives translating unfavorable content) reinforces the node-negativity association; negative evidence (active voice translations for neutral/favorable BE passives) attenuates the default BE→BEI correspondence. The model learns contextual appropriateness through exposure to these contrasting patterns rather than explicit rules.

### Mechanism 2
In multilingual models, semantic prosody knowledge learned from one language pair can transfer to translation from other source languages. NLLB-600M's shared multilingual representations allow prosody awareness (BEI = unfavorable) learned via English-Chinese fine-tuning to apply when translating Spanish passives (SER/ESTAR + participle, also neutral prosody) into Chinese.

### Mechanism 3
Fine-tuning enriches decoder representations with semantic prosody information more significantly than encoder representations. Probing classifiers reveal that post-fine-tuning, decoder layers show improved ability to distinguish whether active or passive voice is appropriate; encoder improvements are modest and concentrated in deeper layers.

## Foundational Learning

- **Semantic prosody** — the consistent attitudinal meaning a word or structure acquires through repeated co-occurrence with specific collocates (e.g., BEI passive ≈ unfavorable events). Why needed here: Understanding that literal translation equivalence does not guarantee prosody equivalence; this is the core problem the paper addresses. Quick check question: If "CAUSE" in English collocates with negative outcomes, would a Chinese equivalent with neutral prosody require a different translation strategy?

- **Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) fine-tuning** — adapting pretrained models to specific tasks via continued training on curated data. Why needed here: The paper's intervention relies on fine-tuning as the mechanism for teaching prosody awareness. Quick check question: What happens to general translation performance (BLEU, chrF2) when fine-tuning on a narrow, structure-focused dataset?

- **Probing classifiers** — diagnostic models trained to extract linguistic properties from neural representations. Why needed here: The paper uses probing to validate where prosody-relevant information is stored pre/post fine-tuning. Quick check question: If a probe achieves high accuracy on decoder layer 12 but low accuracy on encoder layer 1, what does this suggest about where structural appropriateness decisions are made?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Pretrained models (OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M, mBART50) -> BEI dataset (900 sentence pairs) -> Fine-tuning with contrastive evidence -> Evaluation (general metrics + prosody-specific accuracy) -> Probing classifiers for representation analysis

- **Critical path**: 1) Curate contrastive dataset demonstrating prosody (positive evidence: BE→BEI for unfavorable; negative evidence: BE→active voice for neutral/favorable) 2) Fine-tune pretrained models with learning rate search (OPUS-MT: 10^-5, NLLB-600M: 5×10^-4, mBART50: 10^-5) 3) Evaluate on general benchmarks (Flores+, Tatoeba) to confirm no degradation 4) Evaluate on prosody-specific test set to measure improvement 5) Optionally probe layer-wise representations to diagnose where information is stored

- **Design tradeoffs**: Dataset size vs. overfitting: 900 pairs is sufficient to demonstrate BEI prosody but may not scale to teaching multiple structures simultaneously; Literary-only corpus: Chosen for higher BEI frequency and more negative prosody (66% negative in fiction vs. 51.5% in news), but limits domain generality; Multilingual model selection: NLLB-600M enables cross-lingual transfer; OPUS-MT and mBART50 do not (mBART50 has known output-language issues for Spanish→Chinese)

- **Failure signatures**: Model continues using BEI passives for neutral/positive content → insufficient negative evidence or learning rate too low; General translation quality drops significantly → overfitting to BEI dataset; consider mixing with general text; Probe accuracy unchanged post-fine-tuning → information may be distributed differently; check multiple layers; Spanish→Chinese transfer fails → verify mBART50 language token configuration; use NLLB-600M instead

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate fine-tuning on NLLB-600M with the BEI dataset; measure accuracy improvement on negative evidence test set (target: ~59% as reported vs. ~36% baseline) 2) Test Spanish→Chinese transfer: translate Spanish version of BEI test set; confirm positive evidence accuracy increases from ~66% to ~80% 3) Run layer-wise probing on pretrained vs. fine-tuned NLLB-600M decoder; verify ~4.5% mean accuracy improvement across layers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can a single model learn the semantic prosodies of multiple linguistic units simultaneously through combined fine-tuning data? The authors state this is a potential future research direction but only tested one structure (BEI passives).

- Does machine translation performance vary when translating different kinds of passives, specifically adjectival versus verbal passives? The authors note they did not distinguish between these types but plan to investigate whether model performance varies on different kinds of passives.

- Is it necessary to mix the semantic prosody dataset with general text during fine-tuning to better reflect the natural low frequency of passive sentences in Chinese? The authors state this needs future work to justify, as their current approach fine-tuned exclusively on passive-containing data.

## Limitations

- The study relies on a manually curated dataset of 900 literary sentence pairs, restricting generalizability and making independent verification difficult without access to source corpora.
- The research focuses on a single structural phenomenon (BEI passives) in one language pair, making it unclear whether findings scale to other structures or domains.
- Probing experiments lack details on training hyperparameters, limiting reproducibility and confidence in the representation analysis conclusions.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism by which fine-tuning with contrastive positive and negative evidence teaches MT models when to use or avoid a target structure based on semantic prosody, supported by clear experimental results showing improved accuracy.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that semantic prosody knowledge transfers from English-Chinese to Spanish-Chinese in multilingual models, as results show improvement but evidence is limited to one additional language pair.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that decoder representations are more enriched with semantic prosody information than encoder representations post-fine-tuning, as the lack of training details and narrow scope of the probe task reduce confidence.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate fine-tuning and evaluation: Independently reproduce the fine-tuning of NLLB-600M on the BEI dataset and measure accuracy improvements on the positive and negative evidence test sets, comparing results to the reported ~59% negative evidence accuracy post-fine-tuning.

2. Test cross-lingual transfer to additional languages: Extend the Spanish→Chinese transfer experiment to other source languages (e.g., French, German) to assess the robustness of the multilingual prosody transfer mechanism and evaluate whether the learned prosody awareness generalizes beyond structurally similar passives.

3. Probe deeper into representation layers: Conduct a more detailed analysis of layer-wise probing results, including visualization of accuracy trends across encoder and decoder layers, to investigate whether the reported ~4.5% decoder improvement is consistent across all layers and whether encoder improvements are as modest as claimed.
