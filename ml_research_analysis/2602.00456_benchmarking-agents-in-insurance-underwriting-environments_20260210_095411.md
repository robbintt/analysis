# Benchmarking Agents in Insurance Underwriting Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.00456
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00456
- Reference count: 4
- UNDERWRITE benchmark reveals significant reliability gaps in frontier models for insurance underwriting tasks

## Executive Summary
UNDERWRITE is an expert-first, multi-turn insurance underwriting benchmark designed to capture real-world enterprise workflow complexity. The benchmark evaluates 13 frontier models on 300 tasks incorporating proprietary business knowledge, noisy tool interfaces, and imperfect simulated users. Results show models frequently hallucinate domain-specific information despite tool access, with smaller models like GPT-5-Mini exhibiting up to 19% hallucination rates. Pass^4 evaluation revealed up to 20% drops in answer correctness, indicating substantial reliability gaps. While top models achieved 88% correctness, they weren't the most efficient and showed higher tool error rates.

## Method Summary
The study employed a comprehensive evaluation framework using the UNDERWRITE benchmark, which incorporates multi-turn interactions, proprietary business knowledge, and realistic tool interfaces. Thirteen frontier models were assessed across 300 insurance underwriting tasks using both standard and Pass^4 evaluation protocols. The benchmark design emphasizes expert involvement to capture authentic enterprise complexity, contrasting with existing benchmarks focused on open-domain tasks and narrow accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- Models frequently hallucinate domain-specific information despite tool access, with smaller models showing up to 19% hallucination rates
- Pass^4 evaluation revealed up to 20% drops in answer correctness, indicating significant reliability gaps
- Most accurate models achieved 88% correctness but weren't the most efficient and exhibited higher tool error rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The UNDERWRITE benchmark succeeds by incorporating realistic enterprise complexity that existing benchmarks overlook. By including proprietary business knowledge, noisy tool interfaces, and imperfect simulated users, it forces models to engage in careful information gathering rather than relying on surface-level pattern matching. This design reveals fundamental limitations in current agentic frameworks that manifest as hallucination and reliability issues in specialized domains.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-turn interaction patterns**: Essential for capturing the iterative nature of underwriting workflows where information gathering and verification occur across multiple exchanges
- **Tool interface reliability assessment**: Needed to distinguish between model capabilities and framework brittleness that skews performance metrics
- **Hallucination detection in specialized domains**: Requires compositional approaches beyond simple fact-checking due to domain-specific knowledge requirements
- **Efficiency-accuracy trade-offs**: Understanding how model performance varies across different operational constraints in enterprise settings
- **Expert involvement in benchmark design**: Critical for ensuring realistic evaluation that captures domain-specific complexities
- **Simulated user modeling**: Necessary for creating controlled evaluation environments that replicate real-world uncertainty

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: UNDERWRITE Benchmark -> Multi-turn Simulation Environment -> Model Evaluation Framework -> Pass^4 Validation -> Reliability Analysis

**Critical Path**: Model Selection → Task Execution → Tool Interface Interaction → Response Generation → Hallucination Detection → Reliability Assessment

**Design Tradeoffs**: Standard accuracy metrics vs. Pass^4 evaluation (revealed 20% performance gap), model size vs. hallucination rates (smaller models showed 19% hallucination), accuracy vs. efficiency (88% accurate models had higher tool errors)

**Failure Signatures**: Domain-specific hallucination despite tool access, significant performance drops in Pass^4 evaluation, efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, framework brittleness affecting tool interaction reliability

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare hallucination rates across different model families using the same tool interface to isolate model-specific vs. framework-specific failures
2. Evaluate Pass^4 performance on a subset of tasks to verify the 20% correctness drop across different evaluation rounds
3. Test efficiency metrics (time per task, tool error rates) for the 88% accurate models to quantify the operational cost of high accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on simulated user interactions may not fully capture actual underwriting scenarios
- The 13 model evaluations may not represent the full breadth of available frontier models, particularly newer or specialized insurance-focused models
- Proprietary business knowledge incorporation limits external validation and generalizability across different insurance domains

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Models frequently hallucinate domain-specific information even with tool access, and Pass^4 evaluation reveals significant reliability gaps (up to 20% drop in correctness).

**Medium confidence**: Smaller models like GPT-5-Mini showing 19% hallucination rates in product recommendation tasks, and the most accurate models (88% correctness) were not the most efficient with higher tool error rates.

**Medium confidence**: Expert involvement in benchmark design is essential for realistic evaluation, though broader applicability across different enterprise domains needs more empirical validation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct field trials with actual insurance underwriters using the same model configurations to validate simulated user results and assess real-world performance differences.

2. Expand the model evaluation set to include more specialized insurance-focused models and newer frontier models released after the study period to assess temporal generalizability.

3. Implement longitudinal studies tracking hallucination rates and tool error patterns across different time periods and data distributions to identify potential temporal drift in model performance.
