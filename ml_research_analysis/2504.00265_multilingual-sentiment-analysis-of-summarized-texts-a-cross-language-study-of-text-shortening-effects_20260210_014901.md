# Multilingual Sentiment Analysis of Summarized Texts: A Cross-Language Study of Text Shortening Effects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.00265
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00265
- Reference count: 35
- This study investigates how text summarization impacts sentiment analysis accuracy across multiple languages with varying morphological complexities.

## Executive Summary
This research examines the effects of text summarization on multilingual sentiment analysis performance across eight languages with different morphological complexities. The study compares extractive and abstractive summarization methods using both multilingual and language-specific models, revealing that extractive summarization better preserves sentiment accuracy, particularly in morphologically complex languages. The findings demonstrate that languages with rich inflectional morphology experience greater accuracy drops when summarized, while abstractive methods improve readability but introduce sentiment distortion. The work proposes hybrid approaches to balance these competing objectives for practical applications in social media monitoring and market analysis.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates sentiment analysis performance across eight languages using extractive and abstractive summarization methods. Researchers employed multilingual models (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) alongside language-specific models (FinBERT, AraBERT) to analyze datasets from languages including English, German, Finnish, Hungarian, Arabic, and others. The experimental design systematically compares sentiment accuracy before and after summarization, examining how different morphological complexities affect performance degradation. The research focuses on identifying optimal summarization strategies that balance sentiment preservation with readability improvements across diverse linguistic contexts.

## Key Results
- Extractive summarization better preserves sentiment accuracy than abstractive methods, especially in morphologically complex languages
- Morphologically rich languages (Finnish, Hungarian, Arabic) experienced up to 10% accuracy drops compared to English or German
- Abstractive summarization improves readability but introduces significant sentiment distortion requiring careful application

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The differential impact of summarization on sentiment analysis stems from the interaction between morphological complexity and semantic compression. In morphologically rich languages, sentiment-bearing words often carry critical morphological markers that signal emotional intensity or polarity. When summarization algorithms remove or alter these markers, the sentiment signal becomes distorted. Extractive methods preserve these morphological features by maintaining original word forms, while abstractive methods may generate simplified forms that lose sentiment-critical information. The effectiveness of multilingual models varies based on their training data coverage of different morphological types, with language-specific models often better capturing nuanced sentiment in their target languages.

## Foundational Learning

- **Morphological complexity and sentiment**: Understanding how inflectional morphology affects sentiment expression is crucial because languages like Finnish and Arabic encode emotional information in word endings and structures that summarization can disrupt. Quick check: Identify morphological markers that signal sentiment intensity in target languages.

- **Extractive vs abstractive summarization trade-offs**: Recognizing that extractive methods preserve original linguistic features while abstractive methods offer readability but risk semantic distortion is essential for choosing appropriate summarization strategies. Quick check: Compare sentiment preservation rates between methods on morphologically simple vs complex languages.

- **Multilingual model limitations**: Acknowledging that multilingual models have varying performance across languages due to training data imbalances helps explain why language-specific models sometimes outperform general models in sentiment tasks. Quick check: Evaluate model performance gaps between multilingual and language-specific approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Text -> Summarization Engine (Extractive/Abstractive) -> Sentiment Analysis Model (Multilingual/Language-Specific) -> Accuracy Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The sentiment preservation pipeline depends on maintaining morphological integrity through summarization. The critical sequence involves original text → morphological feature preservation during summarization → accurate sentiment classification → performance measurement.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study balances sentiment accuracy against readability, with extractive methods favoring accuracy and abstractive methods favoring readability. This creates a fundamental tension where optimal solutions likely require hybrid approaches that selectively preserve sentiment-critical morphological features while improving text flow.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation manifests as accuracy drops particularly in morphologically complex languages, with abstractive summarization showing higher failure rates due to generation errors and loss of sentiment markers. Abstractive methods also show increased hallucination risk when generating sentiment-bearing content.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test hybrid summarization approaches that combine extractive preservation of sentiment-bearing phrases with abstractive smoothing for readability.
2. Evaluate sentiment preservation across additional morphological types (agglutinative, fusional, isolating) to identify universal patterns.
3. Measure the impact of specific morphological features (case marking, verb conjugation) on sentiment accuracy preservation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The experimental scope is limited to eight languages with specific morphological characteristics, potentially limiting generalizability across all language families
- Performance metrics focus primarily on sentiment accuracy without comprehensive analysis of other summarization quality dimensions like coherence or factual consistency
- The study does not systematically explore hybrid approaches despite proposing them as potential solutions
- Domain-specific variations in summarization effectiveness are not accounted for, as all datasets come from similar social media contexts

## Confidence
- **High**: The core finding about differential impact on morphologically complex versus simpler languages is well-supported by consistent patterns across multiple language pairs
- **Medium**: The relative performance of extractive versus abstractive methods shows language-specific variations that may depend on implementation details and evaluation criteria
- **Low**: Proposed hybrid approaches remain largely theoretical without empirical validation in the current study

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed hybrid summarization methods empirically across the same language set to verify their effectiveness in balancing sentiment preservation with readability
2. Expand evaluation to include additional languages with different morphological typologies and domains beyond social media to assess generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of specific morphological features (case marking, agglutination, etc.) on sentiment preservation to better understand the mechanisms behind observed performance differences
