- Primary result: Achieves near-optimal regret rates for Lipschitz bandits with stochastic delayed feedback

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of Lipschitz bandits with stochastic delayed feedback, where rewards are observed after random delays. The authors propose two algorithms: Delayed Zooming for bounded delays and Delayed Lipschitz Phased Pruning (DLPP) for unbounded delays. Both algorithms achieve near-optimal regret rates, with DLPP showing superior performance on multi-dimensional problems. The key innovation is adapting Lipschitz bandit algorithms to handle delayed observations while preserving near-optimal regret rates.

## Method Summary
The paper tackles Lipschitz bandits with stochastic delayed feedback on continuous metric spaces. For bounded delays, the Delayed Zooming algorithm uses a lazy update mechanism that caches feedback until sufficient new observations accumulate. For unbounded delays, DLPP employs uniform round-robin sampling with scheduled intervals and elimination rules based on confidence radii. Both algorithms maintain covering oracles for the metric space and use confidence radius computations to balance exploration and exploitation. The methods handle synthetic reward functions including triangle, sine, and 2D multi-modal functions under uniform and geometric delay distributions.

## Key Results
- Delayed Zooming achieves regret Õ(T(dz+1)/(dz+2) + τmax T^dz/(dz+2)) for bounded delays
- DLPP achieves regret Õ(min_p∈(0,1]{(1/p)T(dz+1)/(dz+2) + Q(p)}) for unbounded delays
- Both algorithms maintain sublinear regret under various reward functions and delay distributions
- DLPP demonstrates superior performance on multi-dimensional problems compared to Delayed Zooming

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by adapting classic Lipschitz bandit techniques to account for delayed feedback. Delayed Zooming uses a lazy update mechanism that only processes new feedback when sufficient samples have accumulated, preventing premature confidence radius collapse. DLPP accumulates reliable feedback over scheduled intervals, ensuring sufficient samples before making elimination decisions. Both approaches maintain covering oracles to ensure complete space exploration while using confidence radii to focus on promising regions.

## Foundational Learning

**Covering Oracle**: A data structure that maintains ε-coverings of metric spaces, needed to efficiently explore continuous action spaces; quick check: verify complete coverage of [0,1] and [0,1]² at each iteration.

**Confidence Radius**: Statistical bounds on estimate uncertainty, needed to balance exploration-exploitation; quick check: confirm rₜ(x) decreases appropriately with sample count.

**Lazy Update Mechanism**: Caching feedback until sufficient samples accumulate, needed to prevent premature confidence radius collapse; quick check: verify vt(x)+1≤4vs(x) condition holds during execution.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Delayed Zooming -> Covering Oracle -> Lazy Update Cache -> Confidence Radius; DLPP -> Covering Oracle -> Round-Robin Sampling -> Elimination Rule -> Confidence Radius

**Critical Path**: Sampling action -> Observe delayed reward -> Update cache/statistics -> Compute confidence radius -> Elimination decision

**Design Tradeoffs**: Bounded delays allow simpler lazy update but limit applicability; unbounded delays require scheduled sampling but offer greater flexibility. Covering oracles provide efficient exploration but may incur computational overhead.

**Failure Signatures**: Confidence radius collapses prematurely; optimal balls eliminated due to insufficient samples; covering becomes incomplete.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify Delayed Zooming's lazy update by logging vₜ(x) and checking 4× threshold condition
2. Test DLPP's sample complexity by measuring v(B) values at elimination points
3. Validate covering oracle implementations by confirming complete coverage

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can Delayed Zooming be extended to handle unbounded delays while retaining regret guarantees? The lazy update mechanism fundamentally relies on bounded delays to guarantee suboptimality gap bounds.

**Open Question 2**: Can the gap between upper and lower bounds be tightened, particularly the ∆·Q(p) term and logarithmic factors? The current lower bound construction may not fully capture the difficulty of more general delay distributions.

**Open Question 3**: How do algorithms perform when delays are correlated with chosen arm or realized reward? The current analysis assumes independence, but real-world applications may have dependent delays.

## Limitations
- Assumes Lipschitz continuity with known constant L=1 and noise bounded in [0,1]
- Theoretical guarantees rely on covering oracle assumption with potential computational overhead
- Experiments focus on synthetic 1D and 2D problems, limiting scalability assessment
- Geometric delay assumption requires handling infinite delays, though probability is vanishing

## Confidence

**Regret bounds matching predictions**: High (confirmed by experimental results)
**Algorithm convergence**: Medium (empirical validation on limited problem classes)
**Covering oracle implementation**: Medium (implementation details not fully specified)

## Next Checks
1. Verify Delayed Zooming's lazy update mechanism by logging vₜ(x) and checking the 4× threshold condition holds throughout execution
2. Test DLPP's sample complexity guarantees by measuring v(B) values at elimination points across all trials
3. Validate covering oracle implementations by confirming complete coverage of the metric space at each algorithm iteration
