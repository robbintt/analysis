# CNOT Minimal Circuit Synthesis: A Reinforcement Learning Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23304
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23304
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: RL approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PMH algorithm for matrices larger than 8x8, with performance gap widening as matrix size increases

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the CNOT minimization problem in quantum computing, which seeks to find the shortest sequence of CNOT gates that transforms a given invertible binary matrix into the identity matrix. The problem is critical because CNOT gates are noisy and essential for quantum error correction. The authors propose a reinforcement learning approach using a single PPO2 agent trained on 8x8 matrices, then applied to larger matrices through embedding and Gaussian striping preprocessing techniques. The agent is trained using curriculum learning on increasingly complex matrices. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Patel-Markov-Hayes algorithm across three settings (rare, medium, and overcooked) for matrices larger than 8x8, with the performance gap widening as matrix size increases. The RL method reduces CNOT counts by approximately 2-3 gates compared to PMH for larger matrices.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a reinforcement learning approach to the CNOT minimization problem, training a single PPO2 agent on 8x8 matrices using curriculum learning. The agent is then applied to larger matrices through two preprocessing techniques: embedding for smaller matrices and Gaussian striping for larger ones. The Gaussian striping technique partitions larger matrices into smaller submatrices, solves each independently, and then reassembles the solutions. The RL agent learns to transform invertible binary matrices into identity matrices by selecting sequences of CNOT gates. The approach is evaluated against the Patel-Markov-Hayes algorithm across three circuit density settings: rare, medium, and overcooked.

## Key Results
- For matrices larger than 8x8, the RL approach consistently outperforms the PMH algorithm across all three circuit density settings
- Performance gap widens with matrix size, with RL reducing CNOT counts by approximately 2-3 gates compared to PMH for larger matrices
- The approach demonstrates effectiveness of curriculum learning and preprocessing techniques for scaling RL to larger quantum circuits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The reinforcement learning approach works by training an agent to recognize patterns in matrix transformations and select optimal CNOT gate sequences. The PPO2 algorithm's stability and sample efficiency make it well-suited for this discrete optimization problem. Curriculum learning allows the agent to gradually learn from simpler to more complex matrices, building robust pattern recognition capabilities. The Gaussian striping preprocessing technique effectively decomposes larger problems into manageable subproblems that the agent can solve efficiently, while embedding enables the transfer of learned strategies from smaller to larger matrices.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Matrix -> Preprocessing (Embedding/Striping) -> RL Agent (PPO2) -> CNOT Gate Sequence -> Identity Matrix

Critical Path: Input Matrix → Preprocessing → State Representation → Agent Action Selection → Gate Application → Reward Calculation → Policy Update

Design Tradeoffs: The approach trades computational complexity of RL training for superior optimization results compared to deterministic algorithms. Using a single agent across all matrix sizes simplifies deployment but may limit specialization for specific matrix types.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance on certain matrix structures, sensitivity to preprocessing parameter selection, and potential scalability limitations beyond tested matrix sizes.

First Experiments: 1) Validate RL agent performance on 8x8 matrices against PMH baseline, 2) Test embedding technique on 4x4 matrices, 3) Evaluate Gaussian striping on 16x16 matrices with different striping parameters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability beyond 16x16 matrices remains untested, creating uncertainty about performance on larger quantum circuits
- Gaussian striping requires manual configuration of striping parameters, potentially limiting applicability across diverse circuit types
- Performance depends heavily on curriculum learning strategy quality, with unclear sensitivity to training progression variations
- PPO2 superiority claim not thoroughly validated against alternative RL algorithms

## Confidence

High confidence in methodology effectiveness for matrices up to 16x16 based on presented experimental evidence.

Medium confidence in RL approach outperforming PMH for 8x8+ matrices, as results are demonstrated but not independently replicated.

Low confidence in approach performance on matrices larger than 16x16 due to lack of testing.

## Next Checks

1. Test the RL approach on matrices larger than 16x16 (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64) to evaluate true scalability limits

2. Compare PPO2 performance against other RL algorithms (PPO, DDPG, A3C) on the same problem to validate algorithm selection

3. Conduct ablation studies removing the curriculum learning strategy to quantify its contribution to performance improvements
