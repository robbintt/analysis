# A Scoping Review of the Ethical Perspectives on Anthropomorphising Large Language Model-Based Conversational Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.09869
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09869
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Mapping of ethically-oriented work on anthropomorphizing LLM-based conversational agents reveals attribution-based definitions, risk-focused framing, and need for empirical research linking effects to governance

## Executive Summary
This scoping review systematically mapped ethically oriented work on anthropomorphizing large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents (CAs). It analyzed 22 studies from 2021-2025 to understand how anthropomorphism is defined, the ethical challenges and opportunities it presents, and the methodological approaches used. The review found convergence on attribution-based definitions but divergence in operationalization, predominantly risk-focused ethical framing, and limited empirical work linking observed effects to governance guidance. The authors conclude that anthropomorphism in LLM-based CAs is a complex, context-dependent phenomenon requiring further empirical research and tailored governance strategies.

## Method Summary
The review employed PRISMA-ScR guidelines to systematically search 5 bibliographic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, ACM Digital Library) and 3 preprint repositories (arXiv, SSRN, PhilArchive), plus manual search of Communications of the ACM. A 4-block search string targeted anthropomorphism, technology, ethics, and time dimensions. Screening involved 2 stages (title/abstract → full-text) with 3 eligibility gates: CA/LLM-era focus, anthropomorphism as central construct, and explicit normative analysis. 10% of records underwent double-screening with target κ ≥ 0.76. Thematic synthesis was conducted across conceptual foundations, ethical framings, and methodological approaches.

## Key Results
- Attribution-based definitions of anthropomorphism dominate the literature, but operationalization varies widely across studies
- Ethical analyses predominantly focus on risks (miscalibrated trust, overreliance, over-disclosure) with limited exploration of potential benefits
- Methodological approaches are largely qualitative and theoretical, with scarce empirical work connecting observed effects to governance recommendations
- Convergence on attribution-based definitions despite methodological divergence in practice
- Need identified for longitudinal research on user reliance trajectories and context-sensitive governance strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The review's systematic approach captures the evolving discourse on LLM-based CA anthropomorphism by triangulating across multiple publication sources and applying rigorous screening criteria. The thematic synthesis method reveals both convergences (attribution-based definitions) and gaps (empirical grounding for governance) that would be obscured by narrower approaches. The inclusion of preprint repositories ensures capture of emerging work beyond traditional peer review timelines.

## Foundational Learning

**Attribution-based anthropomorphism**: Understanding that users attribute human-like qualities to CAs based on perceived agency, empathy, and social presence—why needed: forms the conceptual foundation for all ethical analysis; quick check: can distinguish between technical features and perceived human-like qualities.

**Cognitive-affective-social cue framework**: Recognizing that anthropomorphism arises from multiple dimensions of human-likeness perception—why needed: explains why simple design changes can have complex ethical implications; quick check: can identify which cues are being manipulated in a given CA design.

**Norm displacement phenomenon**: Awareness that repeated CA interactions can shift user expectations about appropriate human behavior—why needed: underlies concerns about long-term societal impacts; quick check: can articulate how CA use might change offline interpersonal norms.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Search execution -> Screening (Gate A: CA focus, Gate B: anthropomorphism centrality, Gate C: ethical analysis) -> Data charting -> Thematic synthesis

**Critical path**: Search string deployment → systematic screening → thematic coding → governance recommendations

**Design tradeoffs**: Breadth vs. depth tradeoff in search strategy (comprehensive databases vs. focused screening); publication bias vs. emerging research capture (peer-reviewed vs. preprint inclusion)

**Failure signatures**: Screening inconsistencies manifesting as inclusion/exclusion disagreements; thematic synthesis errors appearing as category overlap or missing themes

**First experiments**: 1) Execute database searches to verify record yield; 2) Pilot double-screening on 10% sample to assess inter-rater reliability; 3) Apply charting protocol to 3-5 pilot papers to test coding scheme

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How do cognitive, affective, and social cues interact to create "virtue-laden" attributions, and does a hierarchy of "low-stakes" vs. "high-stakes" anthropomorphism predict distinct harms? [explicit] Section 7 identifies need for investigating how attribution dimensions intertwine and for "a principled way to treat ‘low-stakes’ humanization versus... relational framings."

**Open Question 2**: What are the longitudinal trajectories of user reliance and attachment in high-stakes settings involving anthropomorphic CAs? [explicit] Section 7 identifies need for "longitudinal research capable of capturing cumulative... dynamics, such as reliance trajectories, dependency/attachment indicators."

**Open Question 3**: Which specific design interventions (e.g., frictional design, transparency controls) effectively mitigate risks like miscalibrated trust or over-disclosure? [explicit] The review concludes with recommendation for "governance-ready evaluation pipelines" connecting "measured mechanisms... to justified design and policy interventions."

## Limitations

- Small sample size (22 studies) may limit generalizability and overlook emerging perspectives
- Wide variation in anthropomorphism operationalization introduces inconsistencies in measurement and comparison
- Focus on explicitly normative analyses excludes studies examining effects without direct ethical framing, potentially biasing toward certain viewpoints
- Thematic synthesis provides descriptive rather than inferential insights, limiting causal conclusions

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Systematic methodology (PRISMA-ScR compliance, structured screening protocol, thematic synthesis approach) and convergence on attribution-based definitions of anthropomorphism

**Medium confidence**: Characterization of predominant risk-focused ethical framing and identification of limited empirical work linking effects to governance

**Low confidence**: Relative scarcity of positive opportunity framing and assertion that governance strategies remain underdeveloped, given small sample size and potential publication bias

## Next Checks

1. Replicate database searches using provided search strings to verify 1,841 record yield and assess search term effectiveness
2. Conduct inter-rater reliability assessment on fresh 10% sample to confirm κ ≥ 0.76 threshold and identify screening inconsistencies
3. Apply charting protocol to subset of included studies to verify extracted data alignment with thematic synthesis categories and coding consistency
