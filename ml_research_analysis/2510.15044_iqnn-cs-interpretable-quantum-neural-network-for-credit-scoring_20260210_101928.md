# IQNN-CS: Interpretable Quantum Neural Network for Credit Scoring

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.15044
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15044
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Interpretable quantum neural network achieving 100% accuracy on Dataset 1 and 77.3% on Dataset 2 for multiclass credit scoring

## Executive Summary
IQNN-CS introduces an interpretable quantum neural network framework for multiclass credit scoring that combines variational quantum circuits with post-hoc explanation techniques. The hybrid classical-quantum architecture incorporates a novel Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA) metric to assess attribution divergence across classes. Evaluated on two real-world credit datasets, the model achieved 100% accuracy on Dataset 1 and 77.3% on Dataset 2, with corresponding F1-scores of 1.00 and 0.78. The work demonstrates that interpretable QNNs can support transparent decision-making in high-stakes financial applications while providing insights into model reasoning through quantum embedding analysis.

## Method Summary
IQNN-CS employs a hybrid classical-quantum architecture where classical data is encoded into quantum states using amplitude encoding, processed through variational quantum circuits, and then measured to produce credit risk classifications. The framework integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for post-hoc interpretability, allowing attribution analysis of individual features. A novel Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA) metric quantifies the divergence in feature attributions across different credit risk classes, helping identify inconsistencies in model reasoning. The quantum circuits are trained using gradient-based optimization techniques adapted for quantum hardware constraints, with the entire system optimized end-to-end for both accuracy and interpretability.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% accuracy and F1-score of 1.00 on Dataset 1
- Achieved 77.3% accuracy and F1-score of 0.78 on Dataset 2
- ICAA metric successfully identified attribution inconsistencies, demonstrating utility in detecting unreliable model reasoning
- Interpretability analysis revealed well-separated quantum embeddings and consistent attributions in Dataset 1, while Dataset 2 showed overlapping clusters and ambiguous explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages quantum entanglement and superposition to create rich feature representations that classical neural networks cannot easily replicate. The variational quantum circuits learn optimal quantum state transformations that encode complex relationships between financial features and credit risk classes. The post-hoc interpretability through SHAP values combined with ICAA metric enables validation that the quantum model's reasoning aligns with domain knowledge, making the high-dimensional quantum embeddings interpretable and trustworthy for financial decision-making.

## Foundational Learning

**Variational Quantum Circuits**
- Why needed: Enable parameterized quantum operations that can be optimized for specific tasks
- Quick check: Verify circuit depth and parameter count match hardware constraints

**Quantum Embedding**
- Why needed: Transform classical credit features into quantum states for processing
- Quick check: Confirm embedding preserves feature relationships and distances

**SHAP Values**
- Why needed: Provide additive feature attribution for post-hoc interpretability
- Quick check: Validate Shapley values sum to model predictions and respect feature dependencies

**Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA)**
- Why needed: Quantify divergence in feature importance across different classes
- Quick check: Ensure metric values increase with decreasing interpretability

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Classical Input -> Amplitude Encoding -> Variational Quantum Circuit -> Measurement -> Classical Post-processing -> SHAP Analysis -> ICAA Metric

**Critical Path**
Data encoding and variational circuit optimization are the critical components, as they directly determine model accuracy and embedding quality. The ICAA metric computation depends on both the quantum circuit outputs and SHAP values.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Quantum circuit depth vs. hardware noise tolerance
- Interpretability vs. model complexity
- Training time vs. optimization quality
- Feature encoding granularity vs. quantum resource requirements

**Failure Signatures**
- Perfect accuracy on training data with poor generalization indicates overfitting
- Low ICAA values suggest consistent but potentially biased reasoning
- High ICAA values indicate unreliable or inconsistent model explanations
- Overlapping quantum embeddings suggest poor class separation

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Test model on additional credit scoring datasets to establish robustness
2. Conduct ablation study removing interpretability components to isolate their impact
3. Implement cross-validation to verify perfect accuracy isn't due to overfitting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Perfect 100% accuracy on Dataset 1 raises concerns about potential overfitting or dataset artifacts
- Significant performance drop to 77.3% on Dataset 2 indicates variable robustness across data distributions
- Limited evaluation on only two datasets restricts generalizability claims
- No comparison with state-of-the-art classical models on the same datasets

## Confidence
- **High**: Interpretability framework and ICAA metric development
- **Medium**: Performance results across the two datasets
- **Low**: Generalizability claims and quantum advantage assertions

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on multiple additional credit scoring datasets with varying sizes and characteristics to establish robustness patterns
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the interpretability components to isolate their impact on performance
3. Implement cross-validation and regularization techniques to verify that the perfect accuracy on Dataset 1 isn't due to overfitting
