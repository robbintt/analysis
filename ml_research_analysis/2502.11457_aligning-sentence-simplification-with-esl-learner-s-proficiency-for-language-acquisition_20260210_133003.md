# Aligning Sentence Simplification with ESL Learner's Proficiency for Language Acquisition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.11457
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11457
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: Reinforcement learning method for sentence simplification that aligns generated text with ESL learners' proficiency levels, achieving over 20% improvement in vocabulary frequency and diversity while maintaining high simplification quality.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach to sentence simplification that targets alignment with ESL learners' CEFR proficiency levels without requiring parallel training data. The method uses lexical constraints (target vocabulary coverage) and sentence-level CEFR classification as rewards within a Markov Decision Process framework. By combining token-level and sentence-level rewards, the approach significantly improves vocabulary coverage and diversity while maintaining high simplification quality. Human evaluations confirm the method's effectiveness in producing simplifications matching desired CEFR levels.

## Method Summary
The approach reformulates controlled sentence simplification as a Markov Decision Process, using reinforcement learning with PPO to guide a language model toward satisfying lexical and sentence-level constraints. The policy model (Phi-3-mini-3b with level-specific LoRA adapters) generates simplifications, while lexical rewards match generated tokens against EVP vocabulary lists with dynamic frequency penalties, and sentence-level rewards use a GPT-2 classifier trained on CEFR-SP data. Training uses synthetic complex sentences generated via GPT-4, eliminating the need for parallel corpora.

## Key Results
- Achieved over 20% improvement in target vocabulary frequency and diversity compared to baselines
- Maintained high simplification quality (LENS, SALSA scores) while aligning with target CEFR levels
- Successfully prevented reward hacking through dynamic lexical reward adjustment
- Human evaluations confirmed effectiveness in producing simplifications matching desired CEFR levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Reinforcement learning can discover simplification strategies that satisfy vocabulary and sentence-level constraints without parallel training data.
- **Mechanism:** The authors reformulate constrained simplification as a lookahead search problem within a Markov Decision Process. At each generation timestep, the policy model (an LLM) selects tokens that maximize expected future reward. PPO iteratively updates the policy to memorize successful search trajectories, using self-generated outputs as training data.
- **Core assumption:** The base LLM's inherent paraphrasing capability is sufficient for simplification; RL only needs to guide token selection toward constraint satisfaction.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "We achieve this without a parallel corpus by conducting reinforcement learning on a large language model." [Section 4.1] "Consider the text generation process as a Markov Decision Process... we can use any policy gradient algorithm to guide the language model to search for the generations that maximize the constraint satisfaction."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Combining token-level lexical rewards with sentence-level CEFR classification rewards enables simultaneous control over vocabulary coverage and overall difficulty.
- **Mechanism:** The lexical reward uses a heuristic matching generated tokens against EVP vocabulary lists (Disjunctive Normal Form constraints). The sentence-level reward uses a GPT-2 classifier trained via pairwise ranking loss on CEFR-SP data. These are linearly combined (R = λr + γrl) to produce the total optimization signal.
- **Core assumption:** Vocabulary usage and sentence-level difficulty are complementary signals that can be independently rewarded without conflict.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.3.1] "We use a simple heuristic to guide the search for generations that satisfy the lexical constraints." [Section 4.3.2] "We incorporate a sentence-level reward model by simulating human experts' judgment for the sentence's CEFR level."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Dynamic reward adjustment based on clause frequency prevents reward hacking and encourages vocabulary diversity.
- **Mechanism:** The lexical reward is modified to penalize frequently matched clauses. A clause Cj with high relative frequency pj receives exponentially decayed reward (e−αpj). This approximates entropy maximization across the target vocabulary, forcing exploration beyond a small subset of high-reward words.
- **Core assumption:** The model will otherwise converge to repeatedly generating the same high-reward vocabulary items (reward hacking observed in pilot experiments).
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.3.1, Eq. 3] Dynamic reward formula explicitly penalizes clauses with pj ≥ 1/m. [Figure 4] Training curves show count-only reward causes reward explosion and high KL (model collapse); dynamic reward stabilizes training.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire system targets CEFR levels (A1-C2) as the proficiency framework. Understanding that CEFR defines hierarchical competency bands is essential for interpreting "level i and i+1" constraints.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the authors target vocabulary from both level i and level i+1 for a learner at level i?

- **Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - **Why needed here:** PPO is the core training algorithm. Understanding that PPO constrains policy updates via a clipping objective (or KL penalty) helps explain why entropy regularization against the frozen reference model stabilizes training.
  - **Quick check question:** What problem does PPO solve compared to vanilla policy gradient, and how does the frozen reference model provide additional stability here?

- **Concept: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper trains separate LoRA adapters for each CEFR level while keeping the base model frozen. This is a parameter-efficient approach that enables level-specific control without full fine-tuning.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would separate LoRA adapters be preferable to a single model with level tokens for this task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Complex sentence → Policy model (with top-k sampling) → k simplification candidates → Each candidate → Lexical reward (vocabulary match + dynamic penalty) → Each candidate → Sentence reward (CEFR classifier score) → Combined reward → PPO loss with KL penalty from reference model → Gradient update to LoRA parameters only

- **Critical path:** 1. Complex sentence → Policy model (with top-k sampling) → k simplification candidates 2. Each candidate → Lexical reward (vocabulary match + dynamic penalty) 3. Each candidate → Sentence reward (CEFR classifier score) 4. Combined reward → PPO loss with KL penalty from reference model 5. Gradient update to LoRA parameters only

- **Design tradeoffs:** Separate models per level vs. unified model: Authors chose separate LoRAs for cleaner reward signals but note higher computational cost. Static vs. dynamic lexical reward: Dynamic reward requires per-epoch statistics but prevents collapse. Synthetic complex sentences vs. real data: Synthetic data enables unlimited training but may not cover all complexity patterns.

- **Failure signatures:** Reward explosion + high KL divergence: Model has collapsed to limited vocabulary (count-only reward without dynamic adjustment). High adequacy but low vocabulary frequency: Policy is paraphrasing well but ignoring lexical constraints (sentence reward dominating). High vocabulary match but low diversity: Model exploiting subset of target vocabulary (α too low or dynamic reward disabled).

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Reproduce ablation (Figure 2/6): Train vanilla model → add count reward → add dynamic reward → add sentence reward. Verify diversity increases at each step. 2. Validate lexical reward calibration: Vary α (e.g., 0.5, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5) and measure frequency vs. diversity tradeoff on a held-out set. 3. Test generalization to TurkCorpus: Apply level-specific models to unlabeled data; assess whether simplification quality (LENS/SALSA) degrades compared to CEFR-SP test.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can the method be extended to generate personalized simplifications based on an individual learner's specific vocabulary knowledge rather than broad CEFR levels? The conclusion states, "We plan to extend the method to generate individual learner-targeted personalized simplifications in the future." The current approach assumes the target vocabulary is accessible and relies on general CEFR levels, which do not account for the varied knowledge of different individuals.

- **Open Question 2:** Can the reward model be refined to enforce specific ratios of vocabulary levels (e.g., 95% level $i$ and 5% level $i+1$) to better adhere to the Input Hypothesis? The limitations section notes, "currently, we do not control the frequency to a specific number... which is an important aspect to consider according to the L2 learning theory." The current dynamic reward encourages diversity and coverage generally but lacks the granularity to enforce strict proportional constraints between current level ($i$) and next level ($i+1$) content.

- **Open Question 3:** Is it feasible to integrate rewards for multiple proficiency levels into a single unified model to improve computational efficiency? The limitations state, "The control... is implemented individually for different levels rather than using one model altogether... we seek to improve the design of reward model to integrate rewards... into one model." Training separate model copies (using specific LoRA parameters) for levels A, B, and C creates redundant computational loads and deployment complexity.

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to CEFR-SP dataset and single general simplification dataset (TurkCorpus)
- Synthetic complex sentences generated via GPT-4 rather than authentic learner materials
- Critical hyperparameters underspecified, making exact replication challenging
- CEFR classifier reliability depends on GPT-2 fine-tuned on CEFR-SP without independent validation
- Vocabulary assessment methodology lacks explicit word-sense disambiguation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core RL framework (PPO with lexical and sentence-level rewards) is technically sound and well-implemented. The dynamic reward adjustment mechanism effectively prevents reward hacking, as evidenced by training curves.
- **Medium Confidence:** The 20%+ improvement in vocabulary coverage and diversity is reproducible on the tested datasets. However, the magnitude of improvement may vary with different base models, datasets, or hyperparameter settings.
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about applicability to arbitrary languages and proficiency frameworks are speculative. The effectiveness of synthetic data generation for capturing authentic complexity patterns remains an open question.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Dataset Generalization Test:** Apply the trained models to a completely different simplification dataset (e.g., Newsela, OneStopEnglish) without further fine-tuning. Measure whether vocabulary coverage improvements and simplification quality metrics (LENS, SALSA) transfer to this new domain.

2. **Human Expert Validation of CEFR Alignment:** Conduct human evaluation studies where ESL teaching experts rate whether generated simplifications match target CEFR levels. Compare these judgments against the automated GPT-2 classifier scores to validate the sentence-level reward model's accuracy.

3. **Ablation Study with Real Complexity Sources:** Replace synthetic complex sentences with authentic complex sentences from ESL learner corpora (e.g., EFCAMDAT, LOCNESS). Train models from scratch and measure whether vocabulary coverage and diversity improvements persist when using real rather than synthetic complexity patterns.
