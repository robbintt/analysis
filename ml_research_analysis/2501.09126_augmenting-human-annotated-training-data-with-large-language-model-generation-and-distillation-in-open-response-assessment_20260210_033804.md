# Augmenting Human-Annotated Training Data with Large Language Model Generation and Distillation in Open-Response Assessment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.09126
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09126
- **Reference count:** 8
- **Primary result:** Hybrid approach combining human-coded data with GPT-4o-generated synthetic samples improves BERT classifier performance in open-response assessment, with optimal results at 80% synthetic to 20% human-coded ratio

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a hybrid methodology that augments human-annotated training data with synthetic samples generated by large language models to improve text classification performance in open-response assessment tasks. The approach involves fine-tuning a BERT classifier using both human-coded and LLM-generated data, followed by knowledge distillation into a smaller model. The researchers demonstrate that this method not only enhances classification accuracy but also provides a scalable solution that combines the precision of human coding with the diversity of LLM outputs. The work addresses a critical challenge in educational assessment by offering a practical way to reduce the time and cost associated with manual data annotation while maintaining or improving model performance.

## Method Summary
The methodology follows a three-stage process: first, human-annotated data is used to prompt GPT-4o to generate synthetic samples for training; second, these synthetic samples are combined with human-coded data in varying proportions (from 0% to 100% synthetic) to fine-tune a BERT classifier; and third, knowledge distillation is applied to transfer the learned representations from the BERT model to a smaller, more efficient model. The study systematically varies the temperature parameter during LLM generation (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) to control output diversity and evaluates the impact on classifier performance. This approach allows for controlled experimentation with the trade-off between synthetic data quantity and quality, while also addressing model efficiency through distillation.

## Key Results
- Classifier performance improves significantly when training data is augmented with synthetic samples, with optimal results achieved at an 80% synthetic to 20% human-coded data ratio
- Lower temperature settings (0.3) produce more stable improvements in classification performance, while higher settings (0.7+) introduce greater variability and inconsistent results
- Knowledge distillation successfully transfers performance from the BERT classifier to a smaller model without substantial loss in accuracy, improving computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach works by leveraging the complementary strengths of human expertise and LLM capabilities. Human coders provide high-quality, domain-specific annotations that capture nuanced understanding of the assessment criteria, while LLMs generate diverse synthetic samples that expand the training distribution and help the model generalize better to unseen data. The fine-tuning process allows the BERT classifier to learn from both sources, with the synthetic data helping to regularize the model and reduce overfitting to the limited human-annotated examples. The temperature parameter controls the trade-off between diversity and consistency in synthetic samples, with moderate values (around 0.3) providing optimal balance. Knowledge distillation then compresses the learned representations into a more efficient model without sacrificing the performance gains achieved through augmentation.

## Foundational Learning

**Text classification with BERT:** Fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models for specific classification tasks
- Why needed: BERT provides strong baseline performance but requires adaptation to domain-specific tasks
- Quick check: Verify BERT achieves reasonable baseline accuracy on held-out test set

**Knowledge distillation:** Transferring knowledge from large teacher models to smaller student models
- Why needed: Enables deployment of efficient models while retaining performance benefits
- Quick check: Compare student model performance against teacher model on validation set

**Synthetic data generation with LLMs:** Using prompts to generate training samples that expand the data distribution
- Why needed: Addresses data scarcity and annotation cost issues in supervised learning
- Quick check: Manually review generated samples for quality and relevance

**Temperature-controlled generation:** Adjusting randomness in LLM output to control diversity vs. consistency
- Why needed: Balances the trade-off between novel samples and reliable quality
- Quick check: Compare classification variance across different temperature settings

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Human-coded data → GPT-4o prompts → Synthetic samples → BERT fine-tuning → Knowledge distillation → Student model

**Critical path:** The most performance-sensitive steps are the synthetic data generation quality and the BERT fine-tuning process, as errors or biases introduced here will propagate through to the final model.

**Design tradeoffs:** The study balances synthetic data quantity (80% synthetic) against the need for high-quality human annotations, accepting some performance variability at higher temperatures to explore the diversity-performance trade-off.

**Failure signatures:** Poor synthetic data quality manifests as degraded classifier performance, especially at higher temperature settings; overfitting occurs when synthetic samples are too similar to training data or too noisy.

**First experiments:**
1. Test baseline BERT performance on held-out human-annotated test set
2. Generate synthetic samples at different temperature settings and manually evaluate quality
3. Compare classifier performance across different synthetic-to-human data ratios (0%, 20%, 50%, 80%, 100%)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Results are based on a single text classification task, limiting generalizability to other domains or assessment types
- The optimal 80% synthetic to 20% human-coded ratio is task-specific and may vary significantly across different applications
- The study does not address potential biases introduced by the LLM's training data or how these might affect the augmented dataset
- Long-term model stability and performance degradation over time with synthetic data augmentation are not evaluated

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Synthetic data augmentation improves classifier performance when properly balanced with human-coded data
- **Medium confidence:** The specific 80:20 ratio as optimal and temperature recommendations (0.3 for stability)
- **Low confidence:** Generalizability across different domains and tasks, and long-term model performance with synthetic data

## Next Checks
1. Test the augmentation approach across multiple diverse text classification tasks to establish robustness and identify domain-specific parameter requirements
2. Conduct a longitudinal study tracking model performance over time with synthetic data to assess stability and potential degradation
3. Perform bias analysis comparing synthetic samples to human-coded data to quantify and characterize potential distributional shifts introduced by LLM generation
