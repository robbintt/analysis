# From Distributional to Quantile Neural Basis Models: the case of Electricity Price Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14113
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14113
- Reference count: 35
- Introduces QNBM, a probabilistic forecasting method combining interpretability principles with end-to-end neural network training

## Executive Summary
This work presents the Quantile Neural Basis Model (QNBM), a novel approach for probabilistic forecasting that bridges the gap between interpretability and performance. QNBM extends the Neural Basis Model framework from distributional to quantile regression by replacing distribution parameter mappings with direct quantile mappings. The model leverages shared basis decomposition and weight factorization to avoid parametric distributional assumptions while maintaining competitive performance. Experimental results on German and Belgian electricity price forecasting demonstrate that QNBM achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art distributional and quantile regression neural networks while providing valuable interpretability through learned nonlinear mappings from input features to output predictions across the forecasting horizon.

## Method Summary
QNBM builds upon Neural Basis Models by replacing the final layers that map to distribution parameters with direct mappings to output-conditioned quantiles. The model employs a low-rank matrix factorization approach to manage computational overhead from large weight tensors during training. This factorization allows the model to learn a set of basis functions that can be combined to represent quantiles without assuming a specific parametric distribution. The architecture maintains the interpretability benefits of basis models while extending their capability to handle quantile regression tasks. The nonparametric nature of the quantile representation provides flexibility in modeling complex distributions, particularly addressing issues with excessive negative price spikes observed in traditional distributional models.

## Key Results
- QNBM achieves performance comparable to distributional and quantile regression neural networks in day-ahead electricity price forecasting
- The model provides valuable interpretability through learned nonlinear mappings from input features to output predictions
- QNBM addresses issues with excessive negative price spikes observed in distributional models
- The nonparametric quantile representation offers more flexible modeling than traditional parametric approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The QNBM approach works by decomposing the quantile regression problem into a shared basis representation followed by quantile-specific mappings. This decomposition allows the model to learn common patterns across all quantiles while maintaining flexibility in how each quantile responds to input features. The low-rank factorization of weight matrices enables efficient computation of the large number of parameters required for direct quantile mapping, making the approach computationally feasible. By avoiding parametric distributional assumptions, QNBM can adapt to the complex, potentially multimodal distributions often seen in electricity prices without being constrained by the limitations of assumed distributions.

## Foundational Learning

**Neural Basis Models** - A framework that decomposes complex functions into shared basis representations with learned weightings. Needed to understand the foundational architecture being extended to quantile regression. Quick check: Verify understanding of how basis decomposition enables interpretability.

**Quantile Regression** - A statistical technique for estimating conditional quantiles of a response variable. Needed to understand the specific forecasting task being addressed. Quick check: Confirm knowledge of how quantile regression differs from mean regression.

**Low-Rank Matrix Factorization** - A technique for decomposing large matrices into products of smaller matrices. Needed to understand the computational efficiency approach used in QNBM. Quick check: Validate understanding of how factorization reduces computational complexity.

**Probabilistic Forecasting** - The task of predicting probability distributions rather than point estimates. Needed to understand the broader context of the forecasting problem. Quick check: Ensure comprehension of why distributional forecasts are valuable in electricity markets.

**Electricity Price Dynamics** - The complex, often non-Gaussian behavior of electricity prices including spikes and multimodal distributions. Needed to understand the specific application domain. Quick check: Review typical characteristics of electricity price time series.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Features -> Basis Decomposition -> Low-Rank Factorization -> Quantile Mapping -> Output Quantiles

**Critical Path**: The most important components are the basis decomposition layer, the low-rank factorization mechanism, and the quantile mapping layers. These work together to enable both computational efficiency and the ability to learn complex quantile relationships.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff is between flexibility (nonparametric quantile representation) and computational complexity (large weight tensors). The low-rank factorization addresses this by reducing parameter count while maintaining representational power. Another tradeoff is between interpretability (through basis decomposition) and the potential loss of information when forcing representations through a shared basis.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include overfitting when the basis functions are insufficient to capture the complexity of the data, or underfitting when too many basis functions are used leading to poor generalization. The model may also struggle with very high-frequency data where the computational overhead becomes prohibitive despite factorization.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test QNBM on a simple synthetic dataset with known quantile structure to verify correct learning behavior. 2) Compare performance against a standard quantile regression neural network on the same synthetic data. 3) Evaluate the interpretability of learned basis functions by visualizing their response to input features.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational complexity analysis is incomplete, particularly regarding scalability of low-rank factorization for very large datasets
- Performance comparison limited to only two electricity markets, restricting generalizability across different market structures
- Interpretability claims lack rigorous quantitative validation methods
- Nonparametric nature may introduce overfitting risks in scenarios with limited training data

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core technical contribution of extending Neural Basis Models to quantile regression is well-supported. The computational efficiency claims regarding low-rank factorization are reasonably substantiated.

**Medium Confidence**: Performance claims of "competitive" results are supported but could benefit from more extensive benchmarking. Interpretability benefits are demonstrated qualitatively but lack quantitative validation metrics.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that QNBM specifically addresses excessive negative price spikes is not rigorously proven - improved behavior is shown but not systematically compared against spike frequency statistics.

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability Testing**: Evaluate QNBM's performance and training time on datasets 10-100x larger than the electricity price datasets used, particularly testing the low-rank factorization approach under extreme dimensionality.

2. **Interpretability Quantification**: Develop and apply quantitative metrics to measure the quality and reliability of interpretable insights extracted from QNBM, comparing these metrics against established benchmarks for model interpretability.

3. **Cross-Market Generalization**: Test QNBM on electricity markets with fundamentally different characteristics (e.g., US PJM, Australian NEM, or Nordic markets) to validate the approach's robustness across diverse market structures and price dynamics.
