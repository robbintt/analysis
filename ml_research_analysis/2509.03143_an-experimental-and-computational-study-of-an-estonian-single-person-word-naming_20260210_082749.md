# An experimental and computational study of an Estonian single-person word naming

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: DLM-based measures predicted most response variables in Estonian single-participant word naming except first fixation duration and number of fixations

## Executive Summary
This study combines word naming and eye-tracking in a mega-experiment with a single Estonian speaker to examine lexical processing mechanisms. The researchers measured five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation duration, number of fixations, naming latency, and spoken word duration) and analyzed them using generalized additive mixed models. They compared classical psycholinguistic predictors (word frequency, neighborhood density, paradigm size) with measures from the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM), including target correlation and contextual independence. The study found that DLM-based measures were powerful predictors for most response variables, particularly showing that form-to-meaning mappings influence temporal measures in naming tasks.

## Method Summary
The study employed a single-participant mega-experiment combining word naming with eye-tracking to examine lexical processing in Estonian. Five response variables were measured: first fixation duration, total fixation duration, number of fixations, naming latency, and spoken word duration. Generalized additive mixed models were used to analyze the data, comparing classical psycholinguistic predictors with measures from the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM). The DLM-based measures included target correlation and contextual independence, which capture form-to-meaning mapping properties. The analysis examined how well these different predictor sets explained variance across the five response variables.

## Key Results
- DLM-based measures were powerful predictors for all response variables except first fixation duration and number of fixations
- Models with DLM measures showed less predictor collinearity than classical models
- For total fixation duration, FIL and classical predictors performed equally well, while for naming latency and spoken word duration, classical predictors provided better fits
- DLM measures, based on form-to-meaning mappings, were predictive for temporal measures, indicating semantic involvement in the naming task
- Target correlation and contextual independence interact in predicting naming latency and spoken word duration, suggesting these measures capture distinct aspects of lexical processing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that form-to-meaning mapping properties captured by DLM measures can predict temporal aspects of word production, suggesting that lexical access involves semantic processing even in naming tasks. The finding that DLM measures interact with classical predictors indicates that both form-based and meaning-based processes contribute to word naming, with the relative importance varying by response variable. The reduced collinearity in DLM models suggests these measures capture complementary information about lexical processing that traditional predictors may miss.

## Foundational Learning
- **Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM)**: A computational model that captures form-to-meaning mappings in lexical processing; needed to understand how form properties predict semantic processing; quick check: review DLM's mathematical formulation for target correlation and contextual independence
- **Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs)**: Statistical models that allow for nonlinear relationships and random effects; needed to analyze the complex, non-linear patterns in eye-tracking and naming data; quick check: examine how GAMMs handle autocorrelation in temporal measures
- **Target correlation and contextual independence**: DLM measures that capture how uniquely a word form maps to its meaning and how context affects this mapping; needed to understand why DLM predicts temporal measures; quick check: calculate these measures for sample Estonian words
- **Paradigm size**: The number of inflectional forms a word has; needed as a classical predictor of processing difficulty; quick check: verify paradigm size calculations for Estonian nouns and verbs
- **Eye-tracking measures**: First fixation duration, total fixation duration, and number of fixations as indicators of lexical processing; needed to understand visual word recognition; quick check: review standard interpretation of these measures in reading research

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Word stimuli -> Eye-tracking system -> Naming response recording -> DLM measure calculation -> GAMM statistical analysis -> Result interpretation

Critical path: Stimulus presentation -> Visual processing (eye-tracking measures) -> Lexical access (naming latency) -> Articulation (spoken duration) -> Model fitting

Design tradeoffs: Single-participant design provides detailed individual data but limits generalizability; DLM measures capture semantic processing indirectly through form-to-meaning mappings rather than direct semantic measures

Failure signatures: Poor model fits may indicate violations of GAMM assumptions; unexpected predictor patterns may reflect individual processing strategies rather than language-wide principles

First experiments:
1. Test whether DLM measures predict eye-tracking outcomes in a different Estonian speaker
2. Compare DLM and classical model performance on lexical decision task data
3. Examine whether semantic priming affects the relationship between DLM measures and temporal outcomes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single-participant design limits generalizability across speakers and raises questions about individual versus language-wide processing patterns
- Lack of direct semantic predictors in the DLM model presents a limitation, as semantic involvement was inferred indirectly
- Varying predictive power of DLM versus classical models across response variables suggests findings may be task-dependent

## Confidence
- High: DLM measures are powerful predictors for most response variables except first fixation duration and number of fixations
- High: Models with DLM measures show less predictor collinearity
- Medium: Classical predictors perform better for naming latency and spoken word duration
- Low: Semantic involvement is demonstrated through DLM measures given indirect inference

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with multiple Estonian speakers to assess generalizability and identify individual versus language-wide patterns
2. Incorporate direct semantic measures (such as semantic similarity ratings or priming data) to validate the inferred semantic involvement through DLM measures
3. Test the DLM model on different lexical tasks (e.g., lexical decision, reading comprehension) to determine whether its predictive power is task-specific or represents a more general model of lexical processing
