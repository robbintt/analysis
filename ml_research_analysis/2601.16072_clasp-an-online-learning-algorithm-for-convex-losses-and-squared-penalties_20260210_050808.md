# CLASP: An online learning algorithm for Convex Losses And Squared Penalties

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.16072
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16072
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Key outcome**: Introduces CLASP, an online convex optimization algorithm with time-varying constraints, achieving improved regret and violation bounds.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents CLASP, an algorithm for online convex optimization with time-varying constraints. The algorithm minimizes cumulative loss while controlling constraint violations through squared penalties. CLASP operates by taking gradient steps with respect to the latest loss and projecting onto the current feasible set. The key innovation lies in using firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors to derive modular regret and violation bounds, providing significant improvements over prior work.

## Method Summary
CLASP updates by taking a gradient step with respect to the latest loss and projecting onto the current feasible set. The algorithm's analysis leverages the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, which allows for modular regret and violation bounds. The method is memory-efficient, requiring only one projection per iteration. The analysis naturally extends to multiple or persistent constraints, making it versatile for various constraint structures.

## Key Results
- For convex losses, CLASP achieves regret O(T^max{β,1-β}) and cumulative squared penalty O(T^(1-β)) for any β in (0,1).
- For strongly convex losses, CLASP provides the first logarithmic bounds on both regret and cumulative squared penalty, each O(log T).
- CLASP is memory-efficient, requiring only one projection per iteration.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm's effectiveness stems from the use of firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, which ensures that the distance to the projection does not increase. This property allows for tight bounds on both regret and constraint violations. The modular nature of the analysis means that improvements in either the loss or constraint handling can be analyzed independently, leading to a more robust algorithm.

## Foundational Learning
- **Firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors**: Essential for ensuring that projections do not increase distance, which is crucial for the regret and violation bounds. Quick check: Verify that the projection operator satisfies ||P(x) - P(y)||² ≤ ||x - y||² for all x, y in the space.
- **Online convex optimization**: The framework within which CLASP operates, focusing on minimizing cumulative loss over time. Quick check: Ensure that the loss functions are convex and that the feasible sets are convex and known in advance.
- **Strong convexity**: A property that enables logarithmic bounds on regret and violation. Quick check: Confirm that the loss functions satisfy the strong convexity condition, i.e., f(y) ≥ f(x) + ∇f(x)ᵀ(y-x) + (μ/2)||y-x||² for some μ > 0.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Loss function -> Gradient step -> Projection onto feasible set -> Updated decision variable
- **Critical path**: The algorithm's performance depends critically on the sequence of constraint sets being well-behaved (convex and known in advance).
- **Design tradeoffs**: The choice of β in (0,1) allows for a tradeoff between regret and violation bounds. Lower β favors regret, while higher β favors lower violation.
- **Failure signatures**: If the constraint sets are not convex or known in advance, the algorithm's performance may degrade. Additionally, if the projection onto the feasible set is computationally expensive, the memory efficiency claim may not hold.
- **First experiments**: 1) Test CLASP on a simple convex optimization problem with known constraints. 2) Evaluate the impact of different β values on regret and violation. 3) Benchmark projection efficiency for various constraint structures.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The analysis relies heavily on the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors and specific parameter tuning (β in (0,1)), which may limit practical applicability if these conditions are violated.
- The strong convexity assumption, while enabling logarithmic bounds, is stronger than necessary for many applications and may not hold in practice.
- The algorithm's performance depends on the sequence of constraint sets being well-behaved (convex and known in advance), which may not reflect real-world scenarios with dynamic or adversarial constraint changes.

## Confidence
- **High**: Regret and violation bounds for convex losses
- **High**: Logarithmic bounds for strongly convex losses
- **Medium**: Memory efficiency claims
- **Medium**: Extension to multiple constraints

## Next Checks
1. Test CLASP on non-strongly convex problems where β must be carefully tuned to balance regret and violation.
2. Evaluate performance when constraint sets are not known in advance or change adversarially.
3. Benchmark projection efficiency for complex constraint structures beyond simple convex sets.
