# An Agent-Based Framework for Automated Higher-Voice Harmony Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.24463
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24463
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** Introduces a multi-agent system for automated higher-voice harmony generation with four specialized AI agents.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel multi-agent system for automated higher-voice harmony generation, addressing the challenge of creating musically coherent accompaniments from a given melody and chord progression. The framework decomposes the complex task into four specialized agents: Music-Ingestion, Chord-Knowledge, Harmony-Generation, and Audio-Production. By leveraging a hybrid approach combining symbolic knowledge bases with deep learning models, the system achieves both interpretability and musical validity. The architecture demonstrates how agentic decomposition can modularize music generation tasks while maintaining coherence between melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic components.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a sequential pipeline of four specialized agents working together to generate harmonies. The Music-Ingestion Agent parses MusicXML files to extract melody and chord sequences, which are then passed to the Chord-Knowledge Agent for chord symbol interpretation using a Chord-Former Transformer. The Harmony-Generation Agent employs a Harmony-GPT model combined with a Rhythm-Net RNN to compose harmonically complementary lines that align with both the melody and chord progression. Finally, the Audio-Production Agent renders the symbolic score into high-fidelity audio using a GAN-based Symbolic-to-Audio Synthesizer. The system uses a hybrid approach combining rule-based symbolic knowledge with data-driven neural models to ensure musical validity while enabling creative generation.

## Key Results
- Multi-agent architecture successfully modularizes harmony generation into interpretable components
- Chord-Former Transformer achieves accurate chord symbol interpretation through multi-label classification
- Harmony-GPT combined with Rhythm-Net produces harmonically consonant and rhythmically complementary lines
- GAN-based synthesizer generates high-fidelity audio output from symbolic representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by decomposing the complex task of harmony generation into specialized sub-tasks that can be handled by purpose-built models. The Chord-Knowledge Agent provides explicit musical rules and constraints, ensuring harmonic validity, while the Harmony-GPT model learns probabilistic patterns from training data to generate musically plausible lines. The Rhythm-Net component adds temporal coherence by predicting appropriate note durations that complement the melody's rhythm. This hybrid symbolic-statistical approach allows the system to maintain musical correctness while enabling creative variation. The sequential pipeline ensures that each agent's output becomes the next agent's input, creating a coherent flow from raw musical data to final audio output.

## Foundational Learning
- **Concept:** Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) - Why needed here: The core architectural paradigm of decomposing harmony generation into independent, communicating entities. Quick check: Can you explain why the authors chose four agents instead of one large model, and what the primary benefit of this modularity is?
- **Concept:** Transformer Models (Encoder-Only vs. Decoder-Only) - Why needed here: The system relies on different transformer architectures for different tasks. Quick check: Based on Section 3.5, which agent uses an encoder-only transformer and why is that architecture appropriate for its specific task?
- **Concept:** Constrained Decoding / Guided Generation - Why needed here: The harmony generation isn't purely probabilistic but uses a hybrid system with a symbolic knowledge base to guide the AI's creative process. Quick check: How does the Chord-Knowledge Agent influence the output of the Harmony-Generation Agent during the note selection process?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Music-Ingestion Agent (Librarian) → Chord-Knowledge Agent (Theorist) → Harmony-Generation Agent (Composer) → Audio-Production Agent (Conductor)
- **Critical path:** The core creative output depends entirely on the Harmony-Generation Agent. If this agent fails, the entire purpose of the system is defeated. Its two sub-components, Harmony-GPT and Rhythm-Net, must be functioning and their outputs correctly combined.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Modularity vs. Efficiency (agentic design improves maintainability but likely increases computational overhead), Data-Driven vs. Rule-Based (hybrid approach improves correctness but may limit creative "rule-breaking").
- **Failure signatures:** Empty or Incorrect Pitches (Chord-Knowledge Agent fails to parse chords), Rhythmic Incoherence (Rhythm-Net fails to predict appropriate durations), Audio Artifacts (GAN synthesizer produces glitches or unnatural timbres).
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Run a single melody through the Music-Ingestion Agent to verify parsing, 2) Query the Chord-Knowledge Agent directly with standard and complex chord symbols, 3) Generate a harmony for a short, simple melody and analyze the final audio output.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** Can the integration of a hierarchical planning agent effectively resolve the current limitation regarding long-term structural coherence in extended compositions? The paper identifies "Global Structure and Long-Term Coherence" as a limitation and proposes "Hierarchical Structural Planning" as future work to address this.
- **Open Question 2:** How can the framework be adapted to support real-time Human-Computer Creative Interaction (HCCI) without compromising audio fidelity due to computational latency? The paper lists "Limited Interactivity" as a key challenge and explicitly targets "Enhancing Musical Interactivity" as a future direction.
- **Open Question 3:** To what extent does the "agentic" decomposition of tasks result in error propagation compared to monolithic end-to-end models? The paper asserts modularity is beneficial but does not provide comparative failure analysis against non-agentic baselines to determine if the "handshake" between agents introduces cumulative inaccuracies.

## Limitations
- **Dataset Identity Unknown:** The paper refers to a "large-scale corpus" without specifying exact datasets, creating reproducibility barriers.
- **Missing Hyperparameters:** Critical architectural details like number of layers, hidden dimensions, and attention heads are absent for core neural components.
- **Long-term Incoherence:** The framework lacks explicit mechanisms for global structural planning, resulting in locally coherent but structurally aimless harmonies over extended passages.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The multi-agent framework's modular design principles and sequential pipeline architecture are clearly defined and theoretically sound.
- **Medium Confidence:** The reported training procedures (loss functions, optimizers, epochs/steps) are sufficiently detailed for implementation, though actual performance cannot be verified without full specifications.
- **Low Confidence:** Claims regarding the system's ability to generate "musically coherent harmonies" and GAN synthesizer effectiveness are difficult to evaluate without quantitative metrics or user studies.

## Next Checks
1. **Architectural Fidelity Test:** Implement Chord-Former and Harmony-GPT with assumed hyperparameters and train on Lakh MIDI dataset to assess if core generation capability is preserved.
2. **Knowledge Base Isolation Test:** Evaluate Chord-Knowledge Agent's chord-to-pitch mapping accuracy on comprehensive set of chord symbols to isolate symbolic reasoning component reliability.
3. **Longitudinal Coherence Test:** Generate harmonies for melodies of increasing length and conduct qualitative analysis of structural coherence to identify when lack of global planning becomes perceptually problematic.
