# Debiasing Machine Learning Predictions for Causal Inference Without Additional Ground Truth Data: "One Map, Many Trials" in Satellite-Driven Poverty Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.01341
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01341
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Novel post-hoc correction methods restore unbiased treatment effect estimates from satellite-based poverty predictions without new ground-truth data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical bottleneck in using machine learning (ML) for causal inference: shrinkage bias in predictions leads to attenuated treatment effect estimates. The authors focus on Earth observation (EO) poverty mapping, where ML models trained on satellite imagery produce predictions that are systematically pulled toward the mean. This shrinkage introduces Berkson-type measurement error, biasing downstream causal analyses. To solve this without costly new data collection, the authors introduce two post-hoc correction methods—Linear Calibration Correction (LCC) and Tweedie's correction—that operate on out-of-sample predictions. Evaluated across simulations and real-world Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data, both methods substantially reduce mean absolute error and restore calibration, with Tweedie's correction achieving up to 10-fold error reduction and calibration slopes near 1.0. These methods enable the "one map, many trials" paradigm, allowing a single ML-generated map to support multiple causal analyses without retraining or new labeled data.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce two novel post-hoc correction methods to debias ML predictions for causal inference without requiring additional ground truth data. Linear Calibration Correction (LCC) applies a global linear transformation to rescale out-of-sample predictions, directly addressing shrinkage bias. Tweedie's correction uses a local, density-based adjustment derived from the Berkson error model and Tweedie's formula, leveraging the empirical distribution of predictions to estimate and correct for systematic bias. Both methods assume Berkson-type measurement error and operate solely on out-of-sample predictions, avoiding the need for model retraining or new labeled data. The methods were tested using simulated data with known ground truth and real-world satellite-derived poverty predictions matched to DHS wealth index data. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and calibration slope—the latter measuring bias in treatment effect estimates. Tweedie's correction achieved up to 10-fold reduction in MAE and restored calibration slopes to near 1.0, indicating unbiased treatment effect estimates.

## Key Results
- Tweedie's correction reduced mean absolute error by up to 10-fold compared to uncorrected predictions
- Both LCC and Tweedie's correction restored calibration slopes to near 1.0, indicating unbiased treatment effect estimates
- The methods enable "one map, many trials" paradigm, allowing reuse of ML-generated maps for multiple causal analyses without new data collection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core mechanism exploits the Berkson error structure inherent in ML predictions used for causal inference. When predictions are used as proxies for true outcomes, the shrinkage bias (predictions pulled toward the mean) acts as a Berkson error—errors-in-variables where the mismeasured variable is the predictor. Tweedie's formula, originally from information theory, provides a way to estimate the true underlying distribution from the observed (shrunken) distribution under this error model. By leveraging the empirical density of out-of-sample predictions, Tweedie's correction estimates the systematic bias and applies a local, density-based adjustment to restore calibration. LCC uses a simpler, global linear transformation to achieve similar ends. Both methods avoid the need for new ground truth by assuming that the out-of-sample prediction errors follow the Berkson structure and that the empirical distribution contains sufficient signal to estimate and correct the bias.

## Foundational Learning
- **Berkson error model**: Errors-in-variables structure where the mismeasured variable is the predictor, not the outcome; needed to justify the error structure assumed by the correction methods; quick check: verify that ML predictions are used as predictors in downstream causal models
- **Tweedie's formula**: Information-theoretic result that allows estimation of the true underlying distribution from the observed distribution under Berkson error; needed to derive the local density-based correction; quick check: confirm that the empirical density of out-of-box predictions is used to estimate bias
- **Calibration slope**: Statistic measuring the relationship between predicted and true outcomes in causal inference; slope < 1 indicates attenuation bias (shrunken estimates); needed to quantify bias in treatment effect estimates; quick check: compute calibration slope on test data to assess bias
- **Shrinkage bias**: Systematic tendency of ML predictions to be pulled toward the mean, especially for extreme values; needed to understand the source of attenuation in causal estimates; quick check: compare mean and variance of predictions to true outcomes
- **Out-of-sample predictions**: Predictions made on data not used during model training; needed because corrections operate on these to avoid overfitting; quick check: ensure corrections are only applied to hold-out or test predictions
- **Mean absolute error (MAE)**: Metric for prediction accuracy; needed to quantify improvement from corrections; quick check: compute MAE before and after correction on test set

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: ML model -> out-of-sample predictions -> correction method (LCC or Tweedie) -> debiased predictions -> causal inference
- **Critical path**: Out-of-sample predictions → Tweedie's correction (or LCC) → debiased predictions → unbiased treatment effect estimation
- **Design tradeoffs**: LCC is simpler and faster (global linear adjustment) but may be less accurate for complex bias patterns; Tweedie's is more sophisticated (local, density-based) and achieves higher accuracy but requires estimation of empirical densities
- **Failure signatures**: If the Berkson error assumption is violated (e.g., non-classical measurement error), corrections may fail or introduce new bias; if out-of-sample predictions are themselves highly biased or poorly calibrated, corrections may be insufficient; if the outcome is not continuous (e.g., binary), the methods may not apply directly
- **First experiments**: (1) Apply LCC and Tweedie's correction to a simulated dataset with known ground truth and Berkson error structure; (2) Compare calibration slopes before and after correction on real-world satellite-derived poverty predictions; (3) Benchmark MAE and bias in treatment effect estimates across correction methods and uncorrected predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Methods assume Berkson-type measurement error; validity in non-EO or non-classical error settings is unproven
- Both corrections rely on out-of-sample predictions; high initial model bias or poor generalization may limit effectiveness
- Focus is on continuous outcomes (wealth indices); applicability to binary or categorical targets requires further validation

## Confidence
- Technical soundness of correction methods: High
- Empirical performance on tested data: High
- Assumed error structure and broad applicability: Medium
- Scalability and performance in non-EO contexts: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test Tweedie's correction on non-EO ML prediction tasks with known ground truth to assess generalizability
2. Benchmark correction performance when the initial ML model is heavily biased or underfits
3. Extend the methods to multi-class or binary outcomes and evaluate calibration and causal inference accuracy
