# SPARK: Adaptive Low-Rank Knowledge Graph Modeling in Hybrid Geometric Spaces for Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.11094
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11094
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves 10.8% improvement in Recall@10 over the best baseline on Amazon-Book dataset

## Executive Summary
SPARK introduces a multi-stage framework to address knowledge graph (KG) noise, sparsity, and long-tail entity challenges in recommendation systems. The method employs Tucker low-rank decomposition for robust KG preprocessing, hybrid geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operating in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, and an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy. Contrastive learning aligns multi-source representations to enhance recommendation quality. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance gains, particularly for long-tail item recommendation.

## Method Summary
SPARK tackles KG-based recommendation by first preprocessing the knowledge graph using Tucker low-rank decomposition to reduce noise and redundancy. It then applies hybrid geometric GNNs that learn representations in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, leveraging the strengths of each geometry for different types of relational patterns. An adaptive fusion mechanism, guided by item popularity, dynamically combines these representations. Contrastive learning is used to align representations from multiple sources, improving robustness and generalization. The framework is evaluated on standard recommendation benchmarks, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves 10.8% improvement in Recall@10 over the best baseline on Amazon-Book dataset
- Demonstrates consistent gains across three real-world datasets
- Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of each component, especially hyperbolic geometry and SVD initialization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SPARK's effectiveness stems from its multi-faceted approach to KG-based recommendation. Low-rank decomposition reduces noise and sparsity, enabling cleaner signal extraction. Hybrid geometric spaces capture both hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships, with hyperbolic space better modeling tree-like structures common in KGs. The adaptive fusion strategy ensures that long-tail items, which are often underrepresented, receive appropriate attention during learning. Contrastive alignment improves representation consistency across data sources, leading to more robust recommendations.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge Graph (KG) Noise and Sparsity**
- *Why needed*: Real-world KGs contain incomplete or erroneous relations, hurting recommendation accuracy
- *Quick check*: Evaluate performance drop when injecting synthetic noise into KG

**Low-Rank Decomposition (Tucker)**
- *Why needed*: Reduces KG dimensionality and filters out irrelevant or noisy triples
- *Quick check*: Compare model performance with and without low-rank preprocessing

**Euclidean vs Hyperbolic Spaces**
- *Why needed*: Hierarchical KGs benefit from hyperbolic geometry; non-hierarchical from Euclidean
- *Quick check*: Visualize embeddings to confirm hierarchical vs non-hierarchical structure

**Item Popularity Imbalance**
- *Why needed*: Long-tail items are underrepresented and harder to recommend accurately
- *Quick check*: Measure recall@K separately for head and tail items

**Contrastive Learning for Representation Alignment**
- *Why needed*: Aligns representations from different data sources, improving robustness
- *Quick check*: Evaluate embedding similarity before and after contrastive alignment

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
KG Preprocessing (Tucker) -> Hybrid GNN (Euclidean + Hyperbolic) -> Adaptive Fusion -> Contrastive Alignment -> Recommendation Output

**Critical Path**
1. Tucker low-rank decomposition reduces KG noise and sparsity
2. Hybrid GNN learns dual-space embeddings
3. Adaptive fusion balances head/tail item contributions
4. Contrastive learning aligns multi-source representations
5. Final recommendation is generated

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Low-rank decomposition simplifies KG but may lose rare but important relations
- Hybrid geometry increases model complexity but improves representation fidelity
- Adaptive fusion helps long-tail items but requires accurate popularity estimation

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance on datasets with non-hierarchical KGs
- Overfitting to head items if popularity estimation is inaccurate
- Degraded performance if contrastive learning is poorly tuned

**First Experiments**
1. Evaluate performance with only Euclidean or only hyperbolic GNN
2. Test adaptive fusion with uniform (non-adaptive) weighting
3. Remove contrastive learning and measure impact on recommendation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on pre-defined low-rank structures may limit adaptability to evolving KG dynamics
- Hyperparameter choices (e.g., rank K, manifold dimensions) are not fully justified
- Hybrid GNN assumes Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces are sufficient, which may not generalize to all KG structures

## Confidence
- **High**: Empirical results and ablation studies
- **Medium**: Theoretical guarantees and generalization across datasets
- **Low**: Robustness under dynamic or noisy KG updates

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SPARK on datasets with different KG characteristics (e.g., social networks, biological graphs)
2. Test the impact of varying low-rank ranks and manifold dimensions on performance
3. Assess the method's robustness under incremental KG updates and noise injection
