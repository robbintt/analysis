# Reasoning LLMs are Wandering Solution Explorers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20296
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20296
- Reference count: 40
- This paper investigates whether large language models can perform systematic problem solving or merely wander through solution spaces.

## Executive Summary
This study examines whether reasoning large language models (RLLMs) can perform systematic problem solving or merely wander through solution spaces. The authors formalize systematic exploration using three properties: validity (following reachability rules), effectiveness (reaching goal states), and necessity (avoiding redundant states). Through case studies on eight computational tasks, they identify common failure modes including invalid reasoning steps, redundant explorations, and unfaithful conclusions. Quantitative analysis reveals that all tested models exhibit wandering behavior with performance degrading exponentially as problem complexity increases.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates six RLLMs on eight structured computational tasks using format-constrained prompts requiring symbolic trace outputs. Models are tested with temperature=0.6, top-p=0.95, and max_tokens=32768 on an Nvidia H100. The evaluation measures solution coverage ratio and classifies failures into validity (boundary violations, procedure omissions, incorrect backtracking), effectiveness (state staleness, execution errors, unfaithful conclusions), and necessity (state revisitation, infinite self-loops) categories. Open-source models are run 10 times each while API models run once.

## Key Results
- All tested RLLMs, including state-of-the-art commercial systems, exhibit wandering behavior with exponential performance degradation as task complexity increases
- Wandering exploration causes performance to decay exponentially with depth due to multiplicative error accumulation
- Current models can appear competent on shallow tasks (low depth, high solution multiplicity) while lacking systematic capability, creating misleading benchmark results
- Specific failure modes arise from transformer architecture's lack of explicit state-tracking, backtracking, and memory-management mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Exponential Degradation from Wandering
- Claim: Wandering exploration causes performance to decay exponentially as task depth increases, not merely linearly.
- Mechanism: At each decision point, the model has probability pw of omitting a branch; across d binary decisions, success probability drops as ps(d) = 1 − (1 − qw^(d−1))^m. This multiplicative error accumulation is fundamental to structureless search.
- Core assumption: The probability of branch omission is relatively constant per decision and independent across steps; the model does not improve its exploration discipline with depth.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1]: "Eq. (1) reveals that success probability drops exponentially with d for wandering RLLMs."
  - [abstract]: "performance degrading exponentially as problem complexity increases"
  - [corpus]: Related work on reasoning strategies (Thinking Machines survey) notes similar degradation but without formal derivation
- Break condition: If models developed depth-aware exploration discipline (reducing pw as depth increases), or if search spaces have strong heuristics guiding toward goals, exponential decay would not hold.

### Mechanism 2: Failure Mode Cascade from Missing Architectural Primitives
- Claim: Specific, predictable failure modes arise directly from transformer architecture's lack of explicit state-tracking, backtracking, and memory-management mechanisms.
- Mechanism: Transformers generate tokens autoregressively without stack-based state management, leading to (1) boundary violations (no global constraint tracking), (2) incorrect backtracking (no call stack), (3) state revisitation (no visited-set), (4) state staleness (no working memory refresh).
- Core assumption: These failures are architectural, not merely training-data or scale issues; larger models with same architecture exhibit same qualitative failures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1.1]: "The RLLM relies excessively on short-horizon local information...and fails to maintain awareness of global constraints"
  - [section 4.1.3]: "Language models maintain the exploration sequence through a linear chain-of-thought, lacking stack-based state management"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus evidence on architectural primitives; related work focuses on training/inference techniques rather than architecture
- Break condition: If process supervision, explicit state tokens, or external memory were integrated into the architecture, these failure modes would be reduced or eliminated.

### Mechanism 3: Competence Illusion from Plateau Effect
- Claim: Wandering models can appear highly competent on shallow tasks (low depth, high solution multiplicity) while lacking systematic capability, creating misleading benchmark results.
- Mechanism: When multiple goal states exist (m > 1) and depth is low, even low qw values yield high success rates; Fig. 1 shows "plateaus" where ps > 0.995 despite systematic deficits. Evaluations on such tasks produce false confidence.
- Core assumption: Current benchmarks are biased toward low-depth, high-m problems that mask exploration deficits.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1, Fig. 1]: "When m > 1, 'plateaus' (where ps > 0.995, marked red) appear and could cause misbeliefs about the RLLM's capabilities"
  - [abstract]: "current models' performance can appear to be competent on simple tasks yet degrade sharply as complexity increases"
  - [corpus]: Corpus papers on mathematical reasoning evaluation touch on benchmark limitations but do not formalize the plateau effect
- Break condition: If benchmarks systematically included high-depth, low-m problems, or if evaluation included trace analysis (not just final answers), the illusion would be broken.

## Foundational Learning

- **State-Space Search Formalization**:
  - Why needed here: The paper defines systematic exploration via properties (validity, effectiveness, necessity) on traces through a state space; understanding search as trace validation is essential to grasp the failure mode taxonomy.
  - Quick check question: Given a problem with states S, transitions T, initial state s0, and goals G, can you identify whether a trace J satisfies validity, effectiveness, and necessity?

- **Test-Time Computation (TTC) Techniques**:
  - Why needed here: The paper critiques TTC methods (Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, verifiers, long reasoning) as enabling longer but not better thinking; understanding what TTC does and doesn't provide clarifies the gap.
  - Quick check question: Does sampling multiple chains or exploring reasoning trees guarantee systematic coverage of the solution space? Why or why not?

- **Transformer Limitations for Systematic Reasoning**:
  - Why needed here: The paper attributes failures to architectural lacks (no explicit state tracking, no backtracking mechanism, no stack/memory); recognizing these as structural, not just scale, issues is critical.
  - Quick check question: What architectural components would a system need to reliably maintain a visited-set, backtrack to correct parent states, and refresh working memory after state changes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - Current RLLMs: Transformer backbone + TTC wrappers (CoT, ToT, verifiers) operating over token sequences
  - Missing components (per paper): explicit state representation layer, visited-set maintenance module, stack-based backtrack controller, working memory refresh mechanism, trace validity auditor
  - Evaluation layer: Current benchmarks assess final-answer accuracy; proposed additions include trace validity, search completeness, coverage metrics

- **Critical path**:
  1. Define task-specific state formalizations (as paper does for 8 computational tasks)
  2. Instrument model traces with structured step annotations (e.g., CHECK/BACKTRACK/STATE format)
  3. Build rule-based auditors for validity, effectiveness, necessity
  4. Measure failure mode frequencies across depth/m parameters
  5. Architect and integrate missing primitives (start with external visited-set and backtrack controller as external tools)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - External tool integration vs. architectural modification: External tools (visited-set, stack) are easier to add but may not be invoked reliably; architectural changes are harder but enforce systematicity
  - Trace-level supervision vs. outcome-only training: Process supervision requires annotating reasoning traces at scale but directly targets failure modes; outcome-only training is cheaper but leaves systematicity unaddressed
  - Format-constrained evaluation vs. natural-language reasoning: Constrained formats enable automated auditing but may not reflect real-world deployment; natural-language traces are realistic but harder to audit

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Boundary violation: Model generates indices/coordinates outside problem bounds; check for consistency with problem size constraints
  - State revisitation: Identical or semantically equivalent states appear multiple times in trace; detect via hashing or equivalence checking
  - Incorrect backtracking: After backtrack, model resumes from wrong parent state; detect by comparing post-backtrack state to expected stack top
  - Unfaithful conclusion: Final answer contradicts or omits steps visible in trace; detect by comparing answer to trace summary

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate permutation task experiment: Run same task across depths 20-2000 on multiple models with constrained output format; measure solution coverage ratio; expect exponential decay
  2. Failure mode frequency analysis: On a fixed task (e.g., 24 Game), classify each error step into the taxonomy; compute failure mode distribution per model
  3. Augmentation pilot: Add explicit visited-set tracking (via tool call or prompt instruction) to one model; compare failure mode frequencies and coverage to baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How should model architectures be designed to enable structured search?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list this as the first open research challenge in Section 5, questioning whether to scale end-to-end models or integrate new components like stacks or symbolic modules.
- Why unresolved: Transformer-based LLMs lack inductive biases for explicit state tracking, memory management, or backtracking—core mechanisms in traditional search-based systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of architectures with integrated search controllers or symbolic modules that demonstrate superior performance on the validity, effectiveness, and necessity metrics defined in the paper compared to standard Transformer models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What training signals are needed to develop systematic reasoning capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly pose this as the second research challenge in Section 5, asking whether systematic search can emerge through learning or must be hard-coded.
- Why unresolved: Current models are optimized for coherent text generation rather than reasoning through structured problem spaces, lacking specific incentives for disciplined exploration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful training runs utilizing process supervision, step-level rewards, or structured search imitation that result in models consistently satisfying the properties of systematic exploration.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we evaluate and detect breakdowns in systematic reasoning effectively?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Listed as the third research challenge in Section 5, the authors note that current benchmarks often miss rapid degradation on deeper tasks.
- Why unresolved: Evaluation tools currently focus on final outputs rather than the structure of the reasoning process, allowing models to appear competent on small benchmarks despite lacking robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: The creation of benchmarks that assess solution trace validity, search completeness, and coverage metrics, specifically identifying the "performance collapse" threshold mentioned in the paper.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What other failure modes exist in RLLM exploration beyond those defined?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] In Appendix B, the authors note that "additional failure models likely exist" and cite "premature abandonment" as an example that is difficult to formally define and measure.
- Why unresolved: The current taxonomy covers validity, effectiveness, and necessity, but suboptimal reasoning patterns like strategic persistence failures are hard to detect quantitatively.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of RLLM traces on a wider variety of tasks revealing new, formally definable categories of exploration errors.

## Limitations

- The study's core findings rest on controlled experiments with format-constrained traces, which may not generalize to naturalistic problem-solving scenarios.
- The architectural claims about transformer limitations are well-grounded but remain largely correlative - we cannot definitively prove that missing primitives cause the observed failures versus training data or optimization artifacts.
- The exponential degradation model assumes constant wandering probability across depth, which may not hold if models develop implicit depth-aware strategies.
- The benchmark bias toward shallow tasks is convincingly demonstrated but quantifying the full extent of this illusion across the broader LLM evaluation landscape requires broader empirical validation.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The three properties of systematic exploration (validity, effectiveness, necessity) are clearly defined and their violation patterns are observable across multiple tasks and models. The failure mode taxonomy is well-supported by concrete examples and reproducible across different problem instances.
- **Medium confidence**: The exponential degradation model for wandering behavior is mathematically sound and fits the quantitative data, but the assumption of constant wandering probability per decision point needs more empirical validation across diverse problem structures.
- **Medium confidence**: The competence illusion from plateau effects is clearly demonstrated in the permutation task experiments, but the claim that current benchmarks are systematically biased requires broader investigation across the full landscape of LLM evaluation datasets.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization to unconstrained reasoning**: Replicate the systematic exploration analysis on the same 8 tasks but with naturalistic Chain-of-Thought traces (no format constraints). Compare failure mode frequencies and solution coverage to determine if the observed patterns persist in realistic deployment scenarios.

2. **Architectural intervention validation**: Implement and test an augmented RLLM with explicit visited-set tracking (via external tool or dedicated tokens). Run the permutation task experiment and measure changes in solution coverage ratio and failure mode distribution to directly test whether the proposed architectural primitives address the identified deficits.

3. **Cross-benchmark validation**: Systematically analyze a representative sample of current LLM benchmarks (including mathematical reasoning, commonsense QA, and code generation tasks) for depth and solution multiplicity characteristics. Quantify how many benchmarks fall into the "plateau zone" where competence illusion is likely, and identify which would better reveal systematic exploration deficits.
