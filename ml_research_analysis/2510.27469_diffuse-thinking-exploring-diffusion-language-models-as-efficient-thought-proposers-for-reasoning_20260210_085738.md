# Diffuse Thinking: Exploring Diffusion Language Models as Efficient Thought Proposers for Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.27469
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27469
- Authors: Chenyang Shao; Sijian Ren; Fengli Xu; Yong Li
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Proposed DLM-LLM collaboration framework achieves higher accuracy and throughput on reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines, with accuracy of 0.29 and throughput of 0.40 on Trip-Planning task.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Diffuse Thinking, a novel framework that integrates diffusion language models (DLMs) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance reasoning efficiency in complex tasks. The approach leverages DLMs to generate multiple candidate reasoning steps in parallel, while LLMs evaluate and select the most promising solutions. Through experiments on four benchmarks including Game of 24, Trip-Planning, GPQA, and ARC-C, the method demonstrates significant improvements in both reasoning accuracy and computational throughput compared to existing approaches. The collaborative framework shows promise for scaling reasoning capabilities in large language models while maintaining efficiency.

## Method Summary
The Diffuse Thinking framework operates through a two-stage collaborative process where DLMs and LLMs work together to solve reasoning tasks. In the first stage, DLMs generate multiple candidate reasoning steps in parallel, leveraging their ability to explore diverse solution paths efficiently. In the second stage, LLMs evaluate these candidates and select the most promising ones for further processing. This division of labor allows the system to benefit from the parallel generation capabilities of DLMs while maintaining the evaluation precision of LLMs. The framework is designed to handle complex reasoning tasks that require multiple steps and diverse solution approaches, addressing the limitations of sequential reasoning in traditional LLM-only approaches.

## Key Results
- On Trip-Planning benchmark, achieved accuracy of 0.29 and throughput of 0.40, outperforming prior approaches
- Demonstrated consistent improvements across four diverse reasoning benchmarks: Game of 24, Trip-Planning, GPQA, and ARC-C
- Showed higher accuracy and throughput compared to baseline methods while maintaining computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from the complementary strengths of DLMs and LLMs. DLMs excel at parallel generation and exploration of multiple solution paths, while LLMs provide strong evaluation and selection capabilities. By using DLMs for efficient candidate generation and LLMs for quality assessment, the system can explore a broader solution space while maintaining high standards for final outputs. This division of labor reduces the computational burden on LLMs while leveraging their superior reasoning capabilities for the critical selection task.

- Thought Proposing: Why needed - To generate intermediate reasoning steps efficiently; Quick check - Validate quality of proposed thoughts

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input -> DLM Generator -> Candidate Pool -> LLM Evaluator -> Selected Solution

**Critical Path:** The critical path flows from DLM generation through LLM evaluation to final solution selection. DLMs generate multiple candidates in parallel, which are then processed by the LLM evaluator. The bottleneck typically occurs at the LLM evaluation stage, as it must assess multiple candidates while maintaining reasoning quality.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades off some computational overhead (maintaining both DLM and LLM components) for improved reasoning efficiency and accuracy. The parallel generation capability of DLMs reduces the sequential processing burden on LLMs, but requires careful coordination between components. The evaluation threshold for candidate selection must balance between being too permissive (accepting poor solutions) and too restrictive (discarding potentially good paths).

**Failure Signatures:** System failures typically manifest as either poor candidate generation from DLMs (leading to limited solution diversity) or overly conservative LLM evaluation (rejecting viable solutions). Performance degradation may also occur when reasoning tasks require domain-specific knowledge not captured in the pre-trained models.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test parallel candidate generation with varying numbers of DLMs to find optimal throughput
2. Evaluate LLM performance on different candidate selection strategies (e.g., top-1 vs top-k selection)
3. Measure accuracy improvements when varying the ratio of DLM candidates to LLM evaluation capacity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit areas for future research include scalability to larger reasoning tasks, integration with specialized domain knowledge, and optimization of the collaborative framework for different reasoning domains.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to four benchmarks, raising questions about generalization to broader reasoning domains
- Absolute performance gains, while promising, still leave room for improvement (e.g., accuracy of 0.29 on Trip-Planning)
- Computational overhead of maintaining both DLM and LLM components not fully addressed
- Lack of comparison with state-of-the-art reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 or similar test-time scaling approaches

## Confidence

| Novelty of the collaborative framework approach | High |
| Broader applicability and scalability of the method | Low |

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Testing**: Evaluate the method on a wider range of reasoning tasks, including those outside the current benchmarks, to assess scalability and robustness.

2. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Models**: Benchmark against leading reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 or other test-time scaling approaches to contextualize performance gains.

3. **Scalability and Efficiency Analysis**: Investigate the computational overhead and resource requirements of the DLM-LLM collaboration framework, particularly for large-scale or real-time applications.
