# Growing Perspectives: Modelling Embodied Perspective Taking and Inner Narrative Development Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.11868
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11868
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: This work investigates how developmental stage influences the perspective-taking and collaborative abilities of large language models.

## Executive Summary
This study explores how developmental theory can be integrated into large language models to enhance perspective-taking and collaborative performance. The researchers adapted Selman's developmental theory to evaluate GPT-4o's ability to generate and use internal narratives aligned with different developmental stages during an extended director task. The PerspAct system, which combines the ReAct paradigm with explicit perspective taking, was evaluated on task efficiency and accuracy. The findings demonstrate that GPT-4o can reliably generate developmentally appropriate narratives before interaction, though it tends to shift toward more advanced stages during dialogue. Higher developmental stages generally enhance collaborative performance, while earlier stages show greater variability, particularly in dynamic environments.

## Method Summary
The study employed an adapted version of the director task where GPT-4o was prompted to simulate different developmental stages of perspective taking. Using Selman's developmental theory as a framework, the researchers evaluated how well the model could generate internal narratives appropriate to each stage and use them during collaborative tasks. The PerspAct system integrated the ReAct paradigm with explicit perspective-taking capabilities, allowing the model to generate and follow developmental stage-specific narratives. Task performance was measured in terms of efficiency and accuracy across different developmental stages, with particular attention to how these narratives evolved during the course of interaction.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o reliably generates developmentally appropriate narratives before interaction but tends to shift toward more advanced stages during dialogue
- Higher developmental stages generally enhance collaborative performance, while earlier stages show greater variability
- The integration of developmental theory into LLM frameworks shows promise for modeling embodied perspective taking

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The PerspAct system leverages the ReAct paradigm's combination of reasoning and action to enable LLMs to engage in perspective-taking tasks. By incorporating explicit developmental stage narratives based on Selman's theory, the system provides structured internal dialogue that guides the model's interpretation of social situations. The LLM's ability to generate contextually appropriate narratives allows it to simulate different developmental stages, creating a scaffold for more nuanced perspective-taking. This approach bridges the gap between abstract developmental theory and practical LLM applications by providing concrete narrative structures that the model can use to navigate social interactions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Selman's developmental theory**: A framework for understanding how perspective-taking abilities evolve through distinct developmental stages, essential for creating developmentally appropriate narratives
- **ReAct paradigm**: Combines reasoning and action to enable LLMs to generate task-specific internal narratives and make decisions based on those narratives
- **Embodied perspective taking**: The ability to understand and simulate others' viewpoints in collaborative tasks, crucial for measuring the practical impact of developmental narratives
- **Director task methodology**: A standard experimental paradigm for assessing perspective-taking abilities through collaborative object placement tasks
- **Internal narrative generation**: The LLM's capacity to create and maintain coherent mental models of different developmental stages during interaction

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: PerspAct -> ReAct integration -> Developmental stage narratives -> Task execution -> Performance evaluation
- **Critical path**: Narrative generation → Stage alignment → Task execution → Performance assessment
- **Design tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes developmental appropriateness over raw task performance, accepting variability in earlier stages to capture more realistic developmental progression
- **Failure signatures**: Models tend to advance developmental stages during interaction rather than maintaining stage consistency; early stages show higher variability in dynamic environments
- **First experiments**:
  1. Validate developmental appropriateness of generated narratives using blinded human evaluators
  2. Test PerspAct across multiple LLM architectures to identify model-specific versus general patterns
  3. Isolate whether stage advancement results from interaction dynamics or selection bias

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies entirely on GPT-4o, limiting generalizability across different model architectures
- The adaptation of Selman's theory to LLM contexts remains theoretical rather than empirically validated against developmental psychology benchmarks
- Qualitative assessment of "developmentally appropriate" narratives introduces subjective elements that may affect reproducibility

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: GPT-4o's ability to generate different perspective-taking narratives (task reliability)
- **Medium confidence**: The general pattern of stage advancement during dialogue (observed but requires mechanistic explanation)
- **Medium confidence**: Correlation between developmental stage and collaborative performance (statistically observed but causal mechanisms unclear)
- **Low confidence**: The developmental appropriateness of generated narratives (based on theoretical adaptation rather than empirical validation)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study across multiple LLM architectures (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) to assess model-specific versus general patterns
2. Implement blinded human evaluation of narrative developmental appropriateness to validate the theoretical framework's application
3. Design controlled experiments to isolate whether observed stage advancement results from interaction dynamics or selection bias
