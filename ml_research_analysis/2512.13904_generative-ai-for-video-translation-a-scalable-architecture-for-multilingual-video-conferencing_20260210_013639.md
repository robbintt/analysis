core_contribution: This paper tackles the real-time deployment challenges of cascaded
  generative AI pipelines for video translation in multi-user conferencing scenarios.
  The key issues are the cumulative latency from sequential model inference and the
  quadratic computational complexity when each participant processes streams from
  all others.

- Real-time video translation for multilingual conferencing with cascaded GenAI pipeline

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time video translation for multilingual video conferencing. The authors propose a two-fold solution: a Token Ring turn-taking mechanism that reduces computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N), and a Segmented Batched Processing protocol that enables smooth playback through overlapping buffering after an initial startup delay. A proof-of-concept system was implemented and evaluated across RTX 4060, T4, and A100 GPUs, achieving τ<1.0 (real-time throughput) on modern hardware. User studies validated that the predictable initial delay is acceptable in exchange for uninterrupted playback, with high Mean Opinion Scores for vocal quality and delay acceptability.

## Method Summary
The system implements a 4-stage cascaded GenAI pipeline (ASR→MT→TTS→LipSync) with modular design using PyTorch 2.1.0 and CUDA 12.1. The Token Ring protocol enforces single active speaker processing, while Segmented Batched Processing segments input into fixed-length chunks with overlapping buffering. Models used include Whisper 3.1.1 (ASR
