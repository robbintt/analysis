# Probabilistic Foundations of Fuzzy Simplicial Sets for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03899
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03899
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Introduces probabilistic framework showing fuzzy simplicial sets arise as marginals of probability measures over standard simplicial sets, explaining UMAP weights as arising from distributions over Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a probabilistic foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, demonstrating that every finite fuzzy simplicial set can be generated by a probability distribution over classical simplicial sets. The framework interprets fuzzy weights as marginal probabilities of simplex existence, providing theoretical justification for UMAP's weighting scheme as arising from sampling Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales. The authors develop ČUMAP, a Čech-based variant that better preserves global structure through triangle-based constraints, and demonstrate improved global structure preservation on various datasets while maintaining comparable local structure quality.

## Method Summary
The authors define a probability distribution over standard simplicial sets where fuzzy weights correspond to marginal probabilities of simplex existence. For UMAP, they show exponential weighting emerges from sampling VR filtrations at random scales using an exponential distribution. The framework enables systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods by choosing different probability distributions over scales. ČUMAP extends this by using Čech complexes based on triangles rather than edges, with weights determined by minimal enclosing ball circumradii. The optimization minimizes fuzzy cross-entropy between high-dimensional and low-dimensional simplicial set distributions.

## Key Results
- Every finite fuzzy simplicial set can be generated by a probability distribution over standard simplicial sets
- UMAP's exponential weights arise from sampling Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales (exponential distribution over r)
- ČUMAP (Čech-based variant) better preserves global structure while maintaining comparable local structure preservation to UMAP
- Experiments show ČUMAP improvements in Procrustes alignment and persistent homology metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Fuzzy simplicial set membership weights can be interpreted as marginal probabilities of simplex existence in standard (crisp) simplicial sets.
- **Mechanism**: The framework defines a probability distribution $p$ over the space of standard simplicial sets. The weight $\mu(\sigma)$ of a simplex is defined as the probability that a randomly sampled simplicial set contains the minimal simplicial set generated by $\sigma$ (i.e., $\mu(\sigma) = P(S \geq S(\sigma))$).
- **Core assumption**: The underlying vertex set is finite, and the partial order of face/degeneracy maps strictly enforces weight monotonicity.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "introduces a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets."
  - [section 3] Definition 11 and Proposition 1 establish that marginal maps induce valid fuzzy weights compatible with face maps.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found for this specific derivation; related papers focus on applications rather than theoretical foundations.
- **Break condition**: If the probability distribution is not consistent with the simplicial structure (Definition 12), the derived weights may violate the monotonicity required for degeneracy maps.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: UMAP's exponential weighting scheme arises from sampling Vietoris-Rips (VR) filtrations at random scales.
- **Mechanism**: Instead of a fixed distance threshold, a scale $r$ is sampled from a probability distribution $p(r)$. A fuzzy weight is generated by integrating over the filtration. Specifically, using an exponential distribution $p(r) \sim \exp(-r)$ yields UMAP's standard weights $\mu \sim \exp(-d)$, effectively representing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the pairwise distance.
- **Core assumption**: The "local" pseudo-metrics in UMAP can be treated as separate metric spaces whose fuzzy representations are merged via probabilistic sum (t-conorm).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris–Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions."
  - [section 3.2] Example 5 derives the explicit formula $\mu([x_i, x_j]) = \exp(-d/\nu)$ from an exponential distribution over scales.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence links UMAP specifically to random scale filtrations; corpus papers focus on manifold priors or computational scaling.
- **Break condition**: If the independence assumption between edges (Remark 7) is violated, the Fuzzy Cross-Entropy loss diverges significantly from the true KL-divergence of the underlying simplicial set distributions.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Replacing the edge-based Vietoris-Rips complex with a triangle-based Čech complex better preserves global geometry via "triplet" constraints.
- **Mechanism**: Weights are computed for 2-simplices (triangles) based on the radius of the minimal enclosing ball (circumradius). The optimization uses a triplet cross-entropy loss that penalizes discrepancies in the probability of triangle formation between high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces.
- **Core assumption**: Triangles with large circumradii in the high-dimensional space should remain "open" (large circumradius) in the low-dimensional space to prevent topological tearing and global collapse.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "experiments... show ČUMAP better preserves global structure... as measured by... Procrustes alignment."
  - [section 4.2] Equation (70) defines the weighting based on circumradius; Figure 8 shows improved global scores.
  - [corpus] "Understanding and Improving UMAP..." mentions topological tearing and structural collapse, validating the need for geometric priors.
- **Break condition**: If the dataset is dominated by obtuse triangles, the Čech condition reduces to the Vietoris-Rips condition (Section 4.2), negating the benefit of the more complex filtration.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Simplicial Sets & Posets
  - **Why needed here**: The paper models data topology as a hierarchy of vertices, edges, and triangles (simplices). Understanding the partial order (poset) structure is required to define how probability "flows" from higher-order simplices to their faces.
  - **Quick check question**: If a triangle has a weight of 0.8, what must be true about the weights of its three edge faces? (Answer: They must be $\geq 0.8$).

- **Concept**: T-norms and T-conorms
  - **Why needed here**: These are the mathematical operators used to "merge" fuzzy sets. UMAP specifically uses the probabilistic sum t-conorm to combine local neighborhoods.
  - **Quick check question**: If two local neighborhoods overlap with weights 0.6 and 0.7, what is the merged weight using the probabilistic sum $a+b-ab$? (Answer: $0.6 + 0.7 - (0.6 \times 0.7) = 0.88$).

- **Concept**: Cross Entropy vs. KL Divergence
  - **Why needed here**: The paper clarifies that UMAP minimizes Fuzzy Cross Entropy, which acts as a proxy for KL-divergence only under strict independence assumptions.
  - **Quick check question**: Does minimizing Cross Entropy require the target distribution to be a true probability distribution summing to 1? (Answer: No, it works on fuzzy weights which are local and need not sum to 1 globally).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (X) -> Probabilistic Generator (p(S)) -> Marginalizer (μ(σ)) -> Merger (t-conorm) -> Low-Dim Optimizer (Fuzzy Cross Entropy)
- **Critical path**: The mapping from distance metric to probability distribution p(r) to fuzzy weight μ. This determines the "sensitivity" of the embedding to local vs. global structure.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **VR (Standard)**: Uses only edges; computationally cheap; assumes independence; prone to global structure collapse.
  - **Čech (ČUMAP)**: Uses triangles; computationally expensive (triplet sampling); captures curvature; better global preservation.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - **"Clumping"**: If the scale distribution p(r) is too narrow, the CDF steepens, causing binary-like weights and loss of fine local structure.
  - **Topological Tearing**: If using VR without higher-order constraints, loops may be torn open in the embedding to satisfy local distance preservation.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Verify UMAP Derivation**: Replicate standard UMAP results by explicitly defining p(r) as an exponential distribution and verifying the derived weights match UMAP's binary edge weights.
  2. **Procrustes Comparison**: Run ČUMAP on a dataset with known global structure (e.g., MNIST or COIL-20) and measure the Procrustes alignment score against standard UMAP to quantify global preservation.
  3. **Ablation on Distribution Shape**: Replace the exponential distribution p(r) with a Weibull distribution (Section 4.1) and plot the change in cluster separation vs. trustworthiness to visualize the attraction-repulsion tradeoff.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can combining the triplet-based loss of ČUMAP with UMAP's edge-weighting scheme produce embeddings that improve upon both methods simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Discussion: "One immediate extension is to combine the triplet-based loss with the edge-weighting scheme of UMAP, which the probabilistic formulation developed here accommodates directly."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates ČUMAP and UMAP separately but does not implement or evaluate a hybrid approach that leverages both higher-order simplex information (triangles) and pairwise edge weights.
- What evidence would resolve it: An implementation of a combined loss function incorporating both edge and triplet terms, evaluated on standard benchmarks showing improvements in local trustworthiness, global structure preservation, and topological fidelity compared to either method alone.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the visual smoothness defects in ČUMAP embeddings (spurious points, less smooth clusters) be remedied while preserving its advantages in global structure and topology?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 4.2.1, the authors note: "Qualitatively, we note however that the embeddings are often less smooth with more spurious points" and "we leave improvements of such defects open for future work."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a practical limitation but does not investigate its causes or propose algorithmic modifications to address it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified sampling strategies, regularization terms, or alternative training procedures that reduce spurious points in ČUMAP embeddings, demonstrated through visual inspection and quantitative cluster compactness metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between the rank-order preserving loss derived from the Markovian structure of VR filtrations and established ordinal embedding methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 4.3: "The connection of such a loss to ordinal embeddings or non-metric-multidimensional scaling, where also the preservation of rank-order is the objective, might be an interesting direction for further work."
- Why unresolved: The paper derives a factorization of KL divergence that encourages distance rank preservation but does not empirically or theoretically connect this to existing ordinal embedding literature.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments between the derived Markovian loss and ordinal embedding methods (e.g., non-metric MDS), along with theoretical analysis establishing formal relationships or equivalences.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can closed-form approximations for density-scaled local metrics be developed for triangles and higher-order simplices in the Čech filtration?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that for edges, density-adjusted rescaling has a simple closed form, "However, for triangles, no such simple closed form characterization under rescaling is available" and they consequently omit local rescaling in ČUMAP.
- Why unresolved: The paper defers to a global scale factor instead of developing local density adaptation for higher-order simplices, potentially limiting ČUMAP's ability to handle varying data density.
- What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of tractable approximations for locally rescaled triangle weights, with experiments showing improved embeddings on datasets with heterogeneous density compared to the global scaling approach.

## Limitations
- Independence assumption between edges may lead to systematic biases in Fuzzy Cross Entropy approximation
- Computational complexity of triplet sampling limits ČUMAP's scalability to large datasets
- Circumsphere-based weighting assumes uniform point distribution, which may not hold for heterogeneous data
- Limited empirical validation across diverse dataset types and sizes

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The mathematical derivation of fuzzy weights as marginals of probability distributions (Section 3)
- **Medium Confidence**: The equivalence between exponential scale sampling and UMAP's standard weighting (Section 3.2)
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that Čech-based weighting universally improves global structure preservation

## Next Checks
1. **Independence Assumption Stress Test**: Create synthetic datasets with varying degrees of neighborhood overlap (from sparse to highly clustered). Measure the divergence between Fuzzy Cross Entropy and true KL divergence as a function of overlap density.

2. **Distribution Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the scale distribution parameters (exponential rate, Weibull shape) across multiple datasets. Quantify the tradeoff between local structure preservation (trustworthiness) and global structure retention (Procrustes, PH metrics).

3. **Computational Scalability Benchmark**: Compare VR vs. Čech implementations on datasets ranging from 1,000 to 100,000 points. Measure both runtime and embedding quality degradation to establish practical limits of the Čech approach.
