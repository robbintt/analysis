# Refine Medical Diagnosis Using Generation Augmented Retrieval and Clinical Practice Guidelines

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.21615
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21615
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework achieving Precision@1 of 0.941 on hypertension diagnosis

## Executive Summary
GARMLE-G is a Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language models in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to address the misalignment between ICD-based model outputs and real-world clinical reasoning. It enhances diagnostic queries with EHR data, retrieves authoritative guideline content, and integrates this knowledge with model outputs to produce clinically aligned recommendations. A hypertension diagnosis prototype was developed and evaluated, achieving Precision@1 of 0.941, MRR of 0.964, and Hits@3 of 1.0, outperforming RAG-based baselines. The framework is lightweight, hallucination-free, and suitable for localized healthcare deployment.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Query enhancement that enriches clinical prompts with EHR data and contextual information, (2) Retrieval of relevant CPG content using BM25 scoring to identify authoritative guideline recommendations, and (3) Knowledge integration where retrieved guidelines are combined with model outputs to produce final diagnostic recommendations. The system grounds all outputs in CPG content rather than pure language model generation, ensuring clinical validity and reducing hallucination risks. A hypertension diagnosis prototype was constructed using 3,372 QA pairs and 54 ICD-10 codes, with the framework achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance on the constructed dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieved Precision@1 of 0.941, MRR of 0.964, and Hits@3 of 1.0 on hypertension diagnosis prototype
- Outperformed RAG-based baselines in retrieval accuracy and clinical alignment
- Demonstrated hallucination-free performance through grounding in authoritative clinical practice guidelines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework bridges the gap between model-centric ICD predictions and clinical practice by augmenting model outputs with evidence-based guideline content. By retrieving authoritative CPG recommendations and integrating them with model reasoning, GARMLE-G ensures diagnostic outputs align with real-world clinical standards. The query enhancement stage enriches model understanding with patient-specific EHR context, while the retrieval stage provides evidence-based grounding that prevents hallucinated or clinically inappropriate recommendations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs)**: Standardized, evidence-based clinical recommendations that serve as authoritative references for diagnosis and treatment. Needed because pure model outputs often lack clinical grounding. Quick check: Verify CPG content is from recognized medical authorities.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Architecture combining information retrieval with language model generation to enhance factual accuracy. Needed to ground model outputs in external knowledge. Quick check: Confirm retrieval relevance scores exceed baseline thresholds.
- **BM25 scoring**: Probabilistic retrieval algorithm that ranks documents based on term frequency and inverse document frequency. Needed for efficient and accurate CPG content retrieval. Quick check: Validate BM25 relevance matches clinical expert judgment.
- **ICD-10 coding system**: International classification standard for diseases and health conditions. Needed as target labels for diagnostic classification. Quick check: Ensure ICD mappings cover clinically relevant diagnoses.
- **EHR integration**: Incorporation of electronic health record data into diagnostic workflows. Needed to provide patient-specific context for clinical reasoning. Quick check: Verify EHR data fields are complete and properly formatted.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Query Enhancer -> BM25 Retriever -> Knowledge Integrator -> Model Output
- **Critical path**: EHR data → Query enhancement → CPG retrieval → Model output generation → Clinical recommendation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Retrieval accuracy vs. computational overhead; guideline coverage vs. storage requirements; clinical specificity vs. generalizability
- **Failure signatures**: Low retrieval scores indicating missing CPG content; model outputs inconsistent with retrieved guidelines; EHR integration errors causing query failures
- **3 first experiments**: (1) Test retrieval performance on diverse disease areas beyond hypertension, (2) Measure hallucination rates with and without CPG grounding, (3) Evaluate real-time inference latency under different CPG knowledge base sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single disease prototype (hypertension) with 3,372 QA pairs
- ICD-10 code vocabulary of 54 classes may not capture real-world diagnostic complexity
- No comparison with pure generative baselines to isolate retrieval augmentation benefits
- Clinical validation focused on retrieval metrics rather than actual diagnostic accuracy

## Confidence
- Retrieval performance claims: High - supported by quantitative metrics on constructed dataset
- Clinical alignment claims: Medium - based on retrieval quality but lacks validation against actual clinical outcomes
- Deployment feasibility claims: Low - insufficient evidence about real-world implementation constraints

## Next Checks
1. Test framework performance across 5-10 additional disease areas with varying diagnostic complexity to assess domain generalizability
2. Conduct a user study with clinicians comparing GARMLE-G recommendations against standard care in realistic diagnostic scenarios
3. Evaluate system performance and reliability under intermittent internet connectivity and with compressed/deployed CPG knowledge bases
