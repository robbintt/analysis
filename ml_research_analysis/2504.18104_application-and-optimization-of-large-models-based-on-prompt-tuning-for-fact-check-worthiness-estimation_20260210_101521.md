# Application and Optimization of Large Models Based on Prompt Tuning for Fact-Check-Worthiness Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.18104
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18104
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: F1 score of 0.7774 and accuracy of 0.8857 on COVID-19 misinformation dataset using 1.5B-parameter model

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a prompt-tuning-based method for estimating whether claims are worthy of fact-checking, addressing misinformation challenges in multilingual environments. The approach combines carefully designed prompt templates with in-context learning and prompt tuning to enhance large language models' classification abilities, particularly when dealing with limited or unlabeled data. Experiments demonstrate that the method achieves GPT-4-level performance using a much smaller 1.5B-parameter local model, with 7B-parameter models showing optimal results across different template designs.

## Method Summary
The method employs prompt templates that convert fact-check-worthiness classification into text generation tasks, activating latent knowledge in pre-trained LLMs through cloze-style prompts. In-context learning provides demonstration samples within prompts to guide model behavior without weight updates. Prompt tuning adds learnable prefix embeddings that adapt the model to the specific task while freezing base weights, enabling efficient training on limited hardware. The approach uses a verbalizer to map model outputs to binary labels and systematically varies template length, demonstration count, and parameter tuning across different model sizes.

## Key Results
- Achieves F1 score of 0.7774 and accuracy of 0.8857 on COVID-19 misinformation dataset
- 7B-parameter models (Qwen1.5-7B, Qwen2-7B) outperform smaller models across all configurations
- In-context learning with demonstrations improves performance for most models, except Qwen1.5-0.5B
- Prompt tuning significantly improves smaller models but degraded Qwen2-7B performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prompt templates convert fact-check-worthiness classification into text generation tasks that better activate latent knowledge in LLMs
- Mechanism: Cloze-style templates frame the problem in natural language terms the model was trained on, rather than introducing task-specific classification heads
- Core assumption: The pre-trained model contains relevant knowledge about fact-checking concepts that can be elicited through appropriate framing
- Evidence: [abstract] states prompt templates improve accuracy; [section II.C] explains prompt tuning origins; corpus papers support template-driven classification

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: In-context learning with demonstration samples improves performance by providing task format guidance without weight updates
- Mechanism: Labeled training examples are inserted into the prompt as demonstrations, showing the model the expected input-output pattern
- Core assumption: The model can generalize from few examples via pattern matching without explicit gradient updates
- Evidence: [section III.D] describes in-context learning implementation; [section IV.D.2] shows nine of ten models improved with demonstrations

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Soft prompt tuning adds learnable parameters that adapt the model to the specific task while freezing base weights
- Mechanism: Learnable prompt parameters Pe are prepended to input embeddings, with only ~71,680 parameters trained while the base model remains frozen
- Core assumption: Task-specific adaptation can be captured in a compact continuous prompt representation
- Evidence: [section IV.B] describes the prompt tuning method; [section IV.D.3] shows performance improvements for most models

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt Engineering / Template Design
  - Why needed here: The entire method hinges on converting classification to generation via template framing
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a cloze-style prompt might outperform a classification head for this task?

- Concept: In-Context Learning (Few-Shot Learning)
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on n-shot demonstrations to boost performance
  - Quick check question: What happens to model performance when you increase from 1-shot to 10-shot demonstrations on this task?

- Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
  - Why needed here: Prompt tuning enables training on limited hardware while achieving GPT-4-comparable results
  - Quick check question: Why would freezing 99.9991% of model parameters still allow meaningful task adaptation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt Templates (long/short variants) → In-Context Learning Module (n-shot demonstrations) → Base LLM (Qwen/GPT family) → Verbalizer (maps output to Yes/No) → Final Classification → Prompt Tuning Layer: Learnable prefix embeddings (Pe) prepended to input before the base LLM

- Critical path: 1. Select template length based on model capacity (longer for ≥7B, shorter for <2B) 2. Choose demonstration count (1-5 shot optimal for most models; 10-shot only for GPT-4o) 3. If using prompt tuning: train only Pe parameters for 5 epochs with AdamW, lr=3e-5 4. Apply verbalizer to map raw output to binary label

- Design tradeoffs: Template length vs. model capacity: Small models (<2B) perform worse with long templates due to "redundant information interference" Demonstration count vs. context efficiency: More shots help GPT-4o but hurt Qwen1.5-7B and GPT-4 Prompt tuning vs. in-context learning: Prompt tuning helps smaller models significantly but degraded Qwen2-7B

- Failure signatures: F1 < 0.5 with small models (<2B): Model lacks capacity to understand task framing Performance drops when switching from short to long template on small models F1 decreases as demonstration count increases beyond optimal point (model-dependent) Prompt tuning produces worse results than baseline (observed with Qwen2-7B)

- First 3 experiments: 1. Baseline comparison: Run 0-shot with short template on Qwen2-1.5B and Qwen1.5-7B to establish raw model capability 2. Template ablation: Test both templates on your target model size; if F1 drops with long template, your model may lack capacity 3. Demonstration sweep: Run 0, 1, 3, 5-shot experiments on best-performing template. Stop increasing n if F1 plateaus or declines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and P-Tuning compare to standard prompt tuning for fact-check-worthiness estimation?
- Basis in paper: The authors state in the conclusion that "methods such as LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and P-Tuning have not been validated" and represent a focus for next steps
- Why unresolved: The study restricted its methodology exclusively to prompt tuning to validate the efficacy of soft prompts on local models
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments benchmarking the performance of Qwen models fine-tuned with LoRA or P-Tuning against the prompt tuning baseline

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can chain-of-thought (CoT) template designs improve the model's ability to estimate fact-check-worthiness compared to the cloze-style templates used in this study?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that "the chain-of-thought template design approach could also be applicable to this problem" but was not included in the current work
- Why unresolved: The paper focused on simple instruction-based templates (long and short) and did not explore reasoning-heavy prompt structures
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study applying CoT prompts to the Qwen series models to see if explicit reasoning steps increase the F1 score

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the proposed prompt-tuning method effective for fact-check-worthiness estimation in non-English languages such as Chinese or German?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion acknowledges that "tasks involving fact-check-worthiness in other languages, such as Chinese and German, have not been assessed"
- Why unresolved: Despite the motivation being "multilingual environments," experiments were restricted to the English portion of the COVID-19 dataset
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the Qwen2-1.5B prompt-tuning pipeline to Chinese or German claim datasets and evaluating the resulting accuracy and F1 scores

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness depends heavily on prompt template design, with performance varying significantly across model sizes
- The interaction between prompt tuning and model architecture remains unclear, as evidenced by Qwen2-7B showing degraded performance
- The study focuses exclusively on a single domain (COVID-19 misinformation), limiting generalizability to other fact-checking scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The overall approach of using prompt templates with in-context learning improves fact-check-worthiness classification compared to baseline models; performance varies systematically with model parameter size; in-context learning with demonstrations provides consistent performance gains; the method achieves GPT-4-level performance while using a much smaller 1.5B-parameter local model

**Medium Confidence**: Template length optimization recommendations are model-dependent and may not generalize beyond tested architectures; prompt tuning provides benefits for most models but degraded performance for Qwen2-7B suggests architecture-specific interactions; the verbalizer mapping based on 'es' substring presence is a reasonable heuristic

**Low Confidence**: Claims about multilingual environment effectiveness are not directly tested; the explanation for why prompt tuning fails for Qwen2-7B lacks theoretical grounding; generalization to other fact-checking domains beyond COVID-19 misinformation remains untested

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture-Specific Prompt Tuning Analysis**: Systematically test prompt tuning across different model families (Qwen, GPT, LLaMA) to determine whether the Qwen2-7B degradation is architecture-specific or a broader phenomenon. Include ablation studies varying prompt length, learning rate, and training duration.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Study**: Evaluate the method on fact-check-worthiness datasets from different domains (political claims, scientific misinformation, financial scams) to assess whether performance patterns observed on COVID-19 data hold across diverse misinformation types.

3. **Template Design Robustness Testing**: Conduct systematic ablation studies on prompt template components (instruction phrasing, example formatting, task framing) to determine which elements are essential versus decorative. Test whether simpler templates achieve comparable performance.
