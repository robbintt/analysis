# Multi-Domain Audio Question Answering Toward Acoustic Content Reasoning in The DCASE 2025 Challenge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.07365
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07365
- Reference count: 0
- Introduces DCASE 2025 AQA benchmark with three domains (Bioacoustics, Temporal Soundscapes, Complex QA)

## Executive Summary
The DCASE 2025 Challenge introduces a multi-domain Audio Question Answering (AQA) benchmark to evaluate audio-language models' reasoning abilities across Bioacoustics, Temporal Soundscapes, and Complex QA. The task requires models to interpret diverse acoustic scenes, integrate external knowledge, and answer specific questions grounded in audio content. Three baseline models—Qwen2-Audio-7B, AudioFlamingo 2, and Gemini-2.0-Flash—were evaluated in a zero-shot setting, achieving 30–50% accuracy across subsets, with performance varying significantly by domain. These results highlight the challenge of audio understanding and reasoning beyond classification or captioning tasks, revealing substantial room for improvement in developing more robust, generalizable audio-language models.

## Method Summary
The DCASE 2025 AQA benchmark evaluates audio-language models on three distinct domains: Bioacoustics (animal sounds and ecological audio), Temporal Soundscapes (everyday environmental sounds and their temporal relationships), and Complex QA (multimodal reasoning requiring external knowledge integration). Models are evaluated on their ability to answer specific questions grounded in audio content, moving beyond simple classification or captioning tasks. The evaluation uses zero-shot prompting to assess baseline performance, measuring accuracy across different question types and domains. The benchmark aims to assess not just audio understanding but the ability to reason about acoustic content, integrate knowledge, and provide specific answers to diverse questions.

## Key Results
- Baseline models (Qwen2-Audio-7B, AudioFlamingo 2, Gemini-2.0-Flash) achieved 30–50% accuracy across AQA subsets
- Performance varied significantly by domain, with no single model dominating across all three
- Zero-shot evaluation revealed substantial challenges in audio-language reasoning beyond classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Audio question answering requires models to bridge the gap between raw acoustic signals and semantic understanding, enabling them to extract relevant information from complex audio scenes and answer specific questions. The multi-domain approach forces models to develop generalizable reasoning capabilities rather than memorizing domain-specific patterns. By requiring integration of external knowledge and temporal reasoning, the benchmark pushes beyond traditional audio classification to assess true comprehension of acoustic content.

## Foundational Learning
- **Audio signal processing** - Understanding how raw audio is transformed into meaningful representations; needed to grasp model input handling and feature extraction
- **Multimodal reasoning** - Integration of audio and language modalities for answering questions; needed to understand how models combine acoustic and textual information
- **Temporal reasoning in audio** - Understanding how events unfold over time in sound; needed to evaluate model performance on temporal soundscape questions
- **External knowledge integration** - Ability to incorporate information beyond audio content; needed to assess Complex QA performance

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Audio input -> Feature extraction -> Multimodal fusion -> Question understanding -> Reasoning module -> Answer generation
- **Critical path**: Audio features must be effectively extracted and fused with language representations before reasoning can occur; the quality of this fusion directly impacts answer accuracy
- **Design tradeoffs**: Zero-shot evaluation prioritizes model generalization but may underrepresent fine-tuned performance; domain diversity ensures robustness but increases evaluation complexity
- **Failure signatures**: Domain-specific performance drops suggest limitations in model's ability to generalize across acoustic environments; low accuracy on temporal questions indicates challenges with sequential reasoning
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Compare zero-shot vs. fine-tuned performance across domains, 2) Analyze feature extraction quality for each audio type, 3) Test knowledge integration capabilities with controlled external information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Zero-shot evaluation may not reflect models' full potential when fine-tuned on task-specific data
- Performance variability across domains suggests limited generalization without clear understanding of underlying causes
- Claims about "substantial room for improvement" lack context from established baselines in this emerging field

## Confidence
- High: Introduction of DCASE 2025 AQA benchmark and its three-domain structure is well-established and clearly defined
- Medium: Reported accuracy ranges (30-50%) for baseline models are based on presented experimental results
- Low: Claims about "substantial room for improvement" and implications for developing "more robust, generalizable audio-language models" are speculative

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing on accuracy differences between models and across domains
2. Expand evaluation to include fine-tuned model versions and compare against zero-shot baselines
3. Perform ablation studies to identify which aspects of audio-language reasoning most influence performance
