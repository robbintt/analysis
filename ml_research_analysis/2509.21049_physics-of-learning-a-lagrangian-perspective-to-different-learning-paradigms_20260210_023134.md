# Physics of Learning: A Lagrangian perspective to different learning paradigms

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.21049
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21049
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** Learning algorithms (Adam, Bellman, RMSprop) emerge as stationary trajectories of a postulated Learning Lagrangian through variational calculus

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes that learning processes follow a "principle of least action" analogous to physical laws, establishing a unifying variational framework across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and generative modeling. By introducing a Learning Lagrangian, the authors derive classical algorithms as stationary paths through parameter space, demonstrating deep connections between physical principles and machine learning. The framework provides theoretical insights into efficient learning, showing that learning is inherently decelerating and that planning is crucial for continuous efficiency, addressing the gap between trial-and-error engineering and systematic learning system design.

## Method Summary
The authors postulate a Learning Lagrangian of the form $L(\ell, \nabla_\theta \ell) = \frac{1}{2P}(\nabla_\theta \ell)^T F^{-1}\nabla_\theta \ell - \ell(\theta)$ where $\ell$ is the loss function and $F$ is the Fisher information matrix. They apply calculus of variations, specifically the Euler-Lagrange equations, to derive update rules that correspond to known optimizers and control equations. The framework is validated empirically by analyzing in-context learning velocity and acceleration curves on OpenWebText data, showing that learning progress exhibits monotonic deceleration with bounded generalization error. The theoretical derivations are compared against existing algorithms to demonstrate consistency.

## Key Results
- Classical learning algorithms (Adam, Bellman optimality equation, RMSprop) emerge as stationary trajectories from the postulated Learning Lagrangian
- Learning processes exhibit inherent deceleration, with information-processing velocity decreasing monotonically toward a bounded floor
- Reinforcement learning is structurally equivalent to parameter estimation under Legendre transformation, linking Bellman optimality to Adam-type dynamics
- The framework provides a principled understanding of when and why learning emerges and generalizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Stationary Trajectory Derivation
The framework assumes learning dynamics obey a least-action principle analogous to Hamiltonian mechanics. By defining an action functional $S = \int L(\ell, \nabla_\theta \ell) dt$ and solving Euler-Lagrange equations, the authors derive update rules that correspond to known optimizers. The Lagrangian form $L = \frac{1}{2P}(\nabla_\theta \ell)^T F^{-1}(\nabla_\theta \ell) - \ell(\theta)$ captures kinetic and potential energy analogues. This mechanism breaks if empirical Fisher approximation deviates significantly from true Fisher in high dimensions.

### Mechanism 2: Information-Processing Kinematics
Learning progress is modeled as a decelerating process where position represents cumulative Shannon information and velocity represents per-token surprise. The framework shows that loss curves exhibit non-increasing velocity with a lower bound, implying bounded generalization error. This mechanism assumes information accumulation maps directly to kinematic relationships and may break under non-stationary data distributions.

### Mechanism 3: Legendre Transform Equivalence (RL↔Optimization)
The framework establishes structural equivalence between reinforcement learning and parameter estimation through Legendre transformation. RL Lagrangian in reward form yields Hamiltonian structure, while parameter-estimation Lagrangian yields kinetic terms. The Legendre transform connects momentum to gradients, implying shared optimal solutions. This equivalence breaks if Fisher information is singular or poorly conditioned.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Variational calculus and Euler-Lagrange equations
  - **Why needed here:** The entire framework hinges on deriving dynamics by making action functionals stationary
  - **Quick check question:** Can you derive the equations of motion for $L = T - V$ where $T = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2$ and $V(x) = kx^2$?

- **Concept:** Fisher information matrix and Cramér-Rao bound
  - **Why needed here:** The postulated Lagrangian uses $F^{-1}$ as the kinetic metric; efficiency claims depend on this statistical bound
  - **Quick check question:** For a Bernoulli($p$) distribution, what is the Fisher information $I(p)$?

- **Concept:** Legendre transform between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics
  - **Why needed here:** Connects RL (Hamiltonian-like reward structure) to parameter estimation (Lagrangian loss structure)
  - **Quick check question:** Given $L(x, \dot{x})$, how do you compute the conjugate momentum $p$ and Hamiltonian $H(x,p)$?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Learning Lagrangian $L(\ell, \nabla_\theta \ell)$ -> Fisher information $F$ -> Euler-Lagrange equations -> Update rule $\dot{\theta} = F^{-1/2}\nabla_\theta \ell$
- **Critical path:** Define Lagrangian -> Compute gradients and Fisher (or empirical approximation) -> Solve Euler-Lagrange -> Extract update rule -> Validate against known optimizers
- **Design tradeoffs:** Exact Fisher vs. empirical Fisher (theoretical guarantees vs. O(P) memory); parametric assumptions vs. model-free (planning vs. expressiveness); sample-efficiency vs. compute-efficiency (sequential planning vs. parallel computation)
- **Failure signatures:** Velocity $v(t)$ not decreasing (distribution shift or model misspecification); Fisher approximation singular (unstable dynamics); Lagrangian stationary point unreachable (poor conditioning)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Figure 1 in-context learning velocity/acceleration on a small language model; verify deceleration holds across datasets
  2. Implement the derived update rule $\dot{\theta} = F^{-1/2}\nabla_\theta \ell$ on a simple generative model; compare convergence speed and final loss against Adam
  3. Test the parametric path-planning result (Sec 3.1) in linear regression with unit-norm data; measure if planned data selection reaches error thresholds faster than random sampling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** How can "time" be rigorously quantified in the Learning Lagrangian framework when data samples do not contain similar information content? The current formulation assumes uniform information density across samples, limiting applicability to heterogeneous data. Evidence that would resolve this includes a formal extension of the Lagrangian that incorporates non-uniform information density while preserving stationary trajectory derivations.

**Open Question 2:** What specific experimental designs can empirically verify the "Learning Lagrangian" hypothesis and the derived deceleration laws? The paper establishes theoretical consistency but lacks novel experiments to validate underlying physical postulates. Evidence that would resolve this includes empirical data showing strict adherence to predicted deceleration constraints and efficiency losses when intervening to alter the action.

**Open Question 3:** Can Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) be reformulated to satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation to reduce its theoretical inefficiency? While the paper identifies SGD's non-compliance with variational principles, it does not propose alignment mechanisms or quantify efficiency gaps. Evidence that would resolve this includes a modified SGD update rule derived from the Lagrangian that demonstrates faster convergence compared to standard SGD on identical tasks.

## Limitations
- Empirical validation remains limited to in-context learning velocity curves, with theoretical connections to algorithms relying heavily on derivations rather than comprehensive benchmarking
- Framework validity depends critically on assumptions about least-action principles, Fisher information accuracy, and clean mapping between information accumulation and kinematic quantities
- Generalization scope unclear beyond in-context learning, with uncertain applicability to meta-learning, continual learning, and other paradigms

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The mathematical framework connecting variational calculus to learning dynamics is internally consistent, and the derivation of update rules from Euler-Lagrange equations is correct given the postulated Lagrangian form.

**Medium Confidence:** Empirical evidence for decelerating learning appears sound for the specific case studied, but broader validation across architectures and tasks is needed. The Adam equivalence through Fisher normalization is plausible but requires more rigorous empirical comparison.

**Low Confidence:** The Legendre transform equivalence between RL and parameter estimation has weak empirical support, and the claim that all learning paradigms emerge from the same variational principle remains largely theoretical.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Paradigm Deceleration Test:** Extend velocity/acceleration analysis to supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and generative modeling tasks beyond in-context learning to verify the universal decelerating learning hypothesis.

2. **Fisher Information Fidelity:** Compare convergence properties and update trajectories of the exact Fisher-based update rule versus empirical approximations and standard Adam across multiple architectures to quantify approximation errors.

3. **Distribution Shift Robustness:** Test the Lagrangian framework under concept drift and distribution shift scenarios to identify conditions where the least-action principle and monotonic deceleration break down.
