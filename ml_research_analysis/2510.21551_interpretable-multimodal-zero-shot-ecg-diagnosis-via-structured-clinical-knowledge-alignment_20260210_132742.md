# Interpretable Multimodal Zero-Shot ECG Diagnosis via Structured Clinical Knowledge Alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21551
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21551
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: None

## Executive Summary
ZETA is a zero-shot framework for ECG diagnosis that uses a frozen multimodal model to align ECG signals with structured clinical observations. The approach generates interpretable diagnostic predictions by comparing ECG embeddings against curated positive and negative clinical observations for each candidate condition. Expert-reviewed observations ensure clinical accuracy while the multimodal alignment enables zero-shot generalization to unseen disease categories.

## Method Summary
The method uses a pre-trained frozen multimodal model (D-BETA) to encode both 12-lead ECG signals and textual clinical observations into shared embeddings. For each candidate condition, LLM-generated observations are reviewed by cardiologists across correctness, clarity, directness, and contrast dimensions. During inference, the system computes similarity scores between the ECG embedding and each observation embedding, aggregates positive and negative groups separately, and produces a final diagnosis through comparative scoring.

## Key Results
- None

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Structured positive/negative observation comparison enables zero-shot ECG diagnosis without disease-specific training. A frozen pre-trained multimodal model encodes ECG signals and textual observations into shared embeddings, then computes similarity scores between the ECG and positive/negative observations for each condition. These scores are aggregated and compared to produce possibility scores for each diagnosis.

### Mechanism 2
Expert-validated structured observations serve as interpretable diagnostic anchors. LLMs generate initial observation candidates which cardiologists review across four dimensions: correctness, clarity, directness, and contrast. This curated knowledge base provides clinically grounded features that the model uses for reasoning.

### Mechanism 3
Per-observation similarity scores provide transparent diagnostic rationale. The system exposes individual similarity scores for each positive and negative observation, allowing clinicians to verify whether high-scoring observations correspond to visible ECG features. This mimics differential diagnosis by weighing evidence for and against each condition.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Contrastive multimodal representation learning**
  - Why needed here: ZETA relies on D-BETA's pre-trained cross-modal alignment. Understanding contrastive learning explains how ECG and text embeddings become meaningfully comparable.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why contrastive loss encourages ECG embeddings of a signal with "prolonged PR interval" to be closer to that text description than to "normal PR interval"?

- Concept: **Zero-shot learning via semantic embeddings**
  - Why needed here: The framework operates without labeled training data for target conditions. Understanding semantic embedding generalization clarifies how frozen models can classify unseen diseases.
  - Quick check question: If you have a pre-trained image-text model that has never seen "zebra," how might it classify a zebra image using only the text embedding of "striped horse-like animal"?

- Concept: **Differential diagnosis and clinical reasoning**
  - Why needed here: ZETA explicitly mimics the clinical process of weighing evidence for and against diagnoses. Without this context, the positive/negative observation structure appears arbitrary.
  - Quick check question: A patient presents with chest pain and ST elevation. What evidence would you weigh for versus against a diagnosis of myocardial infarction versus pericarditis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - LLM observation generation (Claude/LLaMA/Mistral) → Cardiologist expert review → Curated P/N observation sets (DSCP/CDCP)
  - Input ECG → Frozen D-BETA encoder → 768-dim embedding → Dot product similarity with all observation embeddings → Softmax normalization → Mean aggregation within P/N groups → Final possibility score

- Critical path:
  1. Observation curation quality determines interpretability validity—if observations are wrong or unclear, all downstream reasoning is compromised
  2. Frozen encoder quality determines zero-shot capability—if D-BETA's embedding space is poorly aligned, similarity scores are meaningless
  3. Temperature parameter (τ=0.5) affects score distribution—too high reduces discriminability, too low creates overconfident scores

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Frozen vs. fine-tuned encoder**: Frozen enables zero-shot but inherits all pre-training biases; fine-tuning would improve performance but require labeled data and reduce generalization
  - **LLM-generated vs. manually authored observations**: LLMs scale knowledge creation but require expert validation; manual authoring is higher quality but doesn't scale
  - **Number of observations per condition**: More observations provide finer-grained reasoning but increase computational cost and potential for redundant/contradictory features

- Failure signatures:
  - **Observation mismatch**: High scores for observations visibly absent in ECG—indicates embedding space misalignment
  - **P/N imbalance**: All positive or all negative observations score high—suggests observations lack discriminative contrast
  - **Cross-dataset collapse**: Strong performance on source dataset, near-random on target—pre-training distribution doesn't transfer

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation on observation sources**: Compare performance using raw LLM outputs vs. expert-reviewed observations vs. manually authored observations on a held-out condition set to quantify the value of expert curation.
  2. **Encoder substitution**: Replace D-BETA with another pre-trained multimodal model (e.g., MERL) to assess whether the framework is encoder-agnostic or dependent on specific embedding properties.
  3. **Per-observation correlation analysis**: For conditions with objective measurements (e.g., "PR interval >200ms"), correlate observation scores with ground-truth measurements to validate whether similarity scores reflect actual feature presence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on pre-trained model generalization without fine-tuning creates uncertainty about cross-domain performance
- Observation curation depends on LLM generation quality and comprehensiveness of expert review
- Interpretability claims rest on unproven assumption that similarity scores reliably correspond to actual feature presence

## Confidence
- Zero-shot capability: Medium confidence - depends on pre-trained model generalization that may not hold across all observation vocabularies
- Clinical accuracy: Medium confidence - expert validation helps but may not capture all diagnostic nuances
- Interpretability validity: Low confidence - similarity-score-to-feature correspondence requires empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Per-observation correlation validation**: For objective ECG measurements (e.g., PR interval, QRS duration), systematically correlate observation similarity scores with ground-truth measurements across multiple conditions to quantify whether scores reflect actual feature presence.

2. **Cross-dataset embedding stability**: Evaluate whether observation similarity scores remain consistent and discriminative when the same ECG is tested across multiple datasets with different acquisition protocols, identifying potential domain adaptation failures.

3. **Clinical expert blinded evaluation**: Conduct a study where cardiologists assess ZETA's predictions and observation-based explanations on unseen ECGs, measuring whether they can reliably identify the correct condition using only the system's stated evidence.
