core_contribution: This paper proposes BRIXEL, a knowledge distillation method that
  improves the spatial resolution of dense feature maps from DINOv3 vision foundation
  models without requiring high-resolution input images. BRIXEL works by training
  a student network with a ViT adapter to reconstruct feature maps from a high-resolution
  teacher model, using L1, edge, and spectral loss functions.

- BRIXEL improves dense feature resolution from DINOv3 models without high-res inputs

## Executive Summary
BRIXEL addresses the fundamental limitation that vision foundation models like DINOv3, while powerful, generate low-resolution dense features that limit their effectiveness for downstream dense prediction tasks. The proposed knowledge distillation method trains a student network with a Vision Transformer adapter to reconstruct high-resolution feature maps from a low-resolution teacher model. By using L1, edge, and spectral loss functions, BRIXEL achieves resolution enhancement without requiring expensive high-resolution inputs during inference.

The method delivers consistent improvements across 42 model comparisons on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and surface normal estimation tasks. BRIXEL achieves up to 88% computational cost reduction compared to running DINOv3 at high resolution while maintaining or improving performance metrics. The approach is particularly valuable for resource-constrained hardware, enabling feature generation on devices with as little as 4GB VRAM, and generalizes well to different input sizes and foundation models including SigLIP 2.

## Method Summary
BRIXEL employs a knowledge distillation framework where a student ViT adapter learns to reconstruct high-resolution feature maps from the low-resolution outputs of a pre-trained DINOv3 teacher model. The adapter is trained using three complementary loss functions: L1 loss for pixel-level reconstruction accuracy, edge loss to preserve spatial details and boundaries, and spectral loss to maintain frequency domain characteristics. This multi-loss approach ensures the student captures both low-level spatial details and high-level semantic information from the teacher's features.

The training process involves feeding the same input image to both teacher and student models at different resolutions, with the teacher operating at lower resolution and the student generating higher-resolution outputs. The adapter is optimized to minimize the combined loss function, effectively learning to upsample and refine the teacher's features without requiring additional high-resolution training data. The method is designed to be plug-and-play, working with any pre-trained vision foundation model and supporting various dense prediction tasks through a unified framework.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.8-4.4% mIoU improvements on semantic segmentation compared to DINOv3 baselines
- Reduces depth estimation RMSE by 0.5-0.9 while maintaining feature quality
- Cuts computational cost by up to 88% compared to running DINOv3 at high resolution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages the rich semantic information encoded in foundation model features while addressing their inherent low spatial resolution through knowledge distillation. By training a student adapter to reconstruct high-resolution features from low-resolution teacher outputs, BRIXEL effectively learns the spatial relationships and fine-grained details that are lost during the teacher's downsampling operations. The combination of L1, edge, and spectral losses ensures comprehensive feature reconstruction that preserves both pixel-level accuracy and semantic consistency.

## Foundational Learning

**Vision Foundation Models**: Pre-trained models like DINOv3 that provide generic visual representations but generate low-resolution dense features. Needed for transfer learning to downstream tasks without task-specific training.

**Knowledge Distillation**: Training a student model to mimic the behavior of a teacher model, enabling the student to leverage the teacher's learned representations. Quick check: Verify teacher-student architecture alignment and loss function compatibility.

**Feature Resolution Enhancement**: Upsampling or reconstructing higher-resolution feature maps from lower-resolution inputs while preserving semantic information. Critical for dense prediction tasks requiring pixel-level accuracy.

**Multi-Loss Training**: Combining multiple loss functions (L1, edge, spectral) to capture different aspects of feature quality and spatial relationships. Quick check: Validate each loss component contributes positively to final performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Image -> Teacher DINOv3 (low-res) -> Student ViT Adapter -> High-Res Feature Maps -> Dense Prediction Task

**Critical Path**: The knowledge distillation loop where teacher features are downsampled, student adapter processes these, and reconstruction loss drives learning. Performance bottlenecks occur during teacher inference and adapter training.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Lower teacher resolution reduces computational cost but may limit feature quality; higher adapter capacity improves reconstruction but increases parameters and VRAM requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor edge preservation indicates inadequate edge loss weighting; spectral artifacts suggest insufficient spectral loss; computational overhead indicates need for adapter optimization.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify teacher-student feature alignment at different resolutions, 2) Test individual loss function contributions through ablation, 3) Measure VRAM usage across different adapter sizes.
