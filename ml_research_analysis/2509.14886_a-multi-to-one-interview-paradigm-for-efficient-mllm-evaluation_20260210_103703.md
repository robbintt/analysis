core_contribution: This paper addresses the inefficiency and redundancy of conventional
  full-coverage question-answering evaluations for Multi-Modal Large Language Models
  (MLLMs). To solve this, the authors propose a multi-to-one interview paradigm inspired
  by human hiring processes, which includes a two-stage interview strategy with pre-interview

# A Multi-To-One Interview Paradigm for Efficient MLLM Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.14886
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14886
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Achieves up to 17.6% PLCC and 16.7% SRCC improvements over random sampling while reducing required questions

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the inefficiency of conventional full-coverage question-answering evaluations for Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The authors propose a multi-to-one interview paradigm inspired by human hiring processes, featuring a two-stage interview strategy with pre-interview and formal interview phases. Dynamic adjustment of interviewer weights ensures fairness, while an adaptive mechanism selects question difficulty levels. Experiments across MMT-Bench, ScienceQA, and SEED-Bench demonstrate significantly higher correlation with full-coverage results than random sampling, validating the paradigm as a reliable and efficient alternative for large-scale MLLM benchmarking.

## Method Summary
The proposed paradigm employs a two-stage interview strategy where MLLMs first undergo a pre-interview phase with a subset of questions to establish baseline performance, followed by a formal interview phase with adaptively selected questions based on demonstrated capabilities. Interviewer weights are dynamically adjusted to ensure fairness across different question types and difficulty levels. The system adaptively selects question difficulty based on model performance, creating a personalized evaluation path that maintains comprehensive assessment while reducing redundancy. This approach mimics human hiring processes where candidates are evaluated progressively through structured interviews.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 17.6% improvement in PLCC correlation with full-coverage results compared to random sampling
- Demonstrates 16.7% improvement in SRCC correlation while reducing the number of required questions
- Validated across three benchmark datasets: MMT-Bench, ScienceQA, and SEED-Bench

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paradigm works by mimicking human hiring processes where candidates are progressively evaluated through structured interviews. The two-stage approach first establishes baseline capabilities, then adaptively selects subsequent questions based on demonstrated strengths and weaknesses. Dynamic weight adjustment ensures fair evaluation across different question types and interviewers, preventing bias toward specific capabilities. The adaptive difficulty mechanism maintains appropriate challenge levels, ensuring that the evaluation remains both comprehensive and efficient by focusing on questions that provide maximum information about model capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **PLCC (Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient)**: Measures linear correlation between evaluation metrics and ground truth - needed to quantify alignment with full-coverage results; quick check: values closer to 1 indicate better correlation
- **SRCC (Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient)**: Measures rank correlation between evaluation metrics - needed to assess relative ordering preservation; quick check: values closer to 1 indicate better rank correlation
- **Multi-modal evaluation**: Assessment of models handling both text and visual inputs - needed because MLLMs must process multiple input types; quick check: ensure benchmarks include both modalities
- **Adaptive question selection**: Dynamic adjustment of evaluation questions based on performance - needed to maintain efficiency while ensuring comprehensive assessment; quick check: verify selection algorithm optimizes information gain
- **Interviewer weight dynamics**: Adjustment of question type importance during evaluation - needed to prevent bias and ensure fair assessment; quick check: monitor weight distribution across question types
- **Two-stage evaluation**: Progressive assessment through initial screening followed by targeted evaluation - needed to reduce redundancy while maintaining thoroughness; quick check: validate correlation between stages

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: MLLM -> Pre-Interview Phase -> Performance Analysis -> Formal Interview Phase -> Dynamic Weight Adjustment -> Question Difficulty Selection -> Final Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The evaluation begins with the pre-interview phase where baseline performance is established, followed by performance analysis that informs the formal interview phase. Dynamic weight adjustment continuously balances question type importance, while the question difficulty selection mechanism ensures appropriate challenge levels. The final evaluation aggregates results from the formal interview phase to produce comprehensive assessment metrics.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The two-stage approach balances evaluation efficiency against comprehensive coverage, accepting some initial redundancy for improved overall accuracy. Dynamic weight adjustment introduces computational overhead but ensures fairness across diverse question types. Adaptive difficulty selection may miss edge cases but significantly reduces evaluation time and resource requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor correlation with full-coverage results may indicate inadequate pre-interview sampling or ineffective weight adjustment. Overly aggressive difficulty adaptation could result in evaluation gaps, while static weights may introduce systematic bias. Performance degradation across different MLLM architectures suggests the paradigm may not generalize well to all model types.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison between full-coverage and two-stage interview approaches on single dataset
2. Weight adjustment sensitivity analysis across different question type distributions
3. Difficulty adaptation accuracy validation using known model capability profiles

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results validated on only three benchmark datasets, limiting generalizability across diverse evaluation scenarios
- Dynamic interviewer weight adjustment may face scalability challenges with larger interviewer pools
- Reliance on two-stage process increases implementation complexity and overhead for evaluation platforms

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Statistical improvements over random sampling baselines (PLCC and SRCC metrics)
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability across different MLLM architectures and evaluation contexts
- **Medium confidence**: Scalability of dynamic interviewer weight adjustment mechanism

## Next Checks
1. Test paradigm across broader range of benchmark datasets and MLLM architectures to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of two-stage interview, dynamic weight adjustment, and adaptive difficulty mechanisms
3. Evaluate computational overhead and practical implementation requirements for integrating paradigm into existing large-scale MLLM evaluation frameworks
