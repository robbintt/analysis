# TeleMath: A Benchmark for Large Language Models in Telecom Mathematical Problem Solving

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.10674
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10674
- Reference count: 15
- Major result: Reasoning-optimized models outperform general-purpose models on specialized telecom mathematical problems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TeleMath, a benchmark dataset of 500 telecommunications-focused mathematical problems designed to evaluate the numerical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors developed a synthetic data generation framework that expands a small seed dataset created by subject matter experts into a larger, diverse set of question-answer pairs using problem decomposition, blueprint generation, and post-processing steps. Experiments with various open-source LLMs reveal that models explicitly designed for mathematical reasoning—such as Qwen3-32B—outperform general-purpose models, even those with more parameters, on this specialized task. This highlights the value of reasoning-oriented architectures for complex technical domains. TeleMath is publicly released to enable reproducible evaluation and further research in this area.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a synthetic data generation framework that starts with 150 expert-generated seed questions and expands them to 500 using problem decomposition, blueprint generation, and post-processing steps. This approach creates a diverse dataset of telecommunications mathematical problems while maintaining domain relevance. The generated questions cover various aspects of telecommunications engineering and are paired with detailed solutions to enable comprehensive evaluation of LLM capabilities.

## Key Results
- Reasoning-optimized models (Qwen3-32B) outperform general-purpose models on TeleMath benchmark
- Model parameter count does not directly correlate with performance on specialized mathematical tasks
- The benchmark successfully differentiates between model architectures based on their mathematical reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its focus on domain-specific mathematical reasoning rather than general knowledge. Telecommunications mathematical problems require specific analytical approaches and technical understanding that general-purpose models may not capture. By using synthetic generation based on expert-designed blueprints, the dataset can cover a wide range of problem types while maintaining consistency and relevance to the field. The post-processing steps ensure quality control and alignment with real-world telecommunications challenges.

## Foundational Learning
- Telecommunications mathematical concepts (why needed: domain specificity; quick check: can identify relevant formulas and principles)
- Problem decomposition techniques (why needed: enables systematic approach to complex problems; quick check: can break down multi-step problems)
- Blueprint-based synthetic data generation (why needed: scales expert knowledge; quick check: maintains consistency across generated problems)

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Seed Questions -> Blueprint Generation -> Synthetic Expansion -> Post-processing -> Benchmark Dataset
- Critical path: Expert seed creation → Blueprint generation → Synthetic question creation → Answer validation → Dataset compilation
- Design tradeoffs: Synthetic generation enables scale but may introduce quality concerns vs. fully manual curation
- Failure signatures: Incorrect answers propagating through synthetic generation, domain drift in expanded questions, insufficient coverage of real-world scenarios
- First experiments:
  1. Test expert seed questions against model performance to establish baseline
  2. Validate synthetic generation process by comparing seed vs. expanded question quality
  3. Benchmark multiple model architectures to identify performance patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic data generation may propagate errors from seed questions to expanded dataset
- Lack of extensive validation for synthetic question quality and answer correctness
- Unclear representativeness of benchmark problems for actual telecommunications engineering challenges

## Confidence
- High confidence: Reasoning-optimized models outperform general-purpose models (aligns with established literature)
- Medium confidence: Benchmark utility for telecommunications mathematical problem solving (pending synthetic data validation)
- Low confidence: Dataset representativeness of real telecommunications engineering challenges (due to synthetic expansion process)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct expert review of a statistically significant sample of both seed and synthetic questions to assess correctness, relevance, and practical applicability to telecommunications engineering contexts.

2. Compare model performance on TeleMath against performance on established mathematical reasoning benchmarks to determine whether observed differences reflect telecommunications-specific challenges or general mathematical reasoning capabilities.

3. Test whether models achieving high performance on TeleMath can successfully apply this knowledge to solve practical telecommunications problems or engineering scenarios not present in the training data.
