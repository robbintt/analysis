core_contribution: This thesis presents a novel approach to building artificial moral
  agents (AMAs) based on reason-based moral decision-making, addressing the challenge
  of developing ethical behavior in autonomous systems. The core idea is to extend
  reinforcement learning (RL) with an ethics module centered around a reasoning unit,
  enabling agents to infer moral obligations from normative reasons and act in accordance
  with them.

# Integrating Reason-Based Moral Decision-Making in the Reinforcement Learning Architecture

- A novel approach extends reinforcement learning with an ethics module centered around a reasoning unit for artificial moral agents

## Executive Summary
This thesis introduces a novel framework for building artificial moral agents (AMAs) by integrating reason-based moral decision-making into reinforcement learning architecture. The approach centers on extending RL with an ethics module featuring a reasoning unit that enables agents to infer moral obligations from normative reasons. The system, called Reason-Based Artificial Moral Agent (RBAMA), was tested in a simulated bridge environment featuring moral dilemmas and demonstrated successful recognition and prioritization of normative reasons.

The RBAMA showed capability to fulfill key ethical desiderata: moral justifiability, trustworthiness, and robustness. In experiments, it successfully navigated moral conflicts by prioritizing rescuing drowning persons over avoiding pushing someone off a bridge. Comparative evaluations against multi-objective RL approaches revealed principled advantages including better generalization and explicit control over moral prioritization, while also identifying limitations such as the current inability to incorporate expected outcomes into reasoning.

## Method Summary
The research extends reinforcement learning architecture by incorporating an ethics module centered around a reasoning unit. This module enables the artificial moral agent to infer moral obligations from normative reasons rather than relying solely on reward signals. The RBAMA prototype was implemented and tested in a simulated bridge environment featuring moral dilemmas where agents must navigate conflicting moral obligations. The system learns to recognize normative reasons through interaction with the environment and uses this reasoning capability to make moral decisions that align with ethical principles.

## Key Results
- RBAMA successfully learned to recognize and prioritize normative reasons in moral dilemmas
- Demonstrated ability to prioritize rescuing drowning persons over avoiding pushing someone off a bridge
- Showed better generalization and explicit moral prioritization control compared to multi-objective RL approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by integrating a reasoning unit into the reinforcement learning architecture that can process normative reasons independently of reward signals. This allows the agent to make decisions based on moral principles rather than purely consequentialist calculations. The reasoning unit infers moral obligations from given reasons and translates them into action priorities, enabling the agent to navigate complex ethical scenarios where multiple obligations conflict.

## Foundational Learning
1. Reinforcement Learning basics - Why needed: Understanding RL foundation is crucial for grasping how the ethics module extends traditional RL architecture
   Quick check: Can identify state, action, reward, and policy components in standard RL

2. Normative ethics and moral reasoning - Why needed: Essential for understanding how the system infers moral obligations from reasons
   Quick check: Can distinguish between consequentialist and deontological approaches to ethics

3. Moral dilemmas and ethical prioritization - Why needed: Core to understanding the test scenarios and decision-making framework
   Quick check: Can explain how conflicts between moral obligations are resolved

4. Multi-objective optimization in RL - Why needed: Important for comparing RBAMA against traditional approaches
   Quick check: Can describe how multiple reward signals are typically handled in RL systems

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Environment -> RL Agent -> Ethics Module (Reasoning Unit) -> Action Selection

Critical Path:
State observation → RL processing → Ethical reasoning → Moral obligation inference → Action selection → Environment feedback

Design Tradeoffs:
- Explicit moral reasoning vs. implicit learning through rewards
- Reasoning overhead vs. decision speed
- Generalizability vs. specific ethical framework constraints

Failure Signatures:
- Inability to resolve conflicts between competing moral reasons
- Over-reliance on learned patterns vs. principled reasoning
- Failure to recognize novel moral situations

First Experiments:
1. Test RBAMA in the bridge environment with varying moral dilemma configurations
2. Compare decision-making performance against baseline RL agents without ethics modules
3. Evaluate RBAMA's ability to generalize reasoning to unseen moral scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Current inability to incorporate expected outcomes into the reasoning process
- Limited testing to simple bridge environment scenarios
- Uncertainty about performance in more complex real-world moral dilemmas
- Potential scalability challenges with multiple stakeholders and interdependencies

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- The integration of a reasoning unit into the reinforcement learning architecture is technically feasible
- The RBAMA can successfully navigate simple moral dilemmas in controlled environments

Medium Confidence:
- The RBAMA fulfills key ethical desiderata (moral justifiability, trustworthiness, and robustness) in more complex scenarios
- The principled advantages of RBAMA over multi-objective RL approaches hold true in diverse moral contexts

Low Confidence:
- The current framework can be effectively refined to incorporate expected outcomes without compromising its core strengths
- The RBAMA's performance scales well to real-world moral dilemmas with multiple stakeholders and complex interdependencies

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the RBAMA in more complex simulated environments featuring diverse moral dilemmas, including scenarios with multiple stakeholders and conflicting obligations. This will help assess the system's scalability and robustness in handling more nuanced ethical situations.

2. Develop a mechanism to incorporate expected outcomes into the reasoning process, allowing the RBAMA to consider both normative reasons and potential consequences in its decision-making. Validate this enhancement by comparing its performance against the current version in scenarios where outcomes significantly impact moral choices.

3. Conduct a comparative study between RBAMA and human decision-making in moral dilemmas, using a large-scale survey or experiment. This will provide insights into the alignment between AI-generated moral decisions and human ethical intuitions, helping to refine the framework for better human-AI cooperation in ethical contexts.
