# Vec2Summ: Text Summarization via Probabilistic Sentence Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.07017
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07017
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Probabilistic sampling in embedding space enables scalable, LLM-free summarization with cosine similarity >0.78

## Executive Summary
Vec2Summ addresses multi-document summarization by framing it as semantic compression in embedding space. The method computes a mean vector from document embeddings to capture central meaning, then samples from a Gaussian distribution around this mean to introduce semantic diversity. These sampled vectors are decoded back into natural language using embedding inversion techniques. The approach avoids LLM context-length constraints, scales efficiently with corpus size, and enables interpretable generation via semantic parameters.

## Method Summary
Vec2Summ computes document embeddings, derives a mean vector and covariance matrix, then samples from a Gaussian distribution centered on the mean. These sampled vectors are inverted back to text using iterative embedding inversion (hypothesizer-corrector). The reconstructed fragments are consolidated into a final summary. The method achieves compression ratios exceeding 99% while maintaining reasonable reconstruction quality and coherence.

## Key Results
- Achieves cosine similarity scores above 0.78 between reconstructed and original texts
- Generates more concise summaries than direct LLM summarization with G-Eval scores of 2.1-3.3
- Scales effectively to large corpora (up to 10,000 documents) with stable performance
- Particularly effective for topically focused, order-invariant corpora

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The mean vector of document embeddings captures central semantic tendency of a corpus by averaging across documents to create a centroid representing shared thematic content. This enables summarization to operate on a fixed-size representation regardless of corpus size. The core assumption is that documents share sufficient topical overlap for a single mean to meaningfully represent the collection.

### Mechanism 2
Gaussian sampling around the mean improves reconstruction diversity and quality by introducing controlled perturbations. Sampling from N(μ, Σ) with temperature scaling (T=1.2) encourages varied outputs during embedding inversion, analogous to ensemble bagging. The core assumption is that semantic variability in the corpus is approximately Gaussian-distributed.

### Mechanism 3
Iterative embedding inversion (hypothesizer + corrector) reconstructs fluent text from sampled vectors by generating initial text and then refining it through iterative optimization. This process minimizes embedding distance plus perplexity penalty over multiple iterations. The core assumption is that embeddings preserve sufficient information for text reconstruction despite representation degeneration.

## Foundational Learning

- **Embedding Anisotropy/Representation Degeneration**
  - Why needed here: Vec2Summ operates in embedding space; understanding that embeddings cluster in narrow cones affects how mean vectors and sampling behave
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why high-frequency tokens clustering near the origin might affect the interpretability of a mean embedding?

- **Multivariate Gaussian Distributions in High Dimensions**
  - Why needed here: The method models semantic space as N(μ, Σ); understanding covariance matrices, positive definiteness, and sampling is essential for implementation
  - Quick check question: What happens if the covariance matrix has near-zero or negative eigenvalues, and how does regularization address this?

- **Embedding Inversion/Vec2Text Paradigm**
  - Why needed here: The core innovation relies on decoding embeddings back to text; understanding the hypothesizer-corrector architecture and why iterative refinement is necessary
  - Quick check question: Why might a single forward pass from embedding to text fail, necessitating iterative correction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Embedding Generator -> Distribution Modeler -> Probabilistic Sampler -> Text Reconstructor -> Summary Synthesizer
- **Critical path**: Embedding quality -> Distribution modeling stability -> Sampling diversity -> Inversion fidelity -> Summary coherence. Errors propagate; weak embeddings cannot be recovered downstream.
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - k (sample count): More samples increase coverage but raise compute cost and may introduce redundancy
  - Temperature T: Higher values increase diversity but risk semantic drift from the mean
  - Correction iterations: More iterations improve embedding match but may overfit to noise or reduce fluency
  - Embedding model choice: GTR (768d) vs. Ada-002 (1536d) trades dimensionality for inversion model availability
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Cosine similarity < 0.75: Inversion failing; check embedding model compatibility with vec2text corrector
  - Reconstructed text incoherent: Over-regularized covariance or too-high temperature; reduce T or check eigenvalue distribution
  - Summary lacks diversity: Covariance collapsed (near-zero eigenvalues); verify corpus has semantic variance
  - Domain-specific terms lost: Vec2text corrector not trained on domain; consider fine-tuning
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. On a 100-document homogeneous corpus, verify cosine similarity > 0.78 between original and reconstructed embeddings
  2. Fix k=10, vary T ∈ {0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5} and measure reconstruction cosine similarity and G-Eval coherence scores
  3. Increase corpus size from 50 to 1000 documents and confirm compression ratio scales while cosine similarity remains stable

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can Vec2Summ be adapted to effectively summarize long-form, structured documents such as books or news articles? The authors note that pilot studies on book and news article summarization neither yielded results meaningful enough to include in this paper. This limitation likely stems from the mean-vector aggregation losing narrative structure or long-range dependencies found in long-form texts.

### Open Question 2
How does performance degrade when applying Vec2Summ to corpora lacking topical coherence or strict order invariance? The authors note Vec2Summ performs best on datasets with "order invariance" and "topical coherence," and suggest the mean vector may not generalize to domains lacking these traits. Modeling a diverse corpus as a single Gaussian centered on a mean vector risks collapsing distinct semantic clusters into a nonsensical average.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does fine-tuning the embedding inversion model on domain-specific text improve reconstruction fidelity? The authors hypothesize that "performance can be further improved by fine-tuning the vec2text decoder on domain-specific text," though this was not implemented in the current work. The experiments utilized off-the-shelf inversion models, leaving the potential gains from self-supervised domain adaptation unverified.

## Limitations

- The Gaussian assumption for semantic variability lacks corpus-specific validation, which could affect sampling effectiveness in multimodal or highly structured domains
- Sample count k is unspecified, creating ambiguity in reproducibility and making it difficult to assess the method's scalability boundaries
- The method's effectiveness depends heavily on embedding quality and the availability of compatible inversion models, which may not generalize across all domains

## Confidence

- **High**: The mean vector mechanism for capturing central semantic tendency is well-supported by both the theoretical framework and experimental results
- **Medium**: The Gaussian sampling approach shows promise but lacks direct corpus evidence for its distributional assumptions
- **Medium**: Embedding inversion via iterative refinement is demonstrated but may face domain-specific challenges

## Next Checks

1. Test the Gaussian sampling assumption by comparing reconstruction quality against alternative distributions (e.g., t-distribution or mixture models) on datasets with known multimodal semantics
2. Conduct ablation studies varying sample count k across different corpus sizes to determine optimal sampling strategies and identify scalability limits
3. Evaluate the method's performance on highly heterogeneous corpora (mixed topics, genres) to test the robustness of the mean vector representation when semantic overlap is limited
