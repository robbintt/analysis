core_contribution: The paper introduces OKBench, a fully automated framework for generating
  high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand, addressing the problem of
  static benchmarks becoming outdated and contaminated with pretraining data. The
  core method involves an agentic pipeline that automates news extraction, QA generation,
  validation, and dataset versioning, producing daily benchmarks from fresh news articles.

# OKBench: Democratizing LLM Evaluation with Fully Automated, On-Demand, Open Knowledge Benchmarking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08598
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08598
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Automated pipeline generates daily MC QA benchmarks from fresh news, showing retrieval augmentation narrows small-vs-large model gaps on novel knowledge

## Executive Summary
OKBench introduces a fully automated framework for generating dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand from fresh news articles. The system uses a four-step agentic pipeline to extract news, generate QA pairs, validate quality, and version datasets, producing approximately 2,000 high-quality questions daily at a cost of ~$4.21. Human validation confirms 92% clarity and 100% correctness on sampled questions. Evaluation reveals that while large models excel on memorized knowledge, retrieval augmentation significantly narrows performance gaps between small and large models on fresh knowledge, making robust retrieval pipelines more critical than model scale for evolving knowledge assessment.

## Method Summary
The OKBench pipeline operates through four automated steps: (1) RSS feed extraction of news articles from 20+ outlets within a 24-hour window, (2) LLM-based generation of 5 multiple-choice questions per article using GPT-4.1 with structured prompts, (3) validation filtering through a separate LLM judge that applies explicit quality criteria (no article references, clear dates, explicit identifiers), and (4) dataset versioning using MD5 signatures with metadata for reproducibility. The system generates approximately 2,000 questions per run at a cost of ~$4.21, with human validation confirming high quality (92% clarity, 100% correctness).

## Key Results
- Human validation confirms high quality: 92% clarity and 100% correctness on sampled questions
- Large performance drop on new knowledge without context (20-25% gap between 1B and 27B models) but retrieval augmentation significantly narrows this gap
- Sharp reading comprehension threshold at ~3-4B parameters: models above this achieve 90-95% oracle accuracy while ≤1B models only reach 55-60%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-agent validation produces higher-quality QA pairs than single-agent generation alone
- Mechanism: A dedicated validation agent independently checks each generated question against explicit criteria (no article references, explicit identifiers, clear date references), discarding those that fail. This separation of generation and validation creates an internal quality filter that catches LLM self-approval biases.
- Core assumption: The validation agent's criteria accurately predict human-judged question quality
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Human validation confirms high quality, with 92% clarity and 100% correctness on sampled questions"
  - [Section 3.2]: Validation achieved 92% correctness rate on clarity across 4 annotators on 200 questions; 100% answer correctness on sampled pairs
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus validation—neighbor papers (YourBench, LLM Jury-on-Demand) pursue similar automated evaluation goals but don't validate this specific multi-agent mechanism
- Break condition: If validation agent criteria become outdated or if generation models improve to rarely produce flagged errors, the validation step adds cost without quality gain

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Retrieval augmentation narrows the performance gap between small and large models on fresh knowledge
- Mechanism: When models cannot rely on parametric memory (facts post-date training cutoff), performance depends on external context. Small models with accurate retrieval achieve comparable accuracy to large models because reading comprehension saturates above ~3-4B parameters, making retrieval quality—not model scale—the dominant factor.
- Core assumption: The retrieved context contains the ground-truth answer
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "retrieval augmentation significantly narrows the performance gap between small and large models"
  - [Section 5.1, Figure 3]: No-context gap between 1B and 27B models is 20-25% on OKBench vs. 40-50% on MMLU Pro (memorized knowledge)
  - [Section 5.3]: Even 1.5B Qwen achieves >90% QA accuracy with BM25 retrieval
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus validation for this specific gap-narrowing mechanism
- Break condition: If retrieval systems fail to surface relevant documents (e.g., corpus grows too large, query-document mismatch), the mechanism collapses and parametric knowledge becomes critical again

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A reading comprehension capacity threshold exists at approximately 3-4B parameters
- Mechanism: Below this threshold, models lack sufficient representational capacity to parse passages and extract answers accurately, even when the correct passage is provided. Above it, oracle-context accuracy plateaus near 90-95%.
- Core assumption: The oracle-context task primarily tests reading comprehension, not other capabilities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 5.1, Observation 2]: "Models around or above roughly 3-4B parameters can read and understand the article sufficiently to push their Oracle accuracy to 90-95%. Yet very small LLMs (e.g., ≤ 1 B parameters) achieve only around 55-60% even with the ground-truth article"
  - [Table 8]: Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct achieves 55.06% oracle accuracy vs. Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct at 91.57%
  - [corpus]: No external corpus validation of this specific threshold
- Break condition: If architectural innovations allow smaller models to achieve similar comprehension, or if evaluation shifts to more complex reasoning requiring larger models even with context

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central comparison is between parametric recall (No-Context) and retrieval-augmented answering. Understanding RAG basics—how retrievers surface documents and how LLMs condition on them—is essential to interpret the results.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model might answer correctly with retrieval but fail without it, even if the retrieval system returns the exact source document?

- Concept: **Benchmark Contamination**
  - Why needed here: The paper's motivation stems from static benchmarks being absorbed into training data, inflating performance estimates. Understanding contamination clarifies why dynamic, fresh benchmarks matter.
  - Quick check question: If a model was trained on Wikipedia data from 2023, why might it perform suspiciously well on a 2023 Wikipedia-derived QA benchmark?

- Concept: **Lexical vs. Dense Retrieval**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares BM25 (lexical), DPR, and ColBERT v2 (dense). Understanding the difference—term matching vs. embedding similarity—explains why BM25 outperforms dense methods on fresh news.
  - Quick check question: Why might BM25 outperform a dense retriever on news articles with specific named entities and dates?
