# WirelessGPT: A Generative Pre-trained Multi-task Learning Framework for Wireless Communication

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.06877
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06877
- **Reference count**: 16
- **Primary result**: Foundation model for multi-task wireless communication achieving up to 41.44% NMSE reduction in channel estimation and 98.11% accuracy in human activity recognition

## Executive Summary
WirelessGPT introduces a foundation model framework for multi-task learning in wireless communication and sensing systems. The model leverages large-scale wireless channel datasets for unsupervised pretraining to extract universal channel representations that capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. By reducing reliance on task-specific labeled data, WirelessGPT achieves superior performance across diverse wireless tasks while maintaining a manageable parameter size of approximately 80 million.

The framework addresses critical limitations in conventional wireless systems that require separate models for different tasks, offering a unified solution for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over conventional methods, with the model achieving up to 41.44% NMSE reduction in channel estimation and 98.11% accuracy in human activity recognition. This establishes WirelessGPT as a new benchmark for multi-task wireless systems and foundation models in the domain.

## Method Summary
WirelessGPT employs a generative pre-training approach using large-scale unlabeled wireless channel datasets to learn universal representations. The model architecture is designed to capture spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in wireless communication signals through transformer-based components. During pretraining, the framework learns to reconstruct wireless channel information from masked or corrupted inputs, enabling it to develop robust feature extraction capabilities. For downstream tasks, the model undergoes task-specific fine-tuning with minimal labeled data, leveraging the universal representations learned during pretraining. The framework supports multiple wireless tasks including channel estimation, signal detection, and human activity recognition within a single unified architecture.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 41.44% NMSE reduction in channel estimation tasks compared to conventional methods
- Reached 98.11% accuracy in human activity recognition tasks
- Demonstrated strong performance across multiple wireless tasks with only ~80 million parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's effectiveness stems from its ability to learn universal channel representations during unsupervised pretraining. By exposing the network to vast amounts of unlabeled wireless channel data, WirelessGPT captures the underlying statistical patterns and spatiotemporal correlations that are common across different wireless tasks. This pretraining phase enables the model to develop a rich understanding of wireless signal characteristics before being fine-tuned for specific applications. The transformer architecture facilitates capturing long-range dependencies in the data, while the multi-task learning framework ensures that knowledge transfer occurs across related wireless functions. The combination of unsupervised pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning allows the model to generalize well while maintaining task-specific accuracy.
