# Monitoring of Static Fairness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.03048
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03048
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: General framework for runtime monitoring of algorithmic fairness using statistical estimation on Markov chains

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for monitoring algorithmic fairness in decision-making systems with unknown models but assumed Markov chain structure. The approach constructs monitors that observe sequences of events and provide quantitative, statistically sound estimates of fairness properties after each observation. The framework supports monitoring properties like demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social burden through Bounded Specification Expressions (BSEs).

The monitors are designed to work with both partially observed Markov chains (POMCs) and fully observed Markov chains (MCs), with different assumptions and accuracy levels for each case. The system uses McDiarmid-style concentration inequalities and martingale-based tools to construct confidence intervals around point estimates, providing guarantees about the correctness of the fairness assessments.

## Method Summary
The core method involves building monitors that observe long sequences of events from a system and output quantitative, statistically sound estimates of fairness or bias after each observation. Two types of monitors are presented: pointwise sound monitors (correct at each time step with high probability) and uniformly sound monitors (correct at all time points with high probability). The monitors use McDiarmid-style concentration inequalities and martingale-based tools to construct confidence intervals around point estimates.

For POMCs, the framework assumes irreducibility, positive recurrence, aperiodicity, and knowledge of mixing time. For MCs, a restricted fragment of BSEs called Probabilistic Specification Expressions (PSEs) is used, requiring fewer assumptions. The monitors are evaluated on lending and college admission examples, demonstrating their practical utility for real-time fairness monitoring with computation times per step ranging from 13-54 microseconds.

## Key Results
- Monitors for partially observed Markov chains (POMCs) with BSEs requiring assumptions about irreducibility, positive recurrence, aperiodicity, and knowledge of mixing time
- More accurate monitors for fully observed Markov chains (MCs) with Probabilistic Specification Expressions (PSEs), requiring fewer assumptions
- Empirical evaluations show monitors are extremely lightweight, with average computation times per step ranging from 13-54 microseconds and requiring between 15-46 registers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the Markov chain structure of the decision-making system to apply statistical concentration inequalities. The McDiarmid-style inequalities provide bounds on how much the estimated fairness metrics can deviate from their true values based on the number of observations. Martingale-based tools are used to track the evolution of the estimates over time, allowing the construction of confidence intervals that tighten as more data is observed.

The distinction between pointwise and uniformly sound monitors addresses the trade-off between immediate accuracy and long-term reliability. Pointwise sound monitors provide guarantees at each time step but may have wider confidence intervals early on, while uniformly sound monitors maintain validity across all time points but may require more conservative estimates initially.

## Foundational Learning
- Markov Chain Theory: Needed to model the decision-making system and apply statistical convergence results. Quick check: Verify that the system's state transitions satisfy the Markov property.
- McDiarmid's Inequality: Used to bound the deviation of fairness estimates from their true values. Quick check: Confirm that the bounded differences condition holds for the estimate functions.
- Martingale Theory: Enables tracking of estimate evolution over time and construction of confidence intervals. Quick check: Validate that the difference sequence forms a martingale.
- Bounded Specification Expressions (BSEs): Formal language for expressing fairness properties. Quick check: Ensure that the desired fairness property can be expressed as a BSE.
- Probabilistic Specification Expressions (PSEs): Restricted fragment of BSEs for fully observed MCs. Quick check: Verify that the fairness property can be expressed as a PSE for MC case.
- Mixing Time: Required for POMC monitors to ensure convergence to steady-state distribution. Quick check: Estimate or bound the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Event Stream -> State Estimation -> Fairness Property Evaluation -> Statistical Estimation -> Confidence Interval Output
- Critical Path: The path from event observation to confidence interval output, involving state estimation, property evaluation, and statistical analysis
- Design Tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. computational efficiency, pointwise vs. uniform soundness guarantees, POMC vs. MC assumptions
- Failure Signatures: Violations of Markov assumptions, inaccurate mixing time estimates, non-convergence of statistical estimates
- First Experiments: (1) Test monitor accuracy on synthetic Markov chains with known fairness properties. (2) Evaluate computational overhead under varying event rates and system complexities. (3) Assess sensitivity to misspecification of Markov chain parameters or mixing time estimates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Strong assumptions about Markov chain structure (irreducibility, positive recurrence, aperiodicity) may not hold in real-world systems
- Empirical evaluation focuses on synthetic examples; performance on complex, real-world datasets is unclear
- Requires knowledge of mixing times for POMC monitors, which may be difficult to estimate accurately in practice

## Confidence
- Theoretical Contributions: High - rigorous mathematical framework and established concentration inequalities
- Practical Utility: Medium - limited empirical validation and strong assumptions required for statistical guarantees

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the monitors on real-world datasets from domains like criminal justice, healthcare, or hiring to assess performance when assumptions may be violated.
2. Develop and test extensions of the framework to handle non-Markovian systems or cases where the Markov chain structure is only approximately true.
3. Investigate the sensitivity of the monitors to the accuracy of the mixing time estimates and the impact of model misspecification on the fairness assessments.
