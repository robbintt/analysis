# M4V: Multi-Modal Mamba for Text-to-Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.10915
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10915
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Linear-complexity Mamba-based text-to-video generation achieving 45% FLOPs reduction vs. PyramidFlow while maintaining comparable quality

## Executive Summary
M4V introduces a Multi-Modal Mamba framework that replaces quadratic-complexity attention layers with linear-complexity Mamba blocks for efficient text-to-video generation. The model reduces computational overhead by 45% at 768×1280 resolution while maintaining comparable video quality to PyramidFlow. Key innovations include MM-Token Re-Composition for bidirectional text-video token fusion and Per-Frame Registers for temporal awareness, addressing Mamba's limitations in multi-modal and spatiotemporal modeling. The framework demonstrates strong performance on quality, motion, and semantic metrics with a VBench Total Score of 81.91% after reward learning and synthetic data integration.

## Method Summary
M4V is a Multi-Modal Mamba framework designed for efficient text-to-video generation that addresses the computational bottleneck of attention-based models. The core innovation replaces traditional attention layers with Mamba blocks, reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear. To overcome Mamba's limitations in handling multi-modal inputs and spatiotemporal dependencies, the model introduces MM-Token Re-Composition for bidirectional fusion of text and video tokens, and Per-Frame Registers to maintain temporal awareness across frames. A lightweight temporal branch with causal attention further improves motion consistency. The framework is trained with reward learning and synthetic data integration, achieving a VBench Total Score of 81.91% while reducing FLOPs by 45% compared to PyramidFlow at high resolution.

## Key Results
- Reduces FLOPs by 45% at 768×1280 resolution compared to PyramidFlow
- Achieves VBench Total Score of 81.91% after reward learning and synthetic data integration
- Maintains comparable video quality to attention-based models while improving efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
M4V leverages the linear complexity of Mamba blocks to significantly reduce computational overhead in text-to-video generation. The MM-Token Re-Composition enables effective bidirectional fusion between text and video tokens, addressing Mamba's weakness in multi-modal modeling. Per-Frame Registers provide temporal awareness that Mamba lacks natively, while the lightweight temporal branch with causal attention ensures motion consistency. Reward learning and synthetic data integration further enhance performance on quality, motion, and semantic metrics.

## Foundational Learning

**Mamba blocks:** State space models with linear complexity that replace attention layers. Why needed: To reduce the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms. Quick check: Verify linear vs. quadratic scaling in computational graphs.

**MM-Token Re-Composition:** Bidirectional fusion mechanism for text-video tokens. Why needed: To overcome Mamba's limitations in handling multi-modal inputs. Quick check: Ensure token exchange patterns maintain semantic coherence.

**Per-Frame Registers:** Temporal awareness mechanism across video frames. Why needed: To address Mamba's inherent weakness in spatiotemporal modeling. Quick check: Validate temporal consistency across generated frames.

**Causal attention:** Directional attention mechanism for temporal modeling. Why needed: To ensure proper temporal dependencies in video generation. Quick check: Confirm causality constraints in attention masks.

**Reward learning:** Optimization technique using feedback signals. Why needed: To improve model performance on quality and semantic metrics. Quick check: Verify reward signal alignment with evaluation metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Text embedding -> MM-Token Re-Composition -> Mamba blocks -> Per-Frame Registers -> Temporal branch (causal attention) -> Video generation

**Critical path:** Text embedding → MM-Token Re-Composition → Mamba blocks → Video synthesis

**Design tradeoffs:** Mamba's linear complexity vs. attention's richer contextual modeling; efficiency gains vs. potential loss in complex interactions

**Failure signatures:** Loss of temporal coherence, reduced multi-modal understanding, or artifacts in video generation

**First experiments:**
1. Compare FLOPs and latency between M4V and attention-based baseline
2. Validate temporal consistency across generated video frames
3. Test multi-modal understanding through text-video alignment metrics
