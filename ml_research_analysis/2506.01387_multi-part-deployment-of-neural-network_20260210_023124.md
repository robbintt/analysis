core_contribution: This paper addresses the scalability and infrastructure cost challenges
  of training and deploying modern large-scale neural networks, exemplified by models
  with hundreds of billions of parameters, by proposing a distributed architecture
  that partitions networks across multiple servers. The core method involves dividing
  neurons into local and remote categories, where each server manages its local neurons
  and uses metadata to dynamically invoke and compute remote neurons on other servers.

- Primary result: Proposed distributed architecture partitions neural networks across multiple servers to reduce infrastructure costs while maintaining computational accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the growing challenge of deploying large-scale neural networks by proposing a distributed architecture that partitions networks across multiple servers rather than relying on monolithic GPU clusters. The approach addresses the infrastructure cost and scalability limitations of modern models with hundreds of billions of parameters. By dividing neurons into local and remote categories and using a Multi-Part Neural Network Execution Engine, the system enables cost-effective, scalable deployment in cloud environments while maintaining computational accuracy and synchronization.

## Method Summary
The proposed method divides neural networks into distributed components across multiple servers. Each server manages local neurons while using metadata to dynamically invoke and compute remote neurons on other servers. The architecture employs a Multi-Part Neural Network Execution Engine to orchestrate distributed computation and a shared network file system to ensure model consistency. A Neuron Distributor component enables flexible partitioning strategies. This approach significantly reduces the need for expensive monolithic GPU clusters while maintaining computational accuracy and synchronization across distributed components.

## Key Results
- Distributed architecture enables cost-effective deployment of large-scale neural networks in cloud environments
- Neuron partitioning strategy divides neurons into local and remote categories for distributed computation
- Multi-Part Neural Network Execution Engine orchestrates distributed computation while maintaining synchronization
- Shared network file system ensures model consistency across distributed servers
- Neuron Distributor enables flexible partitioning strategies for optimal resource utilization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The architecture works by distributing neural network computation across multiple servers rather than concentrating it on a single powerful machine. Local neurons are computed directly on each server, while remote neurons are dynamically invoked using metadata that tracks their locations. The Multi-Part Neural Network Execution Engine coordinates this distributed computation, ensuring proper synchronization and data flow between servers. The shared network file system maintains a consistent model state across all servers, while the Neuron Distributor enables intelligent partitioning based on computational requirements and network characteristics.

- **Neuron Partitioning Strategies**: Important for understanding how to optimally divide neural networks across servers. Quick check: What factors influence the choice of partitioning strategy?
- **Dynamic Neuron Invocation**: Key to understanding how remote neurons are accessed and computed on other servers. Quick check: How does metadata facilitate dynamic neuron invocation?
- **Cloud Infrastructure Cost Optimization**: Relevant for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of distributed deployment. Quick check: How does multi-server deployment reduce infrastructure costs compared to monolithic clusters?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Neuron Distributor -> Multi-Part Neural Network Execution Engine -> Local/Remote Neuron Computation -> Shared Network File System

**Critical Path**: Neuron Distributor partitions the network → Multi-Part Execution Engine orchestrates computation → Local neurons computed directly → Remote neurons dynamically invoked using metadata → Results synchronized via shared file system

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture trades increased network communication overhead for reduced infrastructure costs and improved scalability. While distributed deployment may introduce latency due to inter-server communication, it eliminates the need for expensive monolithic GPU clusters and enables more flexible resource allocation.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Network partition failures could isolate servers and prevent remote neuron computation
- Metadata inconsistency may lead to incorrect neuron invocation
- Shared file system synchronization issues could cause model divergence
- Server failures could impact availability of local and remote neurons

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Deploy a simple neural network (e.g., MNIST classifier) across two servers to validate basic distributed computation
2. Measure latency and throughput for varying ratios of local to remote neurons
3. Test model accuracy consistency when scaling to multiple servers with different partitioning strategies

## Limitations
- No empirical performance metrics or comparative analysis against existing distributed training approaches
- Missing runtime performance benchmarks for distributed vs. monolithic deployment
- Lack of evaluation for communication overhead between servers
- No discussion of failure recovery mechanisms in distributed settings
- Unclear scalability bounds for proposed partitioning strategies

## Confidence
- High confidence in architectural description and conceptual framework
- Medium confidence in claimed cost-effectiveness and scalability benefits
- Low confidence in performance characteristics and practical implementation details

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark latency and throughput for distributed inference across varying network topologies and neuron partition ratios
2. Conduct cost analysis comparing multi-server deployment against GPU cluster solutions for equivalent workloads
3. Evaluate model accuracy consistency under network partitioning and partial server failures
