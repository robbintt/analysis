- Introduces AfriCaption, the first multilingual image captioning model and dataset covering 20 African languages

## Executive Summary
AfriCaption addresses the underrepresentation of African languages in multimodal AI by introducing the first multilingual image captioning model and dataset covering 20 African languages. The framework curates a semantically aligned dataset from Flickr8k using a context-preserving pipeline with machine translation and quality checks, then develops a 0.5B parameter model integrating SigLIP and NLLB200. The dataset and model are evaluated across 20 languages, demonstrating superior performance over prior approaches like Pangea in BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE metrics, though translation quality varies significantly by language due to differing digital representation and MT support. Human evaluations confirm generally adequate captions with notable variation in quality across languages.

## Method Summary
AfriCaption uses a two-stage training approach on L4 GPU: Stage 0 (40 epochs) freezes all except last encoder layer and projector with learning rate 2e-5 and batch size 16, while Stage 1 (30 epochs) unfreezes all with warmup plus inverse root decay. The model combines SigLIP (ViT-based, multilingual) vision encoder with NLLB-200 decoder via Hugging Face VisionEncoderDecoderModel, connected through a linear projector. Captions are selected from Flickr8k using SentenceBERT pairwise similarity, translated using ensemble MT models (NLLB200, M2M100, Azure Translate), and filtered by LaBSE cosine similarity threshold [0.53, 0.98]. Target language codes are provided via forced BOS token during training.

## Key Results
- AfriCaption outperforms Pangea baselines across BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE metrics on 20 African languages
- Performance varies significantly by language, with Yoruba achieving highest human adequacy scores and Hausa lowest
- BLEU/ChrF++ scores range widely (Kabyle 0.85 BLEU vs Dinka 0.004), reflecting MT support differences
- Model generates generally adequate captions as confirmed by human evaluations, though morphologically complex languages face challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Context-Preserving Pipeline
- Multiple MT models generate candidate translations; LaBSE embeddings compute cosine similarity against source; highest-scoring translation is retained; heuristic filter [0.53, 0.98] removes low-quality outputs; dynamic substitution allows future model upgrades without rebuilding dataset
- Assumes LaBSE semantic similarity correlates with human adequacy for African languages under domain shift from image captions
- Evidence: "context-aware selection and translation process" and cosine similarity measurement described in abstract and section 4
- Break condition: If LaBSE similarity systematically diverges from human adequacy for morphologically complex or low-resource languages, filtering threshold may retain semantically drifted translations or discard valid ones

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Lingual Vision-Language Alignment
- SigLIP encodes images into visual features; linear projector maps features to NLLB-200 decoder hidden size; cross-attention conditions caption generation on visual features; two-stage training aligns modalities while preserving NLLB-200's multilingual knowledge
- Assumes NLLB-200's multilingual representations are sufficiently robust for low-resource African languages to decode grounded visual concepts despite limited African-language pretraining data
- Evidence: "integrates SigLIP and NLLB200 for caption generation across under-represented languages" and training procedure described in section 6.4
- Break condition: If NLLB-200's internal representations for low-resource languages are too weak or noisy, cross-attention may amplify errors, producing fluent but ungrounded captions

### Mechanism 3: Language Performance Correlation
- Performance variance correlates with prior MT training data and digital representation; languages with larger digital footprints and better MT support have higher-quality synthetic captions, yielding better human adequacy scores and model metrics
- Assumes BLEU/ChrF++ trends and human evaluation patterns generalize to other African-language multimodal settings
- Evidence: Yoruba highest human score, Hausa lowest; BLEU/ChrF++ vary widely (Kabyle 0.85 BLEU vs Dinka 0.004); "languages like Hausa and Yoruba... yielded better results compared to languages like Ewe or Dinka"
- Break condition: If data augmentation via related-language transfer compensates for low digital representation, correlation between prior MT support and final quality may weaken

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive vs. caption-based vision-language alignment
  - Why needed here: AfriCaption uses SigLIP (contrastive, sigmoid loss) as visual encoder but trains with captioning loss; understanding when contrastive features suffice vs. when captioning signals improve spatial/relational reasoning is critical for low-resource settings
  - Quick check question: For a new language pair, would you pretrain with contrastive alignment first or directly fine-tune on caption data? Why?

- Concept: Encoder-decoder cross-attention
  - Why needed here: The model projects visual features into decoder's hidden space and conditions generation via cross-attention; diagnosing attention patterns helps detect grounding failures
  - Quick check question: If decoder generates plausible captions but ignores image details, which component would you inspect first?

- Concept: Synthetic data quality estimation under domain shift
  - Why needed here: Pipeline relies on MT-generated captions filtered by semantic similarity; for low-resource languages, back-translation metrics and thresholding can misestimate quality
  - Quick check question: When BLEU is low but human adequacy is reasonable, what alternative metric or process would you add to pipeline?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image -> SigLIP encoder -> patch embeddings + pooled output -> Projector -> NLLB-200 decoder -> Autoregressive token generation with cross-attention
- Critical path: 1) Image → SigLIP encoder → patch embeddings + pooled output; 2) Projector maps visual features to decoder hidden size; 3) NLLB decoder generates tokens autoregressively conditioned on visual features via cross-attention; 4) During training: right-shifted decoder inputs + causal mask; during inference: greedy or beam search with language code prompt
- Design tradeoffs: Frozen encoder vs. full fine-tuning (frozen preserves pretrained vision features; fine-tuning improves grounding but risks overfitting); Ensemble MT vs. single best MT (ensemble improves robustness but adds complexity); Threshold selection (0.53-0.98) (higher improves precision but may discard usable data for very low-resource languages)
- Failure signatures: Fluent but ungrounded captions (decoder ignores cross-attention; check projector initialization and cross-attention weights); Repeated or truncated outputs (tokenization or language-code misconfiguration; verify NLLB language codes and special tokens); High training loss, low validation gain (overfitting to noisy synthetic captions; consider data filtering or augmentation); Sharp quality disparity across languages (MT quality variance; inspect per-language similarity scores and human eval distributions)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Ablate training stages: train only Stage 0 vs. only Stage 1 vs. both; compare BLEU/CIDEr/SPICE and human adequacy on held-out subset for two high- and two low-resource languages; 2) Threshold sensitivity analysis: evaluate dataset quality and downstream model performance at similarity thresholds 0.45, 0.53, 0.60, 0.70 for stratified sample of languages; report tradeoffs between data volume and caption adequacy; 3) Cross-attention visualization: for set of images and generated captions, visualize decoder cross-attention maps to verify grounding; identify failure modes (e.g., attention collapse to [CLS] or uniform attention)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can cross-lingual transfer from high-resource African languages (e.g., Luganda) effectively bootstrap captioning performance for low-resource languages within the same family? [explicit] Section 7 explicitly asks this question; the current study did not perform experiments on cross-lingual transfer learning between language families.
- To what extent does reliance on Western-centric source images (Flickr8k) limit model's ability to generate culturally relevant or contextually accurate descriptions for African contexts? [explicit] Section 9 states work "lacks cultural awareness" and does not capture "culturally specific references"; Section 8 advocates for "culturally specific imagery."
- Do standard automated metrics (BLEU, CIDEr) correlate strongly with human judgments of semantic adequacy for morphologically complex languages present in AfriCaption? [inferred] Section 5.3 notes BLEU scores may be "artificially low" for morphologically complex languages, and Section 9 states these metrics "miss semantic nuances."

## Limitations

- Reliance on synthetic data through MT introduces fundamental limitations tied to quality and coverage of African language models, particularly for low-resource languages
- SigLIP-NLLB200 architecture lacks direct validation for this specific pairing in African language contexts, raising questions about cross-attention grounding in low-resource settings
- Context-preserving pipeline's effectiveness depends on unproven semantic alignment capability of LaBSE embeddings under domain shift from general text to image captions for morphologically complex African languages

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Existence and basic functionality of AfriCaption dataset and model pipeline; performance gap between high-resource (Yoruba, Hausa) and low-resource (Dinka, Ewe) languages; superiority over Pangea across multiple metrics
- Medium Confidence: Effectiveness of context-preserving pipeline in maintaining semantic fidelity; adequacy of SigLIP-NLLB200 for cross-lingual transfer in African languages
- Low Confidence: Generalizability of performance patterns to other African-language multimodal settings; sufficiency of LaBSE similarity as proxy for human adequacy in low-resource languages

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluations comparing LaBSE cosine similarity scores against human adequacy ratings for stratified sample of 100 captions across 10 African languages spanning high-to-low resource to validate [0.53, 0.98] threshold correlation with human judgment

2. For subset of 50 images, visualize and analyze decoder cross-attention patterns across generated captions to identify whether attention mechanisms properly ground on relevant image regions or exhibit patterns of ignoring visual input

3. Implement controlled experiment where synthetic captions for low-resource languages are generated using related high-resource languages (e.g., Bantu-family bootstrapping for Ewe) and compare model performance against baseline synthetic captions to test correlation between prior MT support and final quality
