# BPMN Assistant: An LLM-Based Approach to Business Process Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24592
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24592
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: JSON intermediate representation improves LLM-based BPMN editing efficiency by 43% and reliability for open-weights models from 8% to 50%

## Executive Summary
BPMN Assistant is a tool that uses large language models to generate and edit BPMN diagrams from natural language descriptions. Instead of generating verbose BPMN XML directly, the system employs a structured JSON intermediate representation that simplifies editing operations and improves reliability. The approach was evaluated against direct XML generation using models including GPT-5.1, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek V3, showing comparable similarity scores with significantly better performance metrics and reliability for open-weights models.

## Method Summary
The system uses a three-tier architecture with FastAPI backend, Node.js layout server, and Vue.js frontend. It employs a JSON intermediate representation with hierarchical process elements and atomic editing functions (delete_element, add_element, move_element, update_element, redirect_branch). A validation layer with self-correction loop ensures output quality. The approach was compared against direct XML generation across 60 process descriptions and 40 editing tasks using GED/RGED similarity scores, latency, and token counts as metrics.

## Key Results
- JSON approach achieves slightly higher RGED similarity scores (0.72 vs 0.70) compared to direct XML generation
- 43% latency reduction and 75% token savings with JSON representation
- Dramatic improvement in editing success rates for open-weights models: DeepSeek V3 jumps from 8% to 50% success

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The JSON intermediate representation provides a structured, validated interface that simplifies LLM interaction with BPMN models. By breaking down complex XML structures into atomic editing operations, the system reduces the cognitive load on language models and enables more reliable generation. The hierarchical JSON schema captures essential BPMN elements while abstracting away verbose XML syntax, allowing models to focus on business logic rather than markup structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **BPMN XML Structure**: Complex hierarchical format with activities, sequence flows, and gateways - needed for understanding why direct generation is challenging
- **GED/RGED Similarity Metrics**: Graph edit distance measures structural similarity between BPMN models - needed for automated evaluation
- **JSON Intermediate Representation**: Structured schema that maps to BPMN elements - needed for reliable LLM editing
- **Function Calling in LLMs**: Structured output format for specific operations - needed for atomic editing functions
- **Self-Correction Loops**: Iterative validation and refinement of LLM outputs - needed for quality assurance
- **Open-Weights Model Limitations**: Reliability issues with smaller or less capable models - needed to understand performance differences

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
User -> Vue.js Frontend -> FastAPI Backend -> LLM API -> JSON Schema -> bpmn-auto-layout -> BPMN.js

Critical Path:
Natural language input → LLM processing via JSON schema → Validation self-correction → BPMN rendering

Design Tradeoffs:
- JSON intermediate representation adds abstraction layer but improves reliability and efficiency
- Open-weights models show significant performance differences, favoring structured approach
- Current implementation excludes complex BPMN features (lanes, subprocesses) for reliability

Failure Signatures:
- Invalid JSON structure: missing required fields or malformed hierarchy
- Reference hallucination: sequence flows or next fields pointing to non-existent element IDs
- Syntax errors in XML output: unclosed tags or malformed attributes

First Experiments:
1. Generate BPMN model from simple process description using both JSON and XML approaches
2. Perform basic editing operation (add/remove activity) on existing model
3. Compare latency and token usage between JSON and XML generation methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- **Question:** Does the JSON-based approach maintain semantic correctness and behavioral soundness when evaluated using formal verification methods like Petri nets?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors acknowledge, "Due to the lack of semantic evaluation, the results should be considered experimental, as there is no guarantee that the business logic will be correctly integrated."
- **Why unresolved:** The study relied exclusively on structural similarity metrics (GED/RGED) and syntactic validity, explicitly excluding conformance checking or execution simulation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation results showing that generated models pass formal soundness checks (e.g., deadlocks, lack of sync) or align with ground-truth event logs via conformance checking.

**Open Question 2**
- **Question:** How does the tool perform in real-world scenarios involving non-technical users and ambiguous natural language inputs?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper states, "Human-computer interaction (HCI) studies would be necessary to properly evaluate the usability of the system for non-technical users" and notes difficulties with "multilingual or context-specific scenarios."
- **Why unresolved:** The evaluation was automated using curated datasets and did not measure cognitive load, user satisfaction, or the system's ability to clarify ambiguous user intent.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Findings from a user study measuring task success rates and cognitive effort for business stakeholders using the tool interactively.

**Open Question 3**
- **Question:** Can the structured intermediate representation be extended to support complex collaboration diagrams (pools and lanes) without degrading reliability?
- **Basis in paper:** The limitations section notes, "the current implementation does not support collaboration diagrams (pools and lanes) or complex artifacts like data objects."
- **Why unresolved:** The current JSON schema was optimized for executable process orchestration and restricts the element set to ensure the high reliability reported in the results.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A schema extension handling swimlanes and associated success rate metrics for generating multi-participant models compared to the current XML baseline.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on automated GED similarity without human validation of semantic correctness or usability
- Small dataset (60 generation tasks, 40 editing tasks) may not capture full real-world complexity
- Critical experimental details like exact prompts and hyperparameters not specified, limiting reproducibility

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Comparative performance metrics (RGED scores, latency reduction, token savings, editing success rates) are clearly derived from described experimental setup
- **Medium confidence**: Architectural design is logically sound but lacks validation of semantic correctness of generated models
- **Medium confidence**: Benefits of JSON approach are supported by results but based on automated measures rather than human evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation study to assess semantic correctness and practical usability of BPMN models beyond automated GED similarity
2. Extend evaluation to more complex BPMN constructs (subprocesses, lanes, events) and larger, more diverse dataset
3. Perform longitudinal study on maintainability and extensibility of JSON intermediate representation as BPMN standards evolve
