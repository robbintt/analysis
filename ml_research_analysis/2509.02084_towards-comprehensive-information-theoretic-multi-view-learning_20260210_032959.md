core_contribution: This paper addresses the limitations of existing information-theoretic
  multi-view learning methods that rely on the assumption of multi-view redundancy,
  which states that common information between views is necessary and sufficient for
  downstream tasks. The proposed Comprehensive Information-theoretic Multi-view Learning
  (CIML) framework explicitly discards this assumption by jointly leveraging both
  common and unique information.

# Towards Comprehensive Information-theoretic Multi-view Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02084
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02084
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 100% accuracy on MSRC-v1 dataset while outperforming state-of-the-art methods on six real-world datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel information-theoretic framework for multi-view learning that explicitly moves beyond the traditional assumption of multi-view redundancy. The Comprehensive Information-theoretic Multi-view Learning (CIML) framework jointly leverages both common and unique information across multiple views, rather than only focusing on shared information as existing methods do. By decomposing the information space into common and unique components and optimizing them separately, CIML achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets while providing theoretical guarantees about predictive sufficiency for downstream tasks.

## Method Summary
CIML consists of two main modules: a consistency-learning module that maximizes Gacs-Korner common information between views and compresses it using the Information Bottleneck principle to extract task-relevant representations, and a uniqueness-learning module that learns compressed unique representations for each view while minimizing mutual information between unique and common representations as well as among different unique representations. The method theoretically proves that the learned joint representation is predictively sufficient for downstream tasks, addressing a fundamental limitation of existing approaches that discard view-specific information.

## Key Results
- Achieves 100% accuracy on MSRC-v1 dataset, outperforming all comparison methods
- Demonstrates significant performance improvements across LandUse-21, Caltech101-20, NUS, Scene-15, and NoisyMNIST datasets
- Shows that leveraging both common and unique information provides substantial benefits over methods that only use shared information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by recognizing that multi-view learning should not discard unique information from individual views. By explicitly modeling both common information (shared across views) and unique information (view-specific), CIML captures a more complete representation of the data. The Information Bottleneck principle ensures that only task-relevant information is retained while noise is filtered out, and the mutual information minimization prevents interference between common and unique components.

## Foundational Learning

**Information Bottleneck Principle**
- Why needed: Provides a principled way to compress representations while preserving task-relevant information
- Quick check: Verify that the mutual information between compressed representation and input decreases while mutual information with task label is maintained

**Gacs-Korner Common Information**
- Why needed: Quantifies the exact amount of information that is simultaneously extractable from all views
- Quick check: Ensure that the common information measure is properly maximized before compression

**Mutual Information Minimization**
- Why needed: Prevents interference between common and unique information components
- Quick check: Verify that mutual information between common and unique representations is minimized during training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input Views -> Common Information Extractor -> Information Bottleneck Compression -> Common Representation
                    \                                      /
                     -> Unique Information Extractors -> Information Bottleneck Compression -> Unique Representations
                                                                  \                          /
                                                                   -> Mutual Information Minimization

**Critical Path**
1. Extract common information across all views using Gacs-Korner measure
2. Compress common information using Information Bottleneck
3. Extract unique information for each view
4. Compress unique information using Information Bottleneck
5. Minimize mutual information between common and unique components

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Computational complexity vs. information completeness: Using Gacs-Korner common information provides theoretical rigor but is computationally expensive
- Compression level vs. task performance: Information Bottleneck compression must balance between removing noise and preserving task-relevant information
- Common vs. unique information weighting: The relative importance of common and unique components may vary depending on the dataset and task

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance when task-relevant information is highly entangled across views
- Computational bottlenecks when dealing with high-dimensional or large-scale datasets
- Suboptimal results when the assumption of clean separation between common and unique information does not hold

**First Experiments**
1. Test on synthetic datasets where ground truth common and unique information is known
2. Ablation study comparing performance with and without uniqueness-learning module
3. Evaluate sensitivity to Information Bottleneck compression parameter settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations

- The theoretical foundation relies heavily on Gacs-Korner common information, which is computationally intractable for continuous variables in practice, with practical approximations potentially not maintaining theoretical guarantees
- The assumption that task-relevant information can be cleanly separated into common and unique components may not hold in many real-world scenarios where information is entangled or distributed across views in complex ways
- Scalability claims are not thoroughly validated, with computational complexity of calculating Gacs-Korner common information and Information Bottleneck principle at scale not adequately addressed

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Experimental methodology is sound with appropriate dataset selection and comparison to state-of-the-art methods, with statistically significant and reproducible performance improvements

**Medium Confidence:** Theoretical claims about predictive sufficiency require careful scrutiny, as practical approximations may not fully preserve theoretical properties, and the assumption of multi-view sufficiency for downstream tasks needs more empirical validation across diverse task types

**Low Confidence:** Scalability claims lack thorough validation, with method's performance on high-dimensional or very large datasets remaining unclear

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Test:** Evaluate CIML's performance and computational efficiency on datasets with 10× more samples and features than those used in the paper, measuring both accuracy and training/inference time

2. **Information Entanglement Analysis:** Design experiments where task-relevant information is intentionally distributed across views in non-separable ways to test whether CIML's assumption about common/unique information separation breaks down

3. **Theoretical Approximation Validation:** Conduct ablation studies comparing CIML's performance when using exact versus approximate calculations of Gacs-Korner common information and Information Bottleneck, quantifying the impact of these approximations on final task performance
