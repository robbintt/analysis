# Decentralized Weather Forecasting via Distributed Machine Learning and Blockchain-Based Model Validation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09299
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09299
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Decentralized weather forecasting system achieves MAE: 1.95, RMSE: 2.05, MAPE: 1.50 with blockchain-based model validation

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a decentralized weather forecasting system that combines federated learning (FL), Ethereum blockchain, and IPFS storage to address security and scalability issues in centralized weather prediction systems. The approach enables collaborative model training while preserving privacy, using reputation-weighted voting on blockchain to validate and promote high-quality models. Experiments demonstrate competitive forecasting accuracy while enhancing resilience against adversarial attacks through consensus-based validation mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The system implements independent local model training using LSTM networks on private weather datasets, with trained models uploaded to IPFS and referenced on Ethereum via content identifiers (CIDs). A reputation-based voting mechanism filters model submissions, where clients with ≥10 reputation points evaluate and vote on submitted models. The smart contract computes reputation-weighted averages to determine model quality and promote models that outperform the current primary. The architecture uses Flask for backend orchestration, MetaMask for user authentication, and Z-score normalization for preprocessing, with performance measured across temperature regression and secondary classification tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieved competitive forecasting accuracy with MAE: 1.95, RMSE: 2.05, MAPE: 1.50 for temperature prediction
- Successfully implemented reputation-based voting mechanism to filter low-quality model submissions
- Demonstrated resilience against Sybil attacks through enforced voting weight restrictions
- Validated tamper-evident storage using IPFS content addressing with cryptographic CIDs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Local training on distributed weather data sources preserves privacy while enabling collaborative model improvement. Clients train LSTM models locally using sktime framework on private weather datasets, uploading only trained model artifacts to IPFS. Weather data's local structure enables meaningful training without cross-client data access. Evidence shows FL enhances privacy and reduces data transfer overhead. Break condition occurs if local datasets are too small or non-representative.

### Mechanism 2
- Reputation-weighted voting via smart contracts filters low-quality or malicious model submissions. Clients with ≥10 reputation points evaluate submitted models, with the smart contract computing final scores as reputation-weighted averages. Submitters gain/lose reputation based on model performance relative to the current primary model. Honest participants with high reputation reliably outscore malicious submissions over time. Evidence shows tests for Sybil attacks prevented manipulation through voting weight restrictions. Break condition occurs if adversaries coordinate to accumulate reputation before turning malicious.

### Mechanism 3
- IPFS-based content addressing provides tamper-evident model storage with reduced on-chain costs. Trained models are uploaded to IPFS, generating unique CIDs as cryptographic hashes. Only CIDs are stored on-chain, enabling detection of tampering since any model modification produces a different CID. IPFS network accessibility and CID-to-content mapping stability are assumed. Evidence shows IPFS modifications result in different CIDs for integrity maintenance. Break condition occurs if IPFS nodes go offline without sufficient replicas.

## Foundational Learning

- **Federated Learning (FL)**: Why needed here because the system uses independent retraining with blockchain validation rather than synchronous FL aggregation. Quick check: Can you explain why this system's "independent retraining + blockchain validation" differs from standard FL with a central aggregator?

- **Ethereum Smart Contract Security Patterns**: Why needed here because the paper relies on checks-effects-interactions pattern, require statements for access control, and gas optimization. Quick check: What does the checks-effects-interactions pattern prevent, and where is it applied in the smart contract?

- **Time-Series Forecasting with LSTM**: Why needed here because the system uses LSTM networks for weather prediction requiring understanding of temporal dependencies and train/test splitting. Quick check: Why must future data points be excluded from the training set in time-series forecasting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Smart contract (reputation, voting, model promotion) -> Flask backend (model training, inference, RBAC) -> Web frontend (user interaction, MetaMask wallet connection) -> IPFS storage layer (off-chain model artifacts with CID references)

- **Critical path**: Client retrains model locally → Model uploaded to IPFS → CID submitted to smart contract → Sufficient reputation-weighted votes collected → Final score computed → If score exceeds threshold and outperforms current primary, model promoted

- **Design tradeoffs**: Gas costs vs. on-chain verification (storing only CIDs introduces IPFS dependency), reputation threshold (10 points) vs. Sybil resistance cost (higher thresholds slow onboarding), centralized owner role for admin assignment vs. trust vulnerability

- **Failure signatures**: Model predictions inaccurate for non-temperature targets, voting stalls from insufficient clients with ≥10 reputation, integer overflow in score calculation, gas exhaustion during high-volume voting rounds

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Deploy smart contract to Ganache, register as admin, add client, verify client with <10 reputation cannot vote
  2. Train local LSTM model on weather dataset, upload to local IPFS node, retrieve via CID, verify hash matches
  3. Submit deliberately low-accuracy model through validation pipeline, confirm it receives low scores and is not promoted

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can a consensus-based mechanism be effectively designed to replace the centralized "Owner" role for client onboarding and admin governance? The current implementation relies on a centralized "Owner" to assign admins and register clients, reintroducing a trust bottleneck. Evidence would be a functional smart contract upgrade or DAO structure allowing network approval of new administrators via voting without central authority.

### Open Question 2
To what extent can advanced hyperparameter tuning or alternative architectures improve predictive accuracy over the current untuned LSTM implementation? The paper acknowledges reliance on untuned LSTM architectures contrasts with optimized frameworks. Evidence would be comparative benchmarks showing improved MAE/RMSE/MAPE scores against the current baseline while maintaining acceptable gas costs and latency.

### Open Question 3
What specific validation protocols are required to implement the "ML model testing" component to verify integrity of model artifacts? While reputation system validates model performance via voting, there is currently no automated testing layer to verify internal structure, format, or safety of model files before IPFS storage. Evidence would be integration of automated pipeline executing integrity checks on client-submitted models before voting phase.

### Open Question 4
How can the reputation-based voting mechanism be hardened against colluding adversaries who coordinate to artificially inflate reputation scores? While the paper proposes staking and thresholds, it relies on threat model discussion without definitive solution for coordinated malicious voting beyond basic reputation logic. Evidence would be simulation results demonstrating consensus mechanism rejects model updates from colluding minority attempting to validate poisoned model.

## Limitations
- System validated primarily on temperature prediction with regression metrics, while classification metrics showed lower performance
- IPFS-based storage introduces availability risks if nodes hosting model artifacts go offline
- Key implementation details remain unspecified including exact model hyperparameters and complete reputation voting logic

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Federated learning architecture preserves privacy by keeping local data on client devices
- Ethereum smart contract successfully implements access control and reputation tracking
- IPFS content addressing provides tamper detection through CID hash changes

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- System achieves reported MAE/RMSE/MAPE metrics for temperature forecasting
- Reputation-weighted voting effectively filters low-quality model submissions under tested conditions
- Decentralized architecture enhances resilience against specific adversarial attacks

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Security against sophisticated coordinated attacks or Sybil campaigns at scale
- Long-term sustainability of IPFS storage model for continuous model updates
- Performance generalization to weather forecasting targets beyond temperature

## Next Checks

1. **Security Stress Test**: Deploy system with multiple controlled malicious clients attempting reputation manipulation through coordinated voting patterns. Measure whether 10-point threshold effectively prevents consensus manipulation under various attack scenarios.

2. **Infrastructure Resilience Assessment**: Conduct longitudinal test of IPFS model availability by simulating node churn and measuring model retrieval success rates over extended periods. Evaluate impact of CID hash collisions or storage network fragmentation on model accessibility.

3. **Performance Generalization Benchmark**: Reproduce temperature forecasting results, then systematically expand to all five weather features using identical model architectures and training procedures. Compare performance degradation patterns against paper's acknowledgment of temperature-specific optimization.
