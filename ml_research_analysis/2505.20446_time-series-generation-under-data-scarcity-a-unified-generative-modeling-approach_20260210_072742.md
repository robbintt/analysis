# Time Series Generation Under Data Scarcity: A Unified Generative Modeling Approach

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.20446
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20446
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Unified pre-trained diffusion model achieves 55%+ improvement on few-shot time series generation benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first systematic study of state-of-the-art generative time series models under extreme data scarcity. A benchmark is created by subsampling 12 diverse real-world datasets to simulate few-shot scenarios (as few as 10 samples). Results show existing methods degrade sharply in such regimes, motivating a unified diffusion-based framework. The proposed model is pre-trained across heterogeneous domains and adapted via fine-tuning with dynamic convolutions and dataset token conditioning, enabling flexible channel handling and domain-specific generation. Evaluated across 168 data-limited settings, it achieves over 55% improvement in Discriminative Score and contextFID compared to baselines, even when fine-tuned on only 5% of the data. It also outperforms all baselines on full datasets, highlighting the value of pre-training and cross-domain generalization.

## Method Summary
The approach combines pre-training on heterogeneous time series corpora with few-shot adaptation via fine-tuning. Time series are converted to 2D images using delay embedding (m=8, n=8), then processed by a UNet diffusion model with dynamic convolutions (DyConv) for variable channel dimensions and dataset token conditioning for domain awareness. Pre-training runs for 1,000 epochs on ~300k samples across 19 datasets using AdamW (LR=1e-4), while fine-tuning initializes new dataset tokens and adapts the model to target domains using only 5-15% of available data.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 55% improvement in Discriminative Score and contextFID compared to baselines under data scarcity
- Maintains strong performance even when fine-tuned on only 5% of target data
- Outperforms all baselines on full datasets, demonstrating benefits of pre-training and cross-domain generalization
- Dynamic convolutions reduce memory usage from 2.01GB to 0.18GB while maintaining accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Unified pre-training on heterogeneous time series corpora enables cross-domain generalization under data scarcity.
- **Mechanism:** Exposure to diverse temporal structures during pre-training induces domain-agnostic representations that transfer to unseen target distributions. The model learns shared dynamics (periodicity, trend, noise patterns) across finance, energy, climate, and biomedical domains, enabling few-shot adaptation through fine-tuning rather than learning from scratch.
- **Core assumption:** Temporal dynamics share transferable structure across domains—specifically, that patterns learned from high-data domains generalize to low-data target domains.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "pre-trained on a large, heterogeneous collection of time series datasets, enabling it to learn generalizable temporal representations"
  - [Section 5] "exposure to a broad range of temporal structures and statistical properties during pre-training enables the model to learn domain-agnostic representations of time series dynamics"
  - [corpus] MIRA paper demonstrates similar transfer benefits in medical time series foundation models under data scarcity
- **Break condition:** Fails if target domain exhibits fundamentally novel temporal dynamics absent from pre-training corpus (e.g., high-frequency seismic patterns when pre-trained only on slow climate data).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Dynamic Convolution (DyConv) enables unified architecture across datasets with varying channel dimensions without computational waste.
- **Mechanism:** Rather than padding all datasets to a maximum channel dimension, DyConv maintains a canonical kernel [K, K, C0, C1] and applies bicubic interpolation at runtime to match actual input/output dimensions. This preserves computational efficiency while supporting flexible adaptation.
- **Core assumption:** Channel interpolation preserves sufficient representational fidelity for generative tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "dynamic convolutional layers for flexible channel adaptation"
  - [Section 5/DyConv] "DyConv allows a single parameter set to generalize across datasets with varying input/output channels"
  - [Section 6.5/Fig. 3B] Shows DyConv maintains constant GFLOPs while padding scales linearly with max channels; DyConv uses 0.18 GB vs. 2.01 GB for padding
- **Break condition:** Performance degrades if canonical dimensions are undersized relative to target channel complexity (Table 10 shows DyConv[1,128] performs poorly).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Dataset token conditioning disambiguates multi-domain sampling by anchoring generation to target distributions.
- **Mechanism:** Each dataset receives a unique learnable token embedded via AdaGN layers, modulating the denoising network's intermediate features. This provides explicit domain-specific conditioning that resolves distributional ambiguity at inference time.
- **Core assumption:** Models can learn distinct domain representations while sharing underlying temporal processing.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "dataset token conditioning for domain-aware generation"
  - [Section 5/Dataset token] "Through this mechanism, the model captures dataset-specific characteristics while still leveraging shared temporal patterns across domains"
  - [Section 6.4/Table 4] Fine-tuning without tokens remains competitive, but zero-shot sampling without tokens degrades significantly (Disc: 0.252 vs. 0.193; c-FID: 11.07 vs. 4.84)
  - [corpus] Corpus lacks direct comparison for this mechanism; related foundation models (MIRA, LTSM-DIFF) do not explicitly analyze token-based domain conditioning
- **Break condition:** Without fine-tuning, tokenless models sample from mixture distributions, producing incoherent outputs when domains diverge significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Diffusion models and denoising score matching**
  - **Why needed here:** The backbone is EDM-style diffusion; understanding noise schedules, preconditioning, and denoising objectives is essential for debugging generation quality.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the loss function `L = Eσ,x0,ε[λ(σ)||Γθ(xσ; σ) − x0||²]` weights different noise levels differently?

- **Concept: Delay embedding (time-to-image transformation)**
  - **Why needed here:** The model operates in image space; understanding how time series map to 2D representations determines what patterns the diffusion model can capture.
  - **Quick check question:** Given parameters `m` (skip) and `n` (window), what determines the spatial resolution of the embedded image?

- **Concept: Few-shot learning via fine-tuning vs. meta-learning**
  - **Why needed here:** The approach uses standard fine-tuning rather than meta-learning; understanding this distinction clarifies why pre-training quality matters more than adaptation algorithm design.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might LoRA and BitFit underperform full fine-tuning (Table 11) despite being effective in other few-shot contexts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Time Series (L×K channels) -> Delay Embedding T() → Image tensor (K×n×n) -> DyConv (channel adaptation to canonical 128-dim) -> UNet backbone with AdaGN + dataset token + attention layers -> DyConv (channel adaptation back to K) -> Inverse delay embedding → Generated Time Series

- **Critical path:** DyConv canonical dimensions and dataset token initialization are the most sensitive components. Undersized DyConv (Table 10) or missing tokens without fine-tuning (Table 18) cause catastrophic degradation.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Pre-training sequence length:** Shorter lengths (12, 24) generalize well across lengths but degrade at 64; match pre-train length to target domain if known (Fig. 3A)
  - **Model scale:** Large (26M) performs best; XL (40M) shows diminishing returns (Table 2). Pre-training reduces scale sensitivity—smaller models close the gap
  - **Token conditioning:** Required for zero-shot; optional if fine-tuning always occurs

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High c-FID with low discriminative score: Model generating realistic local patterns but incorrect global temporal structure
  - Rapid degradation under channel padding vs. DyConv: Indicates pre-training maximum channel constraint is too restrictive
  - Tokenless fine-tuning works but tokenless zero-shot fails (Table 4 vs. 18): Expected behavior; train with tokens for flexibility

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce pre-training on a subset of datasets** (e.g., 5 domains) with sequence length 24, verifying DyConv handles varying channel dimensions. Monitor memory usage against Fig. 3B baseline
  2. **Ablate dataset tokens:** Fine-tune on a held-out domain with and without token conditioning, comparing discriminative scores. Confirm Table 4 pattern holds
  3. **Test length generalization:** Pre-train on length 24, evaluate on lengths 12, 24, 36, 64 without re-pre-training. Expect degradation curve matching Fig. 3A

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper explicitly defers investigation of data augmentation strategies to future work, noting that such techniques may harm performance if biases are not aligned with the unified training paradigm.

## Limitations
- Requires access to heterogeneous pre-training corpora, which may not exist for all domains
- Delay embedding limits temporal context to fixed spatial resolutions (8x8), potentially missing long-range dependencies
- Performance degrades when pre-training and target domains have fundamentally different temporal characteristics

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The empirical demonstration that pre-training improves performance under data scarcity (Figure 3, Tables 1-3) and that DyConv reduces memory usage while maintaining accuracy (Figure 3B) are well-supported by experimental evidence
- **Medium confidence:** The mechanism by which dataset tokens enable domain-aware generation is plausible but lacks direct ablation studies comparing to alternative conditioning approaches
- **Low confidence:** The claim of cross-domain generalization rests on the assumption that diverse temporal patterns share transferable structure, but the paper doesn't systematically analyze which temporal features transfer versus domain-specific characteristics

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain transfer analysis:** Systematically measure which temporal patterns (trend, seasonality, noise) transfer across domain pairs to validate the core assumption of shared dynamics
2. **Long-range dependency evaluation:** Test generation quality on datasets requiring longer temporal contexts than the 8x8 embedding supports to identify architectural limitations
3. **Alternative conditioning comparison:** Implement prompt tuning or adapter-based conditioning as baselines against dataset tokens to quantify the specific contribution of the token mechanism
