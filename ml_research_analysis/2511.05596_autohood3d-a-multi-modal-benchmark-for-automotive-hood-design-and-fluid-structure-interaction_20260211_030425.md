# AutoHood3D: A Multi-Modal Benchmark for Automotive Hood Design and Fluid-Structure Interaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05596
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05596
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: 4,500 automotive hoods with paired LES-FEA FSI simulations; Graph U-Net generalizes better to OOD geometries with MSE ~10^-2

## Executive Summary
AutoHood3D introduces a large-scale multimodal dataset for automotive hood design under fluid-structure interaction during rotary-dip painting. The dataset contains over 16,000 3D hood geometries with engineered cutouts, paired with time-resolved LES-FEA simulations and structured text-to-geometry annotations. A fully reproducible pipeline generates diverse geometries via convex hull reconstruction and cutout segmentation, then simulates FSI using OpenFOAM with preCICE coupling. ML benchmarks show graph-based architectures generalize better to out-of-distribution cases while MLP and PointNet excel on in-distribution prediction.

## Method Summary
The dataset generation pipeline creates diverse 3D hood geometries through convex hull reconstruction and SAM-2 cutout segmentation, clustering cutouts by perimeter and area into 9 groups. Each hood undergoes coupled LES-FEA simulation with one-way fluid-structure coupling via preCICE, capturing transient pressure fields during a 0.07s acceleration impulse. The resulting dataset includes 4,500 hoods with 8 temporal snapshots each, providing velocity, pressure, and displacement fields for surrogate modeling. Five ML architectures (MLP, PointNet, GraphSAGE, Graph U-Net, PointGNNConv) are benchmarked on normalized field prediction with MSE loss.

## Key Results
- Graph U-Net achieves best OOD generalization (MSE ~10^-2) while MLP/PointNet excel on in-distribution tasks (MSE ~10^-3)
- Displacement fields show 5-50x higher prediction errors than velocity/pressure due to error cascade
- MLP hidden-dim ablation reveals overfitting at 256 dims (ID Dx=2.80×10^-2, OOD Dx=181.02×10^-2) improves with reduction to 64 dims
- GraphSAGE training time increases 16× when max_neighbors grows from 4 to 32 with marginal accuracy gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** One-way fluid-structure coupling captures hood deformation during rotary-dip painting with sufficient fidelity for surrogate modeling.
- **Mechanism:** LES solver computes transient pressure field → preCICE maps pressure to solid mesh via nearest-projection → FEA solves small-strain linear elastic displacement without reverse-coupling feedback.
- **Core assumption:** Hood deflections remain small enough that mesh perturbation does not significantly alter the flow field boundary conditions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA)"
  - [section 3.2]: "Since the predicted deformations are minor and exert negligible spatio-temporal perturbations on the flow field, we adopt a one-way coupling approach"
  - [corpus]: HGATSolver addresses two-way FSI coupling challenges; one-way assumption may not transfer to large-deformation or strong-coupling regimes.
- **Break condition:** When deformation-to-characteristic-length ratio exceeds ~5% or when fluid boundary layer separation is sensitive to surface motion.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Clustering cutouts by perimeter and area produces design diversity that spans the structural response manifold.
- **Mechanism:** SAM-2 segments 2D cutout projections → extract boundary curves → K-means clusters into 9 groups → sample from clusters with symmetry and spacing constraints → re-embed into 3D shell.
- **Core assumption:** Two-dimensional (perimeter, area) features are sufficient to characterize cutout influence on FSI response.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "pipeline generates diverse geometries via convex hull reconstruction and cutout segmentation"
  - [section 3.1]: "K-Means clustering algorithm in the two-dimensional feature space (perimeter, area), which yields nine distinct groups"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence on cutout shape descriptors; Car Drag Coefficient paper uses 3D point clouds but does not address manufacturing cutout topology.
- **Break condition:** When higher-order descriptors (curvature, aspect ratio, topology) dominate structural response more than perimeter/area.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Graph-based architectures generalize better to OOD geometries while MLP/PointNet excel on in-distribution prediction.
- **Mechanism:** Graph models encode mesh connectivity → message passing aggregates local geometric context → captures physics-informative structure; MLPs process points independently → memorize training patterns → fast but poor extrapolation.
- **Core assumption:** Mesh connectivity encodes physically relevant structure beyond raw coordinate values.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "MLP and PointNet achieving in-distribution MSEs around 10^-2, while graph models (Graph U-Net, PointGNNConv) generalize better to out-of-distribution cases"
  - [section 4.1.2]: "Graph U-Net attains the best OOD MSE for pressure 4.05×10^-2 and maintains competitive errors across all velocity components"
  - [corpus]: HGATSolver uses heterogeneous graph attention for FSI, supporting graph representations for coupled multiphysics.
- **Break condition:** When neighborhood parameters (radius, max_neighbors) cause oversmoothing of cutout edges or when compute budget prohibits large-mNN training.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) with DDES turbulence closure**
  - Why needed here: Captures transient pressure fluctuations during the 0.07s acceleration impulse where RANS would smear unsteady features.
  - Quick check question: Why is DDES preferred over wall-resolved LES for industrial geometries with ~750K cells?

- **Concept: preCICE nearest-projection mapping**
  - Why needed here: Transfers pressure from fluid mesh to solid mesh when interface nodes do not coincide.
  - Quick check question: What error is introduced if fluid and solid meshes share the same STL source versus independently generated meshes?

- **Concept: Graph neighborhood aggregation and oversmoothing**
  - Why needed here: mNN parameter controls trade-off between context aggregation and loss of fine-scale cutout detail.
  - Quick check question: Why does increasing max_neighbors from 4 to 32 reduce ID MSE by ~50% but increase per-epoch time by 16x?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Geometry: Inner-hood CAD → convex hull → SAM-2 cutout segmentation → curve database → STL with engineered openings
  Simulation: SnappyHexMesh → UM_pimpleFoam (LES fluid) + UM_solidDisplacementFoam (FEA solid) → preCICE one-way coupling
  ML: Point cloud / STL → encoder (64-dim) → core model → decoder (7 fields: Ux, Uy, Uz, p, Dx, Dy, Dz)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Download 100-sample test subset (DVN/FSYRJA) to validate data loading
  2. Train PointNet baseline: 750 epochs, batch=128, lr=1e-4, ~11ms inference
  3. Train Graph U-Net for OOD tasks: expect 249ms inference, 352 epochs recommended

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - MLP: 9.7ms inference, ID MSE ~0.25×10^-2 (Ux), OOD Dx explodes to 181×10^-2
  - PointNet: 11ms inference, balanced ID performance across all fields
  - Graph U-Net: 249ms inference, best OOD pressure (4.05×10^-2), 3.5M parameters
  - GraphSAGE mNN=4: 147s/epoch, mNN=32: 2361s/epoch (16x slower for marginal accuracy gain)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Displacement (Dx) errors 5-50x larger than velocity/pressure errors due to cascade amplification
  - GraphSAGE underpredicts peak deflection near cutout edges (fixed-radius neighbor limit)
  - MLP hidden-dim ablation: 256→64 reduces ID performance but slightly improves OOD (overfitting indicator)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce PointNet baseline on 100-sample subset; target ID MSE < 0.5×10^-2 on velocity components
  2. Sweep GraphSAGE mNN∈{4, 8, 16} on full 4500-hood set; measure MSE vs. per-epoch time tradeoff
  3. Compare PointNet vs. Graph U-Net on OOD test geometry; quantify generalization gap for Dx field

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can multiphysics-aware loss functions that explicitly enforce conservation of momentum and force continuity at the fluid–structure interface improve surrogate model fidelity compared to standard MSE loss?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors state: "the use of MSE loss does not explicitly enforce the physical conservation of momentum or force across the fluid–structure interface; developing multiphysics-aware training objectives that penalize these residuals could improve fidelity."
- **Why unresolved:** Current benchmarks use MSE exclusively, and displacement prediction errors (particularly Dx) degrade substantially for secondary fields due to amplified upstream errors in velocity/pressure predictions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative training runs using physics-informed loss terms (e.g., interface momentum residuals, force balance constraints) demonstrating reduced errors in coupled field predictions, particularly for displacement components.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Would mesh-agnostic neural operator architectures (e.g., FNO, DeepONet) outperform the evaluated point- and graph-based models on FSI surrogate tasks, particularly for out-of-distribution generalization?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors state: "our ML models are restricted to point and graph-based architectures; investigating mesh-agnostic neural operator approaches may improve predictive accuracy."
- **Why unresolved:** Graph models showed better OOD generalization but suffered from oversmoothing and computational overhead; neural operators offer resolution-invariant learning but have not been evaluated on this 3D multiphysics benchmark.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking neural operators on the AutoHood3D OOD test set, comparing MSE, inference latency, and memory footprint against Graph U-Net and PointGNNConv baselines.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does incorporating higher-order shape descriptors (curvature, modal deformation modes) into cutout clustering improve design-space exploration and surrogate generalization compared to perimeter-area clustering alone?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors state: "clustering cutouts by area and perimeter may overlook higher-order shape descriptors—incorporating curvature or modal deformation modes could enhance design-space exploration."
- **Why unresolved:** Current K-Means clustering uses only perimeter and area, which may conflate geometrically distinct cutouts with similar 2D metrics, potentially limiting the diversity of learned geometric representations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Re-clustering cutouts using curvature-aware features, retraining surrogate models on the new partitioning, and measuring changes in ID/OOD prediction accuracy and coverage of the design manifold.

## Limitations
- One-way FSI coupling may not capture large deformation regimes where mesh perturbation significantly affects flow
- Perimeter/area clustering may miss critical cutout characteristics like curvature and aspect ratio
- Single OOD test geometry provides limited evidence of true generalization capability

## Confidence
- **ID/OOD performance claims:** High confidence - performance metrics are directly reported with clear train/val/test splits
- **Reproducibility of pipeline:** Medium confidence - core methodology is specified but key implementation details (normalization, exact layer definitions, random seeds) are missing
- **Graph models generalize better:** Medium confidence - supported by cross-architecture comparison but limited by single OOD test case

## Next Checks
1. Quantify deformation regime limits: Systematically measure the deformation-to-characteristic-length ratio across all 4,500 hoods and correlate with prediction errors to identify when one-way coupling breaks down.
2. Expand OOD validation: Test all five architectures on 3-5 additional OOD geometries with varying cutout characteristics (size, shape, distribution) to establish robust generalization bounds.
3. Feature sensitivity analysis: Repeat the cutout clustering and ML training using alternative 2D/3D descriptors (curvature, aspect ratio, topological features) to quantify the importance of perimeter/area vs. higher-order cutout characteristics.
