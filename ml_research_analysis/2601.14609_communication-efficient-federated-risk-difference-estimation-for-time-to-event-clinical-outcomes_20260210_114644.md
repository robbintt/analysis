# Communication-Efficient Federated Risk Difference Estimation for Time-to-Event Clinical Outcomes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.14609
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14609
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** FedRD enables server-independent federated risk difference estimation with minimal communication rounds while maintaining theoretical guarantees and matching pooled analysis performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FedRD, a communication-efficient federated learning framework specifically designed for risk difference estimation in distributed survival data analysis. Unlike traditional federated methods that require persistent server connections and iterative communication, FedRD operates independently of any central server, exchanging only summary statistics across sites. The framework provides statistical inference capabilities including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, which are absent in FedAvg-based approaches. Theoretical guarantees establish that FedRD is asymptotically equivalent to pooled individual-level analysis, making it particularly suitable for healthcare settings with varying IT infrastructure and protected computing environments.

## Method Summary
FedRD addresses the challenge of federated risk difference estimation by eliminating the need for a central server and minimizing communication rounds. For stratified models, the framework requires only one round of summary statistics exchange, while unstratified models need three rounds. The approach leverages the properties of the Mantel-Haenszel estimator and provides statistical inference through the delta method. By working with summary statistics rather than raw data, FedRD maintains privacy while achieving asymptotic equivalence to pooled analysis. The framework handles right-censored survival data and provides valid confidence intervals and hypothesis testing capabilities that are typically unavailable in federated learning settings.

## Key Results
- FedRD achieves server-independent operation with minimal communication (1-3 rounds) compared to traditional federated methods requiring persistent connections
- Theoretical guarantees establish asymptotic equivalence to pooled individual-level analysis, ensuring statistical validity
- Simulation studies demonstrate that FedRD matches pooled analysis performance and outperforms local and federated baselines in estimation accuracy and prediction performance
- Real-world clinical applications across Singapore and United States confirm FedRD's robustness under cross-site heterogeneity, achieving discrimination comparable to pooled analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FedRD works by leveraging the mathematical properties of risk difference estimation in survival analysis, specifically utilizing the Mantel-Haenszel estimator framework. The key insight is that risk difference estimation can be decomposed into operations on summary statistics that can be computed locally at each site and then combined without requiring iterative communication. The framework exploits the fact that certain statistical estimators have closed-form solutions that depend only on aggregated quantities rather than individual-level data. By working with these aggregated statistics and applying the delta method for variance estimation, FedRD achieves statistical inference capabilities while maintaining the communication efficiency that comes from avoiding iterative parameter exchanges.

## Foundational Learning
**Mantel-Haenszel estimator:** Used for combining stratified 2×2 contingency tables across multiple sites; essential for deriving the closed-form solution that enables one-round communication
- *Why needed:* Provides the mathematical foundation for combining summary statistics across sites without iterative communication
- *Quick check:* Verify that the weighted average of site-specific risk differences converges to the pooled estimate

**Delta method for variance estimation:** Technique for approximating the variance of functions of random variables using Taylor expansion
- *Why needed:* Enables construction of valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests from the combined summary statistics
- *Quick check:* Confirm that the asymptotic variance formula properly accounts for both within-site and between-site variability

**Survival analysis with right-censoring:** Statistical methods for time-to-event data where some event times are unknown
- *Why needed:* Clinical outcomes often involve censored data where patients are lost to follow-up or haven't experienced the event yet
- *Quick check:* Ensure proper handling of censoring indicators in the summary statistics computation

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Local sites -> Summary statistics computation -> Statistics exchange -> Global combination -> Inference output
**Critical path:** Local computation of stratum-specific counts and risk differences → Exchange of minimal summary statistics → Weighted combination using site-specific weights → Variance estimation via delta method → Confidence interval and hypothesis test construction
**Design tradeoffs:** Server independence vs. flexibility in model specification; minimal communication vs. potential for more sophisticated aggregation schemes; statistical inference capability vs. computational simplicity
**Failure signatures:** 
- Systematic bias when site-specific risk differences are heterogeneous beyond what the variance formula accounts for
- Invalid inference when the normality assumption for the delta method approximation fails in small samples
- Communication breakdown if summary statistics cannot be properly exchanged due to site-specific constraints

**First experiments:**
1. Verify that FedRD produces identical results to pooled analysis when there is no censoring and complete data sharing is simulated
2. Test the sensitivity of variance estimates to different weighting schemes across sites with varying sample sizes
3. Evaluate the impact of extreme heterogeneity in baseline hazard rates across sites on the accuracy of combined risk difference estimates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of real-world federated implementation validation - all evaluations conducted in simulation environments without deployment in actual distributed clinical settings
- Assumptions of homogeneous data distributions across sites may not fully capture cross-site clinical data variations, despite acknowledging heterogeneity in the introduction
- Theoretical framework and simulation results have not been validated under real-world network constraints and varying IT infrastructure conditions

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in theoretical framework and asymptotic properties due to rigorous mathematical treatment
- **Medium confidence** in communication efficiency claims as they are primarily theoretical without empirical network measurements
- **Medium confidence** in performance comparisons relying on synthetic and controlled real-world datasets rather than full federated deployment
- **Low confidence** in generalizability across diverse clinical settings without multi-site validation

## Next Checks
1. Implement and evaluate FedRD across at least three geographically distributed clinical sites with varying IT infrastructure to assess real-world communication efficiency and performance under network constraints
2. Conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate FedRD's robustness to heterogeneous data distributions, particularly when event rates and covariate distributions differ substantially across sites
3. Compare FedRD's computational overhead against FedAvg and other federated baselines in production environments, including resource utilization and training time metrics
