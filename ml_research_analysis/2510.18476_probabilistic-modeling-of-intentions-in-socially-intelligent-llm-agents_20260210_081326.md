# Probabilistic Modeling of Intentions in Socially Intelligent LLM Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18476
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18476
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Bayesian intent modeling framework improves dialogue performance on SOTOPIA benchmark

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a probabilistic intent modeling framework for socially intelligent LLM agents that maintains belief distributions over partner intentions and updates them through Bayesian inference after each utterance. The approach provides contextual grounding under uncertainty without requiring parameter training, enabling agents to better infer and respond to conversational partners' underlying goals. Experimental results on the SOTOPIA benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple social dimensions, with the framework achieving 9.0% better overall performance compared to baseline models.

## Method Summary
The framework implements belief distributions over partner intentions that are continuously updated through Bayesian inference mechanisms after each conversational turn. This probabilistic approach allows the LLM agent to maintain uncertainty about partner intentions while progressively refining its understanding as dialogue progresses. The system operates without additional parameter training, instead leveraging the existing capabilities of the underlying LLM through enhanced contextual grounding. The Bayesian updates incorporate new information from each utterance to refine the probability distributions over possible intentions, enabling more nuanced and contextually appropriate responses.

## Key Results
- Overall score increased by 9.0% on SOTOPIA-All benchmark compared to Qwen2.5-7B baseline
- 4.1% improvement on SOTOPIA-Hard subset of the benchmark
- Performance slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to explicitly model and update uncertainty about partner intentions throughout the conversation. By maintaining belief distributions rather than point estimates, the system can capture the probabilistic nature of intention inference and avoid premature commitment to specific interpretations. The Bayesian inference mechanism ensures that each new utterance appropriately updates these beliefs while preserving uncertainty where evidence is limited. This probabilistic grounding enables more sophisticated dialogue strategies that can adapt to evolving conversational contexts and handle ambiguous or conflicting signals from partners.

## Foundational Learning

**Bayesian Inference** - Mathematical framework for updating beliefs based on evidence; needed for systematically incorporating new conversational information; quick check: verify probability distributions sum to 1 after updates.

**Belief Distribution Modeling** - Representation of uncertainty as probability distributions rather than point estimates; needed for capturing multiple possible intentions; quick check: ensure distributions maintain reasonable entropy levels.

**Social Intention Recognition** - Ability to infer underlying goals from conversational behavior; needed for appropriate response generation; quick check: validate against known intention taxonomies.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** LLM Core -> Intent Belief Module -> Bayesian Update Engine -> Response Generator

**Critical Path:** Utterance Reception → Intent Belief Update → Contextual Embedding → Response Generation

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- Uncertainty representation vs computational efficiency
- Belief update frequency vs response latency
- Model complexity vs interpretability of intention states

**Failure Signatures:**
- Overconfident belief distributions leading to inappropriate responses
- Slow belief updates causing delayed adaptation to partner intent changes
- Belief collapse to single intention eliminating conversational flexibility

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test Bayesian update sensitivity with synthetic intention sequences
2. Measure response quality degradation with increasing conversation length
3. Evaluate performance across different initial prior distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single SOTOPIA benchmark without broader validation
- No analysis of computational overhead for real-time deployment
- Limited investigation of sensitivity to initial prior distributions

## Confidence
High confidence in theoretical framework integration
Medium confidence in empirical results scope
Medium confidence in oracle comparison methodology

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify specific contribution of probabilistic intent modeling component
2. Evaluate framework on additional dialogue benchmarks and real-world conversational datasets
3. Perform computational complexity analysis comparing inference time with and without probabilistic modeling layer
