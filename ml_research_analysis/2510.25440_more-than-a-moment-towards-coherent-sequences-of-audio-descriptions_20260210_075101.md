# More than a Moment: Towards Coherent Sequences of Audio Descriptions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25440
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25440
- Reference count: 24
- This paper introduces CoherentAD, a training-free method for generating coherent, non-repetitive audio description sequences for videos, achieving significantly lower repetition and higher StoryRecall scores than baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating coherent audio descriptions (ADs) for videos, where existing methods often produce repetitive and incoherent sequences that fail to advance the narrative. The authors propose CoherentAD, a training-free method that generates multiple candidate descriptions per video interval and selects a coherent, non-redundant sequence using four scoring criteria: adherence to AD guidelines, redundancy, story advancement, and visual element counts. The method is evaluated on CMD-AD and TV-AD datasets, showing substantial improvements in narrative coherence and reduction in repetition compared to prior approaches.

## Method Summary
CoherentAD is a three-stage, training-free pipeline that generates coherent audio description sequences for videos. Stage 1 uses a VLM (Qwen2-VL-7B) to produce structured 3-part descriptions per interval, followed by LLM (LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B) summarization into paragraphs. Stage 2 generates up to 5 diverse candidate ADs using the LLM. Stage 3 performs auto-regressive selection using four independent LLM scorers: AD guideline adherence (0.40 weight), redundancy vs prior 3 ADs (0.25 weight), story advancement (0.40 weight), and visual element counts (0.29 total: participants 0.13, actions 0.11, salient details 0.05). The final score is a weighted average, and the highest-scoring candidate is chosen per interval. The method uses NVIDIA A6000 hardware, taking approximately 22 seconds per AD.

## Key Results
- CoherentAD achieves 0% exact repetition and significantly lower partial repetition compared to Shot-by-Shot baseline
- CoherentAD improves StoryRecall scores on both CMD-AD and TV-AD datasets, indicating better narrative conveyance
- The method demonstrates effective coherence in AD sequences without requiring training, outperforming prior approaches in both repetition reduction and story comprehension

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by generating multiple candidate descriptions and using a weighted scoring system to select the most coherent and non-repetitive sequence. By explicitly scoring for story advancement and redundancy against the prior three ADs, the system ensures each description contributes new information while adhering to AD guidelines. The multi-candidate generation followed by intelligent selection allows the system to avoid the repetition issues common in single-description generation approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Audio Description (AD) Guidelines**: Standards for creating ADs that are concise, descriptive, and non-redundant. Why needed: Ensures generated ADs follow industry best practices for accessibility. Quick check: Verify generated ADs are typically 15-25 words and describe key visual elements.
- **Sequence-level Evaluation Metrics**: New metrics (StoryRecall, repetition measures) that evaluate the coherence of entire AD sequences rather than individual descriptions. Why needed: Existing metrics don't capture narrative flow and repetition across sequences. Quick check: StoryRecall should be higher when ADs collectively convey the video's narrative.
- **Multi-candidate Generation**: Generating multiple AD options per interval before selection. Why needed: Provides diversity to choose from, enabling better coherence selection. Quick check: Stage 2 should produce varied ADs covering different aspects of the same interval.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Video frames → VLM (Qwen2-VL-7B) → Structured description → LLM summarization → Multiple candidates → Scoring system → Selected AD sequence
- **Critical Path**: Frame sampling → VLM structured generation → LLM summarization → Candidate generation → Auto-regressive selection with four scorers
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Training-free approach trades potential fine-tuning performance for broader applicability and no dataset requirements; multiple candidates increase computational cost but enable better selection
- **Failure Signatures**: High repetition despite scoring indicates scorer weight issues or insufficient candidate diversity; low StoryRecall suggests Stage 1 isn't capturing sufficient visual detail
- **First Experiments**: 1) Run Stage 1 on 10 intervals to inspect structured output quality; 2) Generate and compare multiple candidates for diversity; 3) Test scorer weights with different combinations on small dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method is evaluated only on two AD-specific datasets (CMD-AD and TV-AD), with no generalization tests on other video domains or modalities
- Critical hyperparameters like word limit `lmax` for candidate ADs are unspecified, relying on external work
- LLM-based evaluation metrics (StoryRecall, repetition) lack human validation, potentially introducing evaluation bias

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the method's novelty and the problem formulation, given clear articulation of the sequence coherence challenge and explicit scoring criteria
- **Medium confidence** in the reported performance gains, as they are demonstrated only on two curated datasets and rely on LLM-based evaluation without human validation
- **Low confidence** in the reproducibility of exact scores due to missing hyperparameters and potential variability in LLM scoring

## Next Checks
1. Implement and compare the effect of different `lmax` values (e.g., 15, 20, 25 words) on repetition and StoryRecall metrics to identify optimal candidate length
2. Conduct ablation studies on the four scorer weights to confirm their relative contributions and check robustness to weight perturbations
3. Evaluate the method on a held-out subset of CMD-AD/TV-AD using human raters for coherence and repetition to ground-truth LLM-based StoryRecall scores
