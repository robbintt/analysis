# Dynamical model parameters from ultrasound tongue kinematics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18629
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18629
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Ultrasound tongue kinematics can reliably estimate dynamical model parameters comparable to EMA data

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether dynamical model parameters can be reliably estimated from ultrasound tongue kinematics by comparing ultrasound-derived parameters with simultaneously-recorded EMA data. A linear harmonic oscillator model was fitted to both data types using constrained least squares optimization, achieving R² values ≥ 0.90 for all variables. Bayesian hierarchical regression showed no systematic differences in stiffness and damping parameters between modalities, while ultrasound-estimated target parameters were systematically lower for certain movements, consistent with known characteristics of ultrasound knot tracking and probe stabilization effects.

## Method Summary
The study collected simultaneous EMA (Carstens AG501, 1250 Hz) and ultrasound (Telemed MicrUS, ~81 Hz) data from 6 female speakers of Northern Anglo-British English producing /bV/ and /bVd/ words. Anatomical landmarks were tracked using a pre-trained DeepLabCut model with 11 tongue knots plus hyoid and short tendon landmarks. Both signals were smoothed using 5th-order Discrete Cosine Transform, with EMA downsampled to match ultrasound frame rate. Gestures were segmented by velocity zero-crossings, and constrained least squares optimization solved for linear harmonic oscillator parameters (stiffness k, damping b, target T) in each interval. Parameter differences between modalities were evaluated using Bayesian hierarchical regression in Stan.

## Key Results
- Model fits were comparable between ultrasound and EMA, with R² values ≥ 0.90 for all variables
- No systematic differences in stiffness (k) and damping (b) parameters between modalities
- Ultrasound-estimated target (T) parameters were systematically lower for TDx, JAWx, and JAWy
- Parameter variability was higher for JAW movements in ultrasound compared to EMA

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Constrained least squares optimization can recover dynamical model parameters from kinematic trajectories with high fit accuracy by solving for acceleration coefficients in the linear harmonic oscillator equation. The approach minimizes ||Ẋ - Θ(X)Ξ||² subject to linear constraints, then integrates recovered parameters to simulate trajectories and evaluate against empirical data via R². This works because articulatory gestures can be modeled as piecewise autonomous dynamics with constant parameters within each gesture interval. Break condition: Gesture intervals with non-constant parameters (e.g., prosodic boundary effects) would violate the autonomous assumption.

### Mechanism 2
DCT-based smoothing enables parameter estimation from ultrasound kinematics despite higher noise compared to EMA by removing high-frequency noise while preserving the underlying kinematic signal. The 5th-order Discrete Cosine Transform filtering allows the optimization to converge on meaningful parameters rather than fitting noise, working because the underlying articulatory signal is bandlimited and separable from measurement noise through spectral filtering. Break condition: Over-smoothing removes genuine high-frequency articulatory dynamics; under-smoothing leaves noise that dominates parameter estimates.

### Mechanism 3
DeepLabCut-based anatomical landmark tracking produces kinematic trajectories that preserve systematic spatial relationships necessary for dynamical modeling by identifying 11 anatomically-defined landmarks per frame. This enables automated frame-to-frame tracking without manual annotation with accuracy comparable to human labelers, working because anatomical landmarks correspond to consistent tissue locations across frames and speakers. Break condition: Knot 5 underestimates dorsum height in front vowels; knot selection critically affects parameter interpretation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear harmonic oscillator dynamics
  - Why needed here: The entire modeling framework assumes speech gestures follow second-order dynamics with mass-spring-damper characteristics; understanding how stiffness, damping, and target parameters shape trajectories is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Given fixed target T and stiffness k, what happens to time-to-peak-velocity if damping b increases?

- Concept: Constrained optimization with differential equations
  - Why needed here: Parameter estimation requires solving inverse problems where you optimize coefficients subject to physical constraints (e.g., y = ẋ); unconstrained approaches may produce non-physical solutions.
  - Quick check question: Why must the first-order constraint y = ẋ be enforced explicitly rather than emerging naturally from optimization?

- Concept: Ultrasound imaging artifacts and probe stabilization
  - Why needed here: Systematic differences between ultrasound and EMA (especially JAW targets) arise from physical interactions between soft tissue and probe; recognizing these artifacts prevents misattributing measurement effects to articulatory behavior.
  - Quick check question: Why would low vowels show overestimated vertical JAW targets in ultrasound compared to EMA?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Synchronized multi-modal recording -> EMA filtering and head-correction -> DCT smoothing (both modalities) -> Gesture segmentation via velocity zero-crossings -> Constrained least squares optimization per gesture -> R² evaluation and parameter comparison
- Critical path: 1. Synchronized multi-modal recording -> 2. DCT smoothing (required for ultrasound) -> 3. Gesture segmentation via velocity zero-crossings -> 4. Constrained optimization per gesture -> 5. R² evaluation and parameter comparison
- Design tradeoffs: Simple linear model vs. nonlinear/nonautonomous; knot selection (Knot 5 underestimates dorsum height in front vowels); smoothing order (5th-order DCT); EMA downsampling (loses temporal resolution)
- Failure signatures: R² < 0.80 (likely segmentation error, over-smoothing, or time-varying parameters); extreme k or b values (optimization may not have converged); wide credible intervals in Bayesian comparison (high variability); systematic T offset between modalities (knot selection/probe effects)
- First 3 experiments: 1. Replicate model fitting on provided data: Implement constrained least squares on a single speaker's TDx gestures, verify R² ≥ 0.90 and compare parameter distributions; 2. Ablation on smoothing order: Fit models using 3rd, 5th, and 7th-order DCT smoothing; quantify how R² and parameter estimates change; 3. Cross-validation on knot selection: Compare T estimates from knot 5 vs. knot 7 for TDy; verify that knot 7 produces higher correlation with EMA-estimated T

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can parameters for nonlinear or nonautonomous dynamical models be reliably estimated from ultrasound kinematics? The authors note that "in future work it would be productive to compare more complex models, such as nonlinear dynamical models... as well as nonautonomous models." This remains unresolved because the current study intentionally utilized a simple linear harmonic oscillator to establish a baseline for comparison without excessive degrees of freedom. Fitting nonlinear (e.g., cubic term) or time-dependent models to the ultrasound data and comparing parameter validity against EMA would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
Does implementing continuity constraints on deep learning tracking algorithms reduce noise and improve parameter estimation? The authors suggest that "one solution is to constrain tracking such that sharp divergences between frames are penalized" to address noise in frame-by-frame DLC knot estimation. This remains unresolved because current tracking models estimate kinematics independently for each frame, resulting in trajectory noise that requires heavy smoothing and may obscure the underlying signal. Developing a tracking model with temporal continuity penalties and testing if it lowers the variability of estimated stiffness (k) and damping (b) parameters would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
Can mandibular short tendon tracking be utilized to analyze inter-articulator coordination within dynamical systems? The authors conclude that the validation of short tendon tracking "opens up new directions for the study of inter-articulator coordination in dynamical theories of speech production." This remains unresolved because while the study established that the short tendon captures jaw dynamics comparable to EMA, it did not test models involving coupling between the jaw and other articulators. Applying coupled oscillator models to simultaneous ultrasound-derived tongue and jaw data to examine coordination patterns would resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The pre-trained DeepLabCut model used for anatomical landmark tracking is not publicly available, requiring either contact with original authors or retraining
- The analysis is limited to 6 speakers of Northern Anglo-British English, restricting cross-linguistic and demographic generalizability
- Knot 5's known underestimation of dorsum height in front vowels creates systematic bias in target parameter estimates that cannot be fully corrected without alternative landmark selection

## Confidence

- **High**: The constrained least squares optimization approach produces high-quality model fits (R² ≥ 0.90) and reliably recovers dynamical parameters comparable to EMA
- **Medium**: Systematic differences in target parameters between modalities are correctly attributed to known ultrasound characteristics (knot tracking and probe stabilization)
- **Low**: The absence of a baseline EMA-only parameter estimation study prevents definitive claims about ultrasound-specific advantages

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce parameter estimation pipeline: Implement the constrained least squares optimization on the provided data and verify R² values ≥ 0.90 across all gesture types
2. Test knot sensitivity: Compare parameter estimates using alternative anatomical landmarks (e.g., knot 7 for tongue dorsum) to quantify the impact of landmark selection on dynamical parameters
3. Validate across languages: Apply the same methodology to speakers of other languages to assess whether the reported parameter distributions generalize beyond Northern Anglo-British English vowels
