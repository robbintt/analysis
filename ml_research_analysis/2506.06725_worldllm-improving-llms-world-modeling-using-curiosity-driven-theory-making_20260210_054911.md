# WorldLLM: Improving LLMs' world modeling using curiosity-driven theory-making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.06725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06725
- Authors: Guillaume Levy; Cedric Colas; Pierre-Yves Oudeyer; Thomas Carta; Clement Romac
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: WorldLLM improves LLM-based world modeling through curiosity-driven RL and hypothesis refinement

## Executive Summary
WorldLLM introduces a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining theory-driven reinforcement learning with curiosity-based exploration. The approach formulates hypotheses about environment dynamics and uses active exploration to gather evidence against these hypotheses, iteratively refining them through Bayesian inference. By grounding LLMs' predictions in specific domains through this structured process, WorldLLM achieves higher predictive accuracy than baseline approaches without requiring gradient-based fine-tuning. The framework also generates human-interpretable theories about environment dynamics.

## Method Summary
WorldLLM operates by formulating natural language hypotheses about environment dynamics and using curiosity-driven reinforcement learning to collect evidence that contradicts these hypotheses. The framework alternates between two phases: hypothesis refinement using Bayesian inference on collected data, and active data collection focused on transitions with low predictive likelihood. This creates a closed loop where the LLM's predictions guide exploration toward informative transitions, while the collected evidence updates and refines the underlying theories about how the environment works.

## Key Results
- Achieves higher predictive accuracy than baseline approaches without hypotheses in textual game environments
- Oracle baselines reach up to 0.81 normalized log-likelihood on complex transitions
- Generates human-interpretable theories about environment dynamics
- Demonstrates that theory-based RL with active exploration enhances LLMs' ability to ground knowledge in specific domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
WorldLLM works by leveraging the LLMs' existing world knowledge while providing a structured framework for domain-specific grounding. The hypothesis-driven approach allows the model to make explicit predictions about environment dynamics, while curiosity-driven exploration ensures efficient data collection focused on informative transitions. The Bayesian inference component enables principled updating of theories based on evidence, creating a coherent framework for knowledge refinement without gradient-based fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning

**Natural Language Hypotheses**: Why needed - Provides explicit predictions about environment dynamics; Quick check - Verify hypotheses are specific and testable
**Curiosity-Driven Exploration**: Why needed - Focuses data collection on informative transitions; Quick check - Measure entropy reduction in predictions
**Bayesian Inference**: Why needed - Enables principled theory updates; Quick check - Track posterior probability changes
**Active Learning**: Why needed - Maximizes information gain per interaction; Quick check - Compare sample efficiency to random exploration
**Theory Refinement Loop**: Why needed - Creates continuous improvement cycle; Quick check - Monitor prediction accuracy over time
**Textual Game Environment**: Why needed - Provides controlled testing ground; Quick check - Validate environment complexity matches research goals

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Hypothesis Generator -> Curiosity Module -> Data Collector -> Bayesian Updater -> Hypothesis Generator

Critical path: Hypothesis generation → Curiosity-driven exploration → Evidence collection → Bayesian refinement → Updated hypotheses

Design tradeoffs: Explicit theory formulation vs. end-to-end optimization; interpretable hypotheses vs. raw prediction accuracy; curiosity-driven exploration vs. random sampling

Failure signatures: Overfitting to initial hypotheses, curiosity not aligned with informative transitions, Bayesian updates too slow or too aggressive

3 first experiments:
1. Test hypothesis generation accuracy on known environment dynamics
2. Measure curiosity module's ability to identify surprising transitions
3. Evaluate Bayesian inference updates on synthetic datasets with known ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation scope to single textual game environment type
- Unclear generalizability to real-world domains with complex dynamics
- Qualitative rather than systematic evaluation of theory interpretability
- Limited empirical evidence for curiosity module effectiveness

## Confidence

WorldLLM improves LLM-based world modeling (Medium)
Framework generates human-interpretable theories (Medium)
Curiosity-driven RL effectively collects evidence against hypotheses (Low)

## Next Checks

1. Test WorldLLM on multiple diverse textual environments with varying complexity levels to establish whether performance gains generalize across different domain structures.

2. Implement systematic evaluation protocol for theory interpretability, including human studies assessing accuracy and utility of generated hypotheses compared to ground truth.

3. Compare WorldLLM's performance against direct fine-tuning baseline where LLM is trained end-to-end on predictive tasks without explicit hypothesis formulation.
