# CrossCheck-Bench: Diagnosing Compositional Failures in Multimodal Conflict Resolution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21717
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21717
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Diagnostic benchmark for multimodal conflict resolution with 15,000 QA pairs testing 13 models across hierarchical reasoning tasks

## Executive Summary
CrossCheck-Bench introduces a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating how well multimodal language models detect and resolve contradictions across visual and textual inputs. The benchmark employs a hierarchical task framework with three reasoning levels and seven atomic capabilities, derived from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected inconsistencies. Testing 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models reveals consistent performance degradation as tasks progress from simple perceptual matching to complex logical contradiction detection, with most models failing to exceed 50% accuracy on advanced reasoning tasks.

The benchmark highlights persistent bottlenecks in multimodal reasoning, showing that while models perform adequately on isolated entity recognition, they struggle significantly with multi-attribute conflict resolution. Conventional prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought provide only marginal improvements, whereas methods interleaving symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing demonstrate more stable performance gains. These findings suggest new architectural directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification and highlight the need for systematic evaluation frameworks for multimodal conflict resolution.

## Method Summary
The benchmark uses a hierarchical task framework with three reasoning levels - perceptual matching, attribute-level comparison, and logical contradiction detection - across seven atomic capabilities. It contains 15,000 question-answer pairs generated from real-world multimodal artifacts with synthetically injected inconsistencies. The evaluation methodology tests 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models across progressively complex reasoning tasks, measuring performance degradation patterns and identifying specific failure modes in cross-modal verification. The framework requires compositional reasoning to resolve conflicts, with task difficulty systematically increasing from basic entity recognition to complex multi-attribute contradiction detection.

## Key Results
- Vision-language models show consistent performance drops from perceptual matching (high accuracy) to logical contradiction detection (mostly <50% accuracy)
- Models excel at isolated entity recognition but struggle significantly with multi-attribute conflict reasoning across modalities
- Chain-of-Thought prompting provides only marginal improvements, while interleaving symbolic reasoning with visual processing shows more stable gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by creating controlled inconsistency scenarios that force models to perform compositional reasoning across modalities. The hierarchical structure isolates specific reasoning capabilities, revealing where models fail in the reasoning chain. By systematically varying task complexity and requiring cross-modal verification, the benchmark exposes fundamental limitations in current multimodal architectures' ability to detect and resolve contradictions.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal conflict resolution: Models must verify consistency between visual and textual information streams, requiring integrated cross-modal reasoning
- Hierarchical task decomposition: Breaking complex reasoning into perceptual, attribute, and logical levels enables systematic capability assessment
- Synthetic inconsistency injection: Controlled introduction of contradictions allows precise measurement of reasoning failures
- Compositional reasoning: Tasks require combining multiple atomic capabilities to resolve conflicts, exposing integration bottlenecks
- Atomic capability isolation: Seven fundamental reasoning primitives enable granular performance analysis
- Cross-modal verification: Models must independently validate information across modalities before detecting conflicts

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
- Input processing -> Visual feature extraction -> Text embedding -> Multimodal fusion -> Reasoning engine -> Output generation

**Critical Path**
The critical path involves visual-textual alignment verification followed by logical contradiction detection. Models must first establish entity correspondence across modalities, then perform attribute-level comparison, and finally detect logical inconsistencies. Failures typically occur at the attribute comparison stage when multiple conflicting attributes must be simultaneously evaluated.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The benchmark trades natural complexity for controlled experimental conditions by using synthetic inconsistencies. This enables precise measurement but may not fully capture real-world conflict resolution scenarios. The hierarchical structure provides granular insight but requires extensive annotation and model evaluation overhead.

**Failure Signatures**
Models consistently fail on multi-attribute conflict scenarios where simultaneous evaluation of multiple contradictory properties is required. Performance drops sharply when tasks require chaining multiple reasoning steps, indicating limitations in compositional reasoning capabilities. Chain-of-Thought prompting shows limited effectiveness, suggesting fundamental architectural constraints rather than prompting deficiencies.

**First Experiments**
1. Evaluate model performance across all three reasoning levels with matched computational resources
2. Compare Chain-of-Thought versus interleaved symbolic reasoning approaches on multi-attribute conflict tasks
3. Test model generalization from synthetic to naturally occurring multimodal inconsistencies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark relies on synthetically injected inconsistencies rather than naturally occurring contradictions
- Dataset construction methodology lacks detailed inter-annotator agreement specifications
- Performance evaluation lacks statistical significance testing across model families
- Benchmark focuses on static image-text pairs, limiting generalizability to dynamic multimodal scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Relative performance drops across reasoning levels and superiority of multi-attribute over entity recognition
- **Medium confidence**: Chain-of-Thought prompting effectiveness and symbolic reasoning interleaving benefits
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability of bottlenecks to broader model sets and real-world scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-annotator reliability analysis on synthetic inconsistency generation process
2. Perform ablation studies comparing prompting strategies with matched computational budgets
3. Expand evaluation to include naturally occurring multimodal conflicts from real-world sources
