# Enhancing Network Security Management in Water Systems using FM-based Attack Attribution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.01229
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01229
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FM-based method achieves ~20% average improvement over SHAP and LEMNA in multi-feature attack attribution for water systems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a model-agnostic Factorization Machines (FM)-based approach for attack attribution in water systems, addressing the challenge of identifying root causes of cyber attacks. Traditional attribution methods like LIME, SHAP, and LEMNA focus on individual feature importance but overlook critical sensor-actuator interactions in water systems. The proposed FM-based method captures both linear and quadratic effects of features, providing granular explanations for anomalies by attributing them to specific sensors and actuators. Evaluated on two real-world datasets (SWaT and WADI), the approach achieves approximately 20% average improvement over SHAP and LEMNA in multi-feature attack scenarios.

## Method Summary
The FM-based attack attribution method operates as a surrogate explainer that decouples from the detection mechanism, allowing it to explain any black-box anomaly detector without accessing internal weights. When an anomaly is detected, the system generates perturbed samples around the anomalous input point and trains an FM model locally to mimic the behavior of the black-box detector. The resulting FM weights serve as the explanation for the original anomaly, capturing both linear individual contributions and quadratic pairwise interaction effects. The approach maintains O(kn) computational complexity through efficient factorization, enabling real-time application in critical water infrastructure.

## Key Results
- Achieves ~20% average improvement over SHAP and LEMNA in multi-feature attack scenarios on SWaT and WADI datasets
- Maintains strong performance in single-feature attacks comparable to baseline methods
- Operates with O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for real-time applications
- Captures sensor-actuator interactions that traditional linear attribution methods miss

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Quadratic Interaction Modeling for Coupled Systems
Water system anomalies often result from interactions between sensors and actuators (e.g., pump status affecting pressure sensor), which linear attribution methods fail to capture. The FM approach uses pairwise interaction modeling where each feature has a latent vector, and interaction effects are calculated as dot products between these vectors. This allows attribution to specific relationships between assets rather than just individual components.

### Mechanism 2: Model-Agnostic Surrogate Explanation
The method decouples detection from attribution by training a local FM model to mimic the black-box detector's behavior using perturbed samples. This allows the system to explain any anomaly detector without needing access to its internal structure, making it a plug-and-play solution for existing water system security infrastructure.

### Mechanism 3: Linear-Time Interaction Computation
Factorization Machines avoid explicit calculation of all n² pairwise features by reformulating calculations using sum of latent vectors, reducing complexity from polynomial to linear O(kn). This efficiency is maintained even while modeling complex interactions, crucial for real-time operation in critical infrastructure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Factorization Machines (FM)**
  - Why needed: FM learns a vector per feature instead of single weight, enabling interaction modeling between features
  - Quick check: If you have 3 features, how many pairwise interaction terms would an FM model calculate?

- **Concept: Model-Agnostic Explainability (LIME/SHAP vs. FM)**
  - Why needed: The method is a plug-and-play solution that doesn't care about the detector's internal structure
  - Quick check: Why is a model-agnostic approach preferred in critical infrastructure where detection models might change frequently?

- **Concept: Reconstruction-based Anomaly Detection**
  - Why needed: The paper assumes detection via prediction error, where FM explains the error
  - Quick check: Does the FM model predict water pressure directly, or does it predict the error of the anomaly detector?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** History Buffer -> Anomaly Detector -> Perturbation Module -> FM Explainer -> Attribution Output
- **Critical path:** The system relies entirely on the Anomaly Detector triggering correctly. False negatives mean FM is never invoked; false positives cause FM to explain noise.
- **Design tradeoffs:** 
  - Latent Dimension (k): Higher k captures more complexity but risks overfitting; paper uses k=10
  - Scaling Factors (α, β): Balance linear vs. interaction effects; tests 0.5/0.5 and 0.3/0.7 configurations
- **Failure signatures:**
  - LIME-like Failure: With α=1, β=0, system collapses to linear attribution, missing correlations
  - Overfitting to Noise: Low regularization causes FM to fit perturbation noise rather than system behavior
  - Ghost Interactions: Poor latent vector convergence may report interactions between unrelated assets
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Single vs. Multi-Feature Validation: Compare AvgRank on SWaT for single-feature (linear wins) vs. multi-feature (FM wins by ~20%)
  2. Sensitivity Analysis (α/β): Tune scaling factors to optimize multi-feature attack attribution
  3. Latency Benchmark: Measure FM training step inference time to verify real-time feasibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would extending FM to capture higher-order (beyond pairwise) feature interactions improve attack attribution in complex water systems with multi-stage processes?
- Basis in paper: The authors state they plan to enhance the method by incorporating higher-order interactions to estimate group or process stage contributions.
- Why unresolved: Current FM formulation captures only second-order interactions, but water systems may exhibit complex group-level dependencies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of second-order vs. higher-order FM variants on SWaT/WADI measuring attribution accuracy for attacks involving three or more simultaneously manipulated features.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the FM-based attribution method perform against adversarial attacks specifically designed to evade or mislead feature attribution?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates improved attribution but does not evaluate robustness against adversarial manipulation targeting the explainer itself.
- Why unresolved: Attack attribution methods can be targets, with sophisticated attackers potentially crafting attacks to produce misleading attribution outputs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with adversarially-crafted attacks optimized to produce high attribution scores on non-compromised features, comparing FM against baseline methods under adversarial conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the practical scalability of the FM-based attribution approach when deployed across large-scale, heterogeneous water infrastructure?
- Basis in paper: While O(n) complexity is claimed and tested on SWaT (51 sensors) and WADI, the paper does not evaluate performance on municipal-scale systems with hundreds or thousands of components.
- Why unresolved: Real water distribution networks can have orders of magnitude more components, potentially requiring larger latent dimensions or causing computational bottlenecks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on simulated large-scale water networks with 500+ features measuring attribution latency, memory usage, and accuracy as feature count increases.

## Limitations

- Second-order interactions may miss complex multi-stage attack patterns requiring higher-order dependencies
- Perturbation-based approach inherits instability common to LIME-like explainers, potentially producing misleading attributions
- Performance degradation possible when scaling to large water systems with hundreds of sensors and actuators

## Confidence

- **Core claim (20% improvement)**: Medium-High - Well-supported by SWaT and WADI dataset results
- **Real-time feasibility**: Medium - O(n) complexity claimed but not verified on actual industrial hardware
- **Model-agnostic utility**: Medium-High - Theoretical framework sound, but real-world detector compatibility needs validation

## Next Checks

1. Test the approach on datasets with known third-order interactions to assess completeness of second-order modeling
2. Benchmark against LIME/SHAP on single-feature attacks to confirm comparable performance in simpler cases
3. Measure real-time latency on actual industrial hardware to verify the O(n) claim holds under operational constraints
