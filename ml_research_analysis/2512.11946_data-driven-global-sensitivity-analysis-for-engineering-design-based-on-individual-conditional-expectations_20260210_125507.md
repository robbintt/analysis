# Data-Driven Global Sensitivity Analysis for Engineering Design Based on Individual Conditional Expectations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.11946
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11946
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ICE-based sensitivity metrics capture interaction effects missed by PDP, with theoretical guarantees under polynomial expansion conditions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitations of Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) in capturing interactions within black-box models used in aerospace design. The authors propose an Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE)-based global sensitivity metric that computes feature importance by averaging the standard deviation of ICE curves, thereby capturing interaction effects that PDPs miss. The method introduces ICE-based correlation values to quantify how interactions modify input-output relationships. Theoretical analysis proves that ICE-based sensitivity is a lower bound of PDP-based sensitivity under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. Comparative evaluations on analytical and engineering problems demonstrate that ICE-based metrics provide richer insights than traditional PDP-based approaches while complementing existing methods like SHAP and Sobol' indices.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) surrogate model from input-output data, then generates ICE curves by evaluating the surrogate across a grid of values for each input variable while holding other variables fixed at their observed values. For each ICE curve, the standard deviation is computed as a measure of that variable's importance for that specific instance. The mean of these standard deviations across all instances gives the main effect sensitivity, while the standard deviation of these standard deviations quantifies interaction strength. An ICE-PDP correlation metric measures how stable the response trend is across different instances. The method is demonstrated on a 5-variable Friedman function, a 5-variable wind turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case.

## Key Results
- ICE-based sensitivity metrics reveal interactions hidden by PDP averaging, with empirical evidence across analytical and engineering problems
- Theoretical proof establishes ICE-based sensitivity as a lower bound of PDP-based sensitivity under polynomial expansion conditions
- The interaction metric (σI,ice) effectively identifies variables with strong dependencies on other inputs, particularly in the airfoil lower-surface CST parameters
- ICE metrics complement SHAP and Sobol' indices, providing interpretable insights for design space exploration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Averaging the standard deviation of ICE curves prevents the "cancellation effect" inherent in PDPs, where opposing positive and negative effects across the design space result in a misleadingly flat average. By first calculating the importance (standard deviation) for each individual ICE curve and then averaging these magnitudes, opposing trends add up rather than cancel mathematically.

### Mechanism 2
The standard deviation of ICE-based importance values (σI,ice) serves as a scalar proxy for interaction strength between an input variable and the rest of the system. If a variable strongly interacts with others, the response curve spread changes drastically depending on other variable values, and measuring this spread's variability across the dataset quantifies the instability caused by interactions.

### Mechanism 3
Under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion, PDP-based sensitivity is mathematically guaranteed to be a lower bound of ICE-based sensitivity through Jensen's inequality applied to convex functions. This relies on the expectation of the standard deviation being greater than or equal to the standard deviation of the expectation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Surrogate Modeling (Polynomial Chaos Expansion)**: Understanding PCE is critical because the method operates on surrogate approximations and the theoretical lower-bound proof relies on orthogonal polynomial properties. *Quick check:* Can you explain why the choice of basis functions affects the mathematical guarantees of sensitivity metrics?

- **Functional ANOVA (Sobol' Indices)**: The paper positions ICE metrics as a complement to Sobol' indices, which decompose variance. Distinguishing "variance contribution" from "functional impact" is necessary to interpret results. *Quick check:* If Sobol' Si ≈ 0 but STi > 0, how does this differ from ICE showing high σI,ice?

- **Centering and Anchoring**: The paper uses "centered" ICE/PDP curves to visualize interactions better. Without understanding the subtraction of the anchor point (mean), plots can be misinterpreted as showing absolute output values rather than deviations. *Quick check:* Why does centering a PDP curve at the mean input value help in visualizing heterogeneous effects?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input data -> PCE surrogate builder -> ICE generator -> Metric engine -> Visualizer
- **Critical path:** Construct Surrogate → Generate ICE curves → Compute μI,ice → Check σI,ice for interactions → Visualize 2-way PDP if σI,ice is high
- **Design tradeoffs:** ICE is computationally cheaper and more intuitive for design space exploration than SHAP, but SHAP provides better local explanation for specific instances. PCE is used because its mathematical structure supports theoretical proofs; using Gaussian Processes might require different theoretical justification.
- **Failure signatures:** Flat PDP with high σI,ice indicates hidden interaction (inspect 2-way interactions); high σρ with low μI,ice suggests interaction flips response trend (inspect ICE curves for crossing); zero σI,ice but visible interaction requires visual inspection.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Replicate Friedman function test to verify μI,ice > Ipdp for interacting variables; 2) Train PCE on Wind Turbine data and check if Vhub has low σI,ice vs θw; 3) On Airfoil dataset, verify lower-surface CST parameters show higher σρ than upper-surface parameters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Does the inequality E[xC][Iice(xj; xC)] ≥ Ipdp(xj) hold for general non-polynomial functions? The theoretical proof is restricted to multivariate polynomials and functions with specific additive or multiplicative separability.
- How can surrogate model approximation errors be formally propagated into ICE-based sensitivity metrics? Current metrics assume the surrogate is the truth without accounting for model uncertainty.
- Can ICE-based metrics be integrated into optimization frameworks to actively guide design variable prioritization? Current study focuses on post-hoc explainability rather than using metrics as active optimization heuristics.

## Limitations
- Theoretical lower-bound proof relies on truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion, which may not hold for general black-box functions
- ICE-based interaction metric may fail to detect interactions that flip response signs while preserving variance magnitude
- All comparative evaluations use a single surrogate model type (PCE); performance with alternatives like Gaussian Processes remains untested

## Confidence

- **High:** The mechanism by which averaging standard deviations across ICE curves prevents cancellation effects
- **Medium:** The theoretical proof that ICE-based sensitivity is a lower bound of PDP-based sensitivity under polynomial expansion conditions
- **Medium:** The empirical demonstration that ICE-based metrics reveal interactions missed by PDP in test cases

## Next Checks
1. Apply the method to a non-polynomial surrogate (e.g., Gaussian Process) on the Friedman function to verify if ICE-based sensitivity still exceeds PDP-based sensitivity
2. Construct a test function where an interaction flips response signs but preserves variance magnitude to verify if σI,ice correctly flags the interaction or requires visual inspection
3. Implement the full workflow on the airfoil dataset using both PCE and GP surrogates to assess method robustness across different surrogate types
