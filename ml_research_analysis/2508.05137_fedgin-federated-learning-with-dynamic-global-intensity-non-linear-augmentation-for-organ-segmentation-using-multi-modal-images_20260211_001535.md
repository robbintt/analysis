# FedGIN: Federated Learning with Dynamic Global Intensity Non-linear Augmentation for Organ Segmentation using Multi-modal Images

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.05137
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05137
- **Reference count:** 19
- **Primary result:** FedGIN achieved 12-18% Dice score improvement on MRI test cases in limited-data scenarios and near-centralized performance in complete dataset scenarios for multi-modal organ segmentation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of training generalizable organ segmentation models across different medical imaging modalities (CT and MRI) while preserving patient privacy. The authors propose FedGIN, a federated learning framework that integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module to harmonize modality-specific intensity distributions during local training. The framework enables collaborative training across institutions without sharing raw patient data.

The method was evaluated on two public datasets for five abdominal organs (liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas, and gallbladder). In limited-data scenarios, FedGIN achieved 12-18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test cases compared to FL without GIN. In complete dataset scenarios, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized performance with 30% Dice score improvement over MRI-only baseline and 10% improvement over CT-only baseline. The results show that FedGIN effectively generalizes across modalities and institutions, particularly excelling in segmenting low-contrast, anatomically complex organs like the spleen, gallbladder, and pancreas.

## Method Summary
FedGIN integrates federated learning with a Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module to enable collaborative training of organ segmentation models across different imaging modalities without sharing raw patient data. The framework operates by performing local training on modality-specific data at each client institution while applying the GIN module to dynamically harmonize intensity distributions across modalities. During each federated round, clients train on their local data with GIN augmentation, then share only model updates with a central server. The server aggregates these updates to create a global model that has learned to generalize across both CT and MRI intensity patterns. This approach preserves privacy while addressing the modality heterogeneity challenge that typically degrades multi-modal model performance.

## Key Results
- 12-18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test cases in limited-data scenarios compared to FL without GIN
- 30% Dice score improvement over MRI-only baseline and 10% improvement over CT-only baseline in complete dataset scenarios
- Demonstrated effective generalization across modalities, particularly excelling at segmenting low-contrast organs like spleen, gallbladder, and pancreas

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FedGIN works by dynamically harmonizing intensity distributions across modalities during local training, allowing the global model to learn modality-agnostic features while preserving modality-specific details through local adaptation. The GIN augmentation module creates a bridge between the different intensity patterns of CT and MRI, preventing the model from overfitting to modality-specific artifacts. This enables the federated learning process to converge on features that are truly anatomical rather than modality-dependent, resulting in better generalization when the model encounters new imaging modalities or variations in acquisition protocols.

## Foundational Learning
- **Federated Learning:** Distributed training where clients keep data local and only share model updates - needed for privacy preservation across institutions
- **Medical Image Intensity Distributions:** CT and MRI have fundamentally different intensity scales and patterns - critical for understanding modality heterogeneity
- **3D Dice Score:** Standard metric for volumetric segmentation evaluation measuring overlap between predicted and ground truth volumes - used to quantify segmentation accuracy
- **Multi-modal Learning:** Training models to work across different imaging modalities - essential for building versatile medical imaging systems
- **Augmentation Techniques:** Methods to artificially expand training data - needed to address data scarcity and modality differences
- **Abdominal Organ Segmentation:** Identifying specific organs in CT/MRI scans - core application task being improved

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
FL Server -> Client Nodes -> GIN Augmentation -> Local Segmentation Model -> FL Server

Critical Path:
Client training with GIN augmentation → Model update aggregation → Global model refinement → Improved segmentation performance

Design Tradeoffs:
GIN module adds minimal computational overhead while providing significant performance gains; privacy preserved by sharing only model updates rather than raw data; local adaptation maintains modality-specific performance while global aggregation enables cross-modality generalization.

Failure Signatures:
Poor convergence if GIN augmentation is too aggressive (over-smoothing modality differences); degradation in modality-specific performance if global aggregation overpowers local adaptation; communication bottlenecks if model updates are too large.

First Experiments:
1. Baseline FL without GIN on CT-only data
2. Baseline FL without GIN on MRI-only data  
3. FedGIN training across both modalities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to five abdominal organs in two imaging modalities, unclear if gains translate to other anatomical regions
- Lacks detailed analysis of GIN module's computational overhead in resource-constrained clinical environments
- Did not include direct comparison with state-of-the-art centralized segmentation models to contextualize improvements

## Confidence
- **Modality-agnostic claims:** Medium - demonstrated across CT and MRI but not tested with more than two modalities
- **Near-centralized performance:** High - supported by reported metrics but lacks comparison to centralized state-of-the-art
- **GIN augmentation effectiveness:** Medium - significant improvements shown but contribution not isolated through ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Cross-validation across multiple institutions with varying scanner manufacturers and protocols to assess real-world generalizability
2. Ablation studies isolating the contribution of GIN augmentation versus other federated learning components
3. Analysis of model performance degradation when client participation varies or when clients drop out during training
