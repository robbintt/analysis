# HoverAI: An Embodied Aerial Agent for Natural Human-Drone Interaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.13801
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13801
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Infrastructure-independent drone interaction with demographic-adaptive avatars and sub-1s latency

## Executive Summary
HoverAI introduces a lightweight quadrotor platform that enables natural, socially responsive interaction between drones and humans in shared spaces. The system integrates onboard visual projection, real-time conversational AI, and demographic-adaptive avatar generation into a self-contained platform. Using a MEMS laser projector and semi-rigid screen, HoverAI projects lip-synced avatars that adapt appearance based on user demographics, enabling infrastructure-independent visual communication. Evaluation with 12 participants demonstrates robust performance across speech transcription, command recognition, demographic classification, and real-time responsiveness.

## Method Summary
HoverAI employs a multimodal pipeline combining voice activity detection, automatic speech recognition, lightweight intent classification, RAG-based dialogue, and real-time face analysis for avatar personalization. The system uses a 1.2 kg quadrotor with Orange Pi 5 and a MEMS laser projector projecting onto a semi-rigid polycarbonate screen suspended 15cm forward. Audio processing runs on a ground station via WiFi 5GHz, while video processing occurs onboard. The pipeline routes structured commands to drone control and conversational queries through RAG to maintain grounded dialogue, with demographic estimation driving avatar selection among four predefined variants.

## Key Results
- Speech transcription Word Error Rate: 0.181
- Command recognition F1 score: 0.90
- Gender classification F1 score: 0.89
- Age estimation MAE: 5.14 years
- End-to-end latency: 800-1200ms
- Stable operation: >60 minutes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Infrastructure-independent visual projection via MEMS laser and semi-rigid screen enables mobile, self-contained display without external surfaces.
- Mechanism: A 2D MEMS scanning mirror projects 720p visuals onto a lightweight polycarbonate film suspended 15cm forward; the semi-rigid material maintains surface stability under rotor airflow and vibration.
- Core assumption: Projection quality remains acceptable despite in-flight micro-movements and indoor lighting constraints.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Equipped with a MEMS laser projector, onboard semi-rigid screen... infrastructure-independent visual communication" [section 2.1] "semi-rigid polycarbonate film (0.3 mm, 40 g) suspended 15 cm in front of the projector remains stable under airflow and vibrations"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Parallel audio and video processing with LLM-based intent routing enables real-time, contextually appropriate responses.
- Mechanism: Audio undergoes VAD (Silero) and ASR (Whisper-medium.en); transcripts are classified by gemma:7b-instruct into structured commands (direct execution) or conversational queries (routed to RAG). Concurrently, video feeds InsightFace for demographic estimation to personalize avatar selection.
- Core assumption: WiFi latency (~50ms) and ground station processing do not break conversational turn-taking; 800-1200ms end-to-end latency remains acceptable.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "multimodal pipeline combining VAD, ASR (Whisper), LLM-based intent classification, RAG for dialogue, face analysis" [section 2.2] "end-to-end pipeline latency averaged 950 ms (±120 ms) from speech onset to avatar response"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Demographic-adaptive avatar personalization increases social presence by matching avatar appearance and voice to user characteristics.
- Mechanism: InsightFace estimates age and gender; the system selects among four predefined avatars (young/adult × male/female) and adapts XTTS v2 voice characteristics (pitch, timbre). A default gender-neutral avatar appears when no face is detected.
- Core assumption: Users perceive adaptive avatars as more natural or trustworthy than static interfaces; demographic estimation errors are tolerable for interaction quality.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "lip-synced avatars that adapt appearance to user demographics" [section 3.2] "Gender Estimation (F1: 0.89)... Age Estimation (MAE: 5.14 years)... binary classification (<30 vs ≥30) for avatar selection achieved 91.7% accuracy"

## Foundational Learning

- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Streaming ASR**
  - Why needed here: Real-time interaction requires distinguishing speech from silence/noise before transcription; Whisper-medium.en depends on clean segmentation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why VAD must precede ASR in a streaming pipeline, and what tradeoffs exist between latency and accuracy?

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for Grounded Dialogue**
  - Why needed here: Prevents hallucination by anchoring LLM responses in a curated knowledge base (museum artifacts, FAQs).
  - Quick check question: What happens when a user query has no relevant retrieval match—how should the system respond?

- **Face Analysis for Demographic Estimation**
  - Why needed here: Avatar selection depends on robust age/gender classification under variable lighting and viewing angles.
  - Quick check question: InsightFace outputs a continuous age estimate—why does the system binarize at 30 for avatar selection rather than using raw values?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Close-talking microphone → ground station → Silero VAD → Whisper-medium.en ASR → gemma:7b-instruct intent classifier → [command: drone control] OR [query: RAG system] → XTTS v2 synthesis → avatar selector → lip-synced rendering → MEMS projector/semi-rigid screen. Simultaneously: RGB camera → Orange Pi 5 → InsightFace → demographic estimation → avatar selection.
- **Critical path:** Speech onset → VAD → ASR → intent classification → response generation (RAG or command) → TTS → avatar render → display. This path determines conversational latency (target <1s).
- **Design tradeoffs:** Onboard vs. ground processing: Audio/LLM processing offloaded to ground station for compute capacity vs. latency and range dependence (~15m WiFi limit). Avatar granularity: Four predefined avatars balance personalization with implementation simplicity; finer granularity would increase complexity and misclassification risk. RAG scope: 150 curated facts ensure response quality but limit domain coverage; expanding requires vetting external sources.
- **Failure signatures:** High WER on technical terms: ASR errors cascade to intent misclassification. Vibration artifacts on screen: Aggressive flight maneuvers destabilize projection. Out-of-domain queries: RAG returns generic responses when no relevant documents match. Network dropouts: WiFi interruption breaks audio streaming and ground station inference.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Latency profiling: Instrument each pipeline stage (VAD, ASR, intent, RAG, TTS, render) to identify bottlenecks; target sub-1s end-to-end. 2. Noise robustness test: Evaluate ASR WER and intent classification F1 under varying ambient noise levels (45-70 dB) to quantify degradation. 3. Avatar adaptation A/B test: Compare user perception (trust, clarity, social presence) between demographic-adaptive vs. static avatars.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the use of demographic-adaptive avatars significantly improve user trust and perceived social presence compared to static or non-adaptive drone interfaces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "we did not assess whether the adaptive avatar actually reduces uncertainty or enhances social presence," noting the evaluation focused on technical metrics.
- Why unresolved: The study measured objective performance (WER, F1, latency) but lacked subjective user studies or qualitative feedback regarding the psychological impact of the adaptive interface.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative user studies measuring perceived safety, trust, and clarity using standardized scales (e.g., Godspeed) between adaptive and non-adaptive interaction conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the speech perception pipeline maintain accuracy in uncontrolled, high-noise acoustic environments without relying on close-talking microphones?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "robustness to real-world acoustic environments" as a critical future direction, noting that practical deployments involve "higher noise levels and overlapping speech."
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation was conducted in a controlled indoor environment with moderate ambient noise (45-50 dB) and used close-talking headphones to maximize signal-to-noise ratio.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks of the Whisper-medium.en pipeline's Word Error Rate (WER) in noisy, public environments (e.g., museums or urban settings) using standard far-field microphones.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What mechanisms are required to mitigate the privacy risks and potential bias inherent in real-time demographic estimation for public drone interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that "mistakes in estimating age or gender may lead to misrepresentation or bias" and notes the need to "handle data transparently" to address ethical risks.
- Why unresolved: The current prototype performs demographic estimation immediately upon face detection without established protocols for user consent or bias correction in public spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of privacy-preserving interaction protocols, such as opt-in consent indicators or fairness audits of the InsightFace model across diverse demographic groups.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (N=12) and controlled indoor environment limit generalizability to diverse settings and user populations.
- Dependency on 5 GHz WiFi (~50ms latency, ~15m range) creates operational constraints not fully explored under degraded network conditions.
- Lack of user perception studies to validate whether demographic-adaptive avatars actually improve social presence or interaction quality compared to static alternatives.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The technical implementation of the multimodal pipeline (VAD→ASR→intent→RAG/TTS→avatar) and its measured performance metrics (latency <1s, WER 0.181, F1 0.90) are well-supported by the described architecture and evaluation protocol.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that infrastructure-independent projection via MEMS laser/semi-rigid screen works reliably in practice is supported by qualitative descriptions but lacks systematic testing across different lighting conditions and flight maneuvers.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that demographic-adaptive avatars enhance social presence lacks direct empirical validation; the paper provides technical implementation details but no user perception data comparing adaptive vs. static avatars.

## Next Checks

1. **Avatar adaptation user study**: Conduct a controlled A/B test where participants interact with both demographic-adaptive and static avatars, measuring perceived social presence, trust, clarity, and comfort using validated scales (e.g., Godspeed questionnaire).

2. **Environmental robustness testing**: Evaluate system performance (ASR WER, latency, projection quality) across varying ambient noise levels (45-70 dB), lighting conditions, and drone maneuver intensities to quantify operational boundaries.

3. **Network degradation analysis**: Systematically test pipeline performance under varying WiFi conditions (latency 50-500ms, packet loss 0-30%) to identify failure thresholds and inform design of offline or edge-compute alternatives.
