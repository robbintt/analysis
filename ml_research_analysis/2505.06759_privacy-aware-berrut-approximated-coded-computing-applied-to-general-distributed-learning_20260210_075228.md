# Privacy-aware Berrut Approximated Coded Computing applied to general distributed learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.06759
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06759
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: PBACC maintains high model accuracy while providing strong privacy guarantees (less than 1 bit leakage per element) in general distributed learning scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Privacy-aware Berrut Approximate Coded Computing (PBACC), a framework that extends coded computing techniques to preserve privacy in distributed learning systems. The approach encodes input data tensors using rational interpolation with Chebyshev points, adds Gaussian noise for privacy protection, and employs Berrut barycentric interpolation for decoding during model training. PBACC is designed to work in both centralized and decentralized federated learning settings while handling tensor inputs and multiple data owners.

The framework addresses the fundamental challenge of balancing computational efficiency with privacy preservation in distributed learning. By bounding mutual information leakage per data element, PBACC provides quantifiable privacy guarantees that can be adjusted by tuning noise parameters. The approach is validated across different model types including CNNs, VAEs, and Cox regression models, demonstrating that privacy protection can be achieved without significant accuracy degradation.

## Method Summary
The PBACC framework encodes input data tensors using rational interpolation based on Chebyshev points, adds Gaussian noise for privacy, and decodes using Berrut barycentric interpolation during distributed model training. The method handles tensor inputs through a privacy-preserving secure aggregation mechanism that works with multiple data owners. The privacy metric bounds mutual information leakage per data element, making it arbitrarily small through noise parameter adjustment. The framework supports both centralized and decentralized federated learning scenarios, with the decentralized approach keeping both inputs and models encoded throughout training for maximum privacy protection. Experimental validation covers CNN, VAE, and Cox regression models across different data distributions.

## Key Results
- PBACC maintains high model accuracy while providing strong privacy guarantees (less than 1 bit leakage per element)
- The framework successfully handles tensor inputs and multiple data owners in both centralized and decentralized settings
- Secure training in decentralized data scenarios incurs higher communication costs but provides the strongest privacy protection
- Privacy quantification based on mutual information leakage provides rigorous guarantees under Gaussian noise assumptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PBACC leverages rational interpolation with Chebyshev points to encode data in a way that enables approximate computation while preserving privacy. The Berrut barycentric interpolation formula provides an efficient decoding mechanism that works with the encoded representations. Gaussian noise addition creates a quantifiable privacy buffer by bounding mutual information leakage between the original data and the encoded representations. The secure aggregation protocol ensures that no single party can reconstruct individual data points during the distributed computation process. The framework's flexibility in handling different model types and data distributions makes it applicable to general distributed learning scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- Coded Computing: Why needed - Enables efficient distributed computation by introducing redundancy; Quick check - Verify that the encoding preserves the essential information needed for the learning task
- Rational Interpolation with Chebyshev Points: Why needed - Provides stable polynomial approximation with minimal error; Quick check - Confirm that the interpolation error remains bounded for the expected input ranges
- Berrut Barycentric Interpolation: Why needed - Offers computational efficiency for evaluating rational functions; Quick check - Ensure that the barycentric weights are correctly computed for the chosen interpolation points
- Mutual Information Privacy Metric: Why needed - Provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for quantifying privacy leakage; Quick check - Verify that the Gaussian noise parameters achieve the claimed mutual information bounds
- Secure Aggregation: Why needed - Prevents reconstruction of individual data points during distributed computation; Quick check - Confirm that the aggregation protocol prevents information leakage to any single party

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Data Owners -> Encoder (Chebyshev interpolation + Gaussian noise) -> Secure Aggregator -> Distributed Model Training -> Berrut Decoder -> Model Output
- Critical Path: Data encoding and noise addition occur at data owner side, followed by secure aggregation and distributed training, with decoding performed during model evaluation
- Design Tradeoffs: Higher privacy guarantees require more noise (lower accuracy) and more complex encoding/decoding, while better accuracy requires less noise but weaker privacy
- Failure Signatures: Privacy failures manifest as increased mutual information leakage, accuracy degradation indicates excessive noise or poor interpolation, convergence issues suggest encoding/decoding mismatches
- First Experiments: 1) Test encoding/decoding accuracy on synthetic data with known ground truth, 2) Measure mutual information leakage with varying noise levels, 3) Evaluate model accuracy degradation across different model architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- The mutual information privacy metric assumes Gaussian noise addition, which may not capture all real-world privacy threats
- Computational overhead of barycentric interpolation for tensor decoding is theoretically bounded but not extensively characterized
- Communication cost analysis for decentralized settings is promising but based on limited experimental validation
- Privacy quantification may not translate directly to practical privacy risks in deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- Core mathematical framework (High): Berrut interpolation approach is well-established and mathematically sound
- Privacy quantification (Medium): Mutual information bounds are rigorous under stated assumptions but may not capture all practical threats
- Practical performance claims (Medium-Low): Experimental evaluation covers limited model types and scales
- Communication cost analysis (Medium): Promising results but limited validation across diverse deployment scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Perform end-to-end privacy risk assessment using membership inference attacks to validate that mutual information bounds translate to practical security in real-world deployments
2. Conduct extensive scaling experiments across diverse model architectures (transformer-based models, graph neural networks) to characterize computational overhead and identify bottlenecks
3. Implement and evaluate the decentralized secure training protocol in a real federated learning deployment with heterogeneous devices to measure actual communication costs and convergence behavior under realistic conditions
