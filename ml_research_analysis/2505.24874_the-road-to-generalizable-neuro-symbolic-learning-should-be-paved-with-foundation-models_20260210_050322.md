# The Road to Generalizable Neuro-Symbolic Learning Should be Paved with Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24874
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24874
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Foundation models can replace trained neural components in neuro-symbolic systems, approaching or matching trained model performance while avoiding training pitfalls

## Executive Summary
This position paper argues that foundation models—large pre-trained models that perform well via prompting—can replace the neural components in neuro-symbolic systems, a method termed neuro-symbolic prompting. The authors identify three pitfalls of traditional neuro-symbolic training: (1) the compute pitfall—training specialized models offers diminishing returns as foundation models improve with scale; (2) the data pitfall—specialized datasets cause overfitting, while foundation models generalize better; and (3) the program pitfall—training can lead to symbol hallucination, where models predict symbols not evident in the input but that yield correct answers through the reasoning program. Experiments on five benchmarks (Sum5, HWF5, CLUTRR, Leaf, CLEVR) show that foundation models approach or match the performance of trained models, especially as model size increases, and provide better robustness to noise.

## Method Summary
The paper compares neuro-symbolic prompting (using foundation models to extract symbols for a program) against traditional neuro-symbolic training (e.g., Scallop, ISED) on reasoning tasks. Foundation models (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5, Gemini, GPT-4o) are prompted with specific few-shot examples to extract symbols from raw inputs, which are then processed by symbolic programs to produce final answers. Baselines use trained models from existing frameworks. The evaluation includes five benchmarks: Sum5 (MNIST sums), HWF5 (handwritten arithmetic), CLUTRR (kinship reasoning), Leaf (plant classification), and CLEVR (visual reasoning). The Data Pitfall is evaluated by injecting Gaussian noise (std dev 0.03–0.25) into image datasets and measuring accuracy degradation.

## Key Results
- Foundation models approach or match the performance of specialized trained models on neuro-symbolic tasks, with performance gaps narrowing as model size increases
- Foundation models show better robustness to noise compared to trained models, with smaller accuracy drops under 3% Gaussian noise perturbation
- Neuro-symbolic training can lead to "symbol hallucination" where models predict incorrect intermediate symbols but still achieve correct final answers through the reasoning program

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Replacing task-specific neural perception models with prompted foundation models can approach or match performance while avoiding the compute costs of training.
- Mechanism: Foundation models pre-trained on internet-scale data encode general perceptual capabilities (e.g., digit recognition, object detection) that can be elicited via prompting, eliminating the need to train specialized perception components from scratch.
- Core assumption: Foundation models have sufficient general perception capabilities for the task's symbol extraction requirements, which improves with scale.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This position paper argues that foundation models enable generalizable neuro-symbolic solutions, offering a path towards achieving the original goals of neuro-symbolic learning without the downsides of training from scratch."
  - [section 2.1] "These results show foundation models can generally convert raw input to symbols, nearing the performance of specialized, task-specific models."
  - [corpus] Related work discusses grounding neuro-symbolic AI and visual neuro-symbolic approaches, but no direct evidence on this specific compute trade-off.
- Break condition: Tasks requiring highly specialized perception beyond foundation model capabilities (e.g., novel sensor modalities or extremely niche domains) where prompting yields poor symbol extraction accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Foundation models provide better robustness to distribution shifts compared to neuro-symbolic training with specialized datasets.
- Mechanism: Specialized training datasets cause overfitting to dataset-specific biases and noise, while foundation models' broad pretraining encourages learning more generalizable representations that handle input perturbations better.
- Core assumption: The improved noise robustness observed in experiments generalizes to other forms of distribution shift.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...specialized datasets cause overfitting, while foundation models generalize better..."
  - [section 2.2/Table 1] Performance drop with 3% Gaussian noise: NSprompt shows smaller accuracy drops (-0.03, -0.06, -0.06, -0.07) compared to NStrain (-0.02, -0.21, -0.11, -0.19) across four image datasets.
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related work doesn't directly address this generalization mechanism.
- Break condition: Distribution shifts that fundamentally alter the task semantics or introduce symbols/concepts outside the foundation model's pretraining distribution.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Neuro-symbolic training methods can achieve correct final answers through "symbol hallucination"—predicting symbols not supported by the input but that happen to yield correct outputs via the reasoning program.
- Mechanism: Without ground truth supervision for intermediate symbols, the neural component learns to predict symbols that minimize the final task loss, even if those symbols are factually incorrect or hallucinated, exploiting shortcuts in the reasoning program.
- Core assumption: Symbol hallucination is identified via cases where training methods get correct final answers while prompting methods get wrong answers, but with low ground-truth symbol match rates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...training can lead to symbol hallucination, where models predict symbols not evident in the input but that yield correct answers through the reasoning program."
  - [section 2.3/Table 1] Symbol GT Match for CLUTRR, Leaf, CLEVR is 0.00, 0.16, 0.14 respectively (human evaluation for Leaf), indicating correct answers often come from incorrect intermediate symbols.
  - [section 2.3/Table 2] Human evaluation for Leaf shows 58.8% and 60.0% disagreement with Scallop predictions for margin and shape; texture has near-random agreement (Kappa=0.05).
  - [corpus] Related work on "Neuro-Symbolic Concepts" and "Neural DNF-MT" addresses interpretable neuro-symbolic learning but doesn't directly confirm symbol hallucination.
- Break condition: When ground truth intermediate symbol supervision is available during training, preventing the model from learning such shortcuts.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Neuro-symbolic learning (perception-reasoning split)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's entire argument is structured around the distinction between neural perception (converting raw inputs to symbols) and symbolic reasoning (processing symbols via programs), and how foundation models change the perception component.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the paper claims foundation models change the "perception" part of neuro-symbolic systems but not the "reasoning" part?

- Concept: **Foundation models and prompting**
  - Why needed here: The core proposal—"neuro-symbolic prompting"—replaces trained neural networks with prompted foundation models, so understanding how prompting works (few-shot examples in context) is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does the paper's approach differ from using foundation models with Chain-of-Thought reasoning?

- Concept: **Generalization vs. overfitting trade-offs**
  - Why needed here: The "data pitfall" argument hinges on foundation models generalizing better than task-specific trained models, which requires understanding how specialized datasets can embed biases.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model trained specifically on MNIST digits perform well on the test set but worse than a foundation model on slightly noisy versions of the same digits?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input (raw data) -> Foundation Model (Prompted) -> Symbolic Output (e.g., digits, relationships, object attributes) -> Symbolic Program (e.g., Python function, decision tree) -> Final Answer

- Critical path:
  1. Prompt engineering for symbol extraction (few-shot examples, output format specification)
  2. Ensuring symbolic output format is parseable by the downstream program
  3. Designing the symbolic program to be robust to foundation model errors

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompting vs. fine-tuning foundation models: Prompting preserves generality but may have lower ceiling performance; fine-tuning offers middle ground but reintroduces training risks.
  - Human-specified vs. inferred programs: Human-specified programs provide reliability but limit applicability; inferred programs (open research problem) could expand use cases but introduce error modes.
  - Model size vs. resource constraints: Larger foundation models close the performance gap with trained models but require more compute for inference.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low symbol extraction accuracy: Foundation model fails to correctly identify symbols from input (e.g., Leaf dataset gap due to ambiguous visual features).
  - Format parsing errors: Foundation model output doesn't conform to expected symbolic format, breaking the program.
  - Program-symbol mismatch: The provided program expects different symbols or logic than the foundation model is prompted to produce.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Replicate the paper's main comparison on at least two benchmarks (e.g., CLUTRR and CLEVR) using available foundation models (e.g., open-source models like Llama 3.2 or Qwen2.5) against a neuro-symbolic training baseline (e.g., Scallop).
  2. Noise robustness test: Add controlled noise (e.g., Gaussian noise for images, typos for text) and compare accuracy degradation between prompted and trained approaches.
  3. Symbol hallucination audit: For a subset of examples where the training baseline gets the correct answer but prompting gets the wrong answer, manually inspect if the training baseline's intermediate symbols match ground truth (if available) or perform human evaluation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can neuro-symbolic prompting systems autonomously infer the necessary symbols and reasoning programs without relying on human specification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies the "significant remaining frontier" as the problem of "autonomously inferring the symbols and program," and Section 4 states that "effectively synthesizing programs over foundation model symbols is still an open problem."
- Why unresolved: Current neuro-symbolic prompting methods still depend heavily on human experts to define the symbolic reasoning programs, limiting scalability.
- What evidence would resolve it: The creation of a system that can dynamically generate accurate programs and symbol sets for complex benchmarks like CLEVR without pre-defined logic.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can finetuning foundation models serve as a viable "middle ground" that avoids the generalization pitfalls of training from scratch while solving data-scarcity issues?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 6 discusses an "alternate view" where finetuning is proposed as a middle ground for specialized domains where prompting is ineffective, but notes it risks reintroducing training pitfalls.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if finetuning preserves the robustness and generalizability of the underlying foundation model better than training a specialized model from scratch.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring noise robustness and out-of-distribution performance between finetuned neuro-symbolic models and prompting baselines on niche datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why do current foundation model code generation tools fail to produce reliable programs for complex visual reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4 notes that while tools like ChatGPT Code Interpreter are useful for data analysis, they are "ineffective" for complex tasks like CLEVR, potentially resulting in worse performance than pure prompting.
- Why unresolved: The disconnect between the model's ability to solve simple data tasks and its failure to synthesize code for visual logic is not fully explained or bridged.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of error types in generated code for CLEVR-style tasks leading to a prompting strategy that matches human-specified program performance.

## Limitations

- The empirical evidence is limited to five benchmarks, primarily focused on perception-heavy tasks rather than abstract reasoning or novel domains
- The symbol hallucination analysis lacks systematic quantification across all datasets and depends on human evaluation for some cases
- The claim that foundation models completely eliminate the need for specialized training is overstated—performance gaps remain in some cases (e.g., Leaf dataset)

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The compute pitfall argument is well-supported by scaling laws literature and the observed performance trends with larger foundation models
- **Medium confidence**: The data pitfall (generalization/robustness) claim is supported by noise experiments but would benefit from testing against other distribution shifts
- **Low confidence**: The claim that foundation models completely eliminate the need for specialized training is overstated

## Next Checks

1. Cross-dataset generalization test: Apply the neuro-symbolic prompting approach to a dataset outside the five benchmarks to assess generalizability beyond the studied cases
2. Distribution shift robustness evaluation: Beyond Gaussian noise, test robustness to semantic distribution shifts (e.g., novel object types, altered relationships) and compare with both traditional training and potential fine-tuning approaches
3. Human program specification scalability: Evaluate the practical limits of human-specified programs by attempting to apply the approach to a more complex reasoning task requiring multiple interconnected programs, measuring the effort and error rates in program development
