# RLPR: Extrapolating RLVR to General Domains without Verifiers
## Quick Facts

- Introduces RLPR, a framework extending RLVR to general domains without external verifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks

## Executive Summary
RLPR introduces a novel framework that extends reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to general domains without relying on external verifiers. The approach leverages the LLM's own token probabilities for reference answers as a reward signal, effectively using the model's intrinsic evaluation of reasoning quality. To address training instability, the authors propose a debiasing method to eliminate reward bias from text and an adaptive curriculum learning mechanism based on reward standard deviation filtering. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks using Gemma, Llama, and Qwen models demonstrate consistent improvements in reasoning capabilities across both mathematical and general domains.

## Method Summary
The RLPR framework operates by using the language model's own token probabilities for reference answers as intrinsic reward signals, eliminating the need for external verifiers. The core innovation addresses reward bias and training instability through two key components: a debiasing method that removes text-dependent biases from reward calculations, and an adaptive curriculum learning mechanism that filters training examples based on reward standard deviation. This approach allows the model to learn from its own assessment of answer quality while maintaining stable training dynamics across diverse problem domains.

## Key Results
- RLPR achieves 7.6 points higher performance than VeriFree on TheoremQA benchmark
- RLPR outperforms General Reasoner by 7.5 points on Minerva benchmark
- RLPR surpasses General Reasoner by 1.6 average points across all seven benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of large language models to evaluate their own outputs. By using token probabilities from the model itself as reward signals, RLPR eliminates dependency on external verification systems while maintaining alignment with human judgment. The debiasing mechanism removes systematic biases that arise from text-based evaluation, ensuring that rewards reflect genuine reasoning quality rather than superficial patterns. The adaptive curriculum learning dynamically adjusts the difficulty of training examples based on reward consistency, allowing the model to focus on challenging problems that provide meaningful learning signals.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**: The standard approach of using external verifiers for reward signals in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks. Needed because traditional RL approaches lack reliable quality assessment for complex reasoning problems.
- **Intrinsic Reward Signals**: Using the model's own capabilities to generate evaluation metrics rather than relying on external systems. Required to eliminate dependency on verifier models and enable broader applicability.
- **Curriculum Learning**: Adaptive adjustment of training difficulty based on model performance. Essential for maintaining stable training and ensuring the model learns from appropriately challenging examples.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: LLM -> Token Probability Extraction -> Reward Calculation -> Debiasing Module -> Curriculum Filter -> RL Training
- **Critical Path**: The most performance-sensitive path is the reward calculation and debiasing pipeline, as these directly impact the quality of learning signals. Any latency or bias in this path propagates through the entire training process.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead from additional reward processing against improved training stability and broader applicability. Using intrinsic rewards eliminates verifier dependency but may introduce subtle biases from the base model's training.
- **Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include reward collapse (where the model learns to game the intrinsic reward), curriculum stagnation (where the filter becomes too conservative), and bias amplification (where text-dependent biases accumulate over training).
- **First Experiments**: 1) Verify reward signal quality by comparing intrinsic rewards to human judgments on a validation set. 2) Test debiasing effectiveness by measuring reward consistency across semantically equivalent answers. 3) Validate curriculum learning by analyzing reward distribution changes during training.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- The debiasing method and adaptive curriculum learning effectiveness is primarily validated on seven specific benchmarks, with unclear generalizability to other domains
- Reliance on LLM token probabilities as rewards may introduce hidden biases based on the model's training data and architecture
- The framework's performance on completely different problem domains beyond mathematical and general reasoning remains unverified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core technical contribution of extending RLVR to general domains without external verifiers is well-supported by experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about RLPR outperforming VeriFree and General Reasoner are credible given reported metrics, but comparisons might be sensitive to implementation details
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of debiasing method and adaptive curriculum learning is supported by experimental results but would benefit from more extensive ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies to isolate contributions of debiasing method and adaptive curriculum learning, testing effectiveness across diverse problem types and model scales
2. Test RLPR's performance on a broader range of benchmarks, including those from completely different domains (e.g., legal reasoning, medical diagnosis) to assess generalizability
3. Perform detailed analysis of reward signal quality and bias across different model families and sizes to understand limitations of using LLM token probabilities as rewards
