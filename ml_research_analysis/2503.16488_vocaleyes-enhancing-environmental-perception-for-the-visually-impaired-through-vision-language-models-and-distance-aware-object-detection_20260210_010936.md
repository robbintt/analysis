# VocalEyes: Enhancing Environmental Perception for the Visually Impaired through Vision-Language Models and Distance-Aware Object Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16488
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16488
- Reference count: 17
- Real-time assistive system processes live video on edge devices with quantized Florence-2 model

## Executive Summary
VocalEyes presents a vision-language model system designed to enhance environmental perception for visually impaired users. The system processes live video input on edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, providing audio descriptions of surroundings including object identification and distance estimation. A lightweight Parler TTS Mini component delivers customizable speech feedback with 34 voice options. The quantized and fine-tuned Florence-2 model achieves 45 ms inference latency with 35% reduced size while maintaining performance comparable to larger models.

## Method Summary
The system leverages a quantized and fine-tuned Florence-2 model for environmental perception, processing live video input on edge devices. The architecture includes object detection with distance estimation capabilities and a lightweight Parler TTS Mini component for speech synthesis. The fine-tuned model provides spatially-aware descriptions that enhance situational awareness beyond generic scene descriptions. System accuracy reaches 42.8 mAP for object detection and 68.4% for visual question answering tasks.

## Key Results
- 45 ms inference latency with 35% reduced model size through quantization
- 42.8 mAP accuracy for object detection and 68.4% accuracy for visual question answering
- 34 voice options for customizable speech feedback

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from combining quantized vision-language models with real-time edge processing capabilities. By fine-tuning Florence-2 specifically for assistive applications, the model learns to provide spatially-aware descriptions rather than generic scene information. The distance-aware object detection enables users to understand not just what objects are present, but their relative positions and proximity, which is critical for safe navigation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Models**: Combine visual processing with natural language understanding - needed to bridge the gap between visual perception and accessible information delivery
- **Model Quantization**: Reduces model size and computational requirements while maintaining accuracy - needed for real-time processing on edge devices with limited resources
- **Distance-Aware Object Detection**: Extends traditional object detection to include spatial relationships - needed for situational awareness in navigation contexts
- **Edge Computing**: Processes data locally rather than in cloud - needed for privacy, low latency, and offline functionality
- **Text-to-Speech Synthesis**: Converts textual descriptions to natural speech - needed to deliver information in accessible audio format
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapts pre-trained models to specific assistive tasks - needed to optimize performance for visually impaired user needs

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Camera -> Florence-2 Model -> Distance Estimation -> TTS Engine -> Audio Output
- **Critical Path**: Video frame capture → Model inference → Spatial analysis → Speech synthesis → Audio playback
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Model size vs. accuracy (quantization reduces size by 35% with minimal accuracy loss), voice customization vs. system complexity (34 voices available), edge processing vs. cloud capabilities (prioritizes privacy and low latency)
- **Failure Signatures**: Recognition failures in low-light conditions, speech synthesis errors with uncommon objects, latency spikes during complex scenes, audio output disruptions
- **First 3 Experiments**: 1) Test basic object detection accuracy on standardized datasets, 2) Measure inference latency across different hardware configurations, 3) Validate speech synthesis quality with various voice options

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation conducted primarily on Jetson Orin Nano rather than with actual visually impaired users in naturalistic environments
- Accuracy metrics lack comparison to established benchmarks or state-of-the-art assistive technologies
- Claimed "enhanced situational awareness" remains theoretical without empirical user validation

## Confidence
- High confidence: System architecture description, quantization methodology, hardware specifications
- Medium confidence: Performance metrics on Jetson Orin Nano, model accuracy figures
- Low confidence: Real-world usability, user experience benefits, comparative advantages over existing solutions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal user studies with visually impaired participants in diverse real-world environments to validate claimed improvements in situational awareness and navigation safety
2. Benchmark system performance against established assistive technologies and state-of-the-art vision-language models under identical hardware constraints
3. Test system robustness across varying environmental conditions (lighting, weather, crowded spaces) and measure performance degradation patterns to establish operational limits
