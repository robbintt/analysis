## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.13576
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13576
- **Authors:** Meng-Ping Lin; Enoch Hsin-Ho Huang; Shao-Yi Chien; Yu Tsao
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** End-to-end AVSE-ECS system improves speech intelligibility and signal-to-error ratio in noisy CI simulations.

## Executive Summary
This study proposes an end-to-end audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system for cochlear implant (CI) sound coding simulations. The AVSE-ECS system integrates an AVSE module with the ElectrodeNet-CS (ECS) model, which simulates the ACE coding strategy using a deep neural network. Joint training of the AVSE and ECS components improves objective speech intelligibility and signal-to-error ratio (SER) compared to audio-only approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves a 7.4666 dB improvement in SER over the ACE strategy, and enhances speech intelligibility metrics such as STOI and ESTOI under noisy conditions.

## Method Summary
The AVSE-ECS method uses a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) to extract visual embeddings from the mouth region (ROI), which are then integrated with audio features via cross-attention in a modified NCSN++ U-Net. The ECS model, a deep neural network with a custom "topk" layer, approximates the ACE coding strategy and enables gradient-based optimization. Joint training with a composite loss function (combining spectrogram and electrodogram losses) improves performance over pre-trained models. The system is evaluated on noisy Mandarin speech using objective metrics like STOI, ESTOI, and SER.

## Key Results
- AVSE-ECS achieves a 7.4666 dB improvement in SER over the ACE strategy.
- Joint training significantly outperforms pre-training, with higher STOI and ESTOI scores.
- Visual cues enhance speech reconstruction by filtering noise through cross-attention mechanisms.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Visual cues regarding lip movement act as a robust prior to disambiguate target speech from background noise, particularly when audio signals are degraded. A TCN extracts visual embeddings from the mouth region (ROI), which replace the keys and values in the attention mechanism of the audio U-Net (NCSN++). This cross-attention setup allows the model to "attend" to audio features that correlate with visual lip motions, effectively filtering out noise that lacks corresponding visual movement. The alignment between audio phonemes and visual lip shapes remains consistent even under acoustic noise corruption.

### Mechanism 2
Replacing non-differentiable signal processing blocks with a deep neural network proxy enables gradient-based optimization of the entire CI pipeline. The standard ACE strategy uses non-differentiable operations (envelope detection, argmax-based channel selection). The study uses ElectrodeNet-CS (ECS), a DNN with a custom "topk" layer, to approximate these operations. This differentiability allows the loss function to backpropagate from the electrode output back through the speech enhancement module. The ECS model provides a sufficiently accurate approximation of the biological/physical ACE strategy such that optimizing for ECS output translates to real-world improvement.

### Mechanism 3
Optimizing directly for the "electrodogram" (electrode activation pattern) yields superior CI-specific performance compared to optimizing for audio spectrograms alone. The system uses a composite loss function ($L_{Total} = \alpha L_{Spec} + \beta L_{Elec}$). While $L_{Spec}$ ensures general audio fidelity, $L_{Elec}$ minimizes the Mean Squared Error between the generated electrode pattern and the "clean" electrode pattern. This forces the enhancement module to prioritize acoustic features that survive the CI channel selection process. The "clean" electrodogram derived from clean speech represents the ideal target for perception, ignoring potential information loss inherent in the CI conversion process itself.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: ACE (Advanced Combination Encoder) Strategy**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the industry-standard baseline the paper attempts to improve upon. It involves specific steps (FFT, envelope detection, channel selection) that the ECS model must simulate.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why "channel selection" (picking the top 8 of 22 channels) is necessary in a CI processor?

- **Concept: Cross-Attention vs. Self-Attention**
  - **Why needed here:** The core differentiator between the ASE (Audio-only) and AVSE (Audio-Visual) models is the swap from self-attention to cross-attention.
  - **Quick check question:** In the cross-attention block, do the visual embeddings act as the Query or the Key/Value to condition the audio features?

- **Concept: End-to-End (E2E) Differentiability**
  - **Why needed here:** The primary innovation is "joint training." Without understanding which parts of the traditional signal chain are non-differentiable, the motivation for using ElectrodeNet (ECS) is unclear.
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't you perform standard backpropagation through a traditional "argmax" channel selection function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Noisy Audio (STFT) + Video (Mouth ROI) -> TCN + ResNet-18 (Frozen) -> Visual Embeddings -> NCSN++ (Trainable) with Cross-Attention -> Enhanced Audio Spectrogram -> ECS (Frozen) -> Electrode Selection Pattern -> Tone Vocoder -> Audible Speech

- **Critical path:** The gradient flow path runs *backwards* from the Electrodogram Loss ($L_{Elec}$) through the frozen ECS into the AVSE module.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Training Complexity vs. Performance:** Joint training outperforms pre-training significantly (7.46 dB vs 3.72 dB gain), but requires managing a dual-loss system and larger compute.
  - **Generalizability:** The model was tested on Mandarin (TMHINT). While the authors suggest regression tasks are language-agnostic, tonal languages may provide distinct visual cues; verify performance on non-tonal languages.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Video Occlusion:** If the mouth ROI is lost, the TCN outputs garbage embeddings; check if the system degrades gracefully to ASE performance or fails entirely.
  - **Latency:** The current architecture is PC-based; real-time CI deployment is currently impossible due to the heavy NCSN++ backbone.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce Baseline ECS:** Train the ECS model (Dense layers) to mimic ACE on clean speech to ensure the "proxy" is accurate before connecting the AVSE module.
  2. **Ablation on β:** Run the AVSE-ECS training with β = 0 (Audio-only loss), β = 0.5 (Recommended), and β = 1.0 to verify the sensitivity of the electrodogram loss on SER.
  3. **Modality Drop Test:** Input noisy audio with "frozen" or zeroed visual embeddings to quantify the exact contribution of the visual stream over the audio-only ASE-ECS baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Do the objective improvements in signal-to-error ratio (SER) and speech intelligibility metrics translate to statistically significant improvements in speech perception for human Cochlear Implant (CI) users?
  - **Basis in paper:** The authors state, "Beyond the comprehensive objective evaluations, subjective listening tests are planned for the proposed AVSE-ECS method with both normal-hearing participants using CI simulations and actual CI users."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study relies entirely on vocoder-based simulations and objective metrics (STOI, ESTOI), which approximate but do not fully replicate the auditory experience of actual CI users or the variability of human neurophysiological responses.
  - **Evidence to resolve:** Results from subjective listening tests involving actual CI users performing speech recognition tasks in noisy environments, showing significant perception improvements over standard ACE strategies.

- **Question:** Can the proposed AVSE-ECS architecture be optimized to meet the strict latency constraints required for real-time CI sound processing and hardware implementation?
  - **Basis in paper:** The authors note that "Latency is challenging for real-time deployment on CI sound processors" and mention plans to "reduce the model's computational load through techniques such as pruning and knowledge distillation" for future integration.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current system is implemented on a personal computer suitable for offline processing (e.g., streaming), but the NCSN++ and cross-attention modules likely introduce computational overhead incompatible with the low-power, real-time requirements of wearable CI processors.
  - **Evidence to resolve:** Successful deployment of a lightweight model variant on embedded hardware or edge devices that achieves processing latency below the perceptual threshold (e.g., < 10 ms).

- **Question:** Does the AVSE-ECS system maintain robust performance when generalizing to diverse languages, speakers, and noise types not present in the Mandarin-specific TMSV training dataset?
  - **Basis in paper:** The authors acknowledge that "the objective evaluation relies on a single TMSV dataset in one language, Mandarin Chinese" and list "further studies using diverse datasets" and "cross-language... generalizability" as planned future work.
  - **Why unresolved:** While the authors suggest regression tasks are less language-sensitive, visual cues (lip movements) are language-dependent, and the model's efficacy on different phonetic structures or noise profiles remains unverified.
  - **Evidence to resolve:** Evaluation results from training or testing the system on multilingual audio-visual datasets (e.g., English corpora) demonstrating consistent SER and intelligibility improvements across varied noise conditions.

## Limitations
- **ECS Model Fidelity:** The ECS model's approximation accuracy is critical; poor generalization to specific noise profiles or speakers could undermine joint optimization.
- **Real-World Applicability:** The system is evaluated only on Mandarin and controlled noise conditions; performance on other languages and complex real-world environments is unknown.
- **System Latency and Deployment:** The current architecture is too heavy for real-time CI deployment; latency and computational cost are not reported.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of using cross-attention to fuse visual and audio features for noise reduction is well-supported by the literature. The improvement in SER (7.4666 dB) and objective speech intelligibility metrics (STOI, ESTOI) over the ACE baseline is a direct, measurable outcome.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that optimizing for the "electrodogram" yields superior CI-specific performance is plausible given the composite loss function, but it relies on the assumption that the ECS model is a perfect proxy.
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that the system will generalize well to real-world CI users and diverse listening environments is the least supported; current evaluation is limited to controlled, simulated conditions.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Lingual Performance Test:** Evaluate the AVSE-ECS system on a non-tonal language dataset (e.g., English) to verify the claim that the regression task is language-agnostic and to identify any performance degradation.
2. **Real-World Acoustic Complexity Test:** Test the system with more complex, multi-speaker noise scenarios and in reverberant environments to assess its robustness beyond the laboratory noise conditions used in the paper.
3. **Ablation on Visual Reliability:** Conduct experiments where the visual stream is artificially degraded (e.g., occlusions, delays) to quantify the system's graceful degradation and its fallback performance to the audio-only ASE-ECS baseline.
