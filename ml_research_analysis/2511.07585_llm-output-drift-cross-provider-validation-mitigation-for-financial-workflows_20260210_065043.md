# LLM Output Drift: Cross-Provider Validation & Mitigation for Financial Workflows
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.07585
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07585
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key result**: Small models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B shows only 12.5% consistency regardless of configuration

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of nondeterministic outputs (output drift) in Large Language Models when deployed in regulated financial workflows. The authors demonstrate that drift undermines auditability and trust, presenting a comprehensive evaluation across five model architectures (7B-120B parameters) on financial tasks. They develop a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness and task-specific invariant checking system that enables risk-appropriate deployment decisions through a three-tier model classification framework. Their approach includes cross-provider validation to ensure deterministic behavior transfers between local and cloud deployments, establishing an audit-ready attestation system for financial applications.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness combining greedy decoding (temperature=0.0), fixed seeds, and SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering. They conducted extensive testing across 480 runs (n=16 per condition) using five model architectures on regulated financial tasks. The methodology includes task-specific invariant checking for RAG, JSON, and SQL outputs using finance-calibrated materiality thresholds (±5%) and SEC citation validation. Cross-provider validation was implemented to confirm deterministic behavior transfers between local and cloud deployments, and an audit-ready attestation system with dual-provider validation was established.

## Key Results
- Smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0 across all tested financial tasks
- GPT-OSS-120B exhibits only 12.5% consistency regardless of configuration settings
- Structured tasks (SQL) remain stable even at T=0.2, while RAG tasks show drift variability (25-75%)
- Cross-provider validation confirms deterministic behavior transfers between local and cloud deployments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by establishing strict control parameters (fixed seeds, greedy decoding at T=0.0) combined with domain-specific validation criteria. The finance-calibrated test harness leverages SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering to minimize variability in financial document processing. Task-specific invariant checking uses materiality thresholds (±5%) grounded in SEC standards to identify meaningful drift, while SEC citation validation ensures regulatory compliance. The three-tier model classification system enables risk-appropriate deployment by matching model capabilities to task requirements and audit needs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temperature and Seed Control**: Temperature (T) controls randomness in token selection; lower values reduce variability. Fixed seeds ensure reproducible random number generation across runs.
- **Materiality Thresholds in Finance**: ±5% threshold represents SEC-defined materiality for financial metrics; deviations beyond this indicate potentially significant changes requiring investigation.
- **SEC 10-K Structure-Aware Retrieval**: Financial documents have predictable hierarchical structures; ordering retrieval by this structure improves consistency in extracted information.
- **Cross-Provider Validation**: Testing models across different deployment environments (local vs cloud) ensures deterministic behavior isn't platform-dependent.
- **Task-Specific Invariant Checking**: Different output types (RAG, JSON, SQL) require different validation approaches; invariants capture what must remain constant across runs.
- **Audit-Ready Attestation**: Systematic logging and validation enable regulatory compliance by providing verifiable proof of consistent model behavior.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Finance-Calibrated Test Harness -> Task-Specific Invariant Checker -> Three-Tier Model Classifier -> Audit-Ready Attestation System -> Cross-Provider Validator
**Critical Path**: Model configuration (T=0.0, fixed seeds) → Task execution → Invariant validation → Materiality threshold assessment → Cross-provider verification → Attestation generation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Deterministic behavior requires T=0.0, sacrificing nuanced responses; smaller models offer consistency but may lack reasoning depth; extensive validation adds computational overhead but enables regulatory compliance.
**Failure Signatures**: Output drift exceeding ±5% materiality threshold; inconsistent SEC citations across runs; cross-provider behavioral divergence; task-specific invariant violations.
**First Experiments**: 1) Run SQL generation task at T=0.0 vs T=0.2 to verify stability claims; 2) Execute RAG task across three model tiers to observe drift patterns; 3) Perform cross-provider validation of a single model to test environment consistency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings focus specifically on regulated financial workflows, limiting generalizability to other domains
- 100% consistency at T=0.0 assumes fixed seeds and greedy decoding, but real-world deployments may require higher temperatures
- The ±5% materiality threshold, while SEC-grounded, may not capture all meaningful drift scenarios in practice

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Deterministic behavior at T=0.0 across all tested models; cross-provider validation showing consistent results between local and cloud deployments; SQL task stability even at higher temperatures
- **Medium Confidence**: RAG task drift patterns (25-75%); the three-tier model classification system's risk-appropriateness for financial workflows; the effectiveness of the audit-ready attestation system
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of the ±5% materiality threshold to non-financial domains; long-term stability of deterministic behavior across model updates; real-world performance under variable network conditions and concurrent user loads

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Testing**: Validate the three-tier model classification system and drift patterns on non-financial regulatory domains (healthcare compliance, legal document review) to assess generalizability
2. **Stress Testing**: Evaluate model behavior under realistic deployment conditions including variable network latency, concurrent requests, and mixed temperature requirements to identify potential drift amplification
3. **Longitudinal Monitoring**: Implement continuous drift monitoring over 6-12 months to assess whether deterministic behavior degrades as models receive updates or as training data distributions shift
