- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15662

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitation in large language models where reasoning and verification are decoupled, lacking on-the-fly assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. The authors propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with hybrid reinforcement learning combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities with improved interpretability, achieving significant improvements in reasoning performance while maintaining interpretable reasoning traces.

## Method Summary
STC interleaves reasoning steps with immediate self-critiques, creating a sequence where each reasoning step rₜ is followed by a critique cₜ that provides a natural-language justification and binary correctness score. The framework uses a two-stage training pipeline: first, SFT on synthesized reasoning-critique data generated by a strong LLM, then GRPO with hybrid rewards combining reasoning reward, critique-consistency reward, format reward, and dense step-wise rewards. The output format alternates between reasoning steps (separated by `\n\n`) and critiques wrapped in `<critic>`/`<score>` tags. Training optimizes both reasoning quality and self-assessment accuracy, with the model generating and evaluating its own intermediate steps during inference.

## Key Results
- STC achieves F1-score of 60.8% and true negative rate of 68.3% on average for critique performance
- Pass@1 accuracy improves from 53.3% to 56.4% compared to baseline models
- The framework provides interpretable reasoning traces with self-assessment at each step
- Dense reward augmentation improves Pass@1 by 1.2% but slightly hurts Pass@8 by 0.5%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Interleaving reasoning with immediate self-critique enables real-time error detection and trajectory adjustment.
- **Mechanism**: The model generates a sequence r₁ → c₁ → r₂ → c₂ → ... → rₜ → cₜ, where each critique cₜ provides a natural-language justification and binary correctness score for the preceding reasoning step rₜ. This creates a feedback loop within a single forward pass, allowing subsequent reasoning to adapt based on self-assessed correctness.
- **Core assumption**: The model can learn to produce meaningful self-assessments without external verification during inference; the critique quality depends on training signal quality.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "STC interleaves reasoning steps with immediate self-critiques, enabling real-time error detection and dynamic adaptation during inference."
  - [Section 3.1]: "Each reasoning step rₜ advances the solution, while the corresponding critique cₜ provides a natural-language judgment and score for assessing the correctness of rₜ."
  - [corpus]: Related work on stepwise reasoning (CausalStep, Atomic Reasoner) supports step-level decomposition but does not address unified self-critique.
- **Break condition**: If critiques become uncorrelated with actual step correctness (low F1/specificity), the feedback loop degrades into noise, potentially harming reasoning quality.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Hybrid reinforcement learning with critique-consistency rewards jointly optimizes reasoning quality and self-assessment accuracy.
- **Mechanism**: Three reward signals are combined: (1) reasoning reward based on final answer correctness, (2) critique-consistency reward encouraging the model's final-step critique to match ground-truth correctness, and (3) format reward for structured output. Gradients are selectively backpropagated—critique tokens receive critique-consistency gradients, while all tokens receive reasoning and format gradients.
- **Core assumption**: Critique-consistency at the final answer generalizes to accurate intermediate step critiques; the reward decomposition correctly attributes credit.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize solution quality and self-assessment accuracy."
  - [Section 3.4.1, Eq. 5]: "R_crit(c_T) = 1[s_T = z]... encourages the model to produce critiques consistent with the actual correctness of the final answer."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for this specific hybrid reward design.
- **Break condition**: If reasoning and critique objectives conflict (e.g., high reasoning accuracy but low critique specificity), the model may sacrifice one for the other.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Stepwise critiques serve as dense rewards during training, improving credit assignment over sparse outcome-only signals.
- **Mechanism**: The model's own binary critique decisions s⁽ᵏ⁾ₙ at each step are converted to dense advantages A^dense via normalization across all steps in a group. This augments trajectory-level rewards with fine-grained step-level feedback, providing earlier learning signal.
- **Core assumption**: The model's self-generated critiques are sufficiently accurate to serve as meaningful training signals; self-generated rewards do not reinforce systematic errors.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [Section 3.4.2]: "This extension transforms the optimization from relying solely on sparse trajectory-level rewards to incorporating fine-grained, step-level supervision."
  - [Table 5]: Ablation shows dense reward improves Pass@1 by 1.2% (average), though Pass@8 drops 0.5%.
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus support; related work (PRIME, TANGO) uses process rewards but requires separate models.
- **Break condition**: If early-training critiques are systematically wrong, dense rewards may reinforce incorrect reasoning patterns before self-assessment improves.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
  - Why needed here: STC extends CoT by adding structured critique after each reasoning step; understanding CoT decomposition is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how CoT breaks multi-step problems into intermediate reasoning steps?

- **Concept: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - Why needed here: STC uses GRPO as its RL algorithm, computing advantages via group-level normalization rather than a separate value function.
  - Quick check question: How does GRPO compute advantages differently from actor-critic methods like PPO with a value model?

- **Concept: Process Reward Models (PRMs)**
  - Why needed here: STC can be viewed as unifying a policy model and PRM into a single model; understanding PRM's role in step-level evaluation provides context.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between outcome reward models and process reward models in terms of feedback granularity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B base model -> SFT on synthesized reasoning-critique data -> GRPO with hybrid rewards -> interleaved reasoning-critique generation

- **Critical path**: 1. Synthesize SFT data using base model + strong LLM (GPT-5) for critique generation 2. Filter trajectories where critiques disagree with rule-based verifier 3. SFT training (~500 steps) to establish interleaved generation pattern 4. GRPO training (~1200 steps) with group size G=16, combining reasoning/critique/format/dense rewards 5. Evaluation in both compact and full modes

- **Design tradeoffs**: Single model vs. separate policy+verifier: Reduces deployment complexity but creates tension between reasoning and critique objectives (Table 2 shows tradeoff). Dense rewards: Improve Pass@1 (+1.2%) but slightly hurt Pass@8 (-0.5%); requires hyperparameter tuning (λ_dense=0.5 reported). Full mode vs. compact mode: Full mode provides interpretability at ~2x token cost; performance similar (Table 1).

- **Failure signatures**: SFT phase causes reasoning performance drop (-2.1% Pass@1) as model learns new critique behavior—expected transient. Low critique specificity (TNR) on intermediate steps (Table 2: 58.4-68.3%) indicates unreliable error detection. Format reward failure: Missing or malformed `<critic>`/`<score>` tags indicate training instability.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Format compliance test**: Run inference on 100 samples; verify all output adheres to r₁→c₁→r₂→c₂ structure with valid tags. If <90% compliant, increase format reward weight (λ_format) or extend SFT.
  2. **Critique quality baseline**: Evaluate critique accuracy on held-out set using GPT-5 as judge (following Section 4.2.1). Target F1 >60% and specificity >65% on final-answer critiques before proceeding to GRPO.
  3. **Dense reward ablation**: Train with λ_dense=0 vs. λ_dense=0.5 on small validation split; compare Pass@1/Pass@8. If dense rewards hurt Pass@8 significantly (>2%), reduce λ_dense or implement curriculum scheduling.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Does the Stepwise Think-Critique (STC) framework scale effectively to large-scale models (e.g., 7B+ parameters) and multimodal architectures?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly limit their scope, stating they "validate the concept primarily on a small LLM (e.g., 1.5B parameters)... without experiments on larger LLMs or multi-modal language models."
  - Why unresolved: High training costs restricted the current validation to a 1.5B parameter model, leaving the generalizability of the interleaved training objective to more complex architectures unknown.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful application and evaluation of the STC framework on larger foundation models (e.g., 7B or 70B) and multimodal tasks, demonstrating similar improvements in reasoning and critique consistency.

- **Open Question 2**: How can the trade-off between reasoning capability and critique accuracy be better managed to prevent the degradation of one while optimizing the other?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors observe that "Within a single model, it is challenging to enable strong reasoning and critique capability simultaneously," noting that answer critique performance (F1-score) decreased as reasoning performance improved during GRPO training.
  - Why unresolved: The current hybrid reinforcement learning objective optimizes both tasks jointly, but the gradients or rewards may conflict, leading to a compromise where gains in reasoning come at the cost of self-assessment fidelity.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A modified training objective or reward weighting strategy that achieves monotonic improvement in both Pass@1 accuracy and critique F1-score simultaneously on the same model checkpoint.

- **Open Question 3**: What specific alternative loss functions or training mechanisms can substantially improve the model's critique capability (TNR and F1-score)?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion notes that "The critique capability of our framework still has substantial room for improvement, such as through more effective designs on loss and training mechanisms."
  - Why unresolved: The current critique-consistency reward relies on final-answer correctness, which may be too sparse or indirect to train highly reliable step-level critics.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing the current reward design against novel loss functions (e.g., direct process supervision or contrastive losses) that yield significantly higher Specificity and F1-scores for step-level critiques.

## Limitations

- **Single-model critic limitation**: While STC unifies reasoning and critique in one model, the tradeoff between reasoning accuracy and critique accuracy remains unresolved, with improvements in one often coming at the cost of the other.
- **Critique quality at intermediate steps**: The framework achieves reasonable critique performance on final answers but performance on intermediate steps is substantially lower, raising questions about whether real-time error detection actually improves reasoning trajectories.
- **Data synthesis dependency**: STC's performance depends heavily on the quality of synthetic training data generated by a strong LLM (GPT-5), with the paper not reporting sensitivity to different base models for data synthesis.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The interleaved architecture design (r₁→c₁→r₂→c₂) is clearly specified and implemented; the hybrid reward structure combining reasoning, critique-consistency, and format rewards is well-defined mathematically.
- **Medium confidence**: The improvement in reasoning performance over baselines (Pass@1: 56.4% vs 53.3%) is demonstrated but the extent to which this derives from critique feedback vs. standard RL training is unclear.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that "STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities" is partially supported by critique metrics but the practical impact on reasoning accuracy (particularly Pass@8 improvements) is modest and may not justify the increased inference cost of full mode.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation of critique feedback**: Run STC without using critique scores for dense rewards (λ_dense=0) to determine whether improvements stem from self-critique feedback or general RL training. Compare Pass@1/Pass@8 performance with and without critique-consistency rewards.

2. **Intermediate critique effectiveness**: Instrument inference to measure whether the model actually changes reasoning trajectories based on intermediate critiques. Track correlation between low self-critique scores and subsequent reasoning step quality to validate the feedback loop mechanism.

3. **Generalization to non-mathematical domains**: Test STC on code generation or commonsense reasoning tasks to evaluate whether stepwise self-critique generalizes beyond mathematical problem-solving, where ground-truth verification is more readily available.
