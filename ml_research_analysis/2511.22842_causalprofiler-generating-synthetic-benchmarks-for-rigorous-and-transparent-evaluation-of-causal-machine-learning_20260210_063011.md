core_contribution: This paper introduces CausalProfiler, a synthetic benchmark generator
  for rigorous and transparent evaluation of causal machine learning methods. The
  key challenge addressed is the lack of standardized, diverse, and assumption-aware
  evaluation frameworks in causal ML, where existing benchmarks are often brittle
  and non-generalizable.

# CausalProfiler: Generating Synthetic Benchmarks for Rigorous and Transparent Evaluation of Causal Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22842
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22842
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces CausalProfiler, a synthetic benchmark generator for rigorous and transparent evaluation of causal machine learning methods.

## Executive Summary
CausalProfiler addresses a critical gap in causal machine learning by providing a systematic framework for generating synthetic benchmarks that enable rigorous and transparent evaluation of causal inference methods. The framework allows researchers to specify a Space of Interest (SoI) covering observation, intervention, and counterfactual reasoning levels, then systematically sample synthetic causal datasets from this space. This approach provides coverage guarantees and enables controlled exploration of method behavior under varying assumptions, promoting more reliable and generalizable method development.

## Method Summary
CausalProfiler is a framework for generating synthetic causal benchmarks through systematic sampling of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) based on user-specified Spaces of Interest (SoI). The framework defines three levels of causal reasoning (observation, intervention, counterfactual) and allows researchers to specify parameter ranges and structural constraints for their causal models. CausalProfiler then generates diverse SCMs that satisfy these specifications while ensuring coverage of the defined space. The generated datasets can be used to evaluate causal ML methods across different scenarios and assumptions, providing insights into method robustness and limitations.

## Key Results
- CausalProfiler generates more diverse and realistic SCMs compared to existing benchmarks
- The framework enables deeper insights into method robustness by revealing significant performance variations across different Spaces of Interest
- Experiments demonstrate that CausalProfiler promotes transparent, repeatable, and assumption-aware evaluations of causal ML methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CausalProfiler works by providing a principled approach to synthetic benchmark generation that addresses the fundamental problem of evaluating causal ML methods in a controlled yet realistic manner. By allowing researchers to specify Spaces of Interest that capture their domain requirements and assumptions, the framework ensures that evaluation is both comprehensive and relevant to specific application contexts. The systematic sampling approach guarantees coverage of the specified space, preventing evaluation bias toward particular types of causal structures or data distributions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Structural Causal Models (SCMs)**: Formal representation of causal relationships using directed acyclic graphs and structural equations; needed for generating realistic synthetic causal data
- **Space of Interest (SoI)**: User-defined parameter space specifying constraints and ranges for causal models; needed to ensure evaluation relevance to specific domains
- **Three levels of causal reasoning**: Observation (statistical associations), intervention (do-calculus), and counterfactual (what-if scenarios); needed to comprehensively evaluate causal methods
- **Coverage guarantees**: Mathematical assurances that generated benchmarks span the specified parameter space; needed for unbiased and thorough evaluation
- **Benchmark diversity**: Variety in causal structures, data distributions, and difficulty levels; needed to assess method generalizability

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: SoI specification -> SCM generator -> synthetic dataset -> method evaluation -> performance analysis
- **Critical path**: User defines SoI → CausalProfiler samples SCMs → Synthetic data generated → Causal methods evaluated → Performance metrics computed
- **Design tradeoffs**: Flexibility vs. computational complexity, realism vs. tractability, coverage vs. specificity
- **Failure signatures**: Poor coverage of SoI, unrealistic SCM structures, computational intractability for complex models
- **First experiments**: 1) Generate simple linear SCMs with known ground truth, 2) Compare method performance across varying confounding strengths, 3) Evaluate coverage guarantees by checking parameter distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited comparison with existing benchmarks may not represent the full landscape of causal ML evaluation methods
- Computational complexity for generating synthetic datasets is not thoroughly analyzed
- Potential for overfitting to synthetic benchmarks could limit real-world applicability

## Confidence
- High: The framework's ability to generate synthetic causal datasets and its coverage of the three levels of causal reasoning
- Medium: The claim that CausalProfiler generates more diverse and realistic SCMs than existing benchmarks, as the evidence is limited
- Low: The claim that CausalProfiler enables deeper insights into method robustness, as the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of specific methods

## Next Checks
1. Compare CausalProfiler's performance with a broader range of existing causal ML benchmarks to assess its generalizability
2. Conduct a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of generating synthetic datasets using CausalProfiler for different sizes and complexities of causal models
3. Investigate the potential for overfitting to synthetic benchmarks by evaluating the performance of methods on real-world data after training on synthetic data generated by CausalProfiler
