# Probabilistic Mission Design for Neuro-Symbolic Unmanned Aircraft Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.01439
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01439
- Reference count: 31
- ProMis generates probabilistic mission landscapes quantifying legal navigation compliance under uncertainty

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a neuro-symbolic framework for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) that combines uncertain geospatial data and neural perception with Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs to generate Probabilistic Mission Landscapes. These landscapes quantify the probability that navigation satisfies local flight regulations under uncertainty. The authors demonstrate integration of transformer-based vision models (e.g., ChangeFormer) and Large Language Models for translating natural language requirements into mission specifications. Experiments show ProMis effectively generates interpretable, adaptable mission landscapes across diverse scenarios, handles multi-modal input data, and enables adaptive sampling for runtime efficiency.

## Method Summary
ProMis generates Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PMLs) by resolving Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) over an agent's state space. The system handles inaccurate geospatial data by stochastically sampling map variations to fit probabilistic spatial relation parameters. Large Language Models translate natural language requirements into formal HPLP syntax. The framework integrates OpenStreetMap data, satellite imagery processed by neural models like ChangeFormer, and HPLP inference to produce continuous fields quantifying legal compliance probability.

## Key Results
- Successfully generates interpretable, adaptable mission landscapes across diverse scenarios (urban parks, bay areas, city centers, rail networks)
- Handles multi-modal input data and enables adaptive sampling for runtime efficiency
- Generalizes across environments without local adaptations and supports non-expert operators via LLM integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
ProMis generates a continuous field of legal compliance (Probabilistic Mission Landscape) by resolving Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) over the agent's state space. Instead of binary classification, it models navigation constraints as a logic program where facts are probabilistic distributions (e.g., `distance ~ Normal(μ, σ²)`). It infers the probability $P(c|x)$ that a specific location $x$ satisfies the conjunction of mission rules $c$ by summing over all possible models of the world consistent with sensor data.

### Mechanism 2
The system handles inaccurate geospatial data by stochastically sampling map variations to fit the parameters of the probabilistic spatial relations. Rather than trusting map coordinates as ground truth, ProMis applies a stochastic affine transformation (rotation, translation, scaling) to map features based on an error model. By sampling $N$ variations of the map, it empirically estimates the mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ for spatial predicates like `distance(x, road)`.

### Mechanism 3
Large Language Models (LLMs) enable non-expert operators to define mission parameters by translating natural language into the formal HPLP syntax required for inference. An LLM is few-shot prompted with existing HPLP code examples and instructions. It maps a user prompt to the available spatial vocabulary and outputs executable logic code.

## Foundational Learning

### Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP)
**Why needed here:** You cannot understand ProMis without grasping how logic programs handle uncertainty. Standard logic is binary (True/False); PLP allows facts to have probabilities, enabling the system to reason about "how likely" a rule is satisfied.

**Quick check question:** If `0.7 :: fog` is a fact in the program, and the rule `vlos(X) :- fog, distance(X, op) < 50` exists, how does the probability of `fog` affect the final truth value of `vlos(X)`?

### Monte Carlo Sampling for Parameter Estimation
**Why needed here:** The system doesn't know the exact distance to a road because the map is noisy. It uses sampling to convert geometric uncertainty into distribution parameters.

**Quick check question:** Why is it necessary to sample $N$ variations of the map (Monte Carlo) rather than just calculating the distance once using the map's mean coordinates?

### Neuro-Symbolic Integration
**Why needed here:** The system bridges neural outputs (change detection from images) and symbolic reasoning (logic rules). You need to understand how a neural network's continuous output becomes a discrete or probabilistic symbol.

**Quick check question:** How does the output of the ChangeFormer (a neural network) get converted into a format that the Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Program can use?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Data Layer: OpenStreetMap + Satellite Imagery
Parameter Estimation: Stochastic sampling module + ChangeFormer
Reasoning Core: Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Program inference engine
Interface Layer: LLM + Visualization

### Critical path
Data Acquisition → Spatial Relation Estimation (calculating μ, σ² for `distance`, `over`) → HPLP Construction (populating clauses with parameters) → Inference (solving for P(c|x)) → PML Generation

### Design tradeoffs
- Resolution vs. Runtime: Increasing grid resolution quadratically increases inference queries. Adaptive sampling (Entropy/GP) mitigates this
- Neural vs. Symbolic: Neural perception is dynamic but noisy; Map data is static but potentially outdated. The system must fuse these conflicting sources

### Failure signatures
- Runtime Crash: Usually due to HPLP syntax errors (often from LLM hallucination) or grounding errors in the logic solver
- "Safe" Zone Drift: If the map error model σ is set too low, the PML will be overconfident; if too high, it may mark valid areas as unsafe
- Granularity Loss: If adaptive sampling skips regions with high frequency changes, the interpolated PML will miss narrow legal corridors

### First 3 experiments
1. Validation of Statistical Relations: Query OpenStreetMap for a known area, apply a fixed translation error, and visualize the resulting μ and σ fields for `distance(X, road)`. Verify they match Figure 4
2. LLM Robustness Test: Provide the LLM interface with ambiguous prompts and validate if it correctly maps to the available spatial vocabulary or requests clarification
3. Adaptive Sampling Benchmark: Generate a PML for a complex environment using grid sampling vs. entropy-based adaptive sampling. Compare MAE against ground-truth high-res PML

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
**Can more efficient sampling and inference techniques enable ProMis application in dynamic, real-time scenarios?**
The authors state that application in dynamic scenarios is "limited by its runtime requirements for parameter estimation and inference," explicitly calling for more efficient techniques. A demonstration of ProMis generating updated PMLs at real-time rates (e.g., >1 Hz) within a dynamic simulation while maintaining accuracy would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
**How robust is ProMis when the required uncertainty data (e.g., map accuracy metadata) is missing or sparse?**
The authors note that the probabilistic semantics are "dependent on scenarios where uncertainty data... is provided," identifying this dependency as a limiting factor. Experiments applying ProMis to regions with incomplete metadata using imputation or robust estimation methods, comparing resulting landscape accuracy against ground truth, would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
**To what extent do fine-tuned expert Large Language Models (LLMs) outperform general-purpose models in generating valid ProMis mission specifications?**
The conclusion suggests that the natural language interface "may benefit significantly from developing fine-tuned expert models." A comparative benchmark evaluating syntax validity and semantic correctness between general-purpose and fine-tuned models across a diverse set of operator prompts would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Runtime explosion with dense grids makes real-time application challenging
- Assumed Gaussian translation error model may not generalize across different mapping sources
- LLM integration's robustness and generalization to arbitrary natural language prompts is under-specified

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The framework architecture and integration of neuro-symbolic components (ProMis design, data flow, adaptive sampling methodology) are well-specified and reproducible

**Medium confidence**: The experimental results (runtime analysis, adaptive sampling efficiency) are internally consistent but depend on the proprietary HPLP implementation

**Low confidence**: The LLM integration's robustness and generalization to arbitrary natural language prompts is under-specified

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical relation validation**: Implement the map sampling procedure with controlled translation noise and verify the generated μ and σ² fields match expected distributions for known test geometries

2. **Adaptive sampling benchmark**: Compare MAE of entropy-based adaptive sampling against uniform grid sampling across at least three diverse urban environments to confirm efficiency claims

3. **LLM syntax robustness**: Test the LLM prompt strategy with a battery of ambiguous or edge-case prompts to measure failure rate and identify common error patterns in generated HPLP code
