# Uncertainty Quantification for Data-Driven Machine Learning Models in Nuclear Engineering Applications: Where We Are and What Do We Need?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.17385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17385
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Deep Ensemble and Studentized Residual Conformal Prediction with XGBoost best aligned with analytical solutions for uncertainty quantification in nuclear reactor applications

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning models applied to nuclear engineering, where safety and reliability are paramount. The authors systematically categorize uncertainty sources in both physics-based and data-driven models, demonstrating that data-driven models introduce unique uncertainties including model uncertainty, statistical uncertainty, and approximation error that require specialized UQ methods. Through analytical and realistic SAFARI-1 reactor examples, the study evaluates five key UQ methods and establishes that while all methods performed well in predicting axial flux profiles, Deep Ensemble and Studentized Residual Conformal Prediction showed superior alignment with analytical solutions. The research proposes a tentative VVUQ (Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification) framework that incorporates explainability, interpretability, reproducibility, and applicability metrics to build credibility in ML models for high-consequence nuclear systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comprehensive comparison of five uncertainty quantification methods: Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensemble, Bayesian Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes, and Conformal Prediction. These methods are evaluated through two primary approaches: first, analytical solutions for a simplified reactor model to establish ground truth, and second, realistic SAFARI-1 reactor data for practical validation. The analytical case uses neutron diffusion theory to generate exact solutions for comparison, while the SAFARI-1 case employs actual reactor measurements for axial flux prediction. Each UQ method is implemented and tested for its ability to quantify both epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty) and aleatoric uncertainty (statistical uncertainty), with performance assessed through prediction intervals, coverage probability, and computational efficiency metrics.

## Key Results
- Deep Ensemble and Studentized Residual Conformal Prediction with XGBoost showed the best alignment with analytical solutions among all tested UQ methods
- All five UQ methods performed well in predicting SAFARI-1 reactor axial flux profiles, demonstrating practical applicability
- The study highlights that UQ is essential for building credibility in ML models for high-consequence nuclear systems, with proposed VVUQ framework incorporating explainability, interpretability, reproducibility, and applicability metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of UQ methods in nuclear engineering applications stems from their ability to quantify both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties inherent in data-driven models. These methods work by either Bayesian approximation (capturing model uncertainty through posterior distributions), ensemble approaches (leveraging multiple models to estimate prediction variance), or conformal prediction (constructing statistically valid prediction intervals). The mechanisms succeed because nuclear engineering applications have well-defined physical constraints and measurable outputs, allowing UQ methods to be validated against analytical solutions and real-world data. The combination of rigorous mathematical foundations and practical validation against known reactor behavior creates a robust framework for uncertainty quantification that can be trusted in safety-critical applications.

## Foundational Learning
- Uncertainty Quantification (UQ): The science of characterizing and reducing uncertainties in computational and real-world applications. Needed to build confidence in ML predictions for nuclear safety; quick check: can identify sources of uncertainty in a given ML model
- Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty: Epistemic represents model uncertainty (reducible with more data), while aleatoric represents inherent data variability (irreducible). Needed to properly address different uncertainty types; quick check: can distinguish between model and statistical uncertainty in nuclear reactor data
- Conformal Prediction: A framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals from finite datasets. Needed for reliable uncertainty estimation without distributional assumptions; quick check: can implement prediction intervals with correct coverage probability
- Bayesian Neural Networks: Neural networks with probabilistic weights that capture model uncertainty through posterior distributions. Needed for principled uncertainty quantification in deep learning; quick check: can sample from posterior to generate prediction uncertainty
- VVUQ Framework: Integration of Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification with explainability and interpretability metrics. Needed for comprehensive credibility assessment of ML models; quick check: can map each component to specific nuclear engineering requirements

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Data Preprocessing -> UQ Method Selection -> Model Training -> Uncertainty Estimation -> Validation against Analytical/Real Data -> VVUQ Assessment
Critical Path: Data Input -> UQ Method Application -> Prediction with Uncertainty Bounds -> Validation -> Credibility Assessment
Design Tradeoffs: Computational cost vs accuracy (Bayesian methods expensive but comprehensive), simplicity vs flexibility (conformal prediction simple but less adaptive), and model-specific vs model-agnostic approaches
Failure Signatures: Poor coverage probability indicates underestimated uncertainty, high computational cost limits real-time deployment, and distributional mismatch reduces validity of uncertainty estimates
First Experiments: 1) Compare UQ method performance on synthetic data with known uncertainty; 2) Test coverage probability on safety-critical nuclear parameters; 3) Benchmark computational efficiency for real-time reactor monitoring applications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Potential mismatch between UQ methods and real-world data distributions when test conditions differ significantly from training data
- Computational cost of some methods, particularly Bayesian Neural Networks, may limit practical deployment in resource-constrained settings
- Success on SAFARI-1 reactor data may not generalize to more diverse nuclear engineering applications with different characteristics

## Confidence
- High confidence: The categorization of uncertainty sources and their impact on ML models is well-established and theoretically sound
- Medium confidence: The performance comparisons between UQ methods are reliable for the specific cases studied, but generalizability to other nuclear engineering applications remains uncertain
- Medium confidence: The proposed VVUQ framework represents a logical extension of current practices, though its practical implementation and effectiveness require further validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the five UQ methods on nuclear engineering datasets with significantly different characteristics from SAFARI-1 to assess robustness across diverse conditions
2. Evaluate the computational efficiency of each method in real-time applications to determine practical deployment feasibility
3. Conduct blind validation studies where experts assess whether UQ outputs improve decision-making in nuclear safety analysis compared to standard ML predictions
