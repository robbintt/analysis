# AI-generated Text Detection: A Multifaceted Approach to Binary and Multiclass Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.11550
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11550
- Reference count: 30
- Achieved fifth place in both binary (F1: 0.994) and multiclass (F1: 0.627) tasks in the PAN@CLEF 2025 AI-generated Text Detection competition

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific language models, focusing on binary classification (human vs. AI) and multiclass classification (identifying the specific LLM). The authors propose an optimized neural architecture that replaces token-level features with stylometry features and extracts document-level representations from three techniques: a RoBERTa-base AI detector, stylometry features, and E5 embeddings. They also propose a simpler gradient boosting classifier using stylometric and E5 features for the multiclass task. For binary classification, the optimized architecture achieved a fifth-place ranking with an F1 score of 0.994. For multiclass classification, the simpler architecture also achieved a fifth-place ranking with an F1 score of 0.627.

## Method Summary
The authors developed three architectures: Full Architecture combining RoBERTa-base AI detector, BiLSTM attention, and E5 embeddings; Optimized Architecture replacing BiLSTM with stylometric features (11 dimensions including MTTR, hapax legomenon rate, and burstiness); and Simple Architecture using gradient boosting with stylometric and E5 features for multiclass attribution. The binary classification pipeline processes text through RoBERTa-base detector, applies stylometry feature extraction, and concatenates with E5 embeddings for final classification. For multiclass tasks, the simpler gradient boosting approach proved more effective than neural fine-tuning, achieving better generalization across seven different LLM sources.

## Key Results
- Binary classification achieved fifth place with F1 score of 0.994 using Optimized Architecture
- Multiclass classification achieved fifth place with F1 score of 0.627 using Simple Architecture
- Optimized Architecture outperformed Full Architecture in binary detection (0.994 vs 0.949 F1)
- Simple Architecture significantly outperformed Optimized Architecture in multiclass detection (0.627 vs 0.406 F1)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Replacing token-level perplexity features with stylometric features improves binary AI-text detection while reducing architectural complexity.
- Mechanism: Stylometry captures authorship patterns (vocabulary diversity, sentence structure, word frequency distributions) that differentiate human and AI writing styles more directly than probability-based token features. The 11 selected features (MTTR, hapax legomenon rate, burstiness, etc.) provide discriminative signals about text production patterns.
- Core assumption: AI-generated and human-authored texts exhibit measurable differences in stylistic regularity and lexical diversity that persist across topics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "optimized an existing neural architecture by incorporating stylometric features and achieved fifth place with an F1 score of 0.994"
  - [section 4] "The Optimized Architecture, which incorporated stylometric features and reduced complexity, outperformed the Full Architecture with F1 scores of 0.994 in Task A"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support; neighbor papers focus on transformer-based approaches rather than stylometry specifically.
- Break condition: If AI models are explicitly fine-tuned to mimic human stylometric patterns (e.g., varying sentence length, increasing lexical diversity), these features may lose discriminative power.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: E5 semantic embeddings combined with gradient boosting outperform neural fine-tuning for multiclass LLM attribution.
- Mechanism: E5 embeddings provide task-agnostic semantic representations. Gradient boosting classifiers handle the high-dimensional, non-linear decision boundaries between multiple LLM sources more robustly than end-to-end neural fine-tuning, which may overfit to training distribution specifics.
- Core assumption: Different LLMs produce semantically distinguishable text representations that gradient boosting can partition, even when semantic content is similar.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "developed a simpler gradient boosting classifier that combined E5 embeddings with stylometric features, also achieving fifth place with an F1 score of 0.627"
  - [section 3.2] "By inputting this enriched representation into a gradient boosting classifier, we aimed to enhance the model's ability to perform fine-tuned classification across multiple classes"
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers (e.g., "Mixture of Detectors") similarly explore ensemble and simpler classifier combinations for detection tasks.
- Break condition: If test-time LLMs are unseen during training or if adversarial paraphrasing is applied, semantic embeddings alone may lack attribution specificity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Binary-optimized RoBERTa detectors fail to generalize to multiclass attribution without architectural modification.
- Mechanism: The RoBERTa-base AI detector was pre-trained for binary discrimination (human vs. AI). Extending to seven-class classification requires either fine-tuning with multiclass labels or replacing with architectures that support multiway discrimination from the start.
- Core assumption: Binary detection features do not automatically transfer to fine-grained model attribution; the decision boundaries are fundamentally different tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "The RoBERTa-base AI detector, originally fine-tuned for binary classification, did not effectively extend to the multiclass classification task"
  - [section 4] Full Architecture achieved 0.949 F1 (Task A) but only 0.190 F1 (Task B)
  - [corpus] Limited explicit discussion in neighbors, but "mdok of KInIT" paper similarly addresses both binary and multiclass with distinct approaches.
- Break condition: If a detector is trained jointly on both tasks from initialization with sufficient multiclass data, transfer may succeed.

## Foundational Learning

- **Stylometry and Authorship Analysis**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how features like type-token ratio, hapax legomena, and burstiness quantify writing style is essential to interpreting why they improve detection.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why moving average type-token ratio (MTTR) might differ between human and AI-generated text?

- **Transformer Embeddings (E5, RoBERTa)**
  - Why needed here: The architectures rely on pre-trained embeddings for semantic representation; understanding what these encode informs feature combination strategies.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a general-purpose embedding (E5) and a detector-fine-tuned model (RoBERTa-base AI detector)?

- **Gradient Boosting vs. Neural Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: Task B's success with gradient boosting over neural architectures suggests understanding when classical ML outperforms deep learning is critical.
  - Quick check question: Why might gradient boosting generalize better than neural fine-tuning when training data is limited or class boundaries are complex?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Full Architecture: RoBERTa-base AI detector → BiLSTM attention (token perplexity) → E5 embeddings → Concatenate → Fully connected layer
  - Optimized Architecture: RoBERTa-base AI detector → Stylometry features (11 dims) → E5 embeddings → Concatenate → Fully connected layer
  - Simple Architecture: E5 embeddings → Stylometry features → Concatenate → Gradient boosting classifier

- **Critical path:** Start with Simple Architecture for multiclass attribution; use Optimized Architecture for binary detection. The RoBERTa component is only useful for binary tasks.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Optimized vs. Full: Slightly better performance (0.994 vs. 0.949) with reduced complexity (removes BiLSTM and token-level features)
  - Simple vs. Optimized for multiclass: Simple achieves 0.627 F1 vs. 0.406 F1, but sacrifices binary performance (0.974 vs. 0.994)
  - Assumption: The paper does not report inference speed or memory comparisons; tradeoffs are accuracy-focused only.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Task B F1 drops from ~0.9 (validation) to 0.19–0.627 (test): strong overfitting signal
  - Binary detector applied to multiclass yields near-random attribution (0.19 F1)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce binary classification with Optimized Architecture on validation split to verify 1.0 F1; monitor for overfitting signs.
  2. Ablate stylometry features one at a time to identify which of the 11 contribute most to Task A performance.
  3. Train Simple Architecture on Task B with cross-validation to assess generalization gap before test submission; consider regularization if validation-test gap exceeds 20%.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific architectural modifications or training strategies are required to close the performance gap between binary detection and multiclass model attribution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states that "further exploration is needed to enhance and refine our models for the multiclass classification task."
- Why unresolved: While binary classification achieved near-perfect performance (0.994 F1), the best multiclass attribution score remained significantly lower (0.627 F1), indicating current methods struggle with the complexity of distinguishing between specific LLMs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A unified model architecture that achieves comparable F1 scores (e.g., >0.90) on the multiclass Task B as observed in binary Task A.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why does the optimized neural architecture underperform the simpler gradient boosting classifier specifically for multiclass attribution?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4 reveals that the complex "Optimized Architecture" scored only 0.406 on Task B, whereas the "Simple Architecture" (gradient boosting) achieved 0.627.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the performance difference but does not provide a theoretical or empirical analysis explaining why the simpler approach outperformed the deep learning model in the multiclass setting.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study or loss landscape analysis comparing the neural and gradient boosting models to identify if the neural model is overfitting or failing to capture distinct LLM signatures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can pre-trained binary AI detectors be effectively adapted for multiclass attribution tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.2 notes that the RoBERTa-base AI detector, originally fine-tuned for binary classification, "did not effectively extend to the multiclass classification task."
- Why unresolved: The authors addressed this limitation by removing the component for the multiclass task, leaving the failure mode of transferring binary knowledge to multiclass domains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating a method (e.g., specialized fine-tuning layers) that successfully leverages a binary RoBERTa detector to improve accuracy in the seven-class attribution scenario.

## Limitations
- Binary detection performance achieved in constrained competition setting with undisclosed test distributions, raising real-world generalizability questions
- Substantial performance drop in multiclass attribution (0.627 F1) compared to validation results (~0.9 F1) indicates significant overfitting
- Paper does not report inference efficiency metrics, limiting practical deployment assessment

## Confidence
- Binary detection mechanism (stylometry + E5 embeddings): **Medium confidence** - Strong leaderboard performance but limited ablation analysis of individual stylometric features and no discussion of adversarial robustness
- Multiclass attribution mechanism (E5 + gradient boosting): **Medium-Low confidence** - Performance gap between validation and test sets suggests overfitting, and the approach's effectiveness with unseen LLM models remains unverified
- Binary-to-multiclass transfer failure: **High confidence** - The explicit statement that binary detectors fail for multiclass attribution is well-supported by the 0.19 F1 score and corroborated by similar findings in neighbor papers

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies on the 11 stylometric features to identify which ones contribute most to binary detection performance and whether subsets maintain high accuracy
2. Evaluate model robustness against adversarial paraphrasing and fine-tuning of AI models to mimic human stylometric patterns, measuring performance degradation
3. Test the multiclass attribution system on held-out LLM models not present in the training data to assess generalization beyond the specific model set used in the competition
