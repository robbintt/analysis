# Toward Auditable Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning in Pathology: SQL as an Explicit Trace of Evidence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01875
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01875
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: SQL-based neuro-symbolic framework for pathology with 96.5% accuracy on µ-bench dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that addresses the black-box problem in automated pathology analysis by using SQL queries as explicit traces of evidence. The system combines multi-scale cellular feature extraction with reasoning agents that compose and execute SQL queries over structured feature tables, producing verifiable chains of evidence for diagnostic conclusions. By coupling this SQL reasoning branch with a CNN model and using a Knowledge Comparison Agent to validate findings, the framework generates pathology diagnoses with calibrated confidence and interpretable reasoning traces.

## Method Summary
The framework extracts multi-scale cellular features from pathology images and uses Feature Reasoning Agents to generate SQL queries over structured feature tables. These queries produce quantitative evidence chains that are validated by a Knowledge Comparison Agent against pathological criteria. The system fuses this symbolic reasoning with CNN outputs through a Report Agent to generate final diagnoses. The SQL traces provide transparent links between cellular measurements and diagnostic conclusions, enabling auditable reasoning in pathology image analysis.

## Key Results
- Achieves 96.5% accuracy on µ-bench pathology visual question answering dataset
- Achieves 83.5% accuracy on GADVR dataset
- Demonstrates improved interpretability through SQL trace evidence chains
- Maintains competitive diagnostic accuracy while providing traceable reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages SQL's declarative nature to create explicit, interpretable reasoning traces that connect cellular measurements to diagnostic conclusions. By structuring pathology features into queryable tables, the system enables logical reasoning that can be verified and audited. The neuro-symbolic fusion allows complementary strengths: CNNs excel at pattern recognition while SQL-based reasoning provides logical consistency and interpretability. The Knowledge Comparison Agent adds a validation layer that calibrates confidence based on pathological criteria, creating a closed-loop verification system.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-scale cellular feature extraction: Required for capturing relevant pathology features at different resolutions; Quick check: Verify feature consistency across scales
- SQL query generation for reasoning: Needed to create interpretable evidence chains; Quick check: Validate query logic against pathological criteria
- Knowledge base construction: Essential for validation and confidence calibration; Quick check: Ensure coverage of pathological criteria
- Neuro-symbolic fusion: Combines pattern recognition with logical reasoning; Quick check: Balance contributions of both branches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Image -> Multi-scale Feature Extractor -> Feature Tables -> Feature Reasoning Agent -> SQL Queries -> Evidence Chain
                                           |
                                           v
                                   Knowledge Comparison Agent -> Confidence Calibration
                                           |
                                           v
                                   Report Agent -> Final Diagnosis

**Critical Path**
Multi-scale Feature Extractor → Feature Tables → Feature Reasoning Agent → SQL Queries → Evidence Chain → Knowledge Comparison Agent → Report Agent → Final Diagnosis

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework trades computational efficiency for interpretability, using multi-agent reasoning and SQL query generation that may introduce latency compared to pure CNN approaches. The explicit reasoning traces require additional storage and processing overhead but provide critical auditability for clinical applications.

**Failure Signatures**
- Inconsistent feature extraction across scales may lead to invalid SQL queries
- Knowledge base gaps can cause incorrect confidence calibration
- SQL query generation failures when features don't align with pathological criteria
- CNN-Symbolic fusion conflicts may reduce overall accuracy

**3 First Experiments**
1. Evaluate SQL query validity and interpretability on a held-out validation set
2. Compare confidence calibration accuracy against ground truth pathological diagnoses
3. Measure computational latency of the multi-agent pipeline compared to baseline CNN-only approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Generalizability across diverse pathology domains remains uncertain
- Knowledge base construction and validation details are not fully specified
- Computational overhead may limit real-time clinical deployment
- Performance on rare or complex cases requires further evaluation

## Confidence
- Diagnostic accuracy claims (96.5%, 83.5%): High - Supported by experimental results on benchmark datasets
- Interpretability and traceability benefits: Medium - Demonstrated through SQL traces, but qualitative assessment of clinical utility is limited
- Generalizability across pathology domains: Low - Based on limited dataset scope

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework on additional pathology datasets representing different tissue types and diagnostic challenges to assess generalizability
2. Conduct a clinician study comparing the interpretability and clinical utility of SQL trace evidence against existing explainable AI approaches in pathology
3. Measure and optimize the computational latency of the multi-agent reasoning pipeline for real-time clinical deployment scenarios
