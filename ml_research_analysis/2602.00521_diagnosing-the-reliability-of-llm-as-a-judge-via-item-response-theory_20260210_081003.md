- LLM-as-a-Judge reliability diagnosed using Item Response Theory (IRT) Graded Response Model, with two-phase framework separating prompt sensitivity from true quality assessment

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a two-phase IRT-based framework to diagnose the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems. Phase 1 measures intrinsic consistency by quantifying prompt sensitivity (via coefficient of variation) and measurement error (via marginal reliability), establishing thresholds (CV ≤0.10, ρ ≥0.7) for acceptable reliability. Phase 2 evaluates human alignment by comparing the discrimination breadth and quality perception distributions between LLM and human judges using Wasserstein distance. The framework reveals that reliability varies significantly across tasks—vision tasks show high prompt sensitivity but high reliability, while topical understanding tasks exhibit low reliability. The work provides actionable insights: detailed instructions improve consistency, and rating scale choice affects reliability, enabling more robust LLM evaluation system design.

## Method Summary
The framework fits a Graded Response Model (GRM) to LLM rating data using PyMC with NUTS sampling, treating prompt variations as items and true sample quality as a latent trait θ. Phase 1 computes coefficient of variation (CV) to measure prompt sensitivity and marginal reliability (ρ) to quantify measurement error. If CV ≤0.10 and ρ ≥0.7, Phase 2 proceeds to compare discrimination breadth ratio (θratio) and Wasserstein distance (DW) between LLM and human θ distributions. The approach separates prompt-induced variance from true quality assessment, enabling targeted diagnosis of reliability issues.

## Key Results
- Vision tasks (VIEScore/ImageHub) show high prompt sensitivity (CV≈0.18) but high reliability (ρ≈0.94), while topical understanding tasks (TopicalChat) show low reliability (ρ≈0.52).
- Detailed instructions improve consistency (CV reduced from 0.21 to 0.11) and rating scale choice affects reliability metrics.
- LLMs with broader discrimination ranges (higher θratio) better capture human quality perception, with lower Wasserstein distances indicating stronger alignment.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The IRT framework models LLM ratings as probabilistic responses to prompt variations, isolating true quality (θ) from measurement artifacts. By treating prompts as items with associated difficulty and discrimination parameters, the model separates prompt-induced variance from underlying quality assessment. The two-phase approach first ensures intrinsic consistency (stable θ estimates across prompts) before evaluating human alignment, preventing spurious conclusions about alignment when basic reliability is lacking.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graded Response Model (GRM)**: Extends IRT to ordinal rating scales by modeling category boundaries (thresholds β) and discrimination (α) per prompt; needed to handle multi-level ratings common in LLM evaluation.
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: Ratio of standard deviation to mean for prompt-based θ estimates; quick check: CV < 0.10 indicates prompt-insensitive measurements.
- **Marginal Reliability (ρ)**: Proportion of total variance in θ estimates attributable to true score variance; quick check: ρ > 0.7 indicates acceptable measurement precision.
- **Discrimination Breadth Ratio (θratio)**: Ratio of LLM to human discrimination parameter ranges; quick check: θratio > 1 suggests LLM captures quality differences more finely.
- **Wasserstein Distance (DW)**: Measures distributional distance between LLM and human θ estimates; quick check: DW < threshold (empirical) indicates alignment.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Rating data → GRM fitting → θ estimates → Phase 1 metrics (CV, ρ) → Phase 2 metrics (θratio, DW)
- **Critical path**: LLM ratings → IRT parameter estimation → reliability assessment → alignment evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Binary vs ordinal scales (2PL vs GRM), prompt variation strategy (typo/newline/paraphrase) vs computational cost
- **Failure signatures**: High CV with low ρ indicates fundamental unreliability; high CV with high ρ indicates prompt sensitivity only; missing rating categories break GRM convergence
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Synthetic data test: generate known θ distributions, add prompt noise, verify CV/ρ detection; 2) Scale sensitivity: refit with binary vs 5-point scales on same data; 3) Cross-task validation: apply framework to new benchmark (e.g., code generation) to test generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Anonymized source code obscures implementation details for edge cases (missing rating categories, convergence diagnostics).
- Human θ estimates require raw rating distributions not fully specified across all benchmarks.
- Assumes continuous underlying quality traits, which may not hold for subjective or culturally dependent judgments.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Framework structure, metric definitions, and theoretical interpretation are clearly specified and internally consistent.
- **Medium confidence**: Experimental results demonstrate utility across benchmarks, but generalizability to unseen tasks/judges requires validation.
- **Medium confidence**: Practical guidance supported by ablation studies but may be task-dependent.

## Next Checks
1. Re-implement GRM fitting using PyMC with exact priors/NUTS settings, validate against synthetic data with known parameters.
2. Apply framework to new benchmark (e.g., code generation) to test cross-task generalizability of reliability thresholds.
3. Conduct human evaluation study to verify whether low Wasserstein distance correlates with actual human preference agreement.
