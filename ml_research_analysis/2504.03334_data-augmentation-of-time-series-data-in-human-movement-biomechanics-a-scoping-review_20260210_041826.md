# Data Augmentation of Time-Series Data in Human Movement Biomechanics: A Scoping Review

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.03334
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03334
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: No universally preferred augmentation method; approaches vary by study objectives with physics-based methods ensuring validity but missing soft tissue artifacts.

## Executive Summary
This scoping review comprehensively analyzed data augmentation methods for time-series biomechanical data, identifying 21 relevant publications from 2013-2024. The review found no universally preferred augmentation method, with approaches varying based on study objectives. Physics-based methods (using musculoskeletal models or rotations) ensured biomechanical validity but faced limitations from soft tissue artifacts. Classic methods (adding noise or jittering) were simpler but lacked biomechanical realism. Data-driven methods (GANs, PCA) learned data patterns but were less commonly validated. A key challenge identified was the "synthetic gap" - synthetic data lacking soft tissue artifacts, leading to discrepancies with real measurements. Most studies evaluated augmentation by downstream model performance rather than comparing synthetic to real data.

## Method Summary
The review systematically searched four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, arXiv) using predefined keywords related to biomechanics and data augmentation. From 1,302 initial results, 21 studies published between 2013-2024 were included after screening. The analysis categorized augmentation methods into physics-based (rotations, musculoskeletal models), classic (jittering, warping, window slicing), and data-driven (GANs, autoencoders) approaches. Studies were evaluated based on their augmentation techniques, validation methods, and reported performance improvements in downstream tasks like gait analysis and fall detection.

## Key Results
- No single augmentation method dominates; physics-based methods ensure validity but miss soft tissue artifacts, while classic methods improve robustness without guaranteeing plausibility
- The "synthetic gap" - discrepancies between synthetic and real IMU data due to missing soft tissue artifacts - remains a major challenge affecting downstream model reliability
- Most studies evaluate augmentation through downstream model performance (RMSE, accuracy) rather than direct comparison of synthetic and real signal distributions
- Kinematics predictions benefit from larger datasets while kinetics predictions improve with noise injection to simulate missing soft tissue effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Data augmentation improves downstream model generalization by expanding limited biomechanical datasets.
- Mechanism: Augmentation introduces controlled variability into sparse training data, reducing overfitting by exposing models to a broader distribution of movement patterns without requiring additional data collection.
- Core assumption: The augmented samples preserve biomechanically meaningful patterns that transfer to real-world data distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Most studies evaluated augmentation methods based on downstream model performance, showing generally improved accuracy and generalization across tasks."
  - [section] "The consensus was that data augmentation generally enhances the accuracy and generalization of downstream models across individual tasks."
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper on Error-Guided Pose Augmentation demonstrates targeted generation addressing data imbalance in rehabilitation assessment.
- Break condition: Augmented samples diverge from biomechanically plausible distributions, introducing artifacts that mislead the model rather than regularizing it.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The "synthetic gap" arises from missing soft tissue artifacts in simulated IMU data, creating distributional discrepancies between synthetic and real signals.
- Mechanism: Physics-based and model-generated IMU data assume rigid body attachment, but real sensors attached to skin experience soft tissue movement (wobble, oscillation), particularly at higher velocities and certain body segments (e.g., pelvis).
- Core assumption: Soft tissue artifacts are not random noise but contain systematic, velocity-dependent components that real IMU signals capture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A major challenge identified was the 'synthetic gap' - discrepancies between synthetic and real data due to missing soft tissue artifacts in synthetic data."
  - [section] "Synthetic data often lacks typical soft tissue movement artifacts present in measured data, leading to discrepancies known as the 'synthetic gap' [6,16–18,25]. This gap significantly influences sensor measurements, especially at higher movement velocities."
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus evidence on soft tissue artifacts specifically; corpus papers focus on biomechanical applications rather than signal fidelity issues.
- Break condition: Downstream models trained predominantly on "too clean" synthetic data fail to generalize to the noisier, artifact-laden real IMU signals, especially for kinetics predictions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Kinematics and kinetics predictions respond differently to augmentation strategies due to their distinct relationships with soft tissue artifacts.
- Mechanism: Kinematics predictions benefit from larger datasets (more samples improve angular estimates), while kinetics predictions improve with added noise that approximates soft tissue movement effects, not merely more samples.
- Core assumption: Joint moments are more closely related to accelerations (affected by soft tissue), whereas joint angles face a more complex initial value problem.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Physics-based methods were recommended for biomechanical validity, while classic methods like jittering or warping were suitable for improving robustness."
  - [section] "Kinematics predictions benefit from larger data sets, while kinetics predictions improve with additional noise due to the absence of tissue movements in simulated data."
  - [corpus] Cross-modal diffusion paper suggests learning mappings between modalities (kinematics, GRFs) as complementary observations of shared dynamics.
- Break condition: Applying augmentation strategies optimized for kinematics to kinetics tasks without appropriate noise modeling degrades rather than improves prediction accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Time-series data augmentation fundamentals (jittering, warping, window slicing, magnitude scaling)
  - Why needed here: Classic methods are baseline augmentation strategies; understanding their assumptions helps select appropriate approaches for biomechanical constraints.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why adding Gaussian noise might help kinetics predictions but not kinematics predictions in biomechanical data?

- Concept: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) for time-series synthesis
  - Why needed here: Data-driven methods like GANs (including Wasserstein GANs, TimeGAN) are emerging approaches for learning biomechanical data distributions.
  - Quick check question: What failure mode occurs when a GAN generator produces biomechanically implausible movements that nonetheless fool the discriminator?

- Concept: Musculoskeletal modeling and inverse dynamics
  - Why needed here: Physics-based methods rely on MS models (e.g., OpenSim) to generate biomechanically valid synthetic data; understanding their limitations (simplifications, degrees of freedom) is critical.
  - Quick check question: Why would a musculoskeletal model that tracks joint angles and ground reaction forces still produce "noisy, oscillating joint moments"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw Biomechanical Data (IMU/MOCAP/Force Plates) -> Preprocessing (filtering, coordinate alignment, segmentation) -> Augmentation Pipeline: Physics-based (rotation methods, MS model simulation), Classic (jittering, warping, window slicing), Data-driven (GANs, autoencoders, diffusion models) -> Augmented Dataset -> Downstream Model (LSTM, CNN, MLP variants) -> Evaluation (RMSE, correlation, accuracy) + Synthetic Gap Analysis

- Critical path: Identify the prediction target (kinematics vs kinetics) -> Select augmentation category based on validity/robustness tradeoff -> Validate synthetic data against real data distributions (not just downstream performance) -> Iteratively refine augmentation parameters.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Physics-based: High biomechanical validity but computationally expensive; may still miss soft tissue artifacts.
  - Classic methods: Low computational cost, improve robustness, but do not guarantee biomechanical plausibility.
  - Data-driven: Learn complex distributions but require sufficient real data for training; validation in biomechanics is limited.

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting to "clean" synthetic data (models perform well on synthetic test sets but fail on real data).
  - Systematic prediction errors in specific degrees of freedom (e.g., internal-external rotation) or body segments (e.g., pelvis).
  - Kinetics predictions do not improve despite increased dataset size.
  - Generated movements violate basic biomechanical constraints (e.g., joint limits, non-physical accelerations).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Train identical downstream models on non-augmented, classic-augmented (jittering + noise), and physics-based augmented datasets; evaluate on held-out real data using both kinematic and kinetic metrics.
  2. Soft tissue noise injection: Systematically vary noise levels added to synthetic IMU data and measure the synthetic gap (RMSE between synthetic and real signals) alongside downstream model performance.
  3. Augmentation method ablation: Compare rotation-based, warping-based, and GAN-based augmentation on the same dataset with multiple downstream architectures (LSTM, CNN, MLP) to isolate method effects from model choice.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the relative performances of physics-based, classical, and data-driven augmentation techniques when systematically compared on the same biomechanical datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "a systematic comparison of data augmentation techniques for biomechanics, which is currently lacking, is an important task for future research" to provide guidance on the most effective strategies.
- Why unresolved: The review found that current studies employ various methods based on specific study goals rather than standardized benchmarks, resulting in a lack of direct comparability between techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled study evaluating the three method categories (physics-based, classical, data-driven) using identical input datasets and evaluation metrics to determine relative efficacy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can soft tissue artifacts be effectively modeled and integrated into synthetic IMU data to bridge the "synthetic gap"?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the "synthetic gap" as a major issue and explicitly concludes that "further research is needed to evaluate how soft tissue artifacts can be effectively simulated to ensure a more accurate representation of real-world data."
- Why unresolved: Current musculoskeletal models and simulation methods often assume rigid sensor attachments, failing to replicate the soft tissue movement noise present in measured data, which negatively impacts model reliability.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of augmentation frameworks that include wobbling mass models or noise injection techniques that result in synthetic data statistically indistinguishable from measured data containing soft tissue artifacts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different augmentation strategies distinctly affect the accuracy of kinetic predictions versus kinematic predictions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes a discrepancy where kinematics predictions improve with larger datasets, while kinetics predictions improve with additional noise due to the absence of soft tissue artifacts in simulations.
- Why unresolved: The review highlights that the relationship between augmentation type (e.g., adding noise vs. increasing sample size) and the specific output variable (kinetics vs. kinematics) is complex and not fully understood.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies isolating augmentation variables to measure their specific impact on joint moment (kinetic) error rates versus joint angle (kinematic) error rates.

## Limitations

- No single augmentation method is universally superior, but this finding is based on heterogeneous studies with varying evaluation protocols and performance metrics
- The "synthetic gap" between real and synthetic IMU data is well-described qualitatively but lacks systematic quantitative validation across augmentation methods
- Most studies evaluate augmentation through downstream model performance rather than direct comparison of synthetic and real signal distributions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The general finding that data augmentation improves downstream model performance and generalization on limited biomechanical datasets
- **Medium confidence**: The characterization of the "synthetic gap" and its impact on kinetics predictions
- **Medium confidence**: The recommendation to mix real and synthetic data rather than training solely on synthetic data

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic comparison of synthetic vs. real IMU signal distributions (using metrics like Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or Wasserstein distance) across different augmentation methods to quantify the "synthetic gap."
2. Perform ablation studies on the mixing ratio of real vs. synthetic data during training to identify optimal proportions for different downstream tasks (kinematics vs kinetics).
3. Evaluate augmentation methods on previously untested data-driven approaches (e.g., diffusion models) using standardized biomechanical datasets to assess their performance relative to physics-based and classic methods.
