# FACTS&EVIDENCE: An Interactive Tool for Transparent Fine-Grained Factual Verification of Machine-Generated Text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.14797
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14797
- Reference count: 14
- Presents FACTS&EVIDENCE, an interactive tool for fine-grained factual verification outperforming baselines by 44 F1 points

## Executive Summary
FACTS&EVIDENCE addresses the limitations of existing binary fact verification approaches by providing transparent, claim-level verification with multiple diverse evidence sources. The tool breaks down complex text into atomic claims, retrieves relevant evidence from the web, and uses LLMs to judge factuality while providing rationales for each decision. Users can interactively include/exclude specific evidence sources based on their preferences. Evaluated on the FavaBench dataset, FACTS&EVIDENCE demonstrates significant improvements in detecting factual errors for open-ended generation tasks, empowering users to understand and selectively trust AI-generated content through detailed visualizations.

## Method Summary
FACTS&EVIDENCE implements a multi-stage approach to fine-grained factual verification. First, it decomposes input text into atomic claims using LLM-based analysis. Second, it retrieves diverse evidence sources from the web using multiple search strategies. Third, it employs LLMs to assess the factuality of each claim against the retrieved evidence, generating rationales for decisions. The system then aggregates these claim-level assessments to produce overall credibility scores for the original text. The interactive interface allows users to visualize claim-level credibility scores and selectively include or exclude evidence sources based on their preferences, providing granular control over the verification process.

## Key Results
- FACTS&EVIDENCE outperforms strong baselines by approximately 44 F1 points in detecting factual errors on the FavaBench dataset
- The tool provides transparent, claim-level verification with rationales for each factuality judgment
- Users can interactively select evidence sources, allowing for customized verification based on individual preferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of FACTS&EVIDENCE stems from its fine-grained approach to factual verification. By decomposing text into atomic claims, the system can pinpoint specific factual errors rather than providing binary yes/no assessments. The use of multiple diverse evidence sources increases the likelihood of finding relevant information to verify each claim. LLM-based factuality judgment with rationales provides both accuracy and transparency in the verification process. The interactive nature allows users to leverage their domain expertise by selecting evidence sources that align with their trust criteria, leading to more personalized and reliable verification outcomes.

## Foundational Learning

**Claim Decomposition** - Breaking complex text into atomic, verifiable statements. Why needed: Enables granular factuality assessment at the claim level rather than binary document-level verification. Quick check: Verify that decomposed claims are indeed atomic and independently verifiable.

**Multi-source Evidence Retrieval** - Gathering diverse evidence from multiple web sources using different search strategies. Why needed: Increases coverage and reduces bias from relying on single-source verification. Quick check: Confirm diversity of evidence sources across different domains and perspectives.

**LLM-based Factuality Judgment** - Using language models to assess claim truthfulness against evidence with rationale generation. Why needed: Provides scalable, context-aware verification with explainable reasoning. Quick check: Evaluate consistency of judgments across similar claims and evidence sets.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Text Input -> Claim Decomposition -> Evidence Retrieval (Multiple Sources) -> LLM Factuality Judgment -> Rationale Generation -> Credibility Aggregation -> Interactive Visualization

**Critical Path:** The core verification pipeline follows: Text → Claims → Evidence Retrieval → Factuality Judgment → User Interface. Each stage must complete successfully for the final verification output.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Fine-grained verification vs. computational efficiency (more claims = more processing), multiple evidence sources vs. potential contradictions, LLM-based judgment vs. potential model biases, interactivity vs. interface complexity.

**Failure Signatures:** False negatives from insufficient evidence retrieval, contradictory judgments from conflicting evidence sources, claim decomposition errors propagating through the pipeline, user confusion from overwhelming evidence options.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test claim decomposition accuracy on diverse text types (news, scientific papers, creative writing)
2. Evaluate evidence retrieval coverage and relevance across multiple domains
3. Assess factuality judgment consistency with human annotators on benchmark datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations

**Dataset Dependency:** Evaluation primarily relies on the FavaBench dataset, which may not fully represent real-world diversity across domains and languages.

**LLM Reliability:** The system's accuracy depends heavily on LLM capabilities for both claim decomposition and factuality judgment, introducing potential model biases and inconsistencies.

**User Expertise Requirements:** The interactive features require users to have sufficient expertise to effectively evaluate and select evidence sources, potentially limiting accessibility for non-expert users.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Technical feasibility of claim decomposition and multi-source evidence retrieval is well-established.

**Medium Confidence:** LLM-based factuality judgment system effectiveness demonstrated on FavaBench but requires broader validation across multiple datasets and domains.

**Medium Confidence:** User interface design and interactive features described but not extensively evaluated for usability and user satisfaction.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Dataset Evaluation:** Test FACTS&EVIDENCE on diverse datasets beyond FavaBench, including different domains (e.g., news articles, scientific papers) and languages to assess generalizability.

2. **User Study:** Conduct a comprehensive user study with both expert and non-expert participants to evaluate usability, effectiveness in real-world scenarios, and the impact of interactive evidence selection on verification outcomes.

3. **Error Analysis:** Perform detailed error analysis on cases where FACTS&EVIDENCE fails to detect factual errors or produces false positives, focusing on understanding LLM-based judgment system limitations and claim decomposition accuracy issues.
