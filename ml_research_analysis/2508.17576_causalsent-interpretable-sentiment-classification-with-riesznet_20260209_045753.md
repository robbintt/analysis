core_contribution: This paper presents CausalSent, a method for interpretable sentiment
  classification using causal inference techniques. The core innovation is a two-headed
  neural network architecture that combines RieszNet (for causal effect estimation)
  with standard sentiment prediction, using a shared LLM backbone to simultaneously
  learn classification and causal effects.

# CausalSent: Interpretable Sentiment Classification with RieszNet

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.17576
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17576
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 2-3x lower MAE in treatment effect estimation than prior methods on synthetic IMDB data

## Executive Summary
CausalSent introduces a novel approach to interpretable sentiment classification by combining causal inference techniques with neural network architectures. The method leverages a two-headed network where one head predicts sentiment while the other estimates treatment effects using RieszNet, all built on a shared LLM backbone. This design enables simultaneous learning of classification and causal effects, providing both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into how individual words influence sentiment. The approach demonstrates significant improvements in causal effect estimation accuracy compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
CausalSent employs a two-headed neural network architecture that integrates causal inference with sentiment classification. The model uses a shared LLM backbone to process text, with one head trained for standard sentiment prediction and another head utilizing RieszNet for causal effect estimation. The method applies doubly robust estimation and L1 regularization to improve causal effect accuracy. The architecture can be trained in two ways: simultaneously (both heads optimized together) or in two phases (sentiment head first, then causal head). The approach is evaluated on synthetic IMDB movie review data where treatment words are artificially prepended to reviews to create known treatment effects.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2-3x lower mean absolute error (MAE) in treatment effect estimation compared to prior work
- Demonstrates MAEs of 9.7-22.4% relative to target effects versus 31.2-59.1% from previous methods
- Shows that the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in positive sentiment probability, significantly lower than the naive correlation of +18.4%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by jointly learning sentiment classification and causal effects through a shared representation space. The doubly robust estimation combines outcome modeling with treatment effect estimation, reducing bias from either component. L1 regularization helps identify sparse treatment effects by encouraging zero coefficients for non-influential words. The two-headed architecture allows the model to leverage the same linguistic features for both prediction and causal inference tasks, improving sample efficiency and interpretability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal inference fundamentals**: Understanding potential outcomes framework and treatment effects is essential for interpreting the model's dual objectives. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between ATE and ATT?
- **Riesz representation theorem**: The theoretical foundation for representing causal effects in function spaces, which RieszNet leverages for estimation. Quick check: How does the Riesz representer relate to the causal effect?
- **Doubly robust estimation**: A technique that combines outcome modeling and treatment effect estimation to reduce bias. Quick check: What are the two components that must be correctly specified for doubly robust estimation to work?
- **L1 regularization**: Encourages sparsity in the treatment effect estimates, helping identify truly influential words. Quick check: Why is sparsity desirable in causal effect estimation for interpretability?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
LLM Backbone -> Sentiment Head -> Classification Output
LLM Backbone -> RieszNet Head -> Treatment Effect Output

Critical Path:
Text input → LLM encoding → Shared representation → Both heads process in parallel → Dual outputs (classification + treatment effect)

Design Tradeoffs:
The simultaneous learning approach improves sample efficiency but may introduce interference between tasks. Two-phase training reduces interference but requires more data and computation. Linear heads provide better interpretability but may limit expressive power compared to neural heads.

Failure Signatures:
Poor treatment effect estimation often indicates confounding issues or insufficient regularization. If sentiment classification is accurate but treatment effects are noisy, the RieszNet head may be underfitting. If both fail, the shared representation may not capture causal features effectively.

3 First Experiments:
1. Train the model on synthetic data with a single treatment word and verify it correctly estimates the known effect
2. Compare MAE of treatment effect estimation between simultaneous and two-phase training approaches
3. Test the impact of L1 regularization strength on sparsity and accuracy of treatment effect estimates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a synthetic data generation algorithm be devised that validates Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) estimation without introducing multicollinearities between treatment and confounders?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Subsection 6.5 and Appendix B.1 state the current synthetic pipeline breaks down for ATT because if the treatment word pre-exists, treatment T is no longer independent of confounders X, biasing the direct estimator.
- Why unresolved: The authors note that the current method cancels the benefits of ATT by creating artificial scenarios (prepending unseen words), and a new algorithm is needed to handle natural language conventions where treatment words already exist in context.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validation dataset where the treatment is a naturally occurring word, the confounders are correlated with treatment, and the ground-truth ATT is known and recoverable by the model.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does implementing cross-fitting in the Riesz estimation phase significantly reduce overfitting bias and improve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in treatment effect estimation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Subsection 6.5 lists "Riesz estimation overfitting bias should be mitigated by implementing cross-fitting as in (Chernozhukov et al., 2021)" as a primary future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current CausalSent implementation does not use cross-fitting, leaving it susceptible to overfitting biases inherent in the neural network estimation of Riesz representers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing the MAE of the current simultaneous learning approach against a cross-fitted version on the semi-synthetic IMDB datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would extending the architecture to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) yield more accurate or informative interpretations than the current average treatment effect (ATE) model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Subsection 6.5 suggests extensions for HTE would likely be more informative, and Subsection 6.2 (Table 4) demonstrates that the effect of words like "love" is highly context-dependent (heterogeneous).
- Why unresolved: The current model provides a single scalar estimate (e.g., +2.9%), failing to distinguish between contexts where the treatment acts as a positive sentiment predictor versus a neutral one.
- What evidence would resolve it: An HTE-capable model architecture that successfully estimates varying effects based on linguistic context on synthetic data, outperforming the scalar ATE baseline.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on synthetic IMDB movie review data, raising questions about external validity
- Method demonstrates interpretability gains on only one word ("love"), requiring broader validation across diverse vocabulary
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter choices suggests the method may be brittle in practice

## Confidence
- **High**: Quantitative improvements in treatment effect estimation (2-3x lower MAE)
- **Medium**: Interpretability claims demonstrated on single word analysis
- **Low**: Generalizability to real-world sentiment data beyond synthetic IMDB reviews

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CausalSent on real-world sentiment datasets (e.g., product reviews, social media) with known or estimated treatment effects to assess external validity
2. Conduct ablation studies across diverse vocabulary terms to quantify interpretability gains systematically and identify failure modes
3. Test the method's robustness to varying levels of confounding and effect heterogeneity through expanded synthetic experiments with controlled perturbations
