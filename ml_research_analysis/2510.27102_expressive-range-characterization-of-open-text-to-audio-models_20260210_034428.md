# Expressive Range Characterization of Open Text-to-Audio Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.27102

- Primary result: Novel framework for analyzing text-to-audio model expressive range via acoustic feature PCA visualization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an expressive range analysis framework for evaluating text-to-audio models, adapting techniques from procedural content generation to assess audio generation variability. The authors analyze three open-source models (Stable Audio Open, MMAudio, and AudioLDM 2) by generating 100 samples for each of 50 sound categories from the ESC-50 dataset. Using acoustic features (pitch, loudness, timbre), they quantify and visualize generative output variation through PCA-based scatterplots. Results show that models differ in output diversity and fidelity to reference sounds, with Stable Audio Open generally producing the most variation but not always closest to ESC-50 samples.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs acoustic feature extraction to characterize the expressive range of text-to-audio models. For each of 50 ESC-50 sound categories, 100 ten-second audio clips are generated per model using the prompt format "Sound of [label]". Acoustic features including pitch (f0 via pYIN), loudness (A-weighted RMS), and timbre (13 MFCCs) are extracted from each clip using librosa with specified parameters. Features are augmented with deltas and delta-deltas, then summarized using mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. PCA is applied to the pooled features across all models and ESC-50 references for each label, retaining 95% variance. Total variance (trace of covariance matrix) is computed for each source and normalized to ESC-50 reference to quantify relative output diversity.

## Key Results
- Models exhibit distinct output distributions in acoustic feature space, with Stable Audio Open generally showing the greatest variation
- No single model consistently produces outputs closest to ESC-50 reference samples across all categories
- The framework successfully visualizes and quantifies differences in generative diversity between models
- Total variance normalization reveals relative output diversity compared to reference sound distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by quantifying the acoustic feature space coverage of each model's outputs and comparing this to reference distributions. By extracting perceptually relevant features (pitch, loudness, timbre) and projecting them into a reduced dimensional space via PCA, the method captures the essential variation in generated audio while filtering noise. The normalization to ESC-50 references provides a meaningful baseline for assessing whether models produce appropriately varied outputs that span the space of real-world sounds in each category.

## Foundational Learning
- **Expressive Range Analysis**: A framework from procedural content generation that characterizes the space of possible outputs a generative system can produce; needed to move beyond simple quality metrics to understand model diversity; quick check: visualize output distributions in feature space
- **Acoustic Feature Extraction**: Converting audio into numerical representations (pitch, loudness, timbre) that capture perceptually relevant characteristics; needed as input for quantitative analysis of audio variation; quick check: verify feature dimensions match expected values
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction technique that preserves maximum variance in the data; needed to visualize high-dimensional feature distributions in 2D; quick check: examine explained variance ratio to ensure 95% retention
- **Total Variance Normalization**: Calculating the trace of the covariance matrix and normalizing relative to references; needed to quantify and compare output diversity across models; quick check: verify normalization values are meaningful (e.g., values >1 indicate greater variation than references)
- **ESC-50 Dataset**: Collection of 50 environmental sound classes with 40 examples each; needed as reference distribution for comparison; quick check: confirm class labels match those used in prompt generation
- **Text-to-Audio Generation**: Converting textual descriptions into audio clips; needed as the target system being evaluated; quick check: verify all generated files are valid audio at correct sample rate

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: ESC-50 labels → Text prompts → 3 Models (Stable Audio Open, MMAudio, AudioLDM 2) → 100 audio clips each → Feature extraction (pitch/loudness/timbre) → Statistics aggregation → PCA projection → Scatterplot visualization

**Critical Path**: Data generation → Feature extraction → Statistical summarization → PCA fitting → Visualization/comparison

**Design Tradeoffs**: Using acoustic features captures perceptual qualities but may miss semantic aspects; PCA reduces dimensionality for visualization but may obscure some variation; normalizing to ESC-50 assumes these references represent "true" distributions

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent feature dimensions across clips; PCA explaining insufficient variance (<95%); models producing nearly identical outputs (low variance); reference and generated distributions overlapping completely

**First Experiments**: 1) Generate 5 samples per label per model to verify generation pipeline works; 2) Extract features from 1 sample to confirm feature extraction code; 3) Compute statistics on small subset to verify aggregation pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes ESC-50 represents the "true" distribution of each sound class, which may not hold
- Limited acoustic feature set may miss important semantic or perceptual dimensions
- Model generation parameters (sampling temperature, guidance scale) significantly impact results but are not fully specified
- Normalization to ESC-50 references may not be appropriate if reference set is limited or biased

## Confidence
- Methodology soundness: High
- Comparative analysis validity: Medium-High
- Specific model conclusions: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the analysis using multiple random seeds for each model to establish robustness of the observed output distributions
2. Test whether results hold when including additional acoustic features (e.g., spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate) to assess feature selection sensitivity
3. Compare against a baseline using ESC-50 audio processed through different random augmentations to better understand what constitutes "variation" in this context
