# Probing for Phonology in Self-Supervised Speech Representations: A Case Study on Accent Perception

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.17542
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17542
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: Self-supervised speech representations encode phonological feature-level variations that influence segmental accent perception, with middle-layer features showing the strongest associations with human accent ratings.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether self-supervised speech representations encode phonological feature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. Focusing on three segments ([V], [R], [ú]) uniformly produced by Hindi speakers of English, the authors extract phonological feature probabilities using Phonet and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT and WavLM. Probing analyses reveal that accent strength is best predicted by subsets of pretrained representation features that prioritize perceptually salient phonological features contrasting native and non-native segments. A multinomial logistic regression of segment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings shows strong associations between accent strength and distances from baselines in expected directions. The results demonstrate that self-supervised speech representations implicitly encode linguistically meaningful articulatory-acoustic structure for modeling accent perception using interpretable phonological features.

## Method Summary
The study uses the CSLU FAE corpus with Hindi-accented English segments, extracting phone-level alignments via Montreal Forced Aligner and frame-level representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT and WavLM. Phonet, a bidirectional GRU model, estimates phonological feature probabilities from combined American/Indian English baseline data. Accent strength is predicted using L1-regularized logistic regression and SVM probes trained on segment-averaged representations. SVCCA computes canonical correlations between accent-relevant representation features and Phonet-derived phonological features. Euclidean distances between segments and native/non-native baselines are calculated, with multinomial logistic regression predicting accent ratings from these distances.

## Key Results
- Middle layers of Wav2Vec2-BERT and WavLM achieve weighted-F1 scores of 67-74% for accent classification, outperforming acoustic MFCC baselines.
- SVCCA correlations show accent-relevant representation features prioritize perceptually salient phonological features, with [sonorant] and [approximant] features showing relative weights >1 for contrasting [v]-[V] segments.
- Multinomial logistic regression shows strong associations between accent strength and Euclidean distances from American/Indian English baselines, with expected coefficient directions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A subset of pretrained SSL representation features predicts accent strength better than acoustic MFCC baselines.
- Mechanism: L1-regularized probing classifiers shrink non-relevant β-coefficients to zero, isolating accent-relevant features from high-dimensional representations. Selected subset correlates with phonological feature probabilities.
- Core assumption: SSL representations encode gradient phonological feature information aligning with human perceptual sensitivity to accent.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract confirms subset prediction superiority; section 3.6 details L1 regularization; related work confirms S3Ms encode linguistic structure.
- Break condition: If middle-layer representations don't outperform MFCC baselines, probing approach fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Accent-relevant representation features prioritize perceptually salient phonological features contrasting native vs. non-native segments.
- Mechanism: SVCCA computes canonical correlations between accent-relevant representation subset and independent Phonet-derived phonological feature probabilities. Relative weights >1 indicate feature relevance for accent discrimination.
- Core assumption: Phonet's probabilistic phonological feature encodings accurately reflect articulatory-acoustic properties listeners attend to.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract confirms perceptually salient features show prominent weighting; section 4.3 shows [sonorant], [approximant] features have relative weights >1; [anterior] feature shows unexpected patterns.
- Break condition: If contrastive but perceptually non-salient features show high weighting, perceptual-saliency alignment assumption fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Euclidean distances between segment representations and native/non-native baselines predict accent ratings.
- Mechanism: Multinomial logistic regression of representation-based distances on accent ratings. Greater distance from American English baseline increases odds of strong accent; greater distance from Indian English baseline decreases odds.
- Core assumption: SSL representation space preserves perceptually meaningful geometric relationships.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract confirms strong associations between accent strength and distances from baselines in expected directions; section 4.2 shows odds increase/decrease with distance from American/Indian English baselines respectively.
- Break condition: If distance coefficients show opposite signs or non-significance, perceptual-distance hypothesis fails.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Phonological features (Hayes 2011)**
  - Why needed here: Binary features (e.g., [anterior], [sonorant], [tap]) define segment contrasts. Understanding contrastive vs. non-contrastive features is essential for interpreting probing results.
  - Quick check question: Which features distinguish American English [v] from Hindi-accented [V]?

- **Concept: Self-supervised speech representations (Wav2Vec2-BERT, WavLM)**
  - Why needed here: Extract 1024-dimensional vectors per 20ms frame from specific Conformer/Transformer layers. Layer selection (middle layers perform best) is critical.
  - Quick check question: Why do middle layers show stronger associations with accent ratings than early or late layers?

- **Concept: Probing methodology**
  - Why needed here: Probing classifiers test whether representations encode specific information. L1 regularization enables feature selection; weighted-F1 handles class imbalance.
  - Quick check question: What does a relative weight >1 for a phonological feature indicate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) -> Phonet -> SSL models (Wav2Vec2-BERT, WavLM) -> Probing classifiers (L1-regularized logistic regression, linear SVM) -> SVCCA -> Multinomial logistic regression

- **Critical path**: 1. Forced alignment → 2. Frame-level representation extraction → 3. Segment averaging → 4. Probe training with L1 selection → 5. SVCCA correlation analysis → 6. Distance calculation + regression on accent ratings

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Layer selection: Middle layers (approx. 12-18) optimize accent classification; early layers capture acoustics, late layers capture semantics.
  - Probe type: Logistic regression offers interpretability (β-coefficients); SVM may capture non-linear boundaries but is less interpretable.
  - Baseline datasets: American English vs. Indian English; degree of accentedness in Indian English baseline is unknown (limitation noted).

- **Failure signatures**:
  - MFCC baseline outperforms SSL representations → SSL representations may not encode accent-relevant phonological structure.
  - Contrastive phonological features show relative weights <1 → features may not be perceptually salient to American English listeners.
  - Distance coefficients non-significant or reversed → representation space may not preserve perceptual distances.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce layer-wise probing: Extract representations from all 24 layers of Wav2Vec2-BERT for target segments; train L1-regularized logistic regression probes; verify middle-layer superiority.
  2. Validate phonological feature correlations: Train Phonet on your own American/Indian English data; compute SVCCA correlations between accent-relevant representation subsets and phonological features; confirm [sonorant], [approximant], [tap] show relative weights >1.
  3. Distance-based regression on held-out accent ratings: Compute Euclidean distances from American/Indian English baselines for new CSLU FAE utterances; run multinomial logistic regression; verify expected coefficient signs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Do the interpretable phonological feature patterns identified in segmental SSL representations generalize to prosodic dimensions of accent perception?
- Are the associations between SSL-based segmental distances and accent ratings consistent across different native–non-native language pairs?
- To what extent do uncontrolled suprasegmental factors, such as rhythm, influence the relationship between segmental SSL representations and accent ratings?

## Limitations
- Small target segment set (three segments total) constrains generalizability of phonological feature probing approach.
- Baseline accent distributions unspecified: degree of accentedness in Indian English baseline corpus is unknown.
- Regularization hyperparameters for L1-penalized probes determined via grid search but specific values not reported.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Accent strength prediction mechanism shows strong empirical support through reported weighted-F1 scores (67-74%) and consistent layer-wise probing patterns across segments and models.
- **Medium confidence**: Perceptual-saliency alignment hypothesis has partial support—[sonorant] and [approximant] features show appropriate relative weights, but [anterior] features show unexpected patterns.
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability beyond three studied segments and Hindi-English accent context; results may not transfer to other accent pairs or phonological feature sets.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct perceptual experiment where American English listeners rate salience of phonological features ([sonorant], [approximant], [anterior]) for target segment contrasts. Compare ratings with Phonet-derived relative weights to validate perceptual-saliency assumption.
2. Apply full methodology to different accent pair (e.g., Mandarin-English or Spanish-English) using same CSLU FAE framework. Verify whether similar phonological features emerge as perceptually salient and whether distance-based predictions generalize.
3. Systematically ablate individual dimensions from best-performing middle layers. Measure contribution of each dimension to accent classification performance and phonological feature correlations to identify specific representation features driving observed effects.
