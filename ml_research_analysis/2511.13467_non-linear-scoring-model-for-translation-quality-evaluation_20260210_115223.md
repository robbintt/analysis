# Non-Linear Scoring Model for Translation Quality Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.13467
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13467
- Reference count: 32
- Linear normalization over-penalizes short samples and under-penalizes long ones, creating systematic mismatch with expert judgments.

## Executive Summary
Linear normalization of translation quality metrics systematically over-penalizes short samples and under-penalizes long ones, creating a mismatch with expert judgments. Empirical data from three large-scale translation programs show acceptable error counts grow sublinearly with sample length, following a logarithmic trend. This aligns with psychophysical and cognitive load theories predicting diminishing marginal impact of additional errors. The authors propose a two-parameter model E(x) = a ln(1 + bx) to represent length-dependent tolerance, calibrated from two anchor points via one-dimensional root finding. The model integrates into existing MQM workflows by replacing constant tolerance with a length-dependent function, improving fairness, interpretability, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations, with linear approximation valid within ±20% relative error near the anchor point.

## Method Summary
The paper addresses the mismatch between linear scaling of translation quality metrics and expert judgments by proposing a non-linear tolerance model E(x) = a ln(1 + bx). The method involves extracting anchor point data pairs (sample size, acceptable error count) from elicitation studies, then calibrating the model parameters a and b. For two-point calibration, a one-dimensional root-finding approach solves for b by finding where a specific function equals zero, then computes a directly. For multiple data points, a profiled least-squares optimization using golden-section search finds the optimal b, with a computed in closed form for each b. The model can be implemented using provided Python functions and integrated into existing MQM workflows by replacing constant tolerance with this length-dependent function.

## Key Results
- Linear normalization systematically over-penalizes short samples and under-penalizes long ones
- Acceptable error counts grow sublinearly with sample length, following a logarithmic trend
- The proposed model E(x) = a ln(1 + bx) improves fairness, interpretability, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works because it aligns translation quality evaluation with how humans actually assess longer texts. Psychophysical and cognitive load theories predict that the impact of additional errors diminishes as sample length increases - the first few errors in a long document are more noticeable than errors in an already error-ridden text. This sublinear relationship explains why linear normalization creates systematic biases. By modeling tolerance as a logarithmic function of length, the approach captures this diminishing marginal impact, making error tolerance grow more slowly than sample size. This creates a more accurate reflection of expert judgment patterns and improves the fairness and reliability of quality assessments across different document lengths.

## Foundational Learning
- **MQM (Multi-Dimensional Quality Metrics)**: A framework for systematic translation quality evaluation that breaks down quality into multiple dimensions; needed to understand the context where this non-linear model is applied; quick check: verify MQM uses error counting with length normalization
- **Psychophysical scaling laws**: Principles describing how human perception responds to stimulus magnitude, often following logarithmic relationships; needed to justify why error tolerance should grow sublinearly; quick check: confirm logarithmic perception applies to quality assessment
- **Lambert W function**: A special function used to solve equations involving products of variables and logarithms; needed for calculating fidelity intervals of the non-linear model; quick check: verify the provided formula correctly computes interval bounds
- **Golden-section search**: An optimization technique for finding minima of unimodal functions that doesn't require derivatives; needed for the profiled least-squares optimization when fitting multiple data points; quick check: confirm the optimization converges to the stated coefficients
- **Bisection/Brent's method**: Root-finding algorithms for solving equations numerically; needed for the two-point calibration procedure; quick check: verify the solver finds the correct b value that satisfies the calibration constraints
- **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**: A metric for measuring the fit between predicted and observed values; needed to evaluate and compare different model fits to the empirical data; quick check: calculate SSE for the Institution 1 fit to verify it's approximately 1.55

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Data collection (anchor points) -> Model calibration (root finding/optimization) -> Integration (MQM workflow replacement)

**Critical path:** The essential sequence is: (1) Extract or define anchor point pairs (x, E), (2) Choose calibration method (two-point or multi-point), (3) Run calibration algorithm to obtain parameters a and b, (4) Apply the model E(x) = a ln(1 + bx) in place of linear normalization in the scoring workflow.

**Design tradeoffs:** The two-point calibration offers simplicity and closed-form solutions but requires carefully chosen anchor points that satisfy feasibility constraints. The multi-point least-squares approach provides better fit to empirical data but requires numerical optimization and more anchor points. The logarithmic form balances mathematical tractability with empirical accuracy, though it may not capture all possible non-linear patterns.

**Failure signatures:** If b is fitted on pages but x is input as words without rescaling, outputs will be 250x too large/small. If anchor points imply super-linear or zero-growth tolerance (r not between 1 and ρ), the two-point solver will fail or produce nonsensical results. If the optimization doesn't converge or produces negative parameters, the empirical data may not follow the assumed logarithmic pattern.

**First experiments:**
1. Run the two-point calibration with (1000, 5) and (250, 2) to verify a ≈ 3.688, b ≈ 0.00288
2. Apply the calibrated model to Institution 1 data points and calculate residuals to verify SSE ≈ 1.55
3. Compute fidelity intervals using the Lambert W formula to confirm the ±20% linear approximation bounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical justification rests on psychophysical and cognitive load theories, but direct experimental validation linking these theories to the specific logarithmic error-tolerance relationship is not provided
- The model is calibrated using expert-elicited anchor points from three institutions, but raw data for two institutions is only available as charts, limiting reproducibility
- The model's generality across different translation domains, languages, and quality standards remains untested beyond the described programs

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The mathematical formulation of the non-linear tolerance model and the two-point calibration method are well-defined and reproducible from the provided formulas and pseudocode
- **Medium confidence:** The empirical claim that error tolerance grows sublinearly with sample length is supported by the Institution 1 dataset and aligns with psychophysical principles, but broader validation is limited
- **Low confidence:** The model's performance in real-world MQM workflows (inter-rater reliability, fairness improvements) is asserted but not quantitatively demonstrated in the paper

## Next Checks
1. Digitize the chart data for Institutions 2 and 3 (Figure 2 and Figure 3) to reproduce their calibration curves and validate the model's consistency across different programs
2. Apply the model to an independent dataset of human and AI-generated translations with known quality scores to test its impact on inter-rater reliability and fairness metrics
3. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing MQM scores computed with linear vs. non-linear tolerance functions on the same translation samples to quantify the practical impact of the proposed model
