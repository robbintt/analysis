# Universality of high-dimensional scaling limits of stochastic gradient descent

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13634
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13634
- Reference count: 40
- Main claim: Ballistic phase ODE limits of SGD are universal for coordinate-delocalized initializations, but diffusive phase SDE limits are generically non-universal

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the universality of high-dimensional scaling limits of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for statistical tasks with latent low-dimensional structure. The authors establish that when the loss function depends on data through projections into a fixed-dimensional subspace, the ballistic phase ODE limits of SGD are universal and depend only on the first two moments of the data distribution, provided the initialization and ground truth vectors are coordinate-delocalized. However, they demonstrate that the diffusive phase SDE limits, which describe fluctuations about fixed points of the ballistic dynamics, are generically non-universal even with coordinate-delocalized initializations. This non-universality arises from finite-dimensional corrections to the central limit theorem that are amplified near fixed points.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a rigorous mathematical approach combining quantitative central limit theorems for random low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional product measures with sharp control showing that SGD remains coordinate-delocalized on linear timescales. The analysis leverages recent advances in high-dimensional probability theory to establish universality results in the ballistic phase while identifying mechanisms that break universality in the diffusive phase through finite-d corrections.

## Key Results
- Ballistic phase ODE limits of SGD are universal and depend only on first two moments of data distribution when initialization is coordinate-delocalized
- Diffusive phase SDE limits are generically non-universal due to amplification of finite-d corrections near fixed points
- Coordinate-aligned initializations can break ballistic universality, demonstrating sensitivity to initialization geometry

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The universality in the ballistic phase arises because coordinate-delocalized initializations ensure that random low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional product measures satisfy quantitative central limit theorems, making the dynamics depend only on the first two moments of the data distribution. The non-universality in the diffusive phase occurs because finite-dimensional corrections to these central limit theorems, while negligible during ballistic motion, become amplified near fixed points where dynamics slow down, breaking the universality.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Quantitative central limit theorems** - Needed to establish universality by controlling the convergence rate of random projections; quick check: verify convergence bounds for specific projection dimensions
2. **Coordinate-delocalized initialization** - Critical assumption ensuring uniform distribution across feature space; quick check: measure initialization variance across coordinates
3. **Ballistic vs diffusive phase dynamics** - Understanding the different scaling regimes in SGD limits; quick check: identify transition points between phases in empirical trajectories
4. **High-dimensional probability theory** - Provides mathematical framework for analyzing random projections; quick check: validate concentration inequalities for specific distributions
5. **Low-dimensional projection models** - Framework for analyzing latent structure in high-dimensional data; quick check: verify projection dimension is truly low compared to ambient dimension

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: High-dimensional data → Low-dimensional projection → Loss function → SGD dynamics → Ballistic ODE limit / Diffusive SDE limit

**Critical Path**: The key computational path involves (1) initializing parameters, (2) computing data projections, (3) evaluating loss and gradients, (4) updating parameters via SGD, and (5) analyzing limiting behavior through ODE/SDE approximations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The coordinate-delocalized assumption simplifies mathematical analysis but may not hold in practice; the projection dimension must be small enough for CLT approximations to be valid but large enough to capture meaningful structure.

**Failure Signatures**: Loss of universality manifests as phase-dependent sensitivity to higher moments of data distribution; coordinate alignment in initialization leads to breakdown of universality predictions.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare SGD trajectories with different initialization schemes (delocalized vs aligned) on synthetic data with known low-dimensional structure
2. Measure sensitivity of fixed-point fluctuations to higher moments of data distribution across different projection dimensions
3. Test universality predictions by varying data distributions while keeping first two moments fixed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are primarily theoretical and require empirical validation on real-world datasets
- Coordinate-delocalized initialization assumption may be difficult to verify and maintain in practice
- Non-universality results in diffusive phase are sensitive to specific model parameters and require broader validation

## Confidence
- **Medium-High**: Ballistic phase universality claim appears supported by rigorous analysis using quantitative CLT, though technical assumptions may be difficult to verify in practice
- **Medium**: Diffusive phase non-universality claim is theoretically compelling but would benefit from broader empirical validation across different model families

## Next Checks
1. Implement numerical experiments on synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets to verify the universality/non-universality predictions across different projection dimensions and initialization schemes

2. Test whether the non-universality in the diffusive phase persists when relaxing the coordinate-delocalized assumption, or whether there are alternative conditions that restore universality

3. Investigate whether regularization techniques (e.g., weight decay) or adaptive learning rate schedules can mitigate the non-universality effects in the diffusive phase by suppressing finite-d corrections
