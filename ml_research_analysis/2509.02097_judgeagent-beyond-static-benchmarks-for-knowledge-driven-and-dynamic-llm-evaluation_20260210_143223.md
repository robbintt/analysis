# JudgeAgent: Beyond Static Benchmarks for Knowledge-Driven and Dynamic LLM Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02097
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02097
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: JudgeAgent improves target model accuracy by 4-18% through dynamic evaluation feedback

## Executive Summary
JudgeAgent introduces a novel framework for evaluating large language models that moves beyond static benchmarks by employing LLM agents with context graphs to systematically traverse knowledge structures. The framework addresses critical limitations of traditional evaluation methods, including limited knowledge coverage and difficulty mismatch, through a dynamic, multi-turn interview mechanism that adapts to model capabilities. By generating questions on-the-fly and maintaining a knowledge-centric evaluation approach, JudgeAgent provides more comprehensive assessments of model competencies while demonstrating resilience to data contamination issues that plague static benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The JudgeAgent framework employs a knowledge-driven evaluation approach that combines context graphs with LLM agents to generate dynamic questions tailored to a model's demonstrated capabilities. The system uses a difficulty-adaptive, multi-turn interview mechanism where the evaluator probes the target model's knowledge systematically, adjusting question complexity based on previous responses. The context graph serves as a structured representation of knowledge domains, enabling systematic traversal and question generation that covers knowledge spaces more comprehensively than static benchmarks. This dynamic approach allows the evaluator to identify specific knowledge deficiencies and provide targeted feedback that can improve model performance by 4-18% across various datasets.

## Key Results
- Improves target model accuracy by 4-18% through evaluation feedback across multiple datasets
- Effectively identifies knowledge deficiencies in MedQA, MultiHop-RAG, and QuALITY benchmarks
- Demonstrates strong resilience to data contamination, maintaining evaluation validity even when benchmark questions are exposed during training
- Dynamic scoring mechanism better reflects true model capabilities compared to static benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
JudgeAgent works by replacing static question sets with a dynamic evaluation process that adapts to each model's specific knowledge profile. The framework uses LLM agents to generate questions in real-time based on a context graph that represents knowledge domains, allowing for systematic coverage of the knowledge space. The multi-turn interview mechanism enables difficulty adaptation, where the evaluator adjusts question complexity based on the model's responses, creating a personalized assessment path. This approach overcomes the limitations of static benchmarks by ensuring comprehensive knowledge coverage, matching evaluation difficulty to model capability, and generating fresh questions that reduce contamination risks.

## Foundational Learning

**Context Graphs (why needed: systematic knowledge representation; quick check: can visualize knowledge domains and relationships)**
**Difficulty-Adaptive Evaluation (why needed: match assessment to model capability; quick check: observe performance improvement across difficulty levels)**
**Multi-Turn Interview Mechanism (why needed: comprehensive probing of knowledge; quick check: track question generation and response patterns across turns)**
**Data Contamination Resilience (why needed: ensure evaluation validity; quick check: test performance when benchmark questions are exposed during training)**

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Context Graph -> Question Generation Module -> Multi-Turn Interview Engine -> Dynamic Scoring System -> Target Model

**Critical Path:** The system begins with context graph construction, followed by question generation based on the current knowledge state, then executes the multi-turn interview where each response informs the next question's difficulty and topic, culminating in dynamic scoring that reflects the model's true capabilities.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational overhead of dynamic question generation against the benefit of comprehensive knowledge coverage and contamination resilience. The context graph approach requires upfront knowledge structuring but enables more systematic evaluation compared to random question selection.

**Failure Signatures:** The system may struggle with highly specialized domains where context graph construction is challenging, may generate redundant questions if the graph traversal algorithm is suboptimal, and could face difficulties when evaluating models with very broad but shallow knowledge.

**3 First Experiments:** 1) Validate context graph coverage by comparing generated questions against established benchmark questions. 2) Test difficulty adaptation by measuring performance improvement across interview turns. 3) Assess contamination resilience by exposing target models to benchmark questions during training and comparing evaluation results.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance on non-medical domains remains unclear, as experiments focus primarily on medical knowledge and reading comprehension
- Potential biases in context graph construction and question generation processes are not thoroughly addressed
- Dynamic scoring mechanism's sensitivity to interview duration and question selection strategies requires further exploration
- Data contamination resilience claims are based on limited contamination scenarios and may not generalize to broader pre-training exposure

## Confidence

**JudgeAgent's Knowledge Coverage Advantage:** Medium Confidence
The framework demonstrates improved evaluation comprehensiveness, but the extent of full knowledge space capture requires validation across diverse domains.

**Difficulty-Adaptive Mechanism Effectiveness:** High Confidence
Multi-turn interview approach and difficulty adaptation show consistent improvements in identifying model deficiencies, supported by quantitative results.

**Data Contamination Resilience:** Medium Confidence
Framework performance under contamination conditions is demonstrated, but robustness claims need verification against more extensive contamination scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Generalization Test:** Evaluate JudgeAgent on non-medical domains (mathematics, coding, general knowledge) to assess framework versatility and identify domain-specific limitations in the context graph approach.

2. **Systematic Bias Analysis:** Conduct controlled experiments to quantify potential biases introduced by context graph construction and question generation processes, examining whether certain knowledge structures or topics are systematically favored or disadvantaged.

3. **Extended Contamination Scenario Testing:** Design experiments with varying degrees and types of data contamination (including partial exposure to benchmark questions during fine-tuning) to rigorously validate claimed resilience and identify breaking points in the evaluation framework's effectiveness.
