# Adapting Large Language Models to Emerging Cybersecurity using Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.27080
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27080
- Authors: Arnabh Borah; Md Tanvirul Alam; Nidhi Rastogi

- Primary result: Hybrid sparse-dense retriever achieves 72.7% accuracy on KCV dataset and 92.2% on CWET dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of adapting large language models to emerging cybersecurity threats by introducing a hybrid retrieval-augmented generation system. The proposed approach combines BM25 keyword-based retrieval, FAISS-based semantic retrieval, and regular expression matching for CVE identifiers to improve context grounding and temporal reasoning in threat intelligence tasks. The system demonstrates significant performance improvements over both baseline LLM-only and traditional RAG approaches across two cybersecurity datasets.

The research specifically targets the knowledge retention problem where LLMs struggle to maintain accurate understanding of evolving cybersecurity landscapes. By integrating multiple retrieval methods, the hybrid system can effectively balance keyword precision with semantic understanding while ensuring critical vulnerability identifiers are properly captured. The study provides empirical evidence that this multi-faceted approach significantly enhances LLM performance in cybersecurity applications.

## Method Summary
The core method introduces a hybrid sparse-dense retriever that combines three complementary retrieval techniques: BM25 keyword-based retrieval for exact term matching, FAISS-based semantic retrieval for contextual understanding, and regular expression matching specifically designed to identify CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifiers. This hybrid approach aims to address the limitations of single-method retrieval systems in cybersecurity contexts where both precise technical terminology and broader contextual understanding are required. The system processes queries through each retrieval method independently before combining results to provide enriched context for the LLM, enabling more accurate responses to cybersecurity threat intelligence queries.

## Key Results
- Hybrid model achieves 72.7% accuracy on KCV dataset, outperforming baseline approaches
- Hybrid model achieves 92.2% accuracy on CWET dataset, demonstrating strong performance
- Lower temperature settings improve accuracy in the retrieval-augmented generation process

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid retrieval approach works by leveraging complementary strengths of different retrieval paradigms. BM25 provides high-precision keyword matching essential for technical cybersecurity terminology, while FAISS enables semantic understanding of broader contextual relationships. The regular expression component ensures critical CVE identifiers are captured regardless of their semantic representation. This multi-modal retrieval system addresses the fundamental challenge of balancing precision and recall in cybersecurity contexts, where missing critical vulnerability information can have severe consequences. The combination allows the LLM to access both highly specific technical details and broader contextual relationships necessary for accurate threat intelligence analysis.

## Foundational Learning
**BM25 Retrieval**: A probabilistic ranking function that scores documents based on term frequency and inverse document frequency. Needed for precise keyword matching in technical cybersecurity terminology. Quick check: Verify term frequency calculations correctly handle cybersecurity-specific jargon and abbreviations.

**FAISS Semantic Search**: Facebook AI Similarity Search library that enables efficient similarity search in high-dimensional vector spaces. Essential for capturing semantic relationships between threat descriptions. Quick check: Confirm embedding dimensionality matches typical cybersecurity text characteristics.

**CVE Regular Expressions**: Pattern matching specifically designed to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifiers in text. Critical for ensuring vulnerability references are not missed by semantic methods. Quick check: Test regex patterns against diverse CVE formatting variations.

**Temperature in LLM Generation**: Controls randomness in token selection during generation, with lower values producing more deterministic outputs. Important for balancing creativity with accuracy in security contexts. Quick check: Experiment with temperature values between 0.1-0.7 to find optimal accuracy.

**Embedding Model Selection**: Choice of model for converting text to vector representations significantly impacts semantic retrieval quality. Modest but resource-dependent impact on overall system performance. Quick check: Compare embeddings from different models on cybersecurity-specific benchmark tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> Hybrid Retriever (BM25 + FAISS + Regex) -> Retrieved Context -> LLM Generator -> Final Response

**Critical Path**: The retrieval components form the critical path as they directly impact the quality of context provided to the LLM. BM25 handles keyword precision, FAISS manages semantic relationships, and regex ensures CVE identification. The combined retrieval results feed into the LLM, making retrieval accuracy paramount for final output quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades computational overhead for improved accuracy by combining three retrieval methods instead of using a single approach. This increases resource requirements but provides better coverage of cybersecurity terminology and concepts. The choice of temperature settings represents another tradeoff between deterministic accuracy and generation diversity.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when the hybrid system fails to properly balance the contributions of different retrieval methods, leading to either too much noise (low precision) or missed relevant information (low recall). Embedding model mismatch with cybersecurity domain can cause semantic retrieval failures. Temperature settings that are too high may introduce hallucinations in security-critical contexts.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Conduct ablation studies removing each retrieval component individually to quantify individual contributions
2. Test system performance on temporally distributed datasets spanning multiple years to assess true temporal reasoning
3. Evaluate retrieval accuracy with varying document corpus sizes to understand scalability limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond CVE and threat intelligence datasets remains uncertain
- Performance scaling to larger, more diverse corpora has not been characterized
- Computational overhead of combining three retrieval methods lacks full characterization

## Confidence
High confidence in relative performance improvements of hybrid retriever over baselines, supported by quantitative results across two datasets. Medium confidence in temperature effects and embedding model choice claims, based on limited parameter sweeps. Qualitative claims about improved reasoning lack systematic validation against established benchmarks.

## Next Checks
1. Test hybrid retriever performance on temporally distributed threat intelligence spanning multiple years to assess true temporal reasoning capabilities
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating each retrieval component's contribution to identify potential redundancy or diminishing returns
3. Evaluate system performance under realistic deployment constraints including query throughput, latency requirements, and computational resource limits typical of security operations centers
