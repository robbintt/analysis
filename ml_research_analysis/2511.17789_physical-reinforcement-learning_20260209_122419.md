# Physical Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17789
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17789
- Reference count: 11
- The paper introduces Contrastive Local Learning Networks (CLLNs) as an energy-efficient, fault-tolerant alternative to digital computers for reinforcement learning (RL) tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Contrastive Local Learning Networks (CLLNs) as a novel approach to reinforcement learning using physical analog networks. CLLNs consist of self-adjusting nonlinear resistors that learn through local rules without requiring central processing, offering potential advantages in energy efficiency and fault tolerance compared to traditional digital implementations. The authors adapt Q-learning for these physical networks and demonstrate successful learning on both a simple Markov decision process and a grid navigation task, showing that CLLNs can achieve near-optimal performance while maintaining the benefits of physical computation.

## Method Summary
The approach simulates CLLNs as networks of nonlinear resistors (modeled as MOSFETs) that adjust their conductances based on local voltage and power measurements. The system implements a modified Q-learning algorithm where the network performs inference in a "free" state, then re-imposes previous states to perform contrastive updates in a "clamped" state. State information is encoded as voltages, actions are selected through ε-greedy exploration, and rewards are used to calculate target values for the learning updates. The networks are trained through batches of updates, with output normalization used to handle the non-feedforward architecture.

## Key Results
- CLLN agents successfully learn optimal policies on a 4-state MDP, achieving near-optimal average rewards across trials
- The 3x3 grid navigation task shows the network can learn to reach the goal state efficiently, with performance comparable to digital RL baselines
- The system demonstrates resilience to bounded parameters and non-ideal network topology, maintaining learning capability despite physical constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Local Contrastive Learning
Global gradient descent can be approximated using strictly local measurements of voltage and power dissipation in an analog network. Each edge (resistor) adjusts its conductance ($G_i$) based on the difference between its local power dissipation in a "free" state (input driven) and a "clamped" state (input + label driven). Specifically, $\delta G_i \propto (\Delta V_F^2 - \Delta V_C^2)$. The physical system reliably minimizes power dissipation (co-content) at equilibrium for given boundary conditions, ensuring the contrastive function acts as a valid loss landscape. If the system does not reach equilibrium before measurement, or if component noise obscures the small voltage differences between free and clamped states, the learning signal breaks down.

### Mechanism 2: The "Backtracking" Q-Learning Adapter
Standard Q-learning can be adapted for physical networks by separating inference (forward pass) from the credit assignment (backward pass), which requires temporarily re-imposing the previous state. The system executes an action, receives a reward $R_t$ and next state $S_{t+1}$, and calculates a target label $L_t$. It must then "backtrack"—re-imposing the previous state $S_t$ as input while clamping the output corresponding to the taken action to $L_t$ to trigger the physical weight update. The external control system can buffer the previous state $S_t$ and action $A_t$ long enough to re-apply them after the environment has transitioned to $S_{t+1}$. If the environment transitions faster than the network's relaxation + update cycle, or if the buffer for $S_t$ is cleared prematurely, the learning update cannot be properly applied.

### Mechanism 3: Output Normalization for Recurrent Stability
Subtractive normalization (mean-subtraction) of outputs improves learning capacity in bounded, non-feedforward networks. Instead of training raw outputs to match Q-values directly, the system trains outputs relative to their mean: $L_t = R_t + \gamma[\max(F(S_{t+1})) - \text{mean}(F(S_{t+1}))]$. This removes the constraint on the absolute average voltage, granting the limited dynamic range of the bounded resistors more flexibility. The relevant information for decision making lies in the relative difference between action-values (advantage) rather than their absolute magnitude. If the reward scaling requires output voltages that exceed the physical limits of the circuit (saturation), the normalization scheme cannot compensate.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Q-Learning (Temporal Difference Error)
  - **Why needed here:** This is the high-level algorithm the CLLN approximates. Understanding the "Bellman update" is necessary to interpret why the system must calculate $L_t$ and re-impose $S_t$.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the system calculate the target value $L_t$ for the action just taken?

- **Concept:** Equilibrium Propagation / Energy-Based Models
  - **Why needed here:** The CLLN relies on the physics of the circuit settling into a low-energy state to perform inference. One must grasp that "settling" equals "computation."
  - **Quick check question:** Why must the network reach equilibrium before the "free" and "clamped" states can be compared?

- **Concept:** Analog Circuit Non-Idealities
  - **Why needed here:** The paper notes that parameters are bounded and components can be imperfect. Unlike digital RL, analog physical RL must contend with noise, bias, and saturation.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to the learning signal if the voltage difference between the free and clamped states falls below the component's noise floor?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Environment -> Physical Network (resistors) -> Voltage Outputs -> Action Selection -> Reward/State Update -> State Re-imposition -> Conductance Updates

- **Critical path:** Environment Interaction → Free State Equilibrium → Action Selection → Reward/Next State → **State Re-imposition (Backtrack)** → Clamped State Equilibrium → Conductance Update

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Latency vs. Accuracy: The system must settle to equilibrium for every inference and every update. Faster settling (shorter time constants) reduces accuracy; slower settling increases training time.
  - Batching vs. Plasticity: The paper batches updates every 50 steps to manage external control overhead, but this delays learning feedback.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Voltage Saturation: Outputs hitting the supply rails (0 or 1) indicates reward scaling is too high or the network is insufficiently flexible.
  - Catastrophic Interference: In the non-feedforward network, training one input-output pair degrades performance on others significantly more than in a standard feedforward network.
  - Drift: Without the "clamping" signal, the network parameters might drift due to thermal noise or bias if not actively reinforced.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Verify the Contrastive Gradient: Apply a simple input and label to the simulated CLLN and verify that the conductance change $\delta G$ moves the output closer to the label (manual gradient check).
  2. Stress Test Boundedness: Increase the reward magnitude in the navigation task until the system fails to converge, observing the saturation of gate voltages $V_G$.
  3. Damage Simulation: Remove 10-20% of the edges in the simulation mid-training and observe if the network recovers (retrains) to a near-optimal strategy, validating the fault-tolerance claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What limitations does the non-feedforward architecture of CLLNs impose on the complexity of learnable agent strategies?
- How can learning algorithms be modified to naturally incorporate secondary goals such as power minimization or damage robustness during RL training?
- Can architectures and algorithms be developed to enable on-the-fly recovery in RL tasks after physical damage to network components?
- How can history-storage methods such as eligibility traces or replay buffers be naturally implemented in physical self-learning networks without extensive external control hardware?

## Limitations
- The work demonstrates CLLNs in simulation but has not yet built a physical analog network, leaving uncertainty about real-world performance
- The requirement to "backtrack" and re-impose previous states creates a fundamental mismatch with fast-changing environments
- While bounded parameters are noted as a challenge, the impact on learning capacity and exact failure modes are not fully characterized

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of local contrastive learning is well-supported by mathematical derivation and simulation results
- **Medium Confidence:** The adaptation of Q-learning to physical networks is theoretically sound but relies on ideal state buffering that may be challenging in practice
- **Medium Confidence:** The output normalization technique is supported by experimental results but the specific choice of subtracting the mean could be arbitrary

## Next Checks
1. Build a small-scale physical CLLN (e.g., 4-6 nodes) to verify that the local contrastive learning rule produces the expected weight updates and that the system can reach equilibrium states reliably
2. Systematically vary reward magnitudes and network bounds to map the failure threshold where voltage saturation prevents learning, and test whether alternative normalization schemes improve robustness
3. Simulate targeted damage (removing 10-30% of edges) at various training stages to quantify the network's ability to recover and relearn near-optimal policies, comparing against digital RL baselines
