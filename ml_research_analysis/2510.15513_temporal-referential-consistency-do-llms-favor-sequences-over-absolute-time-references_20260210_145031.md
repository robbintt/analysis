# Temporal Referential Consistency: Do LLMs Favor Sequences Over Absolute Time References?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15513
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15513
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: UnTRaP improves temporal referential consistency by 9.06 percentage points over baselines, addressing LLM bias toward chronological over absolute time references.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TEMP-ReCon, a new benchmark for evaluating temporal referential consistency in large language models, and proposes UnTRaP, a method that aligns event-oriented and time-oriented reasoning pathways. The key finding is that current LLMs systematically favor chronological (event-based) references over absolute temporal references (e.g., dates), leading to inconsistent responses. UnTRaP significantly improves consistency across English, French, and Romanian, outperforming baselines like TSRL and CoTSeLF. The work highlights the need for improved temporal reasoning mechanisms in LLMs for real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The authors create TEMP-ReCon by transforming event-event queries from TEMPREASON into paired queries with absolute and chronological temporal references, each paired with corresponding reasoning pathways. UnTRaP is implemented via LoRA-based supervised instruction-tuning on LLaMA3.1-8B, jointly training both query types under a unified loss that maximizes joint probabilities across event-oriented and time-oriented reasoning paths. The method uses cross-alignment: absolute temporal queries are trained with event-oriented reasoning paths, while chronological queries use time-oriented paths, enabling the model to maintain consistent responses regardless of reference type.

## Key Results
- UnTRaP improves temporal referential consistency by 9.06 percentage points over TSRL and 5.47 percentage points over CoTSeLF.
- All baseline models show negative temporal referential factual deviation for absolute references (e.g., -2.94% to -11.0%), confirming LLM bias toward chronological references.
- Unilateral fine-tuning (training only one reference type) degrades consistency by 29.64 percentage points compared to full UnTRaP.
- The method demonstrates strong generalization across English, French, and Romanian, with +16.02% consistency improvement on Romanian (low-resource) subset.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aligning event-oriented and time-oriented reasoning pathways via supervised instruction-tuning improves temporal referential consistency.
- Mechanism: UnTRaP defines two complementary paths: (1) an event-oriented path (time→event→event) for absolute temporal references, and (2) a time-oriented path (event→time→event) for chronological references. By jointly maximizing P(answer, reasoning_path | query) for both query types under a unified loss (L_UnTRaP), the model learns to traverse a shared latent space regardless of surface temporal reference, reducing divergent predictions.
- Core assumption: The model's internal representations can encode both path types and alignment encourages overlapping activation patterns, reducing reference-specific biases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "UnTRaP... aligns event-oriented and time-oriented reasoning pathways within LLMs."
  - [section 3.2] Equations 4-6 define the unified loss maximizing joint probabilities across paths.
  - [corpus] Related work on temporal reasoning (e.g., TEMPREASON, TGQA) supports multi-path temporal modeling but lacks unified consistency objectives.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs favor chronological references over absolute temporal references, causing referential inconsistency.
- Mechanism: Chronological references (event-based) provide richer semantic context that leverages the model's learned event co-occurrence patterns, whereas absolute time references require precise temporal grounding without associational cues. This asymmetry leads to systematic performance gaps (negative deviation scores for absolute references).
- Core assumption: Pretraining distributions emphasize event sequences over precise timestamp encoding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Findings highlight that current LLMs favor chronological over absolute temporal references."
  - [section 4.2, Table 2] All models show negative EM-based temporal referential factual deviation for absolute references (e.g., -2.94% to -11.0%).
  - [corpus] Limited direct corroboration; corpus papers focus on temporal dynamics broadly, not this specific asymmetry.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bilateral pathway training is necessary; unilateral pathway fine-tuning degrades consistency.
- Mechanism: Training only on absolute references with event-oriented paths (unilateral) creates path-specific overfitting, widening the representational gap when evaluated on chronological references. Joint training enforces cross-path consistency.
- Core assumption: The model does not automatically generalize reasoning strategies across reference types without explicit joint supervision.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2.1, Figure 3] Unilateral fine-tuning reduces temporal referential consistency by 29.64 percentage points vs. UnTRaP.
  - [section 3.2] Final loss combines both Pa and Pc terms explicitly.
  - [corpus] Not directly addressed in corpus papers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal reasoning taxonomy (time-time, time-event, event-event relations)
  - Why needed here: UnTRaP distinguishes event-oriented vs. time-oriented paths; understanding these relation types clarifies why different reasoning sequences are required.
  - Quick check question: Given "Which employer did X work for before 2019?", is this time-event (absolute) or event-event (chronological) reasoning?

- Concept: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA)
  - Why needed here: The implementation uses LoRA-based instruction tuning; understanding rank (r) and alpha parameters is necessary to reproduce results.
  - Quick check question: What happens to gradient updates if lora_r is set too low for complex reasoning tasks?

- Concept: Consistency vs. factuality metrics
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces Temporal Referential Consistency (binary match across references) separate from Temporal Referential Factuality (accuracy); conflating these leads to misinterpretation.
  - Quick check question: If a model answers both query types identically but incorrectly, what is its consistency score? Factuality score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  TEMP-ReCon dataset -> UnTRaP loss module -> LoRA adapter -> LLaMA3.1-8B backbone -> Evaluation pipeline

- Critical path:
  1. Data prep: Convert L3 (event-event) queries from TEMPREASON -> extract temporal anchors -> generate paired queries + reasoning paths
  2. Training: Format as instruction tuples -> joint supervised tuning with L_UnTRaP for 20 epochs
  3. Inference: Generate answers for both query types -> compute consistency (match?) and factuality (exact/F1)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Closed-source models: Cannot apply parameter updates -> method limited to open-weight models (paper notes this explicitly)
  - Unilateral vs. bilateral: Unilateral is simpler but causes 29.64% consistency drop
  - Entity-specific variance: Position entities gain +33.44% consistency; team entities show minimal improvement -> may need entity-aware adapters

- Failure signatures:
  - Low consistency with high factuality deviation -> model has reference bias, not grounded in both paths
  - High factuality but near-zero consistency -> unilateral overfitting
  - Entity-type correlation near zero -> adapter not learning entity-specific patterns (correlation: -0.15)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline replication: Run ICL, Semantic ICL, Semantic CoT on LLaMA3.1-8B with TEMP-ReCon test set -> confirm deviation scores are negative for absolute references.
  2. Ablation: Train with only Pa (unilateral) vs. full L_UnTRaP -> verify 25-30% consistency gap.
  3. Cross-lingual probe: Apply UnTRaP* (multilingual training) on Romanian subset -> check if low-resource language gains hold (reported: +16.02% consistency vs. baseline).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific mechanisms cause UnTRaP to yield disproportionate improvements for "Position" entities while failing to improve performance for "Team" entities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The error analysis notes a 33.44 percentage point improvement for "Position" but a failure to produce significant enhancements for the "Team" entity type, explicitly highlighting the "need for entity-specific adjustments."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the variance in performance across entity types but does not investigate the underlying semantic or structural reasons for the failure on "Team" data.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study analyzing the linguistic features of "Team" queries or a modified loss function designed to handle high-variance entity types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the reasoning path alignment objectives of UnTRaP be effectively applied to closed-source models via in-context learning or RLHF without direct parameter access?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section states that the fine-tuning approach necessitates parameter access, rendering it infeasible for closed-source LLMs, while Appendix E suggests future application via RLHF.
- Why unresolved: The methodology relies on LoRA-based supervised instruction-tuning, and the authors did not test proxy methods (like prompt engineering) for models where gradient access is denied.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of UnTRaP alignment using API-based optimization or specific prompting strategies on models like GPT-4.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does temporal referential consistency transfer to specialized domains such as finance or legal reasoning, or is it dependent on the biographical fact structure of TEMPREASON?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix E explicitly lists "Domain Adaptation" as a commentary, noting that inconsistencies in finance or legal domains can lead to "misinformed clientele" or "legal malpractice."
- Why unresolved: The current TEMP-ReCon dataset is derived from Wikidata biographical entries, which may not capture the complexity of temporal reasoning required in legal statutes or financial market data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results from a version of TEMP-ReCon constructed from legal case histories or financial reports.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to LLaMA3.1-8B, leaving scalability to larger models uncertain.
- Performance variance across entity types (position vs. team) suggests need for entity-specific tuning.
- Reported multilingual gains rely on minimal low-resource testing (Romanian subset only).

## Confidence
- **High**: UnTRaP improves temporal referential consistency over baselines (verified via stated percentage gains and ablation showing unilateral degradation). Temporal referential factual deviation is negative for absolute references across models (supported by Table 2). LoRA-based instruction tuning with r=16, alpha=32 is directly specified and reproducible.
- **Medium**: The mechanism of cross-path alignment (event-oriented vs. time-oriented) driving consistency gains is theoretically sound but relies on unshown internal activation analysis. The reported multilingual gains are plausible but based on minimal low-resource testing.
- **Low**: The exact cause of entity-type performance variance (position vs. team) is not explained. The claim that pretraining data favors event sequences over timestamps lacks direct empirical backing in the paper.

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Test**: Run UnTRaP with multiple LoRA settings (e.g., r=8, 16, 32; alpha=16, 32, 64) and different learning rates to map the stability of consistency gains.
2. **Cross-Model Scalability**: Apply UnTRaP to LLaMA3.1-70B and an open-access decoder-only model (e.g., Mistral-7B) to test if consistency gains scale with model size or architecture.
3. **Adversarial Temporal Probe**: Construct ambiguous temporal queries (e.g., "before/after" with multiple plausible events) and measure consistency/factuality breakdown to test robustness beyond the TEMP-ReCon distribution.
