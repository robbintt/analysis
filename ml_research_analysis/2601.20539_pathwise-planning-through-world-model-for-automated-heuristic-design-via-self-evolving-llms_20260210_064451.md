core_contribution: This paper addresses automated heuristic design for combinatorial
  optimization problems by proposing PathWise, a novel multi-agent reasoning framework
  that formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment
  graph. The core innovation is using a structured entailment graph as stateful memory
  of the search trajectory, combined with coordinated policy, world model, and critic
  agents that enable state-aware planning rather than trial-and-error evolution.

# PathWise: Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20539
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20539
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: PathWise uses structured entailment graphs and coordinated agents to generate stronger heuristics with fewer evaluations than trial-and-error approaches

## Executive Summary
PathWise addresses automated heuristic design for combinatorial optimization by formulating it as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph. The framework uses a structured world model to plan heuristic evolution rather than relying on trial-and-error search, coordinating policy, world model, and critic agents to guide the search process. This planning approach enables more efficient discovery of effective heuristics across diverse optimization problems while reducing redundant evaluations.

## Method Summary
PathWise introduces a novel multi-agent reasoning framework that formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph. The core innovation uses structured entailment graphs as stateful memory of the search trajectory, combined with coordinated policy, world model, and critic agents. These agents enable state-aware planning rather than trial-and-error evolution by generating evolutionary actions, executing heuristic rollouts, and providing routed reflections to guide future decisions. The system operates across diverse combinatorial optimization problems including TSP, KP, CVRP, MKP, OP, and BPP.

## Key Results
- PathWise consistently discovers stronger heuristics using fewer evaluations than baseline approaches
- Achieves faster convergence and better scalability to larger problem sizes
- Shows particular advantages in reducing redundant evaluations and improving generalization across different LLM backbones and problem settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by treating heuristic design as a planning problem rather than random search. The entailment graph provides structured state representation that captures the search trajectory, while the coordinated agent system enables informed decision-making about which heuristics to explore next. The world model predicts heuristic performance, the policy agent selects actions based on predicted outcomes, and the critic provides feedback to refine future decisions. This closed-loop system allows PathWise to learn from its search history and make strategic choices rather than random exploration.

## Foundational Learning
- **Entailment Graphs**: Directed acyclic graphs representing logical relationships between concepts; needed to capture search trajectory and enable structured reasoning about heuristic evolution; quick check: verify graph connectivity and absence of cycles
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Policy, world model, and critic agents working together; needed to enable different perspectives on the search process; quick check: validate agent communication and decision consistency
- **Sequential Decision Processes**: Framework treats heuristic design as a series of connected decisions; needed to enable planning rather than reactive search; quick check: verify state transitions follow expected patterns
- **Heuristic Rollout Execution**: Testing generated heuristics on problem instances; needed to evaluate and compare different heuristic designs; quick check: confirm rollout metrics align with theoretical expectations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Policy Agent -> World Model -> Critic Agent -> Entailment Graph

**Critical Path**: Policy selects action → World model predicts outcome → Heuristic rollout executed → Results fed to critic → Graph state updated → Next policy decision

**Design Tradeoffs**: Structured planning vs. exploration flexibility; computational overhead of world model predictions vs. reduced redundant evaluations; graph complexity vs. search efficiency

**Failure Signatures**: Poor policy decisions leading to local optima; inaccurate world model predictions causing misguided exploration; critic feedback loops creating instability; graph state becoming too complex to navigate effectively

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Single-agent baseline comparison without world model or critic
2. Ablation study removing entailment graph structure
3. Performance comparison across different problem sizes and complexity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on expensive heuristic quality evaluation that remains problem-dependent
- Performance degradation potential on extremely large instances due to exponential search space
- Limited testing of generalization across diverse LLM backbones

## Confidence
- High: Structured planning approach effectiveness and advantages over random evolution
- Medium: Generalization claims across different LLM backbones
- Medium: Scalability claims for extremely large problem instances

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each agent (policy, world model, critic) to quantify their individual impact on performance gains
2. Test the framework on problems with non-stationary evaluation landscapes where optimal heuristics may shift during search
3. Evaluate performance when reducing the number of allowed heuristic evaluations by 50-75%, determining practical limits of efficiency advantages
