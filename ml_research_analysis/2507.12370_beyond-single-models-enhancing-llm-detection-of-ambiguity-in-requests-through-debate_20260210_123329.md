# Beyond Single Models: Enhancing LLM Detection of Ambiguity in Requests through Debate

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.12370
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12370
- Reference count: 19
- Multi-agent debate framework significantly improves LLM ambiguity detection for certain models

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a multi-agent debate framework to enhance large language models' ability to detect ambiguity in user requests. The framework leverages structured debate among multiple LLM agents to identify and clarify ambiguous requests, outperforming individual model baselines for Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B. While demonstrating significant improvements in ambiguity detection rates and consensus building, the approach shows model-dependent effectiveness, with Gemma2-9B actually performing worse with debate. The research suggests that collaborative reasoning through structured debate can augment LLM capabilities for interactive systems requiring ambiguity resolution.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed a multi-agent debate framework where three LLM agents (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, Mistral-7B) engage in structured debate to identify ambiguous user requests. They created a programmatically generated dataset covering numerical, attribute, and spatial ambiguities with 1,200 examples total. Each debate involved agents presenting arguments, building consensus, and reaching conclusions about whether requests were ambiguous. The framework measured performance through success rates, consensus rates, and agreement levels. Experiments compared debate-enhanced detection against individual model baselines across different agent configurations and ambiguity types.

## Key Results
- Debate framework improved ambiguity detection for Llama3-8B (71.7%) and Mistral-7B (76.7%) over individual baselines
- Mistral-7B-led debates achieved the highest success rate of 76.7%, excelling at complex spatial ambiguities
- Debate consensus rate reached 98.3%, with most agreements reached within two rounds
- Gemma2-9B performance degraded with debate, showing model-dependent effectiveness
- Framework particularly effective for spatial ambiguity detection, a challenging domain

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The debate framework works by leveraging diverse perspectives from multiple agents to identify different aspects of ambiguity that a single model might miss. Through structured argumentation and consensus building, agents can surface implicit ambiguities, challenge assumptions, and arrive at more nuanced interpretations. The iterative nature of debate allows agents to refine their understanding and build upon each other's insights, creating a collaborative reasoning process that exceeds individual model capabilities. The high consensus rates indicate that structured debate leads to reliable agreement on ambiguity detection.

## Foundational Learning
**LLM Architecture Basics** - Understanding transformer-based models and attention mechanisms
*Why needed:* To grasp model capabilities and limitations in ambiguity detection
*Quick check:* Can explain self-attention and positional encoding

**Ambiguity Detection Fundamentals** - Recognizing different types of ambiguity (numerical, attribute, spatial)
*Why needed:* To understand what the models are being asked to detect
*Quick check:* Can distinguish between explicit and implicit ambiguity

**Multi-Agent Systems** - Knowledge of how multiple AI agents can collaborate or debate
*Why needed:* To understand the debate framework's collaborative reasoning approach
*Quick check:* Can explain consensus-building in multi-agent systems

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Dataset Generator -> LLM Agents (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, Mistral-7B) -> Debate Manager -> Consensus Evaluator -> Performance Metrics

**Critical Path:**
User request → Dataset → Agent selection → Debate initialization → Argumentation rounds → Consensus building → Ambiguity classification → Performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades computational efficiency (multiple model inferences per request) for improved detection accuracy. Programmatic dataset generation enables rapid experimentation but may miss real-world complexity. Using three agents balances diversity of perspectives with practical resource constraints.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Gemma2-9B degradation indicates not all models benefit from debate
- Spatial ambiguity success may not transfer to other ambiguity types
- High consensus rates could mask underlying disagreements in complex cases
- Programmatic datasets may not capture real user behavior patterns

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Run the debate framework with different agent combinations to identify optimal configurations
2. Test the framework on naturally occurring ambiguous requests from user logs
3. Vary debate parameters (number of rounds, consensus thresholds) to optimize performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains are model-dependent, with Gemma2-9B actually degrading
- Programmatically generated dataset may not reflect real-world ambiguity complexity
- Only evaluated three LLM architectures with modest parameter counts
- Spatial ambiguity examples represent a narrow slice of real-world ambiguity

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Multi-agent debate improves ambiguity detection for certain models (Llama3-8B, Mistral-7B)
- **Medium confidence**: Mistral-7B-led debates achieved highest success rate (76.7%)
- **Medium confidence**: Gemma2-9B performance degraded with debate

## Next Checks
1. Test debate framework across broader range of LLM architectures and parameter scales
2. Evaluate approach using naturally occurring ambiguous requests from real user interactions
3. Investigate impact of varying debate parameters (number of agents, structure, consensus thresholds)
