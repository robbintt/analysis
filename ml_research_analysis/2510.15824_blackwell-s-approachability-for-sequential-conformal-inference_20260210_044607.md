# Blackwell's Approachability for Sequential Conformal Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15824
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15824
- Authors: Guillaume Principato; Gilles Stoltz
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces opportunistic approachability algorithm for adaptive conformal inference, achieving validity and efficiency under distributional drift assumptions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive conformal inference (ACI) using Blackwell's approachability theory. By formulating ACI as a repeated two-player finite game between a learner selecting miscoverage levels and an opponent choosing outcomes, the authors establish theoretical foundations for balancing validity and efficiency in conformal prediction. The key innovation is an opportunistic approachability algorithm that exploits potential restrictions on the opponent's play, such as distributional drift or regime switching, to achieve improved efficiency while maintaining validity guarantees. This work bridges the gap between worst-case validity and practical efficiency in conformal inference beyond exchangeability assumptions.

## Method Summary
The paper formulates adaptive conformal inference as a repeated two-player game where the learner selects miscoverage levels and the opponent chooses outcomes. The opportunistic approachability algorithm uses a calibration-based forecaster to estimate the opponent's actions and adapts its strategy accordingly. The method targets a set of coverage-efficiency pairs, approaching this set under mild assumptions. Theoretical guarantees show asymptotic validity and efficiency in favorable settings where the opponent's action space is restricted. The algorithm provides a principled framework for conformal inference in non-exchangeable settings by exploiting potential structure in how the opponent (data-generating process) operates.

## Key Results
- Establishes theoretical connection between Blackwell's approachability and adaptive conformal inference
- Proposes opportunistic algorithm that exploits restrictions on opponent's action space (drift, regime changes)
- Achieves asymptotic validity while improving efficiency in favorable settings
- Provides conditions under which target coverage-efficiency pairs are approachable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging game-theoretic principles from Blackwell's approachability theory to transform the adaptive conformal inference problem into a strategic interaction. The learner (conformal predictor) faces an opponent (data-generating process) in a repeated game, where the learner's goal is to make the average miscoverage level approach a desired target set. The opportunistic algorithm adapts to potential structure in the opponent's behavior, exploiting cases where the opponent cannot freely choose actions (such as when data exhibits drift or regime changes). This adaptation allows the algorithm to achieve better efficiency than worst-case approaches while maintaining validity guarantees. The calibration-based forecaster component estimates the opponent's likely actions, enabling the algorithm to adjust its strategy dynamically.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Calibration Forecaster -> Action Space Estimator -> Opportunistic Algorithm -> Coverage-Efficiency Target Set

**Critical Path:**
1. Observe outcome and compute empirical coverage
2. Update calibration forecaster with observed data
3. Estimate opponent's restricted action space
4. Select miscoverage level based on approachability strategy
5. Achieve target coverage-efficiency pair asymptotically

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Precision vs. computational efficiency in estimating opponent's action space
- Aggressiveness of efficiency pursuit vs. robustness to model misspecification
- Complexity of target set specification vs. achievable performance

**Failure Signatures:**
- Persistent deviation from target coverage indicates incorrect action space estimation
- Oscillations in coverage suggest miscalibration of the forecasting component
- Suboptimal efficiency may result from overly conservative approach to the target set

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement algorithm on synthetic data with known drift patterns to verify efficiency gains
2. Test sensitivity to misspecification of the opponent's action space
3. Compare performance against standard conformal methods on benchmark datasets with regime changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding practical implementation of the opportunistic algorithm, particularly concerning estimation of the opponent's action space and calibration distribution from limited data. Theoretical guarantees assume knowledge of the target set and optimal action space, which may not be available in practice. The authors acknowledge that empirical validation on real-world datasets is needed to assess practical performance, as the theoretical results rely on assumptions about restricted opponent action spaces that may not hold in real applications.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees require knowledge of target set and optimal action space, which may not be available in practice
- No empirical validation on real-world datasets provided
- Performance depends on accurate estimation of opponent's action space and calibration distribution
- Assumptions about opponent's restricted action space may not hold in many practical settings

## Confidence

**High confidence in:**
- Theoretical framework connecting Blackwell's approachability to adaptive conformal inference
- Mathematical formulation and conditions for asymptotic validity and efficiency

**Medium confidence in:**
- Potential for improved efficiency in non-exchangeable settings
- Theoretical results assuming restricted opponent action spaces

**Low confidence in:**
- Practical applicability without empirical validation
- Performance in real-world settings with complex, unknown data-generating processes

## Next Checks
1. Implement the opportunistic approachability algorithm on benchmark datasets with known distributional shifts or regime changes to evaluate its efficiency gains compared to standard conformal methods.
2. Conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of misestimating the opponent's action space and calibration distribution on the algorithm's performance.
3. Develop practical guidelines for setting the target set and estimating the optimal action space in real-world applications, potentially through cross-validation or domain knowledge incorporation.
