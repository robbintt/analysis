- Introduces Vietnamese Context Search (VCS) benchmark and a modified InfoNCE loss function for Vietnamese information retrieval

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in Vietnamese information retrieval by introducing the Vietnamese Context Search (VCS) benchmark and a novel training objective. The VCS benchmark provides standardized evaluation for Vietnamese embedding models across three tasks: document retrieval, sentence re-ranking, and NLI-based re-ranking. The authors propose a modified InfoNCE loss function that incorporates a (1-p+) term to slow learning as probability increases, showing improved performance over standard InfoNCE across multiple tasks and training methods. The work also includes comprehensive temperature parameter analysis and demonstrates competitive results with a 20M-parameter Vietnamese embedding model.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce the Vietnamese Context Search (VCS) benchmark comprising three distinct tasks: ViMedRetrieve for document retrieval, ViRerank for sentence re-ranking, and ViGLUE-R for NLI-based re-ranking. For the training objective, they propose a modified InfoNCE loss function that incorporates a (1-p+) term, which slows the learning rate as the probability increases, addressing the limitation of standard InfoNCE where learning rates become too slow as probabilities approach one. The method is evaluated across different training approaches and temperature parameters, with τ=0.1 showing optimal performance. A 20M-parameter Vietnamese embedding model is trained using this approach and compared against larger existing models.

## Key Results
- The modified InfoNCE loss function with (1-p+) term outperforms standard InfoNCE across all Vietnamese information retrieval tasks
- Temperature analysis shows τ=0.1 yields superior performance compared to higher values
- A 20M-parameter Vietnamese embedding model trained with the proposed method achieves competitive results compared to larger existing models
- The VCS benchmark provides standardized evaluation framework for Vietnamese information retrieval systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The modified InfoNCE loss function works by addressing the fundamental limitation of standard InfoNCE where the learning rate becomes too slow as the probability of correct classification approaches one. By incorporating the (1-p+) term, the loss function maintains a more consistent learning rate throughout training, preventing premature convergence and allowing the model to continue learning discriminative features. This is particularly important for low-resource languages like Vietnamese where training data may be limited, requiring more efficient use of available information.

## Foundational Learning
- **InfoNCE Loss Function**: Contrastive learning objective that maximizes mutual information between positive samples while minimizing it for negative samples; needed to train effective embedding models for retrieval tasks
- **Temperature Scaling (τ)**: Hyperparameter that controls the sharpness of probability distributions in contrastive learning; critical for balancing gradient magnitudes during training
- **Low-Resource Language Challenges**: Limited training data and lack of standardized benchmarks create difficulties in developing effective NLP models; requires specialized approaches for efficient learning
- **Document Retrieval vs. Re-ranking**: Different tasks requiring different embedding strategies - retrieval needs broad semantic matching while re-ranking requires fine-grained semantic understanding
- **Quick check**: Verify that temperature scaling is properly applied in the softmax calculation of the InfoNCE loss function

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Vietnamese Text -> Tokenizer -> Embedding Model -> Contrastive Loss (Modified InfoNCE) -> Parameter Updates -> Evaluation (VCS Benchmark)

Critical path:
The critical path flows from raw Vietnamese text through the embedding model to the contrastive loss function. The modified InfoNCE loss with (1-p+) term is the core innovation that enables more efficient learning, particularly important for the low-resource Vietnamese language context.

Design tradeoffs:
- Model size vs. performance: 20M parameters chosen as balance between efficiency and capability
- Temperature selection: τ=0.1 selected based on empirical results but may require tuning for different tasks
- Loss complexity: Added (1-p+) term increases computational overhead but provides learning rate benefits

Failure signatures:
- Temperature too high (τ>0.1): Loss becomes too flat, gradients become too small, slow convergence
- Temperature too low (τ<0.1): Loss becomes too sharp, gradients become unstable, training becomes erratic
- (1-p+) term too aggressive: Learning rate may become too slow, preventing effective parameter updates

3 first experiments:
1. Compare standard InfoNCE vs. modified InfoNCE with (1-p+) term on ViMedRetrieve task
2. Perform temperature sweep (τ=0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0) to identify optimal value
3. Evaluate model performance on all three VCS tasks to verify consistent improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalization to other low-resource languages beyond Vietnamese remains untested
- Sensitivity analysis of temperature hyperparameter across different model architectures and dataset scales is limited
- Computational overhead introduced by the modified loss function during training is not quantified

## Confidence
- **High**: Benchmark construction and dataset quality, given clear task definitions and evaluation protocols
- **Medium**: Loss function improvements, as results show consistent gains but lack ablation studies isolating the (1-p+) term's specific contribution
- **Low**: Claims about low-resource language generalization, as the paper only validates on Vietnamese without testing on other low-resource language scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test the modified InfoNCE loss function on at least two other low-resource languages to verify cross-linguistic benefits
2. Conduct an ablation study comparing standard InfoNCE, the modified version, and variants without the (1-p+) term to isolate its specific contribution
3. Perform a systematic sensitivity analysis of the temperature hyperparameter across different model sizes and training dataset scales to establish robust parameter guidelines
