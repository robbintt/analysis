# Punctuation and Predicates in Language Models

## Quick Facts

- This paper investigates the computational role of punctuation tokens in large language models (LLMs) and how models process different reasoning rules.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the computational role of punctuation tokens in large language models (LLMs) and how models process different reasoning rules. Using zeroing-out and interchange intervention techniques across GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma, the authors find that punctuation tokens like periods and question marks serve as necessary and sufficient information carriers in certain layers of GPT-2, particularly in later layers. However, DeepSeek and Gemma show markedly different patterns, with punctuation being necessary in only early layers for DeepSeek and sufficient in only a few layers for Gemma. Beyond punctuation, the study examines reasoning rules such as conditional statements ("if-then") and universal quantification ("for all"). Conditional statements are processed compositionally in early layers and become fixed thereafter, while universal quantification is revisited throughout the network. Layer-swapping experiments reveal that conditional rules are less swappable than universal quantification, suggesting they are more difficult for the model to process. The findings highlight significant model-specific differences in how LLMs handle punctuation and reasoning, offering insights into internal computation organization and reasoning mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The study fine-tunes GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma on the RuleTaker dataset using cross-entropy loss with classification heads, then applies zeroing-out interventions (to test necessity/sufficiency) and interchange interventions (to measure layer-wise processing) on punctuation tokens and reasoning targets. Zeroing-out removes token activations to test necessity and keeps only punctuation tokens to test sufficiency, while interchange interventions swap activations between base and override prompts to compute Interchange Intervention Accuracy (IIA) across layers. Layer-swap experiments test representation transferability by swapping entire layers. The analysis reveals that punctuation tokens in GPT-2 become both necessary and sufficient in later layers, conditional statements are settled early in the network, and universal quantification remains actively processed throughout.

## Key Results
- GPT-2 shows punctuation tokens (period, question mark) becoming both necessary and sufficient in layers 7-11, while DeepSeek and Gemma show much more limited effects
- Conditional statement consequents are processed and bound in early layers (IIA drops sharply by layer 6 in GPT-2), while universal quantification predicates remain actively processed across all layers
- Layer-swap experiments show conditional rules are less swappable than universal quantification, suggesting different computational strategies
- Model-specific differences are pronounced: GPT-2 processes punctuation as aggregation points, while Gemma shows no period interchange effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Punctuation as Information Aggregation Points
- Claim: In some architectures, punctuation tokens (period, question mark) function as information aggregation points where sentence-level content is summarized and stored for later retrieval.
- Mechanism: Information from content tokens is transferred to punctuation tokens in early layers (observed at layer 4-7 in GPT-2). Once aggregated, these punctuation tokens become both necessary (zeroing them destroys performance) and sufficient (keeping only them preserves performance) for downstream reasoning.
- Core assumption: This transfer reflects a learned computational strategy rather than an architectural necessity, given the sharp cross-model differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "for GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma"
  - [section 5.1] "First Period IIA peaks in layer 4" coinciding with "First Sentence IIA finishes its drop" — interpreted as information transfer from sentence to period
  - [corpus] "When Punctuation Matters" (arXiv:2508.11383) documents LLM sensitivity to punctuation variations but does not address the aggregation mechanism directly
- Break condition: If zeroing punctuation in early layers (0-4) does not degrade performance, the aggregation hypothesis does not apply to that model.

### Mechanism 2: Early Binding of Conditional Consequents
- Claim: Conditional statement consequents ("then B" in "if A, then B") are processed and bound early in the forward pass, after which the model becomes insensitive to interventions on these tokens.
- Mechanism: The model resolves the logical implication structure in early-to-middle layers. Post-binding, the representation is fixed and downstream layers operate on the settled interpretation rather than re-reading the consequent token.
- Core assumption: The IIA drop reflects genuine computational closure, not merely representational entanglement that could be probed differently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "conditional consequents being 'settled' early and revisited across all layers" (note: abstract text appears internally contradictory — early settling vs. revisiting; this reading follows the IIA evidence)
  - [section 5.2] GPT-2 conditional IIA: ~50% at layer 1, drops to ~5% by layer 6 and remains low; DeepSeek processes consequent in 4/22 layers
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on conditional binding specifically; mechanism is underexplored externally
- Break condition: If interchange intervention on consequents at mid-to-late layers produces high IIA (>30%), early binding is not the dominant pattern.

### Mechanism 3: Distributed Processing of Universal Quantification Predicates
- Claim: Universal quantification predicates ("are Z" in "all X are Z") remain actively processed across all layers rather than being early-bound.
- Mechanism: The model continuously references or revisits the predicate representation throughout the forward pass, maintaining sensitivity to interventions at any layer.
- Core assumption: Sustained IIA indicates ongoing computation rather than representational redundancy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.2] "for all models, the lowest IIA is still very high, around 40%" and "the model does not 'stop processing' the predicate after some layer"
  - [section 5.2, Figure 5] Layer swap heatmaps show higher interchangeability for universal quantification than conditionals
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on universal quantification layer dynamics
- Break condition: If IIA for universal quantification interventions drops sharply after a specific layer, the distributed processing claim fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Interchange Intervention Accuracy (IIA)**
  - Why needed here: Core metric for measuring whether an intervention successfully transfers logical structure. Without understanding IIA, the layer-wise sensitivity plots are uninterpretable.
  - Quick check question: If IIA is 80% at layer 3 and 10% at layer 8 for the same intervention target, what does this imply about where processing occurs?

- Concept: **Necessity vs. Sufficiency in Ablation**
  - Why needed here: Distinguishes whether a token is required (zeroing hurts) vs. whether it alone carries enough information (non-zeroing preserves). The paper uses both to characterize punctuation.
  - Quick check question: If a token is sufficient but not necessary, what does this imply about redundancy in the representation?

- Concept: **Layer Swap / Transferability**
  - Why needed here: Tests whether layers have specialized functions (low swap tolerance) or shared representations (high swap tolerance). Critical for interpreting the conditional vs. universal quantification differences.
  - Quick check question: Why would conditionals show lower layer swap compatibility than universal quantification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Residual stream blocks -> Intervention target (output of transformer block, input to next). Captures combined attention + MLP effects.
  - Punctuation tokens (., ?) -> Aggregation candidates — tested for necessity/sufficiency.
  - Reasoning tokens -> Consequent tokens in conditionals; predicate tokens in universal quantification.
  - Layer indices -> Model-specific ranges (GPT-2: 0-11, DeepSeek: 0-21, Gemma: 0-16 for 2B variant).

- Critical path:
  1. Fine-tune models on RuleTaker dataset (True/False/Unknown classification).
  2. Run zeroing-out interventions (necessity) and selective non-zeroing (sufficiency) on punctuation tokens across all layers.
  3. Run interchange interventions on reasoning targets (consequent, predicate) across layers, compute IIA.
  4. Run layer swap experiments, compute correlation heatmaps.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Intervention granularity: Paper intervenes at residual block level (macro), not subcomponents (attention heads, MLP). Trades detail for interpretability.
  - Fine-tuning requirement: All models fine-tuned on RuleTaker. Results may not transfer to base models or other reasoning benchmarks.
  - Model selection: GPT-2 (older, smaller) vs. DeepSeek/Gemma (modern, larger). Architectural differences (LayerNorm position, attention type, context length) confound direct comparison.

- Failure signatures:
  - Gemma insensitivity to period interchange: Near-zero IIA across all layers — may relate to distillation training or larger context window.
  - Token dilution effect: Question mark sufficiency degrades when other tokens are also non-zero (Figure 2), suggesting interference in the aggregation signal.
  - Architectural confounds: Cannot attribute GPT-2 vs. Gemma differences to scale alone; training objectives (distillation vs. next-token) differ.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate punctuation necessity/sufficiency for a single model (GPT-2 recommended) on a subset of RuleTaker to validate intervention pipeline. Expected: layers 7-11 show high sufficiency, layers 0-4 show high necessity.
  2. Run interchange intervention on conditional consequents at layers 1, 4, 8, 11. Compute IIA. Expected: monotonic decrease from early to late layers.
  3. Run layer swap for universal quantification (swap layer 5 with layers 0, 10, 11). Compute logit difference. Expected: higher swap tolerance than conditionals.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do LLMs process input components (subjects, adjectives, punctuation) by forming early static summaries reused across layers, or do they remain sensitive to changes throughout the network?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The abstract and introduction explicitly pose this question: "we ask whether LLMs process different components of input... by forming early static summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to changes in these components across layers."
- Why unresolved: Results are mixed—conditional statement IIA drops sharply after early layers (suggesting early "settling"), while universal quantification IIA remains high across all layers (suggesting ongoing sensitivity), leaving the general mechanism unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic interchange intervention studies across a broader range of syntactic and semantic components, combined with subspace analysis to identify whether representations become invariant after certain layers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What architectural or training factors explain the stark model-specific differences in punctuation necessity and sufficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors hypothesize that "this difference is related to the context window size of the models: GPT-2 has the smallest window, followed by DeepSeek and then Gemma, or due to Gemma being a distilled model," but do not test this.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the phenomenon (GPT-2 has 5 layers where punctuation is necessary and sufficient, DeepSeek has 1, Gemma has 0) but does not isolate the causal factor among candidates like context window size, distillation, LayerNorm position, or attention mechanism.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments across model variants that systematically vary context length, training objectives (distilled vs. non-distilled), and architectural components while holding other factors constant.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are the observed differences in interchange intervention accuracy (IIA) patterns specific to reasoning tasks or general to syntactic processing?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 6.1 states: "Although we did find differences in IIA between different part-of-sentence targets, it is hard to know to what extent our results apply to syntactic processing of tokens in general, or to reasoning specifically."
- Why unresolved: The experiments fine-tune models on the RuleTaker reasoning dataset and intervene on reasoning-relevant tokens (consequents, predicates), conflating syntactic role with reasoning function.
- What evidence would resolve it: Parallel experiments on non-reasoning tasks with identical syntactic structures (e.g., "All blue things are nice" in a pure classification vs. logical inference context) to disentangle syntactic from reasoning-specific processing.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Do the necessity and sufficiency patterns observed in fine-tuned models generalize to pre-trained models without task-specific adaptation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All models are fine-tuned on RuleTaker (GPT-2 with full parameter training, Gemma and DeepSeek with LoRA). The paper does not investigate whether punctuation's computational role emerges from pre-training or is induced by fine-tuning on structured reasoning data.
- Why unresolved: Fine-tuning may cause models to develop specialized mechanisms (e.g., using punctuation as reasoning boundary markers) that do not exist in pre-trained checkpoints.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of zeroing-out and interchange interventions on pre-trained model checkpoints without fine-tuning, using natural language prompts that elicit similar reasoning behavior.

## Limitations
- The fine-tuning procedure is underspecified, lacking details on learning rates, epochs, batch sizes, and LoRA hyperparameters, creating uncertainty about whether reported behaviors reflect inherent architectural properties or training artifacts.
- The model selection creates unresolvable confounds: GPT-2 (small, pre-trained on next-token prediction) is compared against DeepSeek and Gemma (larger, fine-tuned with distillation objectives), making it impossible to isolate whether observed differences stem from scale, training method, or architectural choices.
- The interchange intervention methodology cannot definitively distinguish between genuine computational processing and representational redundancy or correlation-based patterns.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: GPT-2 shows punctuation tokens becoming both necessary and sufficient in layers 7-11, with necessity appearing earlier (layers 0-4) and sufficiency later; conditional consequents in GPT-2 show sharp IIA drops by layer 6, remaining low thereafter; universal quantification predicates maintain high IIA (~40%+) across all layers in all models.
- Medium Confidence: The interpretation of period IIA peaking at layer 4 as information aggregation from sentences; Gemma's near-zero IIA for period interchange being attributable to distillation training or larger context window.
- Low Confidence: The claim that punctuation tokens function as "information aggregation points" where sentence-level content is summarized; that DeepSeek's early-layer necessity pattern reflects a fundamentally different computational strategy versus GPT-2's later sufficiency.

## Next Checks
1. **Zeroing-out replication on subsampled RuleTaker**: Run necessity/sufficiency experiments on 100 random RuleTaker samples across layers 0-11 for GPT-2 only. Verify that period sufficiency peaks at layers 7-11 while necessity appears earlier at layers 0-4. This isolates the intervention pipeline from model-specific confounds.

2. **Conditional IIA layer-by-layer validation**: For GPT-2, run interchange interventions on conditional consequents at layers 1, 4, 8, and 11 with 50 base/override pairs each. Compute IIA at each layer. Confirm monotonic decrease from ~50% at layer 1 to ~5% at layer 11, validating the early-binding hypothesis.

3. **Cross-model conditional vs. universal swap comparison**: For all three models, run layer swap experiments (swap layers 0-11 with layer 5) for both conditional consequents and universal quantification predicates. Compute logit difference for correct class. Verify that conditionals show consistently lower swap tolerance than universal quantification, confirming the compositional versus distributed processing distinction.
