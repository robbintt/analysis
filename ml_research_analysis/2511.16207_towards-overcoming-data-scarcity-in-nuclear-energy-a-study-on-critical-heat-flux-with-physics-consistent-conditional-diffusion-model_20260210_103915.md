# Towards Overcoming Data Scarcity in Nuclear Energy: A Study on Critical Heat Flux with Physics-consistent Conditional Diffusion Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16207
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Diffusion models successfully generate synthetic CHF data with 6.8% mean relative error and maintain physical consistency

## Executive Summary
This study addresses data scarcity in nuclear energy applications by developing diffusion models (DMs) and conditional diffusion models (CDMs) for generating synthetic critical heat flux (CHF) data. Using a public dataset of 24,579 CHF measurements, the models learn the joint distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and CHF, with the CDM specifically designed to generate CHF values under user-specified conditions. Both models successfully capture statistical properties and correlations in the original dataset while maintaining physical consistency through validation against theoretical models.

## Method Summary
The researchers trained diffusion models on a public dataset containing 24,579 CHF measurements, developing both a standard DM to learn the joint distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and CHF, and a CDM to generate CHF values under specific conditions. The models were evaluated on their ability to reproduce statistical properties, maintain physical consistency, and quantify uncertainty. Performance was measured using mean relative error and relative standard deviation metrics, with physical validation against theoretical models for outlet equilibrium quality.

## Key Results
- CDM achieves mean relative error of 6.8% when predicting CHF values under specified conditions
- Generated samples show low variability with mean relative standard deviation of 4.40%
- Generated outlet equilibrium quality values maintain proper relationships with thermal-hydraulic parameters
- Both DM and CDM successfully capture statistical properties and correlations in the original dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The diffusion model framework effectively learns the complex, high-dimensional distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and CHF data through iterative denoising processes. By training on the joint distribution, the model captures intricate correlations between parameters that traditional statistical methods might miss. The conditional variant extends this capability by allowing generation of physically consistent CHF values for specific operating conditions, addressing the practical need for targeted data augmentation in nuclear reactor design and safety analysis.

## Foundational Learning
- Diffusion models: Why needed - learn complex distributions without requiring explicit likelihood functions; Quick check - verify training converges and generates realistic samples
- Conditional generation: Why needed - enable targeted data creation for specific operating scenarios; Quick check - confirm generated values match specified conditions
- Uncertainty quantification: Why needed - assess reliability of synthetic data for safety-critical applications; Quick check - validate relative standard deviation aligns with expected variability
- Physical consistency validation: Why needed - ensure generated data respects fundamental physical laws; Quick check - compare against established theoretical models

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input parameters -> Diffusion model backbone -> Noise prediction -> Denoising steps -> Output CHF values

Critical Path: The core denoising process operates through T iterative steps where at each step t, the model predicts noise ε_θ(x_t, t, c) based on current noisy sample x_t and condition c, then updates to x_{t-1} using the reverse process formula.

Design Tradeoffs: The model balances between generation quality (requiring more denoising steps) and computational efficiency, with typical implementations using 1000-2000 steps. The conditional formulation adds complexity but enables practical application for specific scenarios.

Failure Signatures: Poor physical consistency in generated samples, high relative standard deviation indicating unstable generation, or systematic bias in CHF predictions under certain conditions.

First Experiments: 1) Generate samples with known conditions and verify prediction accuracy, 2) Test physical consistency of generated outlet equilibrium quality values, 3) Evaluate uncertainty quantification by generating multiple samples under identical conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Small training dataset size (24,579 points) may limit generalizability to extreme conditions
- No exploration of distribution shifts between training and deployment environments
- Limited real-world validation beyond theoretical model comparisons
- Computational costs and scalability for operational deployment not addressed

## Confidence

High confidence:
- CDM achieves 6.8% mean relative error in CHF prediction
- Both models capture statistical properties and correlations in original dataset

Medium confidence:
- Generated values maintain physical relationships based on theoretical validation
- Low variability in generated samples (4.40% relative standard deviation)

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on CHF data from reactor designs or operating conditions not represented in training dataset
2. Conduct ablation studies varying training data size and diversity to quantify impact on accuracy and uncertainty
3. Implement trained models in mock operational environment to evaluate computational efficiency, latency, and integration challenges for real-time CHF prediction
