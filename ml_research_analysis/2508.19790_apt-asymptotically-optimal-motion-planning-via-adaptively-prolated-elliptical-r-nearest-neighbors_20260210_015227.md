# APT*: Asymptotically Optimal Motion Planning via Adaptively Prolated Elliptical R-Nearest Neighbors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19790
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19790
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Outperforms existing planners in dimensions R⁴ to R¹⁶ with higher success rates and lower median path costs

## Executive Summary
APT* introduces a sampling-based motion planner that combines adaptive batch sizing with elliptical r-nearest neighbor search. The planner dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on the hypervolume of informed sets and uses Coulomb's law to define virtual forces for refining neighbor selection. This approach employs non-linear prolation methods to optimize vertex electric charges, improving convergence rates and reducing solution costs. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across high-dimensional configuration spaces.

## Method Summary
APT* extends FDIT* by integrating adaptive batch sizing and elliptical r-nearest neighbor modules. The method adjusts batch sizes based on the hypervolume of informed sets and uses Coulomb's law to define virtual forces for refining neighbor selection. The planner employs non-linear prolation methods to optimize vertex electric charges, improving convergence rates and reducing solution costs. The implementation is available as part of the OMPL framework.

## Key Results
- Outperforms existing planners in dimensions from R⁴ to R¹⁶
- Achieves higher success rates and lower median path costs
- Validated through real-world robot manipulation tasks
- Demonstrates effectiveness in complex environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Coulomb-Guided Elliptical Neighbor Search
Deforming the nearest neighbor search region from spherical to ellipsoidal, aligned with the net virtual force from valid and invalid vertices, accelerates path convergence. Vertices carry electric charge, with valid neighbors exerting attractive forces and invalid neighbors exerting repulsive forces. The vector sum produces a net force direction that becomes the major axis of an ellipsoidal search region.

### Mechanism 2: Hypervolume-Driven Adaptive Batch Sizing
Scaling batch size inversely with the Lebesgue measure of the informed hyperellipsoid yields faster initial solutions and more efficient subsequent optimization. When the informed set is large, batch size approaches m_max for rapid exploration. As the solution cost improves and the informed set shrinks, batch size decays toward m_min.

### Mechanism 3: Non-Linear Charge Modulation via Tanh Taylor Expansion
Mapping batch size to vertex charge through a Taylor-expanded tanh function yields a smooth, bounded charge trajectory that appropriately transitions from circular to highly elliptical neighbor regions. Charge is computed via tanh Taylor series with controllable order α.

## Foundational Learning

- **Random Geometric Graphs (RGG) and asymptotic optimality**: Why needed: APT* inherits RGG-based convergence guarantees; the neighbor radius r(B) is derived from RGG density bounds. Quick check: Explain how r(B) scales with batch size B and dimensionality n, and why this affects graph connectivity.
- **Informed sampling and hyperellipsoids**: Why needed: APT* uses informed sets to constrain sampling; the hypervolume ζ(c_i, n) drives batch adaptation. Quick check: Given current solution cost c_i and minimum distance c_min, compute the informed ratio G_i for a 6-DOF problem.
- **Coulomb's law in n-dimensional space**: Why needed: The force model generalizes inverse-square to inverse-(n-1) power. Quick check: Why does Eq. 3 use r_i^(n-1) in the denominator rather than r_i^2?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Planner core -> Elliptical-RNN module -> Adaptive batch-size module -> Charge calculator
- **Critical path**: 1) On cost improvement → trigger batch-size recalculation; 2) Batch size → charge q; 3) Charge + neighbor positions → Coulomb force → ellipse axes; 4) Ellipse → filtered neighbor set → edge candidates → collision check → graph update
- **Design tradeoffs**: α order in tanh expansion affects accuracy vs. computation; m_min/m_max bounds control adaptation range; Φ threshold balances neighbor rejection vs. completeness
- **Failure signatures**: Stuck at local optimum when force direction consistently points along suboptimal homotopy; slow initial solution when m_max set too low; excessive neighbor rejection when Φ threshold too strict
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline sanity check on 2D empty space; 2) Ablation on charge modulation comparing fixed vs. adaptive charge on R8 dividing-wall task; 3) Hyperparameter sweep varying α, m_min, Φ on R16 random rectangles

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can APT* be extended to effectively integrate human-aware safety constraints for motion planning in dynamic scenarios?
- To what extent can SIMD parallelization reduce the computational overhead of the elliptical neighbor search?
- Is the Taylor expansion of the Tanh function theoretically optimal for charge prolation, or is its superiority empirical?

## Limitations
- Missing Coulomb proportionality constant k_e and elliptical scaling factor k values
- Limited ablation studies isolating each APT* component's contribution
- Insufficient environmental diversity in real-world validation

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in mechanism validity: Coulomb-guided neighbor selection and hypervolume-based batch adaptation are theoretically grounded and experimentally validated
- **Medium confidence** in implementation robustness: Core algorithms are well-specified but missing parameter values reduce reproducibility certainty
- **Low confidence** in generalizability: Real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate feasibility but broader environmental diversity is absent

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary α, m_min/m_max, and Φ across DW and RR environments to quantify performance robustness
2. **Ablation study**: Compare APT* variants with fixed charge, fixed batch size, and spherical neighbor search to isolate each mechanism's contribution
3. **Failure mode characterization**: Intentionally design obstacle configurations that exploit APT*'s directional bias to assess local optimum susceptibility
