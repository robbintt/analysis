- Introduces a BFO-based ontology for the MO|RE motor performance data repository in sports science

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a domain ontology for motor performance research data using the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) framework. The ontology addresses the challenge of structuring complex, longitudinal test data from sports science studies to enable machine understanding and cross-study comparisons. By modeling studies and test items as plan specifications and measurement processes as concrete realizations, the approach enables formal representation of test processes and results while supporting FAIR data principles and privacy considerations.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a BFO-based ontology for motor performance research data by mapping existing MO|RE repository structures to BFO concepts, IAO plan specifications, and OBI measurement patterns. The approach models studies and test items as plan specifications, participants as material entities with measurable qualities, and measurement processes as concrete realizations of plans. The ontology design incorporates privacy-aware extensions for handling sensitive data and supports competency questions through SPARQL queries.

## Key Results
- Successfully models motor performance research data using BFO continuant/occurrent distinction
- Enables formal representation of test processes and results for machine understanding
- Supports cross-study comparisons through standardized plan specification patterns
- Addresses privacy considerations through sensitivity annotations and access control mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Modeling studies and test items as plan specifications enables standardized comparison of motor performance data across studies with varying protocols.
- Mechanism: By representing test items as `iao:plan_specification` instances and their concrete executions as `bfo:process` realizations, the ontology separates the abstract specification of a test from its particular execution, allowing query systems to group results by test type while preserving protocol differences.
- Core assumption: Query consumers can map semantically equivalent test items across studies despite naming and parameter variations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "models research studies and test items as plan specifications... measurement results as outputs of realized processes"
  - [section 3.3.2] "A more:test item is, same as the study, an iao:plan specification... concretized in an iao:plan, which is accordingly realized in a concrete more:test process"
  - [corpus] Related work on ontology-aligned structuring (arxiv:2601.12582) supports formalized workflow descriptions for reproducibility, though corpus evidence for this specific plan-specification pattern is limited.
- Break condition: If test item definitions across studies lack sufficient semantic annotation to determine equivalence, cross-study queries return incomplete or incoherent aggregations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The BFO continuant/occurrent distinction provides a coherent framework for modeling temporal and processual aspects of motor performance measurements.
- Mechanism: BFO bifurcates entities into continuants (entities that persist through time, e.g., participants as `bfo:material_entity`) and occurrents (processes that unfold over time, e.g., test executions as `bfo:process`). Qualities (`bfo:quality`) inhere in continuants, while dispositions realized through occurrents connect participants to measurable outcomes.
- Core assumption: Domain experts can consistently classify motor performance entities as either continuants or occurrents without ontological ambiguity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "formalizes complex temporal and processual aspects... using BFO concepts such as continuants, occurrents, and qualities"
  - [section 3.2] "BFO differentiates between continuants (entities that persist through time) and occurrents (processes that unfold over time)... addresses the temporal complexity inherent in motor performance research"
  - [corpus] Bio-KGvec2go (arxiv:2509.07905) and OBO Foundry approaches confirm BFO's applicability for biomedical process modeling, providing indirect validation.
- Break condition: If motor performance entities exhibit hybrid temporal characteristics that resist clean continuant/occurrent classification, model coherence degrades.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Annotating sensitive data properties with privacy metadata enables role-based access control within the knowledge graph.
- Mechanism: Properties and classes representing identifying or health-related data (age, BMI, postal codes) are annotated with sensitivity metadata. The ontology design accommodates access constraints (referencing ODRL patterns) so different user roles receive filtered graph views.
- Core assumption: A formal annotation schema for sensitivity can be defined and consistently applied during data ingestion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "particular attention to privacy and data protection through access control mechanisms"
  - [section 3.3.1] "annotate properties and classes that represent identifying or health-related data... with corresponding metadata for an automated distinction between sensitive and non-sensitive entities"
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence for privacy-aware KG mechanisms in sports science is weak; ODRL-based access control (cited in paper) is standard but not validated in this specific domain.
- Break condition: If data curators inconsistently annotate sensitivity or access policies evolve without schema updates, privacy guarantees fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **BFO continuant vs. occurrent distinction**
  - Why needed here: The entire MO|RE ontology hinges on correctly classifying entities as temporally persistent (participants, equipment) or processual (test executions, measurement acts).
  - Quick check question: Given a "handgrip strength measurement," is the *force value* a continuant quality or part of an occurrent process?

- Concept: **Plan specifications and realizations (IAO/OBI patterns)**
  - Why needed here: Test items and studies are modeled as abstract plans that get realized in concrete processes; understanding this pattern is prerequisite to querying or extending the ontology.
  - Quick check question: If a Shuttle Run test protocol changes mid-study, which entity must be versioned: the plan specification or the test process?

- Concept: **Dispositions and their measurement**
  - Why needed here: Motor performance constructs (strength, endurance) are modeled as dispositions that inhere in participants and are realized through test processes, with measurement data as the output.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between a participant's "handgrip strength disposition" and the scalar measurement datum produced by a hand dynamometer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Upper ontology: BFO 2020 (continuants, occurrents, qualities) -> Mid-level ontologies: IAO (information content entities, plan specifications), OBI (assays, evaluant roles, measurement datums) -> Domain module: MO|RE ontology (more:study, more:test_item, more:test_process, more:person, more:measures_disposition) -> Data layer: MO|RE repository (relational/spreadsheet data to be transformed) -> Privacy layer: Sensitivity annotations + ODRL-based access policies (planned)

- Critical path:
  1. Map MO|RE spreadsheet schemas to BFO/IAO/OBI classes
  2. Define test item hierarchy as plan specifications
  3. Model participants as material entities with qualities and dispositions
  4. Transform test executions into process instances with measurement outputs
  5. Annotate sensitive properties; implement access control

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity vs. usability: Full processual modeling enables rich queries but increases ingestion complexity; shortcuts (e.g., more:measures_disposition) simplify common access patterns.
  - BFO compliance vs. domain flexibility: Strict BFO alignment ensures interoperability but may constrain how sports science concepts are represented.
  - Privacy annotations vs. query performance: Fine-grained sensitivity metadata supports access control but may complicate query optimization.

- Failure signatures:
  - Competency questions (e.g., "How does handgrip strength vary across age groups?") return empty results due to incomplete instance data.
  - Cross-study aggregations conflate semantically distinct test items due to underspecified plan specifications.
  - Privacy leaks occur when new properties are added without sensitivity annotations.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Handgrip test item end-to-end modeling: Ingest one study's handgrip data, verify the SPARQL query in Listing 1 returns expected aggregations, validate all triples against the ontology schema.
  2. Cross-study test item alignment: Map Shuttle Run protocols from two studies to the more:test_item hierarchy; test whether a query for "endurance tests" correctly retrieves both.
  3. Privacy annotation coverage audit: Define a sensitivity taxonomy, run an automated check for unannotated properties that match sensitive patterns (age, location, health indicators), report coverage gaps.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can role-based access constraints and privacy annotations be technically implemented within the knowledge graph to ensure GDPR compliance for sensitive sports science data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.3.1 states, "The implementation of required access control to ensure data privacy will be the subject of future work."
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the need to annotate sensitive properties (e.g., BMI, age) and mentions the ODRL ontology, the specific architecture for enforcing these policies within the knowledge graph is not yet defined.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formalized privacy extension to the ontology and a functional prototype demonstrating automated access restriction based on user roles (e.g., researcher vs. public).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the proposed BFO-based modeling pattern (Plan Specifications realized by Processes) generalize effectively to the full heterogeneity of motor performance test items beyond the Handgrip example?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents a "vision" and relies primarily on a single "Exemplary Modeling" case (Handgrip) to demonstrate the ontology's structure.
- Why unresolved: Although the authors mention scalability to items like the Shuttle Run, the semantic challenges of modeling diverse test types (e.g., cognitive tests or complex endurance protocols) using this specific pattern have not been validated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful mapping of a statistically significant variety of test items from the MO|RE repository into the ontology, validated by a comprehensive set of competency questions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the MO|RE ontology modules be integrated into broader cross-disciplinary research infrastructures, such as the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4 notes the potential for shortcuts and modules to play a role in "endeavors outside of DiTraRe... within the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)."
- Why unresolved: The paper outlines the ambition for cross-disciplinary collaboration (e.g., with health and education) but does not detail the specific mappings required to align the domain ontology with mid-level ontologies like NFDIcore.
- What evidence would resolve it: Published alignment documentation or "bridging" modules connecting MO|RE concepts to NFDIcore, enabling cross-domain queries without semantic conflict.

## Limitations
- Privacy-aware extensions remain conceptual without implementation or validation
- Cross-study comparability confidence is limited by insufficient evidence of consistent test item definitions
- Assumes domain experts can consistently classify entities using BFO continuant/occurrent distinction

## Confidence
- Cross-study comparability: Medium - Theoretically sound but limited corpus evidence
- Privacy-aware extensions: Low - Conceptual only, not implemented or validated
- BFO-based temporal modeling: High - Established precedents in biomedical ontologies

## Next Checks
1. Handgrip test item end-to-end modeling: Ingest one study's handgrip data, verify the SPARQL query in Listing 1 returns expected aggregations, validate all triples against the ontology schema.
2. Cross-study test item alignment: Map Shuttle Run protocols from two studies to the more:test_item hierarchy; test whether a query for "endurance tests" correctly retrieves both.
3. Privacy annotation coverage audit: Define a sensitivity taxonomy, run an automated check for unannotated properties that match sensitive patterns (age, location, health indicators), report coverage gaps.
