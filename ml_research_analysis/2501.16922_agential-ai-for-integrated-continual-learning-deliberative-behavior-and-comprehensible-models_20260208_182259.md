## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Agential AI (AAI), a system designed to overcome key limitations of current machine learning approaches, including the lack of integration with planning, incomprehensible internal structure, and inability to learn continually. AAI's core component, Modelleyen, employs a novel "varsel" mechanism that learns environmental structure topologically using local variation and selection, enabling continual learning without destructive adaptation. The system integrates this with Planlayan, a planning algorithm that executes goal-directed actions based on the learned model, and a behavior encapsulation mechanism that decomposes behavior patterns into comprehensible hierarchical structures. Preliminary experiments on a simple environment demonstrate AAI's effectiveness in accurate modeling, goal-directed behavior, and continual learning across changing environments, outperforming random actions and maintaining performance without destructive adaptation.

## Method Summary
AAI comprises three integrated components: Modelleyen learns environment structure through Conditioning State Variables (CSVs) using a variation-selection mechanism that adds/removes connections based on local refinement; Planlayan generates goal-directed action networks through backward search from goal states using the learned model; and behavior encapsulation decomposes action networks into hierarchical subgoal structures. The system operates on discrete state variables (BSVs, DSVs, CSVs) with ternary states, learning logical conditioning relationships rather than parametric functions. Modelleyen creates initial overfitted connections that are locally refined, while Planlayan recursively generates upstream action networks to identify goal-achieving actions without reward signals.

## Key Results
- AAI demonstrates effective continual learning across environment changes without catastrophic forgetting in a simple FSM environment
- The system achieves goal-directed behavior through backward planning, outperforming random actions
- Behavior encapsulation transforms complex action networks into comprehensible hierarchical structures
- Modelleyen maintains consistent responses to past instances while adapting to new environment types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Varsel (Variation-Selection) Learning
- **Claim:** If a learning system initially overfits to each observation then locally refines unnecessary connections, it may achieve continual learning without catastrophic forgetting.
- **Mechanism:** Modelleyen creates Conditioning State Variables (CSVs) that initially connect to *all* active state variables when an unexplained event occurs. Through local refinement, it removes sources that are observed to be unnecessary (inactive positive sources, active negative sources). Theorem 1 proves that any modification preserving past source sets maintains consistent responses to past instances.
- **Core assumption:** Environmental structure is discrete and can be captured through logical conditioning relationships; Markovian transitions are sufficient for initial modeling.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "using component-level variation and selection to learn the structure of the environment"; [Section 3] "Theorem 1... if C undergoes any modification as a result of encounter with an instance y1, its state in response to any past instance y0 is not altered by this modification"
- **Break condition:** Highly stochastic environments where first-order statistical significance filtering discards genuine relationships; non-Markovian dependencies requiring temporal memory.

### Mechanism 2: Backward Goal-Directed Planning via Action Networks
- **Claim:** Given a structured model with explicit alternative pathways, backward search from goal states can produce goal-directed behavior without reward signals or forward sampling.
- **Mechanism:** Planlayan recursively generates upstream action networks by expanding predecessors: for CSVs, it expands upstream conditioners and sources; for DSVs, precondition states and conditioners; for GSVs, constituents and constituencies. Actions are selected that can immediately activate CSVs whose downstream dependencies are realizable.
- **Core assumption:** The learned model accurately represents environmental dynamics; alternative pathways are explicitly represented rather than sampled.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "integrates this with Planlayan, a planning algorithm that executes goal-directed actions based on the learned model"; [Section 4] "Planlayan is explicitly goal-directed, identifying a path from initial states to the goal without needing rewards"
- **Break condition:** Exponential pathway growth in complex environments (current version is exhaustive); precise timing requirements where multiple pathways have identical preconditions but different temporal effects.

### Mechanism 3: Behavior Encapsulation via Network Reduction
- **Claim:** If action networks contain redundant alternative pathways, edge-oriented reduction can identify reliable subgoal structures and produce hierarchical behavior decompositions.
- **Mechanism:** The encapsulation process splits unified action networks into alternative variants, then iteratively removes edges whose source-target pairs are not connected across all variants. Remaining edges represent necessary subgoals. This recurses on encapsulated subnetworks, producing arbitrary hierarchies.
- **Core assumption:** Repeatedly occurring pathway segments across alternatives indicate reusable behavioral primitives.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "behavior encapsulation mechanism that decomposes behavior patterns into comprehensible hierarchical structures"; [Section 5] "this encapsulation process can significantly aid agent behavior... encapsulated behavioral subunits can be reused when the same precondition/goal pairs arise"
- **Break condition:** Computationally intensive for large networks; currently operates post-hoc rather than integrated with ongoing operation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Discrete State Variable Systems**
  - Why needed here: AAI operates on State Variables (BSVs, DSVs, CSVs) with ternary states {1, -1, 0}, not continuous representations.
  - Quick check question: Can you represent your environment as a set of boolean-like variables plus an "unobserved" state?

- **Concept: Logical Conditioning Relationships**
  - Why needed here: CSVs encode "IF positive_sources_active AND NOT negative_sources_active THEN targets_active" relationships.
  - Quick check question: Can environmental dynamics be expressed as logical rules rather than continuous functions?

- **Concept: Topological vs. Parametric Learning**
  - Why needed here: Varsel mechanisms modify network *structure* (adding/removing connections) rather than tuning continuous parameters.
  - Quick check question: Are you prepared to implement graph-structured learning rather than weight optimization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Modelleyen (Learning) → Planlayan (Planning) → Behavior Encapsulator (post-hoc)
- **Critical path:** 1. Implement SV types with state computation (Algorithms 1-2) 2. Implement CSV formation, refinement, and negative source formation (Figure 2) 3. Implement upstream AN generation for planning (Algorithm 3) 4. Integrate learning-planning loop (Section 4.1)
- **Design tradeoffs:** Completeness vs. complexity (NCE threshold controls model size vs. coverage); Exhaustive vs. selective planning (current exhaustive search is correct but doesn't scale); Integrated vs. separate encapsulation (currently post-hoc; integration would enable subpolicy reuse)
- **Failure signatures:** Runaway model growth → NCE threshold too low or environment too stochastic; Planning loops → Multiple pathways with identical preconditions but different timing (RS subtype issue); Forgetting → Check if negative source formation is incorrectly triggered on past instances
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Replicate the FSM environment (Figure 6) with 2 cells, 7 states each; verify model learning on "Complete" variant without randomness 2. Test continual learning: Switch between RS/SGS/NEG subtypes every 500 steps; verify episode duration doesn't spike at transitions 3. Validate encapsulation: Generate action network for goal state G from initial (DC,W); manually verify encapsulated edges correspond to necessary transitions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can Modelleyen's "varsel" mechanism effectively scale to high-dimensional, continuous observation spaces (like visual inputs) using the proposed "network refinement" approach?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper states that scaling to visual spaces requires adapting the algorithm to operate on networks as observations rather than lists of state variables, acknowledging that current implementation handles structured spaces like "fully-connected neural networks" rather than specialized architectures like CNNs.
- **Why unresolved:** The current experiments are restricted to a simple Finite State Machine (FSM) with low-dimensional discrete state variables. The proposed solution—redefining refinement operations on network structures rather than lists—is theorized but not yet implemented or validated.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical results demonstrating that AAI can perform continual learning and planning on standard visual reinforcement learning benchmarks (e.g., Atari or Minigrid with pixel inputs) with performance comparable to deep learning baselines.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the behavior encapsulation mechanism be successfully integrated into the agent's online operation to enable the autonomous reuse of learned sub-policies?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Future Work section states: "Another direction for future development is incorporating behavior encapsulation into ongoing operations to enable reusable behavior patterns."
- **Why unresolved:** The current paper demonstrates behavior encapsulation as a post-hoc analysis process performed on action networks after they are generated, rather than as a mechanism the agent uses dynamically during task execution.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An experiment showing that an agent utilizes an encapsulated behavior (e.g., a specific sequence of moves) learned in one environment context to solve a problem in a new environment more efficiently than re-planning from scratch.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the Modelleyen framework be extended to model non-Markovian environments that require tracking long-term dependencies?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly list this as a limitation: "the current model assumes a Markovian environment, focusing solely on immediate state transitions and neglecting long-term dependencies."
- **Why unresolved:** The fundamental definition of Conditioning State Variables (CSVs) links current active sources to immediate target states in the next step. The system currently lacks a mechanism to associate a current state with a target that occurs many steps later without intermediate grounding.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful modeling and planning in a test environment specifically designed with time delays or state-aliasing (where the optimal action depends on history rather than just the current observation), without external memory buffers.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does extending the Normalized Causal Effect (NCE) calculation to incorporate upstream conditioners improve the precision of statistical significance filtering?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Appendix notes: "The current method... has one drawback... only first-order significance of relations are considered... Resolution of this limitation requires consideration of and conditioning on higher-order conditioners... and is left for future work."
- **Why unresolved:** The current NCE metric filters relationships based solely on immediate source-target probability, failing to account for conditional dependencies (contexts) provided by higher-level CSVs, which can lead to the filtering of genuinely significant but complex relationships.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis showing that a higher-order NCE metric significantly reduces false negatives (retaining true causal relationships) and model complexity in environments with high causal redundancy.

## Limitations
- The core claims rest on a single toy environment with limited complexity that may not stress-test scalability to real-world domains
- The paper lacks comparison to established continual learning baselines, making it difficult to assess whether reported performance gains are meaningful
- The behavior encapsulation mechanism is demonstrated only in a simplified post-hoc analysis, not as an integrated component of the agent's operation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The local variation and selection mechanism (Theorem 1) for preventing catastrophic forgetting appears theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The planning algorithm correctly generates upstream action networks given a learned model
- **Low confidence**: The behavior encapsulation produces genuinely comprehensible hierarchical structures beyond simple path compression

## Next Checks
1. **Scalable Environment Test**: Implement a more complex grid-world or partially observable environment with 10+ state variables and stochastic transitions to evaluate model growth and planning efficiency
2. **Baselines Comparison**: Compare AAI against established continual learning methods (e.g., EWC, PNN) and planning algorithms (e.g., MCTS with learned models) on standard benchmarks like MiniGrid or Procgen
3. **Real-Time Encapsulation**: Integrate the behavior encapsulation into the online operation of Planlayan, measuring whether subpolicy reuse reduces planning time in recurrent task scenarios
