# Exploratory Semantic Reliability Analysis of Wind Turbine Maintenance Logs using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.22366
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22366
- Authors: Max Malyi; Jonathan Shek; Andre Biscaya
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: LLMs can extract reliability insights from unstructured wind turbine maintenance logs, identifying failure modes and causal chains

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an LLM-based framework for extracting reliability insights from unstructured wind turbine maintenance logs. The approach moves beyond traditional classification to perform complex reasoning tasks including failure mode identification, causal chain inference, and comparative site analysis. Using structured prompt engineering on a large industrial dataset, the method demonstrates that LLMs can act as "reliability co-pilots" generating expert-level hypotheses from raw text. A Pareto analysis example showed 15 failure modes extracted, with the top 8 accounting for 80% of events, highlighting the framework's potential to unlock operational intelligence previously obscured in unstructured data.

## Method Summary
The framework employs structured prompt engineering with large language models to analyze unstructured maintenance logs. The approach involves systematic prompt design for different reliability analysis tasks, including failure mode extraction, causal chain inference, and comparative site analysis. The methodology was tested on a proprietary industrial dataset from one wind turbine operator, using LLM reasoning capabilities to transform raw maintenance text into structured reliability insights. The framework processes logs through carefully designed prompts that guide the model to identify patterns, relationships, and hypotheses about system reliability.

## Key Results
- LLMs successfully identified 15 distinct failure modes from power converter maintenance logs
- Pareto analysis revealed the top 8 failure modes accounted for 80% of events
- Framework demonstrated capability for complex reasoning tasks including causal chain inference and comparative site analysis
- LLMs generated expert-level hypotheses from raw unstructured maintenance text

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages LLMs' ability to understand natural language context and perform multi-step reasoning, allowing extraction of complex reliability patterns that traditional keyword-based approaches miss. By structuring prompts to guide the model through specific analytical tasks, the approach transforms unstructured narrative text into actionable reliability intelligence. The method's effectiveness stems from combining domain-specific prompt engineering with LLMs' pattern recognition capabilities to identify failure modes and causal relationships that would be difficult to extract through conventional methods.

## Foundational Learning
- Prompt Engineering Fundamentals: Understanding how to structure prompts for specific analytical tasks is critical for consistent results
  - Why needed: Different reliability questions require different prompt structures to guide LLM reasoning
  - Quick check: Test prompts with known examples to validate output structure and completeness
- Reliability Analysis Concepts: Familiarity with failure modes, root cause analysis, and Pareto principles
  - Why needed: Framework outputs must align with established reliability engineering terminology and methods
  - Quick check: Verify extracted failure modes match industry standards and expert knowledge
- Natural Language Processing Basics: Understanding text preprocessing and semantic analysis
  - Why needed: Maintenance logs contain technical jargon and abbreviations requiring proper interpretation
  - Quick check: Assess model's ability to correctly interpret domain-specific terminology

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Raw Maintenance Logs -> Structured Prompts -> LLM Processing -> Reliability Insights -> Validation

**Critical Path:** Raw text input → Prompt engineering → LLM inference → Failure mode extraction → Causal chain analysis → Comparative analysis → Expert validation

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- General vs. specific prompts: Broader prompts capture more patterns but may be less precise
- Single vs. multi-step reasoning: Simpler prompts are faster but may miss complex relationships
- Model size vs. cost: Larger models provide better reasoning but increase computational expense

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Inconsistent failure mode identification across similar log entries
- Missing causal relationships in multi-event scenarios
- Difficulty with domain-specific terminology or abbreviations

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test failure mode extraction with benchmark maintenance logs of known issues
2. Validate causal chain inference using logs with documented failure sequences
3. Compare Pareto analysis results with existing reliability databases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent do LLM-inferred causal chains align with ground-truth failure sequences when validated against SCADA alarm data or expert review?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that a critical next step is validating generated hypotheses, "potentially augmented by correlating findings with other data sources like SCADA alarm sequences."
- Why unresolved: The current study was exploratory and positioned the LLM as a hypothesis generator; validation requires cross-referencing with distinct time-series datasets and human domain experts not utilized in this phase.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative correlation metrics between LLM-identified causal chains and confirmed root causes validated by independent reliability engineers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does incorporating LLM-extracted semantic features (e.g., specific failure modes) into quantitative predictive maintenance models significantly improve failure prediction accuracy?
- Basis in paper: The authors propose future work should explore the "fusion of semantic and time-series data" to enhance prediction algorithms.
- Why unresolved: The current framework focused on qualitative analysis and hypothesis generation rather than integrating these insights into quantitative predictive algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative benchmark of predictive model performance (e.g., precision, recall) with and without the inclusion of LLM-extracted semantic features.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are the prompt engineering strategies developed in this study robust across maintenance logs from different operators with varying data collection cultures?
- Basis in paper: The authors suggest scaling the framework to "larger, multi-operator datasets" to test the generalisability of prompt engineering strategies.
- Why unresolved: This study utilized a single dataset from one industrial partner (Nadara), potentially limiting the generalizability of the specific prompt structures to logs with different terminologies or formatting standards.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the identical framework to a multi-operator dataset without significant degradation in semantic grouping or inference quality.

## Limitations
- Relies on proprietary industrial datasets that were not publicly released, making independent replication difficult
- Lacks detailed error metrics or validation against ground truth reliability data
- Does not address computational efficiency or scalability for industrial deployment

## Confidence
- LLMs can extract meaningful reliability insights from unstructured wind turbine maintenance logs: Medium
- This approach unlocks insights "previously obscured in unstructured data": Low
- Framework's scalability and computational efficiency for industrial deployment: High (limitation)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct blind validation where LLM-generated failure modes and causal chains are evaluated by wind turbine reliability experts against independently verified ground truth data
2. Perform sensitivity analysis testing multiple prompt variations and model versions to establish robustness of the extraction methodology
3. Benchmark the LLM approach against traditional natural language processing techniques on the same maintenance log dataset to quantify improvement in insight extraction
