core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of generating causally aligned
  curricula in reinforcement learning, where the key challenge is ensuring that source
  tasks share invariant optimal decision rules with the target task, particularly
  in the presence of unobserved confounders. The authors develop a sufficient graphical
  criterion to characterize causally aligned source tasks and provide an efficient
  algorithm to generate such tasks based on qualitative causal knowledge.

# Causally Aligned Curriculum Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16799
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Causally aligned curriculum learning algorithm that ensures source tasks share invariant optimal decision rules with target task despite unobserved confounders

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in curriculum learning for reinforcement learning: ensuring that source tasks are causally aligned with the target task, particularly when unobserved confounders may break the transfer of optimal decision rules. The authors develop a sufficient graphical criterion based on qualitative causal knowledge (DAG structures) to characterize when source tasks will have invariant optimal decision rules with the target task. They provide an efficient algorithm to generate causally aligned source tasks and introduce a causal augmentation procedure that can be applied to existing curriculum generators to ensure alignment, demonstrating significant performance improvements on confounded environments.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a theoretically grounded approach to curriculum learning that ensures causal alignment between source and target tasks. The core contribution is a sufficient graphical criterion that characterizes when optimal decision rules are invariant across tasks in the presence of unobserved confounders. Based on this criterion, the authors develop an algorithm to generate causally aligned source tasks using only qualitative causal knowledge (DAG structure). They also introduce a causal augmentation procedure that can be applied to existing curriculum generators to ensure the generated tasks are causally aligned with the target task. The approach relies on identifying task graphs where the optimal decision rule in the target task can be recovered from source tasks, even when some variables are unobserved.

## Key Results
- Causally augmented curriculum generators significantly outperform non-causal baselines on confounded environments
- Achieved successful convergence on Colored Sokoban and Button Maze tasks where non-causal methods failed
- The causal augmentation procedure can be applied to existing curriculum generators to ensure alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by ensuring that source tasks share invariant optimal decision rules with the target task through causal alignment. By using qualitative causal knowledge (DAG structures), the algorithm can identify which source tasks will have decision rules that transfer to the target task, even in the presence of unobserved confounders. The causal augmentation procedure modifies existing curriculum generators to produce tasks that satisfy this alignment criterion, ensuring that learning from source tasks will generalize to the target task.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal DAGs**: Directed acyclic graphs representing causal relationships - needed to specify the qualitative causal structure of tasks; quick check: verify DAG structure matches domain knowledge
- **Invariant optimal decision rules**: Decision rules that remain optimal across different tasks - needed to ensure transfer learning works; quick check: test if optimal policy transfers between tasks
- **Unobserved confounders**: Hidden variables affecting multiple observed variables - needed to handle real-world scenarios where not all variables are observable; quick check: verify performance degrades when confounders are introduced
- **Curriculum learning**: Sequential learning from simpler to more complex tasks - needed to structure the learning process; quick check: verify learning improves with well-ordered curricula
- **Transfer learning**: Applying knowledge from source tasks to target tasks - needed to leverage multiple tasks for faster learning; quick check: measure performance improvement from task transfer
- **Reinforcement learning**: Learning optimal policies through interaction - the underlying learning framework; quick check: verify standard RL performance on single tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Task Graph Specification -> Causal Alignment Criterion -> Source Task Generation -> Causal Augmentation -> Curriculum Learning

**Critical path**: Causal structure specification → Alignment criterion verification → Task generation/augmentation → Policy learning → Performance evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: The approach requires complete causal DAG knowledge (high theoretical rigor) versus approaches that learn causal structure from data (more practical but less theoretically grounded). The sufficient criterion ensures alignment but may be conservative, potentially excluding useful source tasks.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Poor performance when causal structure is misspecified
- Failure to find any aligned source tasks in complex environments
- Computational intractability when DAG structure is very large or complex

**Three first experiments**:
1. Verify the causal alignment criterion by testing invariant optimal decision rules between manually constructed source and target tasks
2. Test the causal augmentation procedure on a simple curriculum generator (e.g., task randomization) to ensure it produces aligned tasks
3. Evaluate performance degradation when providing incorrect causal structure to assess robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Requires complete qualitative causal knowledge (DAG structure), which may not be available in many real-world scenarios
- Experimental validation limited to relatively simple grid-world domains, scalability to complex tasks unclear
- The sufficient graphical criterion may be conservative, potentially excluding useful source tasks

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical contributions regarding causal alignment criteria and sufficient condition for invariant optimal decision rules
- Medium confidence in practical effectiveness given limited experimental scope
- Medium confidence in causal augmentation procedure's general applicability, as it depends heavily on underlying curriculum generator quality

## Next Checks
1. Test the causal augmentation procedure on existing curriculum learning benchmarks beyond grid-worlds, particularly in continuous control domains like MuJoCo or DeepMind Control Suite tasks
2. Evaluate robustness to incorrect or incomplete causal structure specifications by systematically introducing errors in the DAG knowledge and measuring performance degradation
3. Compare against alternative approaches for handling unobserved confounders in RL, such as meta-learning methods or causal representation learning techniques that don't require explicit causal structure knowledge
