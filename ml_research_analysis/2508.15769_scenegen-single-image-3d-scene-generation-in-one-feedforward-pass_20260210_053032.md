# SceneGen: Single-Image 3D Scene Generation in One Feedforward Pass

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.15769
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15769
- Reference count: 40
- Single-feedforward 3D scene generation from one image

## Executive Summary
SceneGen introduces a novel framework for generating multiple 3D assets with geometry, texture, and spatial arrangement from a single scene image in one feedforward pass. Unlike previous methods requiring optimization or asset retrieval, SceneGen directly predicts 3D assets and their spatial configurations through an integrated architecture. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D-FUTURE dataset, generating textured scenes with four assets in approximately 2 minutes on a single A100 GPU while outperforming baseline methods in both geometric and visual quality metrics.

## Method Summary
The SceneGen framework addresses single-image 3D scene generation through a novel approach that operates without optimization or asset retrieval. The core innovation lies in its feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders. A position head is introduced to enable simultaneous generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions. The framework is designed to work in a single feedforward pass and can be extended to multi-image input scenarios for improved performance. The method processes input images to generate complete 3D scenes including geometry, texture, and spatial arrangement of multiple assets.

## Key Results
- Achieves F-Score of 90.60 and PSNR of 19.59 on 3D-FUTURE dataset
- Generates textured scenes with four assets in approximately 2 minutes on A100 GPU
- Significantly outperforms baselines including MIDI and PartCrafter in geometric and visual quality metrics
- Successfully extends to multi-image input scenarios with improved generation performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SceneGen's effectiveness stems from its unified architecture that processes visual and geometric information simultaneously through feature aggregation. By integrating local and global scene features, the model captures both fine-grained details and overall scene context. The position head enables direct prediction of 3D asset locations and orientations, eliminating the need for post-processing or optimization. The single-pass design ensures computational efficiency while maintaining high-quality output. The ability to extend to multi-image inputs provides additional robustness and detail capture.

## Foundational Learning
- **3D Scene Representation**: Understanding how 3D scenes are encoded as collections of assets with geometry and spatial relationships is essential for grasping SceneGen's output format.
  - *Why needed*: The framework generates complete 3D scenes rather than individual objects, requiring knowledge of scene composition.
  - *Quick check*: Can you explain how SceneGen represents multiple assets in a single scene?

- **Feature Aggregation in Neural Networks**: Knowledge of how neural networks combine features from different sources (visual, geometric) is crucial for understanding the core architecture.
  - *Why needed*: SceneGen's performance relies on effectively merging local and global scene information.
  - *Quick check*: What types of features are aggregated and how does this improve scene generation?

- **Position Prediction in 3D Space**: Understanding how neural networks predict spatial positions and orientations of 3D objects is key to grasping the position head's function.
  - *Why needed*: The position head is a novel component that directly predicts asset locations and orientations.
  - *Quick check*: How does the position head differ from traditional 3D object detection approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Image -> Visual Encoder -> Feature Aggregation Module -> Position Head -> 3D Asset Generator -> Textured Scene Output

Critical Path: The critical path flows from input image through visual encoder to feature aggregation, then to position head for spatial arrangement prediction, and finally to 3D asset generator for geometry and texture creation.

Design Tradeoffs: The single-pass design prioritizes computational efficiency over potential quality gains from iterative optimization. The unified architecture trades modularity for integration, potentially limiting flexibility but improving coordination between components.

Failure Signatures: Common failure modes include incorrect spatial arrangements when objects have similar visual features, texture artifacts in complex lighting conditions, and geometric inaccuracies for highly occluded objects.

First Experiments:
1. Test SceneGen on a simple scene with distinct, well-separated objects to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate the feature aggregation module's contribution by comparing with and without feature integration
3. Assess the position head's accuracy by comparing predicted spatial arrangements against ground truth layouts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation metrics focus primarily on geometric fidelity and visual quality without addressing photorealism or texture coherence in complex scenes
- Performance claims may not translate to real-time applications given the 2-minute generation time on A100 GPUs
- Framework's generalization to scenes beyond the 3D-FUTURE dataset remains unclear, particularly for scenes with complex object interactions or highly occluded arrangements

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Architectural contributions (feature aggregation module, position head) and core technical implementation are well-documented and logically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Quantitative performance claims (F-Score 90.60, PSNR 19.59) are supported by 3D-FUTURE dataset results, but lack comprehensive qualitative comparisons
- **Low Confidence**: Claims of "superior" performance lack detailed ablation studies to isolate individual component contributions

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SceneGen on diverse datasets (ShapeNet, CO3D) to assess generalization across varying object categories, scene complexities, and occlusion levels
2. Conduct human perceptual studies to validate visual realism and texture coherence of generated scenes, particularly in challenging lighting and material scenarios
3. Test framework performance on lower-end GPUs and under real-time constraints to determine practical applicability for interactive applications
