# Atom-anchored LLMs speak Chemistry: A Retrosynthesis Demonstration

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.16590
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16590
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Framework achieves ≥90% site identification, ≥40% reaction class naming, and ≥74% reactant prediction in zero-shot/few-shot retrosynthesis.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an atom-anchoring framework that enables large language models to perform chemical reasoning by mapping molecular structures to unique atomic identifiers. The method allows LLMs to analyze molecules and predict retrosynthetic disconnections without requiring labeled training data or task-specific model training. Applied to single-step retrosynthesis, the approach demonstrates competitive performance across multiple benchmarks while providing a general blueprint for data-scarce chemistry problems.

## Method Summary
The framework uses unique atomic identifiers to anchor LLM reasoning to molecular structures, enabling zero-shot structural analysis and few-shot chemical transformations. For retrosynthesis, a Position Model identifies disconnection sites and reaction classes from atom-mapped product SMILES, while a Transition Model predicts final reactants using few-shot examples. The approach leverages general-purpose LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o) with specific prompting strategies, avoiding the need for specialized training. Evaluation is conducted on USPTO50k and PaRoutes datasets, with performance measured through template accuracy, reactant accuracy, and combined accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieves ≥90% partial match accuracy in identifying chemically plausible disconnection sites
- Reaches ≥40% accuracy in naming correct reaction classes
- Demonstrates ≥74% accuracy in predicting final reactants for single-step retrosynthesis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The atom-anchoring mechanism works by providing LLMs with a structured way to reference specific molecular features through unique atomic identifiers. This allows the model to maintain spatial awareness of the molecule while reasoning about chemical transformations. By grounding abstract chemical concepts to concrete atomic positions, the framework bridges the gap between natural language reasoning and molecular structure manipulation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Atom-mapping correction:** Essential for ensuring consistent atomic references across different SMILES representations; verify using Somnath et al. 2021 methodology.
- **Canonical SMILES generation:** Critical for maintaining consistent molecular representations; validate using RDKit or similar tools.
- **Reaction Ontology:** Provides standardized reaction class labels; cross-reference with the 136 unique reaction names used in evaluation.
- **JSON output schema:** Required for structured LLM responses; implement strict validation to prevent parsing errors.
- **Chemical validation:** Necessary for verifying generated reactants; use RDKit to check SMILES syntax and chemical validity.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Product SMILES -> Position Model -> Disconnection Sites -> Transition Model -> Reactants
- **Critical path:** The Position Model's ability to correctly identify disconnection sites directly determines Transition Model performance
- **Design tradeoffs:** General-purpose LLM flexibility vs. specialized model performance; zero-shot simplicity vs. few-shot accuracy
- **Failure signatures:** Invalid JSON output, atom index hallucination, and SMILES syntax errors in generated reactants
- **First experiments:**
  1. Validate USPTO50k atom-mapping correction implementation
  2. Test Position Model with simple reaction types to verify disconnection site identification
  3. Verify Transition Model can generate chemically valid reactants for known examples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** Can the framework extend to multi-step synthesis planning without performance degradation? The current work demonstrates single-step accuracy but hasn't implemented recursive planning algorithms.
- **Open Question 2:** Does domain-specific fine-tuning degrade the generalizability required for atom-anchored prompting? The chemistry-specialized model (ether0) failed completely while general-purpose models succeeded.
- **Open Question 3:** Is superior performance driven by enhanced chemical reasoning or improved SMILES parsing abilities? Current evaluation conflates reasoning capability with syntactic manipulation skills.

## Limitations
- Performance tightly coupled to specific LLM versions used (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o)
- Evaluation limited to curated academic datasets and small expert-validated sets
- Generalization to complex stereochemistry and rare reaction types remains untested

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Atom-anchoring methodology and disconnection site identification (≥90% partial match)
- **Medium Confidence:** Reaction class identification and reactant prediction performance (≥40% and ≥74% accuracy)
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about generating synthetic datasets through knowledge mapping lack concrete validation

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the USPTO50k atom-mapping correction procedure from Somnath et al. 2021
2. Test framework performance across multiple LLM versions to assess model dependency
3. Apply framework to a held-out test set with stereochemical complexity and rare reaction types
