core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing explainability
  in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (MMRAG) by introducing a two-stage
  reinforcement fine-tuning framework. The core method idea involves using rule-based

# MMRAG-RFT: Two-stage Reinforcement Fine-tuning for Explainable Multi-modal Retrieval-augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.17194
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17194
- **Reference count**: 6
- **Key outcome**: Achieves SOTA on WebQA (QA-FL: 0.708, QA-Acc: 0.763, QA: 0.583) and MultimodalQA (EM: +4.7%, F1: +12.7%) using two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
MMRAG-RFT introduces a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation. The approach combines rule-based reinforcement for coarse-grained point-wise ranking with reasoning-based reinforcement for fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation. This enables both effective document filtering and explainable reasoning capabilities. The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on WebQA and MultimodalQA benchmarks while maintaining interpretability through its staged approach.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning strategy. The first stage uses rule-based reinforcement to perform coarse-grained point-wise ranking, filtering out irrelevant documents through predefined criteria. The second stage applies reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning for fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation, enabling explainable reasoning paths. This staged approach balances efficiency in document retrieval with the quality of generated explanations, addressing the challenge of maintaining interpretability in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation systems.

## Key Results
- WebQA: QA-FL score of 0.708, QA-Acc of 0.763, and overall QA score of 0.583
- MultimodalQA: Improved EM by 4.7% and F1 by 12.7% over previous methods
- Demonstrated SOTA performance on both benchmark datasets
- Maintained explainability while achieving strong quantitative results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage approach works by first reducing the search space through rule-based filtering, then applying more sophisticated reasoning to the remaining candidates. The rule-based stage efficiently eliminates irrelevant documents using predefined criteria, while the reasoning-based stage focuses computational resources on relevant documents for fine-grained ranking and generation. This hierarchical processing reduces noise and enables the model to focus on quality reasoning paths, leading to both better performance and more interpretable results.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation**: Combining information from multiple modalities with retrieved documents for generation tasks; needed to handle complex real-world questions requiring diverse information sources.
- **Reinforcement fine-tuning**: Using reward signals to guide model optimization beyond supervised learning; needed to incorporate domain-specific criteria and reasoning quality metrics.
- **Point-wise vs list-wise ranking**: Different ranking approaches for document selection; point-wise evaluates individual documents while list-wise considers document relationships, each serving different filtering and ranking needs.
- **Explainable AI in multi-modal contexts**: Providing interpretable reasoning paths in systems processing multiple data types; needed to build trust and understanding in complex multi-modal decision-making.
- **Rule-based reward engineering**: Designing explicit criteria for model optimization; needed to incorporate domain knowledge and ensure consistent filtering of irrelevant content.
- **Fine-grained vs coarse-grained processing**: Different levels of detail in information processing; needed to balance efficiency and quality in document selection and reasoning.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Document Retriever -> Rule-based Filter -> Reasoning Engine -> Answer Generator

Critical Path: The rule-based filter serves as the gatekeeper, significantly reducing the document set before expensive reasoning operations. The reasoning engine then performs fine-grained ranking and generates explanations. The answer generator produces final responses based on the ranked documents and reasoning paths.

Design Tradeoffs: The staged approach trades some early precision for significant computational efficiency gains. Rule-based filtering may miss some relevant documents but dramatically reduces the processing burden on the reasoning stage. The explainability comes at the cost of additional complexity in the fine-tuning process.

Failure Signatures: Poor rule design can lead to over-filtering (missing relevant documents) or under-filtering (passing too many irrelevant documents). Insufficient reasoning quality in the second stage can result in weak explanations despite good document selection. Data quality issues in training can cause cascading failures through both stages.

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study removing the rule-based stage to measure its contribution to overall performance
2. Testing with artificially degraded document quality to evaluate robustness
3. Analysis of reasoning path quality across different document types and query complexities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited transparency in rule-based reward function construction and generalization across domains
- Dependency on high-quality annotated data for effective fine-grained list-wise ranking
- Lack of ablation studies to isolate individual stage contributions to overall performance
- No statistical significance testing or error analysis for reported improvements

## Confidence

Methodology: **Medium**
- Limited details on rule-based reward construction
- Unclear generalizability across domains
- Missing hyperparameter settings

- Improvements reported without statistical significance tests
- No error analysis provided
- Performance claims lack supporting ablation studies

Generalizability: **Low**
- Framework tested only on WebQA and MultimodalQA datasets
- No experiments on other multi-modal tasks or domains
- Unclear how approach scales to different data characteristics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the individual contributions of the rule-based and reasoning-based fine-tuning stages to overall performance.
2. Test the framework on additional multi-modal datasets (e.g., VQA, TextVQA) to assess generalizability and robustness.
3. Provide detailed implementation details, including the rule-based reward function and hyperparameter settings, to enable reproducibility.
