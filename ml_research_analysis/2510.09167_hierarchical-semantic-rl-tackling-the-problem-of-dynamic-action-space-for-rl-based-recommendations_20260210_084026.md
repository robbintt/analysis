core_contribution: HSRL introduces a Semantic Action Space (SAS) that maps dynamic

  from catalog changes. It uses a Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN) to generate SID

## Executive Summary
HSRL introduces a Semantic Action Space (SAS) that maps dynamic item actions into fixed-dimensional Semantic IDs (SIDs), decoupling policy learning from catalog changes. It uses a Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN) to generate SID tokens autoregressively, refining decisions via residual state modeling, and a Multi-Level Critic (MLC) to assign credit at each token level. On public benchmarks, HSRL achieves 12.308 Total Reward (+22.4% over HAC) and 13.084 Depth (+17.9%). In a 7-day online A/B test, it delivers 18.421% CVR lift with only 1.251% cost increase.

## Method Summary
HSRL addresses dynamic action spaces in RL-based recommendations by introducing Semantic IDs (SIDs) that represent item semantics in a fixed-dimensional space. The method employs a Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN) that generates SID tokens autoregressively, with each token refining the decision-making process through residual state modeling. A Multi-Level Critic (MLC) provides credit assignment at each token level. This architecture decouples policy learning from catalog changes, enabling efficient adaptation to dynamic item spaces while maintaining strong performance across various recommendation scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves 12.308 Total Reward (+22.4% over HAC) on public benchmarks
- Improves Depth metric to 13.084 (+17.9% over HAC)
- Delivers 18.421% CVR lift in 7-day online A/B test with only 1.251% cost increase

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by creating a semantic abstraction layer that remains stable despite catalog changes. By mapping items to SIDs and generating them autoregressively through HPN, the system can learn stable policies that generalize across item dynamics. The residual state modeling allows each token to refine previous decisions, while MLC ensures proper credit assignment throughout the hierarchical decision process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic embeddings**: Map items to fixed-dimensional semantic space; needed to create stable action representation despite catalog changes; quick check: verify embedding quality through similarity metrics
- **Autoregressive generation**: Sequentially generate SID tokens; needed to build complex decisions incrementally; quick check: monitor token generation consistency
- **Residual state modeling**: Refine decisions based on previous outputs; needed to improve decision accuracy at each step; quick check: validate residual learning effectiveness
- **Hierarchical credit assignment**: Multi-level value estimation; needed to properly attribute rewards across decision hierarchy; quick check: ensure credit flows correctly through levels
- **Dynamic action space handling**: Adapt to changing item catalogs; needed for real-world recommendation systems; quick check: test with varying catalog sizes
- **Policy-decoder separation**: Decouple policy from item mapping; needed to maintain stable learning; quick check: verify policy stability across catalog changes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
SAS (Semantic Action Space) -> HPN (Hierarchical Policy Network) -> SID tokens -> MLC (Multi-Level Critic) -> Action decoder

**Critical Path**
Item features → SID generation → HPN token refinement → MLC evaluation → Final action selection

**Design Tradeoffs**
Fixed SID dimensionality vs. expressiveness: Higher dimensionality captures more semantics but increases computational cost. The hierarchical approach trades sequential computation for stable policy learning.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor SID quality leads to policy instability; inadequate token refinement causes suboptimal recommendations; MLC misalignment results in incorrect credit assignment.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Validate SID embedding quality using similarity metrics on item attributes
2. Test HPN token generation consistency across different catalog sizes
3. Evaluate MLC credit assignment accuracy with synthetic reward scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on two public benchmarks and one short online A/B test (7 days)
- Limited analysis of computational overhead and memory requirements
- No exploration of performance in highly dynamic environments with frequent item attribute changes

## Confidence
**Medium** for major claims based on available evidence:
- Public benchmark results show consistent improvements over HAC
- Online A/B test demonstrates practical effectiveness
- Limited dataset diversity and short experiment duration reduce confidence

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method on a wider range of recommendation datasets, including those with high item turnover
2. Conduct a longer online A/B test with statistical significance analysis
3. Investigate the computational overhead and memory requirements of the proposed approach compared to existing methods
