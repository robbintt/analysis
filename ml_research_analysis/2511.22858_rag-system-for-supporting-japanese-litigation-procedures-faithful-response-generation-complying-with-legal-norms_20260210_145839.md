core_contribution: 'This study identifies key requirements for developing a norm-compliant
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to support Japanese medical litigation.
  It outlines three essential components: (1) restricting knowledge sources to those
  validated by expert communities to comply with procedural norms, (2) ensuring responses
  are faithful to retrieved context and avoiding reliance on outdated or hallucinated
  information, and (3) referencing knowledge sources with appropriate timestamps aligned
  to the specific issues in dispute.'

# RAG System for Supporting Japanese Litigation Procedures: Faithful Response Generation Complying with Legal Norms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22858
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22858
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Identifies three essential components for norm-compliant RAG systems in Japanese medical litigation: expert-validated knowledge sources, faithful context adherence, and timestamped citations

## Executive Summary
This study examines the requirements for developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to support Japanese medical litigation procedures. The research identifies critical challenges in ensuring legal norm compliance while generating accurate responses about time-sensitive medical and legal knowledge. The authors propose a framework that balances the need for accurate information retrieval with strict adherence to legal procedural requirements governing expert testimony and evidence presentation.

## Method Summary
The research presents a theoretical framework for developing norm-compliant RAG systems rather than implementing a working prototype. The methodology involves analyzing Japanese medical litigation procedures to identify key requirements for AI systems supporting legal processes. The study focuses on three core components: restricting knowledge sources to expert-validated materials, ensuring response faithfulness to retrieved context, and implementing temporal accuracy through appropriate timestamping. The approach emphasizes metadata management and citation networks to maintain legal compliance while providing accurate information retrieval.

## Key Results
- Identified three essential components for norm-compliant RAG systems: expert-validated knowledge sources, faithful context adherence, and timestamped citations
- Highlighted the critical challenge of managing time-sensitive medical and legal knowledge in litigation support
- Proposed using metadata and citation networks to ensure temporal accuracy in legal responses
- Emphasized that legal RAG systems must generate responses that comply with procedural norms governing expert testimony

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed system works by establishing strict constraints on knowledge sources and response generation mechanisms that align with legal procedural requirements. By limiting knowledge sources to expert-validated materials, the system ensures that only information recognized by legal authorities is used in generating responses. The emphasis on faithful context adherence prevents the system from introducing hallucinated or outdated information that could compromise legal proceedings. The timestamping mechanism ensures that responses reference the correct version of medical or legal knowledge relevant to the specific time period in question during litigation.

## Foundational Learning
- Legal norm compliance requirements: Understanding procedural rules governing expert testimony is essential because legal systems have strict standards for admissible evidence and expert statements. Quick check: Review jurisdiction-specific rules for expert witness testimony and evidence admissibility.
- Temporal reasoning in legal contexts: Time-sensitive knowledge management is critical because medical and legal standards evolve, and litigation often involves determining what was known or accepted practice at specific historical moments. Quick check: Map temporal dependencies between medical guidelines and legal precedents in relevant case law.
- Metadata and citation network management: Proper source attribution and version tracking are necessary because legal proceedings require verifiable evidence chains and clear documentation of knowledge sources. Quick check: Design metadata schema that captures source authority, timestamp, and citation relationships.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Knowledge Source Validator -> Temporal Context Manager -> Faithful Response Generator
Critical path: Legal query → Expert-validated retrieval → Temporal constraint application → Context-faithful generation → Timestamped response
Design tradeoffs: The system prioritizes legal compliance over response flexibility, requiring strict source validation that may limit the breadth of retrievable information but ensures procedural adherence.
Failure signatures: Responses may be incomplete if expert-validated sources are unavailable, or may reject valid queries if temporal constraints cannot be satisfied with available knowledge.
First experiments: 1) Test source validation accuracy by comparing system-retrieved expert-approved documents against ground truth legal authority lists. 2) Evaluate temporal constraint satisfaction by measuring accuracy of timestamp-aligned responses in simulated cases. 3) Assess faithfulness metrics by comparing generated responses against original context passages.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, as it focuses primarily on establishing theoretical requirements rather than identifying research gaps.

## Limitations
- Based on theoretical analysis rather than empirical validation of a working system
- Lacks quantitative performance data or error rate measurements
- Focus on Japanese medical litigation may limit generalizability to other legal domains
- Does not demonstrate handling of complex temporal reasoning in real legal cases

## Confidence
- High confidence in identifying the need for expert-validated knowledge sources in legal RAG systems
- Medium confidence in the proposed three-component framework, as it lacks empirical validation
- Low confidence in the specific implementation details for temporal accuracy and citation management

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test a prototype system that enforces temporal constraints on retrieved documents based on case-specific timestamps
2. Conduct a user study with legal experts to evaluate the practical utility and accuracy of the proposed norm-compliant RAG system
3. Perform error analysis comparing hallucinated vs. faithful responses in a controlled legal question-answering dataset
