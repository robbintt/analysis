# A Usable GAN-Based Tool for Synthetic ECG Generation in Cardiac Amyloidosis Research

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.08260
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08260
- **Reference count:** 39
- **Primary result:** GAN-based tool for generating synthetic ECG beats to address data scarcity and imbalance in cardiac amyloidosis research.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a GAN-based tool for generating synthetic ECG beats to address data scarcity and imbalance in cardiac amyloidosis (CA) research. The core method uses class-specific GANs with bidirectional LSTMs to produce realistic synthetic ECG signals for different beat types, enabling data augmentation for machine learning models. A user-friendly GUI and separate training/generation scripts support clinical researchers in producing labelled synthetic data. Planned experiments aim to evaluate morphological fidelity, statistical similarity, impact on AI-ECG performance, and clustering stability using metrics like DTW distance, KS test, AUROC, and silhouette coefficient. The tool targets improved early diagnosis and patient stratification in CA by augmenting limited datasets with physiologically plausible synthetic ECG beats.

## Method Summary
The method employs class-specific GANs trained separately per beat type to generate synthetic ECG beats. Each GAN uses a bidirectional LSTM generator (input=187, hidden=128) and discriminator (input=187, hidden=256) to model temporal dependencies in 187-sample beat representations. The architecture uses BCE loss, Adam optimizer (lr=2e-4), batch size 96, and 3000 epochs per class. Class-specific training aims to preserve minority class distributions better than conditional generators. The system includes a Streamlit GUI for clinical users to train generators and produce synthetic data, with outputs merged into downstream machine learning pipelines for CA diagnosis and phenotyping.

## Key Results
- GAN-based synthetic ECG generation tool designed specifically for cardiac amyloidosis research
- Class-specific GAN architecture with bidirectional LSTMs to preserve minority class morphologies
- User-friendly GUI and modular Python scripts for training and generation workflows
- Planned evaluation protocol covering morphological fidelity, statistical similarity, clinical utility, and clustering stability
- Implementation on MIT-BIH dataset with 5 beat types mapped to clinically relevant categories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Class-specific GANs trained separately per beat type preserve minority class distributions better than conditional or global generators.
- Mechanism: Isolating training to single-class subsets reduces mode competition across heterogeneous morphologies, allowing the discriminator to specialize on intra-class variance rather than inter-class boundaries.
- Core assumption: Sufficient intra-class variability exists within each beat type for the generator to learn a meaningful distribution.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "class-specific generators that focus on reproducing the morphology and variability of a single beat type"; [section IV.C] "Training is performed separately for each arrhythmia class"
- Break condition: If a class has fewer than ~100-200 samples, the generator may overfit rather than generalize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bidirectional LSTM in both generator and discriminator captures forward and backward temporal dependencies critical for ECG wave morphology.
- Mechanism: ECG beats exhibit temporally symmetric features; bidirectional processing allows the generator to condition each timestep on full-sequence context, producing more physiologically coherent waveforms.
- Core assumption: The 187-point beat representation captures complete morphological information.
- Evidence anchors: [section IV.B] "bidirectional LSTM layer with input size 187... to model temporal dependencies along the beat"
- Break condition: If generated beats show discontinuities at beat boundaries, consider attention-based alternatives.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Synthetic augmentation improves clustering stability for CA phenotype discovery by densifying sparse regions of the latent space.
- Mechanism: Small CA cohorts produce unstable cluster assignments due to sampling noise; GAN-generated samples that preserve CA-specific distributions increase effective sample size.
- Core assumption: The GAN captures CA-specific morphological features accurately enough that synthetic samples lie within the true distribution.
- Evidence anchors: [section III] "when the number of confirmed CA cases is small... Synthetic ECG beats generated by GANs can help alleviate these limitations"
- Break condition: If synthetic samples cluster separately from real samples, the generator is introducing distribution shift.

## Foundational Learning

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** - Why needed: Understanding the adversarial training dynamics explains why mode collapse and vanishing gradients are key failure modes to monitor.
- Quick check: Can you explain why the generator's loss being "binary cross-entropy with target label 1" encourages realistic outputs?

- **Bidirectional RNNs / LSTMs** - Why needed: The architecture choice depends on understanding that bidirectional processing provides full-sequence context at each timestep.
- Quick check: What information does a bidirectional LSTM have at timestep t that a unidirectional LSTM does not?

- **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** - Why needed: The evaluation protocol uses DTW to assess morphological fidelity.
- Quick check: Why might DTW be preferred over Euclidean distance for comparing ECG beats with slight temporal variations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** CSV input → PyTorch Dataset (class-filtered) → DataLoader (batch_size=96, shuffled) → Generator (BiLSTM→FC→FC→Dropout→Linear) → Discriminator (BiLSTM→Flatten→FC→FC→Dropout→Sigmoid) → BCE loss → Adam optimizer
- **Critical path:** 1) Prepare CSV with columns 0-186 (beat samples) + column 187 (class label) 2) Run train_gan.py or GUI Step 1-4 to train class-specific generator 3) Monitor loss curves for convergence 4) Run generate_signals.py to produce synthetic beats 5) Merge synthetic CSV with real data for downstream tasks
- **Design tradeoffs:** Class-specific vs. conditional GAN (separate generators increase training time but reduce mode competition); 1D beat-level vs. multi-beat sequences (current architecture generates isolated beats); single-lead vs. 12-lead (architecture operates on single-channel tensors)
- **Failure signatures:** Mode collapse (generated beats look nearly identical); vanishing gradients (discriminator loss approaches 0 rapidly); overfitting (synthetic beats are near-duplicates of training samples)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce MIT-BIH training on majority class (normal beats) to verify baseline quality 2) Train on minority class (e.g., fusion beats) to assess class-specific training benefits 3) Quantitative evaluation on one metric (DTW) to compute morphological fidelity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does GAN-based augmentation improve the sensitivity and calibration of AI-ECG models for detecting cardiac amyloidosis (CA) compared to naive oversampling?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VI.A, "Experiment 3," states the plan to assess clinical utility by comparing classifiers trained on original, oversampled, and GAN-augmented cohorts using AUROC and Brier scores.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper presents the tool and protocol but reports no empirical results from these comparative experiments on CA-specific data yet.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Execution of the proposed protocol demonstrating statistically significant improvements in sensitivity and AUPRC for models trained on GAN-augmented data versus baselines.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the class-specific generators preserve the subtle, multivariate distributions of CA-specific physiological features (e.g., low QRS voltage, pseudoinfarction patterns)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VI.A, "Experiment 2," proposes verifying physiological plausibility by comparing real and synthetic feature distributions using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and Hotelling's $T^2$ test.
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation is validated on the general MIT-BIH dataset, but it remains unproven whether the architecture captures the distinct, heterogeneous phenotypes specific to CA.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Results showing non-significant distributional shifts (p > 0.05) and small effect sizes (Cohen's d) between real and synthetic beats for CA-specific indices like the LV mass–to–QRS voltage ratio.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does augmenting sparse CA datasets with synthetic beats stabilize unsupervised clustering to effectively distinguish between disease subtypes (e.g., AL vs. ATTR)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VI.A, "Experiment 4," outlines the need to evaluate "latent-structure and clustering stability" using metrics like the silhouette coefficient and adjusted Rand index.
- **Why unresolved:** While the authors argue that synthetic data should improve density estimation, they have not yet demonstrated that the generated beats lead to more robust or clinically meaningful cluster assignments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstration of higher Jaccard similarity across bootstrap resamples and improved alignment of clusters with clinical labels in the GAN-augmented setting.

## Limitations
- Evaluation protocol remains largely unimplemented with critical validation experiments only planned but not demonstrated
- Class-specific GAN architecture shows theoretical advantages but no ablation studies compare it against conditional GANs
- Bidirectional LSTM design choice lacks empirical justification through comparison with alternative architectures
- Core claim about improved clustering stability for CA phenotype discovery remains unvalidated

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Basic GAN architecture specification and training procedure (loss functions, hyperparameters, model structure)
- **Medium confidence:** Claims about class-specific GANs preserving minority class distributions (supported by design logic but no empirical validation)
- **Low confidence:** Claims about improved clustering stability and CA phenotype discovery (no experimental results provided)

## Next Checks
1. Implement and run the planned DTW-based evaluation on MIT-BIH data to establish baseline morphological fidelity before CA experiments
2. Conduct ablation study comparing class-specific GANs against conditional GANs on minority classes to verify the claimed advantage
3. Generate synthetic samples for a small CA dataset (if available) and run the clustering stability experiment with bootstrap resampling to test the core hypothesis
