# Memp: Exploring Agent Procedural Memory

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06433
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06433
- Reference count: 7
- Agents with procedural memory achieve up to 50% accuracy gains and 50% fewer steps compared to agents without memory.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of brittle procedural memory in LLM-based agents by proposing Memp, a framework that distills past agent trajectories into reusable procedural knowledge and explores strategies for building, retrieving, and updating this memory. By leveraging both fine-grained step-by-step instructions and higher-level script abstractions, agents can reuse learned behaviors and reduce redundant exploration. Evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld benchmarks shows that Memp improves task success rates and efficiency, with up to 50% accuracy gains and 50% fewer steps compared to agents without memory. The framework also supports continual learning through dynamic memory updates, and procedural memory built from strong models can transfer effectively to weaker models. Memp marks a step toward self-improving, adaptable agents.

## Method Summary
Memp addresses the challenge of brittle procedural memory in LLM-based agents by introducing a framework that distills past agent trajectories into reusable procedural knowledge. The approach leverages both fine-grained step-by-step instructions and higher-level script abstractions to enable agents to reuse learned behaviors and reduce redundant exploration. The framework supports continual learning through dynamic memory updates and enables transfer of procedural knowledge from strong models to weaker ones. Evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld benchmarks demonstrates significant improvements in task success rates and efficiency.

## Key Results
- Up to 50% accuracy gains compared to agents without memory
- 50% fewer steps needed to complete tasks
- Procedural memory from strong models transfers effectively to weaker models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Memp works by distilling agent trajectories into structured procedural knowledge that can be efficiently retrieved and reused. The framework captures both detailed step-by-step instructions and abstract script representations, allowing agents to adapt learned behaviors to new but similar tasks. The memory system supports continual updates, enabling agents to refine their knowledge base over time. The dual representation approach balances specificity with generalization, making the stored knowledge both actionable and adaptable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Trajectory Distillation**: Converting raw agent paths into structured procedural knowledge; needed to transform unstructured experiences into reusable patterns; quick check: compare trajectory complexity before/after distillation.
- **Script Abstraction**: Creating higher-level representations of common task sequences; needed to enable generalization across similar tasks; quick check: measure abstraction accuracy on held-out task variants.
- **Memory Retrieval**: Efficiently accessing relevant procedural knowledge for current tasks; needed to reduce redundant exploration; quick check: retrieval precision/recall on task-query pairs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Memory Bank -> Retrieval Engine -> Action Selector -> Environment

**Critical Path**
1. Agent executes task in environment
2. Trajectory captured and stored in Memory Bank
3. Retrieval Engine processes task and queries Memory Bank
4. Relevant procedural knowledge retrieved and abstracted
5. Action Selector uses retrieved knowledge to guide next actions
6. Process repeats with continual memory updates

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Fine-grained vs. abstract representations: detailed steps offer precision but may overfit; abstractions generalize better but may lack specificity
- Memory size vs. retrieval efficiency: larger banks capture more knowledge but slow retrieval
- Update frequency vs. stability: frequent updates enable adaptation but may introduce noise

**Failure Signatures**
- Retrieval misses: agent repeats failed actions despite stored successful alternatives
- Overgeneralization: abstracted scripts apply inappropriately to dissimilar tasks
- Memory staleness: outdated procedures lead to suboptimal or failed task completion

**3 First Experiments**
1. Measure task success rate improvement when procedural memory is added to baseline agent
2. Compare performance using only step-by-step vs. only script-level representations
3. Test memory retrieval accuracy under increasing bank sizes and task diversity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two specific domains (TravelPlanner and ALFWorld), limiting generalizability
- Effectiveness on tasks requiring extensive commonsense reasoning or ambiguous instructions remains untested
- Long-term stability under continuous operation not explored

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core architectural design is technically sound and well-motivated; specific improvements (up to 50% accuracy gains, 50% fewer steps) are supported by benchmark results.

**Medium Confidence**: Continual learning mechanism effectiveness and transfer learning claims are demonstrated but require broader validation in more complex scenarios.

**Low Confidence**: Framework's scalability to diverse real-world tasks and robustness under extended continuous operation remain uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Memp on additional benchmarks spanning diverse domains (robotics simulation, open-world games, real-world API interactions) to assess cross-domain applicability.
2. Implement longitudinal study with continuous operation over hundreds of tasks, monitoring memory retrieval accuracy, storage efficiency, and performance degradation/improvement.
3. Conduct systematic experiments varying the gap between source (strong) and target (weak) models, testing memory transfer across multiple model pairs.
