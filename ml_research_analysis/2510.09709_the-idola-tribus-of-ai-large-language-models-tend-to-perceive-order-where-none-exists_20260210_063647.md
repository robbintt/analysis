# The Idola Tribus of AI: Large Language Models tend to perceive order where none exists

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09709
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09709
- Reference count: 40
- Large language models frequently generate incorrect explanations for randomly generated number sequences, even when using advanced reasoning models.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models exhibit "Idola Tribus," a tendency to perceive order where none exists. Testing five LLMs across 724 number series (ranging from simple arithmetic to random), researchers found that while models accurately identified patterns in ordered sequences, they frequently generated incorrect explanations for random series. This pattern persisted even with chain-of-thought reasoning models, revealing a fundamental limitation in LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The study tested five LLMs (GPT-4.1, o3, o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking, Llama 3.3) on 724 number series across eight categories: arithmetic, geometric, difference, quasi-arithmetic, quasi-geometric, quasi-difference, random-increasing, and random. Each series contained five positive integers. Responses were evaluated by an LLM-as-a-Judge (o3) using four options: correct alignment with preset rule, correct non-alignment, incorrect explanation, or random series statement. Two prompt variants were tested: standard and "random-allowed."

## Key Results
- All five models correctly identified regularities in all arithmetic and geometric series (100% success)
- Success rate for random series remained notably low at approximately 26.8% average across models
- The tendency to force pattern explanations persisted even when models recognized their own explanations as invalid
- The "random-allowed" prompt intervention improved but did not eliminate the Idola Tribus bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** LLMs exhibit a forced-pattern generation bias that can be partially mitigated by explicitly validating "no pattern" as permissible
- **Mechanism:** Standard instruction-tuning may implicitly condition models to always provide structured responses. Modifying prompts to allow randomness shifts probability distribution to permit "I don't know" without penalty
- **Core assumption:** Failure is partly due to instructional alignment rather than pure computational inability to detect randomness
- **Evidence:** Abstract notes models "frequently over-recognized patterns" when analyzing random series; section 5 states models "tend to force themselves to explain patterns unless explicitly instructed"
- **Break condition:** If success rates for random series remain low even with explicit "random" instructions, mechanism shifts from instructional bias to fundamental inductive incapacity

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Chain-of-Thought verification mechanisms fail to veto logically inconsistent outputs when models creatively overfit to noise
- **Mechanism:** Reasoning process generates plausible narrative (e.g., relating numbers to atomic weights) that creates local coherence bypassing strict logical consistency checker
- **Core assumption:** Self-evaluation component is calibrated to detect mathematical errors but susceptible to "creative" but false semantic associations
- **Evidence:** Abstract shows "tendency persisted even when models recognized their own explanations as invalid"; section 5 notes o3/o4-mini generated "creative ideas... including interpretations based on atomic numbers... even though these were inconsistent"
- **Break condition:** If future models show 100% rejection of contradictory self-generated patterns, this mechanism of "creative bypass" is resolved

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** High performance on ordered sequences creates false sense of reliability that masks Idola Tribus bias
- **Mechanism:** Near-perfect accuracy (100%) on arithmetic/geometric series reinforces "pattern-existence" prior, making models statistically likely to invent patterns in noise to maintain high confidence
- **Core assumption:** Training distribution over-represents ordered data, leading to prior that "inputs usually contain patterns"
- **Evidence:** Section 4 shows "All five models correctly identified regularities in all arithmetic series... while success rate for random series remained notably low"; Table 2 shows 100% success on ordered vs ~26.8% on random
- **Break condition:** If model trained on balanced dataset of 50% random / 50% ordered sequences, bias should theoretically diminish

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Inductive vs. Deductive Consistency**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper highlights that while LLMs excel at deduction (applying known rule), they struggle with induction (inferring rule from data) when data has no rule
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between a model failing to apply a rule (deduction) vs. inventing a rule that doesn't exist (inductive hallucination)?

- **Concept: LLM-as-a-Judge Limitations**
  - **Why needed here:** Study used LLM (o3) to evaluate other LLMs' outputs. This meta-evaluation is standard but imperfect
  - **Quick check question:** If an LLM evaluates its own output as "valid" despite it being mathematically false, what does this imply about reliability of automated evaluation pipelines?

- **Concept: Apophenia (Idola Tribus)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core theoretical lens of the paper. It frames AI error not as "bug" but as structural bias similar to human cognitive bias (seeing faces in clouds)
  - **Quick check question:** Does error rate increase or decrease when input data looks "almost" ordered vs. purely random? (Answer: Paper suggests quasi-ordered is actually harder to correctly label as "deviating" than random)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input number series -> Target LLM (GPT-4.1, o3, o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking, Llama 3.3) -> Prompt Interface (Standard vs. Random-Allowed) -> Evaluator LLM (o3) -> Success/Failure classification
- **Critical path:** 1. Inject "Random-Allowed" instruction -> 2. Model inference (Generation of pattern or "random" declaration) -> 3. Consistency check (Does explanation strictly match provided numbers?)
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Precision vs. Recall: Allowing "I don't know" increases logical precision but may reduce recall
  - Creativity vs. Grounding: High-temperature settings generate creative hypotheses (atomic numbers, tarot) useful for open-ended tasks but hazardous for strict logic tasks
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Over-fitting: Model generates complex, high-order polynomial or semantic link (e.g., "Jersey numbers of quarterbacks") to explain 5 random integers
  - Self-Contradiction: Model outputs pattern description but simultaneously acknowledges series is random in reasoning trace
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Probe:** Run target model on 724-series dataset without "random" instructions to establish Idola Tribus baseline error rate
  2. **Intervention Test:** Re-run with "Random-Allowed" prompt. Quantify delta in success rates specifically for random and quasi-ordered categories
  3. **Self-Correction Audit:** Ask model to generate pattern for random series, then feed back asking "Does this rule strictly explain all numbers?" to measure self-consistency gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can specific fine-tuning strategies effectively eliminate the *Idola Tribus* bias without reducing model's creative capabilities?
- **Basis in paper:** Discussion states "exploring effective fine-tuning strategies is a key next step in tackling the issue," referencing methods like Zelikman et al. (2022) for enhancing logical reasoning
- **Why unresolved:** Study identifies bias but does not implement or test fine-tuning interventions; only suggests future research should focus on developing "bias-free" models
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing standard models against models fine-tuned on logical consistency tasks to measure if tendency to hallucinate patterns decreases while valid creative output remains intact

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does tendency to over-recognize patterns in random integer sequences transfer to complex, real-world domains such as data analysis or qualitative reasoning?
- **Basis in paper:** Paper focuses entirely on integer sequences but cites "potential risks for real-world LLM applications" like AI agents and retrieval-augmented generation
- **Why unresolved:** Limitations section notes experiment was restricted to number series, leaving behavior in semantic, noisy, or real-world data environments untested
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Replication using non-mathematical data (e.g., randomly sorted historical events or noisy financial logs) to see if models similarly hallucinate causal narratives where none exist

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Why do chain-of-thought mechanisms in "thinking" models fail to suppress outputs that model has internally evaluated as incorrect?
- **Basis in paper:** Results show models like o3 "generated false patterns even in cases where it itself recognized them as incorrect," indicating failure in self-evaluation modification process
- **Why unresolved:** Paper observes disconnect between internal validity checks and final output generation but does not determine if this is due to architectural constraints or compulsion to provide answer
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Mechanistic analysis of internal reasoning traces in thinking models to identify where "invalid" signal is generated and why it fails to inhibit final "valid" generation token

## Limitations
- Meta-evaluation using LLM (o3) as judge introduces potential bias cascades if judge model shares same Idola Tribus tendency
- Experimental scope constrained to integer sequences with fixed term counts (5), limiting generalizability to other pattern types or sequence lengths
- "Random-Allowed" prompt intervention improves but does not eliminate Idola Tribus bias, suggesting either fundamental inductive limitations or insufficient prompt engineering

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Empirical observation that LLMs generate false patterns for random series is well-supported by data (average 26.8% success on random vs 100% on ordered)
- **Medium confidence:** Hypothesis that this represents fundamental inductive bias (Idola Tribus) rather than prompt-engineering issue, since even advanced reasoning models fail despite self-checking
- **Low confidence:** Claim that meta-evaluation using o3 is unbiased, given same model used both as generator and judge in different contexts

## Next Checks
1. **External validation:** Have human experts evaluate subset of LLM-generated pattern explanations to determine if automated judge (o3) agrees with human assessments of validity
2. **Dataset variation:** Test same models on sequences with 3, 7, and 10 terms to determine if sequence length affects Idola Tribus bias magnitude
3. **Cross-architecture testing:** Apply same evaluation protocol to non-transformer architectures (e.g., traditional ML regressors or statistical methods) to establish whether pattern-overfitting is unique to LLMs or general machine learning phenomenon
