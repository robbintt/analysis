# Lost in the Mix: Evaluating LLM Understanding of Code-Switched Text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14012
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14012
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: LLMs show asymmetric vulnerabilities to code-switching, with non-English tokens embedded in English text consistently degrading performance, while the reverse often improves comprehension

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how large language models handle code-switched text—where multiple languages are mixed within a single discourse—which is common in multilingual communities and online content. The authors generate code-switched variants of established reasoning benchmarks using a linguistically grounded LLM pipeline that respects grammatical constraints. They find that embedding non-English tokens into English text consistently degrades LLM performance, even when switches follow linguistic rules, suggesting structural processing difficulties rather than token-level unfamiliarity. Conversely, embedding English into other languages often improves comprehension, especially when models are weaker in the matrix language.

The study reveals that prompt-based mitigation shows inconsistent results across different models, while fine-tuning on code-switched data leads to more reliable, though partial, performance recovery. These findings highlight the need for more adaptive strategies to ensure robust LLM performance in real-world multilingual settings, where code-switching is prevalent. The asymmetric performance patterns suggest that structural processing challenges, rather than simple token unfamiliarity, underlie the observed degradation.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate LLM comprehension of code-switched text using a linguistically grounded generative pipeline that creates code-switched variants of established reasoning benchmarks. They systematically embed non-English tokens into English text and vice versa, following grammatical constraints. Performance is measured across multiple benchmarks and language pairs. The study tests both prompt-based mitigation strategies and fine-tuning approaches to assess their effectiveness in improving comprehension of code-switched content.

## Key Results
- Embedding non-English tokens into English text consistently degrades LLM performance across multiple benchmarks
- Embedding English into other languages often improves comprehension, especially for models weaker in the matrix language
- Fine-tuning on code-switched data provides more reliable performance recovery than prompt-based mitigation strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The observed performance patterns stem from structural processing challenges in LLMs when handling code-switched text. When non-English tokens are embedded in English text, models struggle with the structural discontinuity, suggesting limitations in their ability to process mixed-language inputs. The asymmetric improvement when English is embedded into other languages indicates that models leverage their stronger English capabilities to aid comprehension in weaker languages.

## Foundational Learning
- Code-switching: The alternation between two or more languages within a single conversation or discourse. Why needed: Understanding this phenomenon is crucial as it's common in multilingual communities and affects LLM performance.
- Matrix language: The dominant language in a code-switched utterance that provides the grammatical framework. Why needed: Critical for understanding how models process mixed-language inputs and the observed asymmetric performance patterns.
- Linguistic constraints: Grammatical rules governing where and how code-switching can occur. Why needed: The study respects these constraints in generating test data, making results more representative of natural code-switching.
- Tokenization effects: How language models break down and process mixed-language text. Why needed: Helps distinguish between surface-level token handling issues and deeper semantic processing limitations.
- Fine-tuning: Additional training on specific data types to improve model performance. Why needed: One of the mitigation strategies tested, showing partial but reliable improvements in handling code-switched text.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input text -> Tokenization -> Attention mechanisms -> Semantic processing -> Output generation
Critical path: Tokenization and attention mechanisms are most critical, as they directly handle the mixed-language input and determine how information flows through the model.
Design tradeoffs: Models must balance between maintaining language-specific processing capabilities and developing mechanisms to handle language transitions smoothly.
Failure signatures: Performance degradation when non-English tokens are embedded in English text, with inconsistent improvements from prompt-based interventions.
First experiments:
1. Test model performance on naturally occurring code-switched social media data
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating tokenization effects from semantic processing
3. Evaluate fine-tuning across broader language pairs and code-switching patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited set of language pairs and code-switching patterns tested
- Generative pipeline may not fully capture natural code-switching complexity
- Focus primarily on comprehension tasks, leaving generation performance unexplored
- Unclear mechanisms behind asymmetric performance patterns
- Inconsistent results from prompt-based mitigation strategies

## Confidence
- High confidence: Code-switching generally degrades LLM performance in comprehension tasks
- Medium confidence: Specific patterns of asymmetric performance degradation
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of fine-tuning as mitigation strategy
- Low confidence: Generalizability of prompt-based mitigation approaches

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate model performance on naturally occurring code-switched text from social media and multilingual communities to validate findings against real-world data
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating tokenization effects from semantic processing limitations to better understand the root causes of performance degradation
3. Test the fine-tuning approach across a broader range of language pairs and code-switching patterns to assess generalizability and identify optimal training strategies
