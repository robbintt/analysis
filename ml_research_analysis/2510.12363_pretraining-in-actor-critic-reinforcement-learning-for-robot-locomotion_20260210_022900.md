# Pretraining in Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Robot Locomotion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12363
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12363
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Pretraining improves sample efficiency by 36.9% and task performance by 7.3% in robot locomotion RL

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning for robot locomotion tasks. The authors propose a pretraining method that leverages exploration-based data collection to learn embodiment-specific knowledge before fine-tuning on actual tasks. The approach is evaluated across 9 distinct robot locomotion environments with 3 different robot embodiments, demonstrating significant improvements in both sample efficiency and task performance compared to random initialization.

## Method Summary
The proposed method consists of three stages: exploration-based data collection, pretraining, and reinforcement learning. During the exploration phase, diverse dynamic transition data is gathered through controlled exploration of the robot's capabilities. This data is then used to train a Proprioceptive Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained weights from this model are subsequently loaded into both actor and critic networks to warm-start the policy optimization process for actual locomotion tasks. This initialization strategy provides the RL algorithm with a better starting point that already encodes useful embodiment knowledge.

## Key Results
- Sample efficiency improved by 36.9% on average across all tested environments
- Task performance increased by 7.3% compared to random initialization
- Systematic validation across 9 distinct robot locomotion environments with 3 different robot embodiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the concept of embodiment-specific knowledge that can be learned independently of specific tasks. By collecting diverse exploration data that captures the robot's dynamic capabilities and physical constraints, the PIDM learns useful representations of how the robot's actions affect its proprioceptive states. This learned knowledge provides a better initialization for the actor-critic networks than random weights, effectively transferring prior knowledge to new tasks and reducing the amount of task-specific exploration needed.

## Foundational Learning
- Reinforcement Learning fundamentals: why needed - to understand the actor-critic framework being improved; quick check - can explain policy gradient methods and value function approximation
- Proprioceptive sensing in robotics: why needed - the method specifically uses proprioceptive data for pretraining; quick check - can describe joint angles, velocities, and torques as proprioceptive signals
- Inverse dynamics modeling: why needed - core component of the pretraining stage; quick check - can explain how to predict actions from state transitions
- Sim-to-real transfer: why needed - evaluation is in simulation but applications are real robots; quick check - can identify key challenges in transferring learned policies to physical hardware

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Exploration Data Collection -> PIDM Training -> Actor-Critic Weight Initialization -> RL Fine-tuning

**Critical Path:**
The most critical sequence is: (1) diverse exploration data collection, (2) effective PIDM training, (3) proper weight initialization transfer. Each stage must succeed for the next to provide benefits.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Exploration vs. efficiency: More diverse exploration data improves pretraining but increases initial computational cost
- Model complexity: More complex PIDM models may capture better dynamics but require more data and computation
- Weight transfer strategy: Loading pretrained weights to both actor and critic vs. only actor involves a tradeoff between initialization quality and potential interference

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor exploration data diversity leading to suboptimal PIDM learning
- Overfitting during PIDM training that doesn't generalize to RL tasks
- Catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning pretrained weights
- Sim-to-real gaps that prevent transfer of learned knowledge

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Vary exploration data diversity and measure impact on final RL performance
2. Compare pretraining with different model architectures for the PIDM
3. Test weight initialization strategies (actor only vs. actor+critic) across different robot embodiments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to simulation environments, with unclear transferability to real-world robots
- Reliance on quality and diversity of exploration data collection, which may be challenging in constrained environments
- Computational overhead during pretraining stage not fully characterized, potentially offsetting sample efficiency gains

## Confidence
- High confidence: Pretraining improves sample efficiency and task performance in simulation environments
- Medium confidence: Generalizability of results to real-world scenarios
- Low confidence: Computational efficiency claims regarding total training time

## Next Checks
1. Conduct transfer learning study to evaluate pretrained models on physical robots, measuring performance degradation due to sim-to-real gaps and identifying key factors limiting real-world applicability.

2. Perform ablation study isolating contribution of each pretraining component (exploration strategy, PIDM training, weight initialization) to quantify their individual impact on final performance.

3. Implement resource-aware analysis comparing total training time (pretraining + fine-tuning) against baseline methods to determine practical efficiency gains in deployment scenarios with limited computational budgets.
