# Integrating AI and Ensemble Forecasting: Explainable Materials Planning with Scorecards and Trend Insights for a Large-Scale Manufacturer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01006
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01006
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: AI-powered ensemble forecasting for after-sales demand across 90+ countries and 6,000+ parts with explainable scorecards and trend diagnostics

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an AI-powered ensemble forecasting framework for after-sales demand planning across 90+ countries and 6,000+ parts. It integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models within a Pareto-aware, cluster-segmented architecture, producing calibrated forecasts with prediction intervals. Large language models embedded in the analytics layer generate role-specific scorecards and trend diagnostics, decomposing accuracy by revenue share, bias, and geography. The system enables planners to move from assessing forecast accuracy to understanding directional trends and prioritizing interventions, closing the loop between forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions.

## Method Summary
The method employs Pareto-aware segmentation to model high-revenue items individually while pooling long-tail items via clusters, combined with horizon-aware ensembling using statistical, ML, and DL models. Two-step LLM context engineering generates reproducible, explainable narratives through orchestrator and specialist agents. Trend and change-point detection aligned with known regimes (e.g., COVID-19) helps distinguish model drift from structural demand shifts. The system uses rolling-origin validation, constrained optimization for ensemble weights, and hierarchical reconciliation to ensure forecast coherence.

## Key Results
- Ensemble forecasting framework integrates statistical, ML, and DL models with Pareto-aware segmentation
- LLM-powered analytics generate role-specific scorecards and trend diagnostics with business context
- System produces reproducible, explainable outputs aligned with business objectives for 6,000+ parts across 90+ countries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Segmented ensemble forecasting with Pareto-aware pooling may improve accuracy and computational efficiency for skewed demand distributions.
- Mechanism: High-revenue items (~10% of parts, ~80% of revenue) are modeled individually while long-tail items share statistical strength via cluster-based global models; ensemble weights are horizon- and tier-aware, learned via rolling-origin validation against WMAPE.
- Core assumption: Cluster descriptors (ADI, CV², seasonality strength, lifecycle state) capture enough structure for pooling to help rather than harm.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states Pareto-aware segmentation; section 3 describes revenue skew and clustering; no direct evidence from neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If cluster heterogeneity is high, shared parameters may degrade accuracy vs. individual models.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-step LLM context engineering with role-aware contracts can convert quantitative forecast outputs into reproducible, explainable narratives for diverse stakeholders.
- Mechanism: LLM Model 1 (orchestrator) normalizes user intent into a canonical job specification using static task-specific prompts; LLM Model 2 (specialist) executes domain calculations and validation, returning structured reflections; contracts enforce metric definitions, formatting, and quality checks so repeated requests yield consistent outputs.
- Core assumption: Private LLMs on-premise/VPC can reliably follow multi-step contracts without hallucinating metrics or violating definitions.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions role-specific scorecards; section 5.2 describes orchestrator assembling artifacts; Forecast Critic paper cited but doesn't validate this mechanism.
- Break condition: If prompt contracts are underspecified or context window is exceeded, narratives may drift or omit required checks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Trend and change-point detection aligned with known regimes can help distinguish model drift from structural demand shifts.
- Mechanism: Trend module computes slopes and detects change points for MAPE/WMAPE and bias over user-selected windows; regime flags (shock/restriction/recovery) and lifecycle covariates attribute movements to known factors rather than misclassifying them as degradation.
- Core assumption: Regime labels and covariates are accurate and timely; change-point detection thresholds are calibrated to avoid false positives in noisy, intermittent series.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract describes trend module with regime alignment; section 3 mentions COVID effects via regime flags; no direct validation in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If regime labels are missing or lagged, change-point attribution may misclassify external shocks as model failure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Intermittent demand forecasting (Croston, SBA, TSB)**
  - Why needed: After-sales parts exhibit zero-inflated, long-tailed demand; standard ETS/ARIMA are biased for intermittent series.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why simple exponential smoothing over-forecasts when demand is intermittent?

- **Concept: Forecast combination / ensembling**
  - Why needed: No single model dominates across diverse series; ensembles hedge model-selection risk and stabilize under regime shifts.
  - Quick check: What are two benefits of combining statistical, ML, and DL models versus selecting a single best model?

- **Concept: Hierarchical reconciliation (MinT)**
  - Why needed: Demand is hierarchical (country→region; item→family); forecasts must cohere across levels for S&OP consistency.
  - Quick check: Why does unconstrained bottom-up forecasting often produce incoherent aggregate plans?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
- Client (React/JS) -> REST API (FastAPI/Python) -> AI Agents (Orchestrator + Specialist) -> Forecasting Engine -> Database

**Critical path:**
1. User specifies intent via dashboard → REST request with role metadata
2. Orchestrator LLM builds canonical specification using contract prompts
3. Forecasting engine executes ensemble; outputs stored with versioning
4. Specialist LLM computes KPIs, trend diagnostics, validation checks
5. Orchestrator assembles narrative, tables, figures → returned as deterministic response

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Pareto segmentation trades granularity for statistical strength
- Two-LLM orchestration trades latency and cost for separation of concerns and contract enforcement
- Horizon-aware weighting adds complexity vs. simple averaging but aligns with business loss functions

**Failure signatures:**
- Cluster heterogeneity causes long-tail accuracy degradation
- Contract drift: LLM omits required tables or misstates definitions
- Regime mislabeling: COVID or lifecycle shifts misattributed to model failure
- Reconciliation breaks: Aggregate/leaf forecasts diverge due to missing hierarchy constraints

**First 3 experiments:**
1. A/B test: Pareto-segmented ensemble vs. all-individual models on held-out country-part series; measure WMAPE by revenue tier
2. Contract validation: Run identical requests 10× through two-step LLM pipeline; verify narrative consistency and table completeness against contract specification
3. Regime sensitivity: Withhold COVID regime flags for subset of series; compare trend classification accuracy vs. labeled ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does forecast accuracy of parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques (adapters, prompt tuning) compare to full model retraining when adapting global forecasting ensemble to new, data-sparse geographic markets?
- Basis: Conclusion mentions transfer learning shortens time-to-value without providing comparative error analysis
- Why unresolved: Asserts benefits but lacks comparative WMAPE analysis between efficient adaptation and full retraining
- What evidence would resolve: Comparative ablation study showing forecast accuracy for new countries using transfer learning versus full retraining

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does two-step context engineering framework quantitatively reduce hallucination rates compared to standard prompting methods when generating technical diagnostics for operational users?
- Basis: Claims architecture reduces hallucinatory risk through reporting contracts but provides no empirical metrics
- Why unresolved: Evaluation focuses on forecasting metrics, lacking quantitative assessment of LLM reliability
- What evidence would resolve: Quantitative measurements of factual grounding or hallucination frequency in generated scorecards

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are optimal drift detection thresholds for triggering re-clustering of long-tail segment, and how sensitive is ensemble's accuracy to dynamic evolution of these clusters?
- Basis: Methodology relies on cluster-modeled long tail and drift monitors but doesn't specify re-clustering logic
- Why unresolved: Describes static segmentation strategy and general MLOps loop, leaving specific criteria for dynamic cluster stability as implementation detail
- What evidence would resolve: Analysis of forecast stability under varying rates of cluster turnover with specific ADI/CV² thresholds

## Limitations
- Evidence is internally consistent but lacks external validation against industry baselines or third-party data
- No quantitative comparison provided for accuracy gains from Pareto-aware pooling
- No failure-mode analysis for contract drift in LLM narratives

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Ensemble forecasting framework construction, hierarchical demand structure, WMAPE as primary metric, general two-LLM pipeline architecture
- **Medium Confidence**: Pareto segmentation benefits, LLM contract enforcement effectiveness, trend/change-point detection utility
- **Low Confidence**: Regime label accuracy and external validity of COVID-19 attribution

## Next Checks
1. A/B test: Compare Pareto-segmented ensemble vs. all-individual models on held-out country-part series; measure WMAPE by revenue tier
2. Contract validation: Run identical requests 10× through two-step LLM pipeline; verify narrative consistency and table completeness against contract specification
3. Regime sensitivity: Withhold COVID regime flags for subset of series; compare trend classification accuracy vs. labeled ground truth
