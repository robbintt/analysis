# Game-Of-Goals: Using adversarial games to achieve strategic resilience

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.11295
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11295
- Authors: Aditya Ghose; Asjad Khan
- Reference count: 19
- This paper proposes a computational framework using game tree search methods to select optimal execution strategies from hierarchical goal models for achieving strategic resilience in adversarial business environments.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses strategic resilience in adversarial business environments by modeling organizational strategic planning as a two-player adversarial game. The authors propose a computational framework that leverages game tree search methods (Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning and Monte Carlo Tree Search) to select optimal execution strategies from hierarchical goal models. The approach uses an evaluation function based on minimizing vulnerability to adversarial actions, selecting strategies that leave minimal room for competitors to impede business goals. Experimental results demonstrate that while Minimax provides comprehensive strategic insights, it is computationally expensive (exponential complexity), whereas MCTS offers a more scalable alternative with logarithmic scaling of compute time as simulation count increases.

## Method Summary
The framework takes hierarchical AND/OR goal models as input and constructs augmented game trees where each decision point represents an OR-refinement choice. The system uses Minimax search with Alpha-Beta pruning for exhaustive strategic evaluation or Monte Carlo Tree Search for scalable approximation. Both algorithms evaluate positions using a Hamming distance-based evaluation function measuring proximity to goal satisfaction, with payoffs propagated upward through the tree to select the most resilient strategy. The approach assumes maximally adversarial competitor behavior and perfect information about game state.

## Key Results
- Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning provides comprehensive strategic insights but suffers from exponential computational complexity
- MCTS offers a scalable alternative with logarithmic scaling of compute time as simulation count increases
- MCTS provides the best balance between computational feasibility and robust decision-making for real-time strategic planning under adversarial conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Goal Refinement as Game Moves
- Claim: Selecting among OR-refined subgoals can be modeled as game moves where each choice is evaluated for resilience against adversarial responses.
- Mechanism: The goal model constrains available actions via condition-action rules. When faced with OR-refinement choices, the framework constructs an augmented game tree rooted at the current state, treats each subgoal as a "win" condition, and propagates payoff labels upward via minimax-style backing up—maximizing player chooses highest payoff, minimizing (adversary) chooses lowest.
- Core assumption: Adversarial agents behave in a maximally adversarial fashion; the environment can be abstracted as a single opponent; business actions and adversarial impacts will eventually be visible (perfect information approximation).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We assume that competitor agents are behaving in a maximally adversarial fashion(opposing actions against our sub goals or goals in general). We use game tree search methods (such as minimax) to select an optimal execution strategy."
  - [Section 3, p.4-5] "To decide if g1 is the preferred decomposition, we explore the game tree rooted in s where g1 serves as the 'win' condition... The payoff label associated with a given subgoal is thus an indicator of the robustness or resilience."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support for goal-model-to-game-tree mapping specifically; related papers focus on agent strategic reasoning and adversarial games but not this hierarchical decomposition mechanism.
- Break condition: If the goal model is incomplete (missing feasible capabilities) or the adversary's behavior is not approximately maximally adversarial (e.g., cooperative or random), payoff labels may not reflect real-world resilience.

### Mechanism 2: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for Exhaustive Strategic Insight
- Claim: Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning provides comprehensive strategic evaluation by exhaustively exploring the game tree up to a cutoff depth, propagating worst-case adversarial outcomes upward.
- Mechanism: At each maximizing node, the algorithm selects the child with highest payoff; at minimizing nodes, selects lowest payoff. Alpha-Beta pruning uses upper (α) and lower (β) bounds to cut off branches that cannot influence the final decision, reducing but not eliminating exponential complexity.
- Core assumption: A meaningful cutoff depth can be chosen within resource bounds; the evaluation function at pseudo-leaf nodes sufficiently proxies long-term outcome quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experimental results show that while Minimax provides comprehensive strategic insights, it is computationally expensive (exponential complexity)."
  - [Section 2, p.3-4] "Minimax search is the best-known game-tree search technique... If a node represents a maximizing player's move, the label of the child node with the highest payoff value is selected."
  - [corpus] Corpus papers reference game-theoretic and adversarial reasoning but do not directly validate minimax for business strategy; this remains an unproven transfer assumption.
- Break condition: When depth cut-off must be very shallow due to time constraints, or when non-deterministic state transitions explode the branching factor, minimax becomes impractical.

### Mechanism 3: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for Scalable Approximation
- Claim: MCTS offers a computationally feasible alternative by sampling promising branches via random playouts, achieving logarithmic scaling of compute time as simulation count increases.
- Mechanism: Rather than exhaustively exploring the tree, MCTS performs Monte Carlo sampling from pseudo-leaf nodes, executing random playouts to end-game or cutoff states. The sampling distribution concentrates on higher-value branches over time. Payoffs are backed up identically to minimax.
- Core assumption: Random playouts provide a sufficiently unbiased estimate of position value; the simulation count can be tuned to balance accuracy and efficiency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MCTS offers a more scalable alternative with logarithmic scaling of compute time as simulation count increases."
  - [Section 4.2, p.10] "The relationship follows a logarithmic trend, where compute time grows significantly at first but gradually plateaus, suggesting diminishing returns beyond a certain number of simulations."
  - [Section 4.3, p.10-11] "MCTS provides a scalable alternative by focusing on the most promising moves rather than exhaustive search, making it a better choice for adaptive strategic planning."
  - [corpus] Indirect support from papers on adversarial strategic reasoning; no direct corpus validation of MCTS for goal-model-based business strategy.
- Break condition: When playouts are misleading (e.g., rare but catastrophic adversarial moves are undersampled), or when the evaluation horizon is too short for statistical convergence.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Minimax Search and Alpha-Beta Pruning**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core algorithm for exhaustive adversarial planning. Without understanding minimax propagation rules and pruning logic, the augmented game tree evaluation is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given a game tree with maximizing player at the root and three child nodes with payoffs [3, -1, 7] after minimax propagation, what payoff backs up to the root?

- Concept: **Goal Modeling (AND/OR Refinement)**
  - Why needed here: The input structure to the framework. Understanding how parent goals decompose into AND-refinements (all must succeed) vs OR-refinements (any can succeed) is essential to grasp the decision problem being solved.
  - Quick check question: If goal G has an OR-refinement into {g1, g2, g3}, and the game-tree search yields payoffs of 0.8, 0.3, and 0.6 respectively for pursuing each, which subgoal should be selected and why?

- Concept: **State Update Operators (PWA/PMA)**
  - Why needed here: Actions modify the world state, potentially non-deterministically. The paper uses the Possible Worlds Approach (PWA) to define how states evolve, which directly impacts branching in augmented game trees.
  - Quick check question: If executing action a in state s generates multiple possible successor states, how does the minimax backup rule handle this at the parent action node?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. **Goal Model** (input): Hierarchical AND/OR goal structure (e.g., KAOS/i*/Tropos format)
  2. **Capability Models**: Condition-action rules for business and environment agents
  3. **State Representation**: Propositional variable assignments representing current world state
  4. **State Update Operator**: PWA-based transition function handling non-deterministic outcomes
  5. **Augmented Game Tree Generator**: Constructs alternating state-node / action-node tree
  6. **Evaluation Function**: Hamming distance-based proximity to goal satisfaction (extensible to weighted non-functional objectives)
  7. **Search Engine**: Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning OR MCTS
  8. **Strategy Selector**: Chooses highest-payoff OR-refinement at decision points

- Critical path:
  1. Parse goal model → extract OR-refinement decision points
  2. For each candidate OR-refinement, generate augmented game tree from current state
  3. Apply search algorithm (minimax or MCTS) with depth cut-off
  4. Evaluate pseudo-leaf states using evaluation function
  5. Back up payoffs to root; select OR-refinement with highest payoff

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Minimax vs MCTS**: Minimax is exhaustive but exponential; MCTS is approximate but logarithmic. Choose based on decision-time constraints and acceptable error margins.
  - **Depth cut-off vs accuracy**: Deeper search improves strategic lookahead but increases compute exponentially (minimax) or sub-linearly (MCTS).
  - **Deterministic vs non-deterministic state update**: Non-determinism increases branching factor; conservative worst-case backup reduces branching but may be overly pessimistic.
  - **Static vs dynamic capability sets**: Paper assumes static rules for simplicity; production systems may need runtime capability updates.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Exponential compute blowup**: Minimax with high branching factor and deep cutoff → timeout or memory exhaustion
  - **Goal-capability mismatch**: Capability completeness check fails → goal model contains infeasible objectives
  - **Misleading playouts (MCTS)**: Rare adversarial moves undersampled → selected strategy vulnerable to low-probability disruptions
  - **Stale state assumptions**: Real-world state diverges from model state → decisions based on obsolete information
  - **Overly shallow cutoff**: Evaluation function applied too early → payoff labels reflect heuristic, not actual strategic value

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Minimax depth scaling test**: Fix branching factor (e.g., 3 actions per state), measure compute time vs depth cut-off from 2 to 8. Verify exponential growth; identify practical depth limit for your compute budget.
  2. **MCTS simulation count calibration**: At fixed depth (e.g., 4), vary simulation count from 100 to 10,000. Plot compute time and payoff stability. Identify point of diminishing returns (plateau region per paper's Figure 2).
  3. **Algorithm comparison on synthetic goal tree**: Generate a goal model with 5 OR-refinement branches, each with 3-level subgoal depth. Run both Minimax and MCTS; compare selected strategies, compute time, and payoff values. Validate whether MCTS approximates Minimax's top choice within acceptable tolerance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can machine learning techniques be integrated into the framework to refine strategy prediction and improve decision-making efficiency in complex, multi-agent environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that future work will focus on "incorporating machine learning techniques to refine strategy prediction and improve decision-making efficiency in complex, multi-agent environments."
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies on classical search algorithms (Minimax and MCTS) without adaptive learning components, and the authors explicitly defer this integration to future research.
- What evidence would resolve it: An empirical evaluation of the framework modified to include learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks or reinforcement learning) demonstrating improved prediction accuracy or speed in simulations with more than two agents.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the capabilities of adversary agents be dynamically learned from a history of interactions rather than being static?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 3, the authors state that capability models are currently condition-action rules, and note: "These capabilities can be learnt from a history of interactions (but we leave this for future work)."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation assumes a static set of condition-action rules for the environment agent, ignoring the possibility that adversary behaviors evolve over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mechanism capable of ingesting logs of past adversarial moves to update the probability distributions or rules governing the environment agent's actions within the game tree.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the assumption of "perfect information" significantly degrade the robustness of strategies in scenarios where adversaries possess private knowledge or engage in deceptive actions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states in Section 2 that assuming perfect information is "generally valid" because actions will "ultimately be visible," but this simplification may fail to model temporary information asymmetries or bluffs common in business strategy.
- Why unresolved: The proposed framework treats the game as one of perfect information, lacking mechanisms to reason about hidden states or uncertainty regarding the opponent's true position.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of strategy performance in "perfect information" simulations versus "imperfect information" simulations where key state variables are hidden from the business player.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does the inclusion of weighted non-functional performance metrics in the evaluation function alter the selection of optimal strategies compared to the simple Hamming distance approach?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3 mentions that the current evaluation function uses Hamming distance to assess proximity to goals, but suggests one "can also create evaluation functions that represent weighted sums... [of] non-functional performance measures."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not implement or test this more complex evaluation function, leaving its impact on the trade-off between goal achievement and performance metrics (e.g., cost, time) unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the "optimality" of strategies selected by the basic Hamming distance function against those selected by a weighted multi-objective evaluation function.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes maximally adversarial competitor behavior, which may not reflect real business contexts
- Goal model completeness is critical but unverified; missing capabilities could render selected strategies infeasible
- The evaluation function's Hamming distance metric may inadequately capture complex business objectives
- MCTS's reliance on random playouts could undersample rare but high-impact adversarial actions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The minimax and MCTS algorithms themselves (well-established in game theory)
- **Medium confidence**: The augmented game tree construction mechanism and payoff propagation rules
- **Medium confidence**: The computational complexity claims (exponential for minimax, logarithmic for MCTS)
- **Low confidence**: The real-world applicability to business strategy given the perfect information and maximal-adversary assumptions

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework with incomplete goal models to quantify failure rates when capabilities are missing versus when models are complete.
2. Evaluate strategy robustness by introducing non-maximally adversarial opponent behaviors (random, cooperative, or targeted) and measuring performance degradation.
3. Validate MCTS sampling adequacy by identifying rare adversarial actions in historical business disruption data and measuring their representation in playouts.
