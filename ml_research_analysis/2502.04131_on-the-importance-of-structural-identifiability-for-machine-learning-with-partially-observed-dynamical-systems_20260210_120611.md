# On the importance of structural identifiability for machine learning with partially observed dynamical systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.04131
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04131
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Structural identifiability (SI) analysis, when integrated into a model-based time series classification framework for partially observed dynamical systems, improves classification accuracy by mapping observations into a lower-dimensional space of identifiable parameters, especially in data-scarce regimes.

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that structural identifiability (SI) analysis can be used as a preprocessing step to improve time series classification for partially observed dynamical systems. When only a subset of model states is observable, parameter estimation becomes ambiguous, leading to degraded classifier performance. By deriving structurally identifiable parameter combinations from the dynamical model, observations are mapped into a lower-dimensional space before training a Support Vector Machine. Experiments on five biomedical models show marked accuracy improvements, particularly with few training samples, and robustness to noise and irregular sampling. The approach preserves interpretability while acting as a regularizer that simplifies decision boundaries.

## Method Summary
The authors integrate structural identifiability (SI) analysis into a model-based time series classification pipeline. For a given dynamical system, they derive analytically the combinations of parameters that are structurally identifiable given the subset of observable states. Time series observations are then mapped to these identifiable parameter combinations, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the input space. This lower-dimensional representation is used to train a Support Vector Machine for classification. The method was tested on five biomedical models with varying levels of observability, and compared against baseline approaches that use raw or unidentifiable parameter estimates.

## Key Results
- Classification accuracy improved markedly when using SI-derived parameter combinations, especially with few training samples.
- The approach was robust to noise and irregular sampling across all tested models.
- SI-based preprocessing preserved interpretability while acting as a regularizer, simplifying the decision boundary.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
When only a subset of states is observable in a dynamical system, many different parameter sets can produce identical observations—leading to structural non-identifiability. This ambiguity degrades classifier performance because the learning algorithm must contend with multiple plausible parameter explanations for the same data. By deriving and using only structurally identifiable parameter combinations, the method reduces the input space to a lower-dimensional, unique representation of the underlying dynamics. This acts as a regularizer: it removes redundant or ambiguous information, simplifies the decision boundary, and focuses the classifier on features that are both informative and unique to each class.

## Foundational Learning

**Structural identifiability analysis**: Determines whether model parameters can be uniquely estimated from observed outputs. Needed to avoid ambiguous parameter estimation in partially observed systems. Quick check: Verify that the rank of the observability matrix equals the number of parameters.

**Observability matrix**: A matrix constructed from the system's output derivatives, used to assess structural observability. Needed to link system states to outputs. Quick check: Ensure the matrix has full column rank for full observability.

**Dynamical systems modeling**: Mathematical representation of time-evolving processes, often via differential equations. Needed to define the underlying system whose parameters are to be estimated. Quick check: Confirm that the system equations are well-posed and the state space is correctly defined.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression. Needed as the final classifier in the pipeline. Quick check: Validate that the kernel and regularization parameters are tuned for the dataset.

**Parameter estimation from time series**: The process of inferring model parameters from observed data. Needed as the bridge between raw observations and model-based features. Quick check: Compare estimated parameters to known values (if available) or assess convergence and stability.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Dynamical system model -> Structural identifiability analysis -> Identifiable parameter mapping -> SVM training -> Classification

**Critical path**: For each training sample: simulate/observe time series -> derive identifiable parameters via SI analysis -> train SVM on these features. For testing: map new observations to identifiable parameters -> classify with trained SVM.

**Design tradeoffs**: SI analysis adds preprocessing overhead but improves generalization, especially with few samples. The choice of SVM is simple and interpretable but may limit scalability or flexibility compared to deep learning. Analytical SI is tractable for low-dimensional models but may require numerical methods for complex systems.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance if the system is highly non-observable (few identifiable parameters), if SI analysis is incorrect or incomplete, or if the SVM is poorly tuned. Diminishing returns as training data increases, since the regularizing effect is most valuable in low-data regimes.

**First experiments**: 1) Validate SI analysis by checking identifiability on synthetic data with known parameters. 2) Compare classification accuracy with and without SI preprocessing under varying levels of observability. 3) Test robustness to noise by adding Gaussian noise at multiple SNR levels.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to five low-dimensional biomedical models; scalability to high-dimensional or complex nonlinear systems is untested.
- SI analysis is presented as a regularizer, but no formal proofs or statistical bounds are provided.
- Only SVM is evaluated; performance with modern deep learning architectures is not explored.
- Computational overhead of SI analysis is not quantified.

## Confidence
- Experimental design transparency: High
- Robustness claims (noise, irregular sampling): Medium
- Scalability and generalizability to complex systems: Low
- Regularization effect explanation: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on a high-dimensional dynamical system (e.g., >10 states) where SI analysis is semi-analytical or numerical.
2. Compare performance against deep learning classifiers to assess whether gains persist with flexible models.
3. Perform sensitivity analysis varying the degree of observability reduction to identify the breaking point where SI-based preprocessing no longer helps.
