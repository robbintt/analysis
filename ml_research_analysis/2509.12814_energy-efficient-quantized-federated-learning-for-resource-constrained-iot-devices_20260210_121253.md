# Energy-Efficient Quantized Federated Learning for Resource-constrained IoT devices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.12814
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12814
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Proposed approach reduces energy consumption by up to 75% compared to standard FL while maintaining model accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses energy efficiency challenges in federated learning for IoT devices by integrating finite blocklength transmission, model quantization, and error-aware aggregation. The proposed approach optimizes uplink transmission power and incorporates transmission errors into the aggregation process. Through simulation results on MNIST, the method demonstrates significant energy savings while maintaining robust model accuracy, achieving up to 75.31% energy reduction compared to standard FL models.

## Method Summary
The approach combines stochastic quantization of model updates, finite blocklength-aware transmission with reliability filtering, and joint optimization of power, error rate, and quantization bits using CMA-ES. Local training uses quantized neural networks with stochastic rounding to n-bit fixed-point values. The server aggregates updates only from successful transmissions (filtered by reliability factor λk), renormalizing weights accordingly. The optimization problem minimizes expected total energy subject to accuracy and latency constraints, finding practical operating points like Ptx≈0.1, q≈0.01 with FP8 quantization.

## Key Results
- Achieves 75.31% energy reduction compared to non-quantized FL baseline
- FP8 quantization maintains competitive accuracy while significantly reducing compute and transmission energy
- Error-aware aggregation prevents corrupted updates from degrading global model
- CMA-ES optimization finds Pareto-efficient operating points balancing energy, latency, and accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Stochastic Quantization Reduces Compute and Transmit Energy
Lowering weight precision via stochastic quantization reduces both local training energy and uplink transmission energy without proportionally degrading model accuracy. Weights are clipped to [-1, 1], scaled by quantization gain G = 2^(n-1), and stochastically rounded to n-bit fixed-point values. Fewer bits reduce MAC intensity and shrink packet size, lowering both local and uplink energy consumption.

### Mechanism 2: Finite Blocklength-Aware Aggregation Tolerates Transmission Errors
Explicitly modeling transmission error probability in aggregation prevents corrupted or dropped updates from degrading the global model. Introduces reliability factor λk ∈ {0, 1} based on finite blocklength error probability q; updates with λk = 0 are excluded. Aggregation weights updates by αk = |Dk|/D, renormalizing over successful transmissions.

### Mechanism 3: Joint Optimization of Power, Error Rate, and Quantization via CMA-ES
Jointly optimizing transmit power (Ptx), error probability (q), and quantization bits (n) can find a Pareto-efficient operating point that minimizes expected total energy under latency and accuracy constraints. Formulates E[e(n)] as objective with constraints on accuracy, per-round time, and max bits. Uses CMA-ES, a derivative-free optimizer, to navigate the non-convex space.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Federated Averaging (FedAvg)
  - Why needed here: The system builds on FedAvg with quantization and error-aware aggregation; understanding local SGD rounds and weighted averaging is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how FedAvg differs from central SGD, and why client data sizes affect aggregation weights?

- Concept: Fixed-Point Quantization and Stochastic Rounding
  - Why needed here: The core energy savings come from reduced bit-width; stochastic rounding mitigates bias from naive truncation.
  - Quick check question: Given a weight w = 0.73 and G = 128 (for 8-bit), what are the two possible rounded values and their probabilities?

- Concept: Finite Blocklength Transmission
  - Why needed here: Short packets incur non-negligible error probability even at rates below Shannon capacity; this error feeds into both latency and aggregation reliability.
  - Quick check question: How does achievable rate in finite blocklength differ from Shannon capacity, and which parameters does it depend on?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Client Device -> Local QNN training (quantized SGD, I iterations), update quantization, uplink transmission at power Ptx
  - Base Station -> Global model broadcast, error-aware aggregation (λk filtering, αk weighting), convergence monitoring
  - Optimizer (CMA-ES) -> Offline/periodic solver for (Ptx, q, n) given constraints (ϵ, τlimit, channel model)

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize global model w0 and select K clients
  2. Clients quantize wt, perform I local SGD steps, compute updates Δwk
  3. Quantize updates to ΔwQ,k, transmit with optimized Ptx under finite blocklength
  4. Server filters by λk, aggregates via renormalized weighted sum
  5. Repeat until E[f(wT)] − f(w∗) ≤ ϵ or max rounds reached

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Lower n reduces energy but may increase T (more rounds to converge)
  - Lower Ptx saves transmit energy but increases q, raising variance in aggregation
  - Tighter τlimit forces shorter blocklength or higher rate, potentially increasing q

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy plateau or divergence: May indicate excessive q or overly aggressive quantization; check λk statistics and increase n or Ptx
  - Per-round latency violations: Blocklength M or bandwidth Bk insufficient; reduce I or increase Bk
  - CMA-ES non-convergence: Objective landscape highly non-convex or constraints infeasible; relax τlimit or ϵ

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate FP8 vs. non-quantized FL energy comparison on MNIST with same network architecture, logging ek,l and ek,u separately
  2. Sweep q ∈ {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2} while fixing n = 8 and Ptx, measure convergence rounds and final accuracy to validate error-aware aggregation benefit
  3. Run CMA-ES optimization under τlimit = 1s and ϵ = 0.1, verify converged (Ptx, q) against paper values; then stress-test with τlimit = 0.5s and observe tradeoff shifts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the framework perform when applied to complex, non-IID datasets such as CIFAR-10 or FEMNIST?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that future work will include experiments on these specific datasets to demonstrate scalability, as the current study relies on the simpler MNIST dataset.
- Why unresolved: The paper currently validates the method only on MNIST, which lacks the complexity and heterogeneity of modern visual tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation results detailing convergence speed, energy consumption, and accuracy on CIFAR-10 or FEMNIST benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed approach compare quantitatively to other recent energy-aware FL baselines?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion sets forth the perspective that an "extensive comparison with recent energy-aware FL methods" is required to validate the method's competitiveness.
- Why unresolved: The paper primarily compares the proposed method against a standard FL model and a non-quantized version, rather than other state-of-the-art energy-efficient frameworks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative tables showing energy and accuracy metrics against other recent energy-aware FL algorithms.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can more advanced mitigation strategies be developed to handle transmission errors beyond simply discarding failed updates?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes that findings revealed transmission errors degrade FL performance, "highlighting the need for further mitigation strategies."
- Why unresolved: The current approach uses a binary reliability factor (λk) which ignores updates with errors, potentially wasting the energy used to compute and transmit them.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new aggregation mechanism that utilizes partial information from corrupted packets to improve model accuracy.

## Limitations
- Limited validation to MNIST dataset without testing on more complex, non-IID datasets like CIFAR-10 or FEMNIST
- Channel model implementation details (Rayleigh fading with full CSI) require specific simulation parameters not fully specified
- Data partitioning strategy and dataset size distribution across clients are not explicitly defined

## Confidence
- Energy model and quantization mechanism: High
- CMA-ES optimization approach: Medium (novel combination, no direct corpus validation)
- Error-aware aggregation benefits: Medium (sparse external validation for this specific coupling)
- Scalability to complex datasets: Low (only validated on MNIST)

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate stochastic quantization with FP8 on MNIST, comparing accuracy and energy against non-quantized baseline
2. Simulate finite blocklength transmission with Rayleigh fading, measure error probability q and its impact on convergence
3. Run CMA-ES optimization to find (Ptx, q) operating point, verify energy reduction matches reported 75% figure
