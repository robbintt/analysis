# Uncovering Bias Paths with LLM-guided Causal Discovery: An Active Learning and Dynamic Scoring Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12227
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12227
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Introduces hybrid LLM-guided causal discovery framework combining active learning with dynamic scoring to efficiently identify fairness-relevant causal pathways

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of uncovering fairness-relevant causal pathways in complex, noisy datasets where traditional methods struggle. The authors propose a hybrid framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for querying and scoring variable relationships, combined with active learning strategies to efficiently identify how sensitive attributes influence outcomes. The approach uses a composite scoring mechanism incorporating mutual information, partial correlation, and LLM confidence to prioritize variable pairs for investigation. By adapting to graph size and complexity through dynamic scoring, the method aims to make causal fairness audits more actionable and efficient.

## Method Summary
The framework employs an active learning loop where an LLM guides the selection of variable pairs for querying based on their potential relevance to fairness pathways. Each pair is scored using a composite metric that balances statistical measures (mutual information and partial correlation) with LLM confidence in its assessment. The dynamic scoring mechanism adapts the query budget and prioritization strategy based on the current state of the causal graph being constructed. This hybrid approach combines the statistical rigor of traditional causal discovery with the contextual understanding and flexibility of LLM guidance, allowing for more nuanced identification of bias pathways in complex datasets.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baselines in structural accuracy and fairness-path recovery on semi-synthetic Adult dataset and clinical networks
- Achieves top F1 scores and higher normalized bias detection compared to traditional causal discovery methods
- Dynamic scoring and active querying significantly improve efficiency and robustness in identifying bias-relevant causal relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by strategically combining multiple information sources to overcome limitations of purely statistical or purely LLM-based approaches. The active learning component ensures that the LLM focuses its queries on the most promising variable pairs rather than exhaustively examining all possibilities, dramatically reducing computational overhead. The dynamic scoring adapts the exploration strategy based on the current graph state, allowing the method to shift focus as the causal structure becomes clearer. By incorporating both statistical measures and LLM confidence, the framework balances objective data relationships with contextual understanding that can capture complex, real-world fairness considerations that may not be apparent from correlation alone.

## Foundational Learning

**Causal Discovery** - Why needed: To identify cause-effect relationships in data without relying on controlled experiments. Quick check: Does the method recover known ground truth causal structures in synthetic data?

**Active Learning** - Why needed: To efficiently allocate limited query budgets by selecting the most informative variable pairs. Quick check: Does the query strategy improve with each iteration by focusing on promising areas?

**Mutual Information & Partial Correlation** - Why needed: To quantify statistical dependencies between variables while controlling for confounders. Quick check: Do these metrics capture both linear and non-linear relationships appropriately?

**LLM Confidence Scoring** - Why needed: To incorporate contextual understanding and uncertainty quantification from language models. Quick check: Does the LLM correctly identify when it lacks sufficient information for a reliable assessment?

**Dynamic Scoring** - Why needed: To adapt the exploration strategy based on the evolving state of the causal graph. Quick check: Does the method adjust its focus appropriately as more information is discovered?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data → Statistical Analysis → LLM Query Selection → Dynamic Scoring → Causal Graph Construction → Fairness Path Identification

Critical Path: The most critical path involves the interaction between the dynamic scoring module and the LLM query selection. The system must accurately identify promising variable pairs (through statistical analysis and previous LLM feedback), generate appropriate queries, interpret LLM responses, and update the scoring to guide subsequent queries. Failures at any point in this loop can lead to missed bias pathways or wasted computational resources.

Design Tradeoffs: The framework balances exploration vs. exploitation by adjusting the query budget based on graph complexity. A key tradeoff involves how much weight to give LLM confidence versus statistical measures - too much LLM weight risks propagating model biases, while too little may miss contextual fairness considerations. The dynamic scoring mechanism must also balance adaptability with stability to avoid oscillating between different areas of the graph.

Failure Signatures: The system may fail to identify important bias pathways if the LLM systematically undervalues certain variable relationships or if the statistical measures are poorly calibrated for the data distribution. Computational inefficiency can occur if the dynamic scoring becomes too conservative, leading to excessive querying of low-value variable pairs. The method may also produce overly complex causal graphs if the scoring mechanism fails to properly penalize spurious relationships.

First Experiments:
1. Test on synthetic data with known fairness-relevant pathways to verify recovery accuracy
2. Evaluate sensitivity to LLM quality by comparing results across different model versions
3. Measure computational efficiency gains from dynamic scoring compared to static query strategies
