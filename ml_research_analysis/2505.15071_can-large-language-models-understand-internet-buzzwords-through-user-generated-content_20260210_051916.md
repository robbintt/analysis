# Can Large Language Models Understand Internet Buzzwords Through User-Generated Content

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.15071
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15071
- Authors: Chen Huang; Junkai Luo; Xinzuo Wang; Wenqiang Lei; Jiancheng Lv
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LLMs achieve +2.51% semantic accuracy and +3.31% semantic completeness in generating Chinese internet buzzword definitions using RESS method with user-generated content

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models can accurately define Chinese internet buzzwords by leveraging user-generated content (UGC) as contextual examples. The authors introduce CHEER, a novel dataset containing Chinese internet buzzwords paired with definitions and corresponding UGC, and propose RESS, an aspect-specific definition generation method inspired by child language acquisition principles. The study reveals that while LLMs can generate definitions for buzzwords they have encountered before, they struggle with truly understanding new terms and often rely on prior exposure rather than genuine comprehension of UGC context.

## Method Summary
The research introduces CHEER, the first dataset of Chinese internet buzzwords with definitions and user-generated content examples, consisting of 12,686 buzzwords across 13 categories. The proposed RESS method guides LLMs through aspect-specific definition generation, breaking down the task into identifying aspects of the buzzword, then generating definitions based on those aspects using UGC as reference. This approach is inspired by how children acquire language skills through focused attention on specific linguistic aspects. The method is evaluated against multiple baseline approaches using metrics for semantic accuracy and completeness.

## Key Results
- RESS achieves an average improvement of +2.51% in semantic accuracy and +3.31% in semantic completeness over the best baseline method
- LLMs demonstrate significant over-reliance on prior exposure to buzzwords rather than true understanding through UGC
- Models show underdeveloped inferential abilities for generating definitions of previously unseen buzzwords
- Performance reveals challenges in identifying high-quality UGC that facilitates accurate buzzword comprehension

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The aspect-specific approach of RESS works by mimicking child language acquisition, where learners focus on specific linguistic features before synthesizing complete understanding. By breaking down definition generation into aspect identification and then definition synthesis, the method provides structured scaffolding that helps LLMs process complex semantic relationships in buzzwords more effectively than holistic approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- Chinese internet slang semantics: Understanding the unique linguistic properties and cultural context of Chinese internet buzzwords is essential for evaluating model performance on this specialized domain
- User-generated content analysis: Required for assessing how well models can extract meaningful definitions from informal, context-dependent online discourse
- Semantic accuracy metrics: Critical for quantitatively measuring how precisely generated definitions match reference definitions in meaning
- Child language acquisition principles: Provides theoretical foundation for the aspect-specific approach to definition generation
- Cross-lingual generalization: Important for understanding whether findings extend beyond Chinese to other languages with internet slang

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
CHEER Dataset -> RESS Method -> LLM -> Definition Output -> Evaluation Metrics

Critical Path:
CHEER Dataset (buzzword collection) -> RESS Method (aspect identification) -> LLM (definition generation) -> Semantic Accuracy/Completeness Evaluation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Aspect-specific vs. holistic definition generation approaches
- Dataset size and diversity vs. annotation quality and consistency
- Prior exposure reliance vs. genuine understanding capability
- UGC quality filtering vs. dataset completeness

Failure Signatures:
- Over-reliance on prior buzzword exposure indicates pattern matching rather than comprehension
- Poor performance on unseen buzzwords suggests limited inferential reasoning capabilities
- Difficulty identifying high-quality UGC points to challenges in contextual understanding

First Experiments:
1. Baseline comparison using direct prompt-to-definition without aspect-specific scaffolding
2. Performance evaluation on seen vs. unseen buzzwords to measure generalization
3. A/B testing of different UGC selection strategies to optimize definition quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on 360 buzzwords may not capture full diversity of Chinese internet slang
- Modest performance improvements (+2.51% accuracy, +3.31% completeness) may not represent significant practical gains
- Method may achieve pattern matching rather than genuine understanding of buzzword meanings
- Lacks comparison with more recent advanced prompting techniques in rapidly evolving LLM research

## Confidence
- High confidence in methodological framework and dataset creation (CHEER)
- Medium confidence in reported performance improvements given modest magnitude
- Low confidence in claims of true understanding vs. pattern matching

## Next Checks
1. Test RESS on a larger, more diverse set of buzzwords (at least 1000+ terms) to verify scalability and generalizability across different semantic categories
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing RESS against current state-of-the-art prompting methods (chain-of-thought, least-to-most prompting, or recent few-shot learning techniques)
3. Implement human evaluation studies where native Chinese speakers rate the quality and naturalness of generated definitions in real-world communication scenarios
