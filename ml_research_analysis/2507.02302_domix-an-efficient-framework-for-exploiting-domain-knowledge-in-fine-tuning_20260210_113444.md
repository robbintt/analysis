# DoMIX: An Efficient Framework for Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Fine-Tuning
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.02302
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02302
- Authors: Dohoon Kim; Donghun Kang; Taesup Moon
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DoMIX reduces training time by 58%, GPU memory usage by 87% during pre-training, and by 37% during fine-tuning while achieving superior average performance in continual domain-adaptive pre-tuning.

## Executive Summary
DoMIX introduces an efficient, parallel framework for continual domain-adaptive pre-training that overcomes key limitations of existing methods. It leverages LoRA modules to store domain knowledge separately and employs a diagonally initialized bridge matrix to flexibly exploit this knowledge during end-task fine-tuning. This approach is robust to domain order and avoids the need for domain identification during inference. In continual DAP settings, DoMIX reduces training time by 58%, GPU memory usage by 87% during pre-training, and by 37% during fine-tuning, while achieving superior average performance. It also extends to standard LLM fine-tuning, reducing memory usage by 18% and training time by 36% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while matching or exceeding their performance.

## Method Summary
DoMIX introduces an efficient framework for continual domain-adaptive pre-training that addresses key limitations of existing methods. The approach leverages LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) modules to store domain knowledge separately, enabling parallel pre-training across multiple domains. A diagonally initialized bridge matrix is employed to flexibly exploit this stored knowledge during end-task fine-tuning. This architecture allows the model to be robust to domain order and eliminates the need for domain identification during inference. The framework is designed to be particularly effective in continual DAP (Domain-Adaptive Pre-training) settings, where it demonstrates significant improvements in both efficiency and performance.

## Key Results
- Reduces training time by 58% and GPU memory usage by 87% during pre-training in continual DAP settings
- Achieves 37% reduction in GPU memory usage during fine-tuning while maintaining superior average performance
- Extends to standard LLM fine-tuning with 18% memory reduction and 36% training time reduction compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DoMIX's efficiency gains stem from its parallel pre-training architecture using LoRA modules to store domain-specific knowledge separately. The diagonally initialized bridge matrix acts as a flexible adapter that can selectively combine and apply this stored knowledge during fine-tuning without requiring domain identification. This separation of concerns allows for efficient knowledge storage and retrieval while maintaining model performance. The framework's robustness to domain order is achieved through the modular nature of LoRA adaptations, which can be applied in any sequence without degradation. The domain-agnostic inference capability is enabled by the bridge matrix's ability to dynamically combine relevant domain knowledge based on the task at hand rather than requiring explicit domain labels.

## Foundational Learning
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that modifies model weights through low-rank matrices; needed for efficient domain knowledge storage and memory reduction
- Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP): Pre-training on domain-specific data to improve downstream task performance; quick check: verify DAP improves task-specific metrics compared to standard pre-training
- Continual Learning: Learning from sequential data without forgetting previous knowledge; why needed: enables efficient multi-domain adaptation without catastrophic forgetting
- Bridge Matrix Architecture: A mechanism for combining multiple knowledge sources; quick check: test if diagonal initialization provides sufficient flexibility for knowledge combination
- Parallel Pre-training: Training multiple domain adaptations simultaneously; needed for efficiency gains and reduced wall-clock time

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Data -> LoRA Domain Modules (parallel) -> Bridge Matrix -> Fine-tuning Task
**Critical Path:** Domain data → LoRA adaptation → Bridge matrix initialization → Fine-tuning
**Design Tradeoffs:** Separate LoRA modules provide modularity but increase parameter count; diagonal bridge matrix simplifies combination but may limit expressiveness
**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on unseen domains, degradation when domain order changes, memory overflow with many domains
**First Experiments:** 1) Test efficiency gains on 2-3 domains with controlled datasets, 2) Verify domain order robustness through systematic permutation tests, 3) Measure memory usage scaling with increasing number of domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns with large numbers of domains remain unexplored
- Long-term effectiveness of LoRA modules for extended use cases is unclear
- Potential trade-offs between efficiency gains and model expressiveness are not fully addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in reported efficiency gains (58% training time reduction, 87% GPU memory reduction during pre-training) based on controlled experimental setups
- **Medium confidence** in robustness to domain order and domain-agnostic inference, as these claims are supported by experiments but may not generalize to all domain distributions
- **Low confidence** in long-term scalability and adaptability to highly dynamic or heterogeneous domains, as these aspects are not thoroughly explored

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DoMIX's performance and efficiency on a larger number of domains (e.g., 10+) to test scalability and robustness
2. Assess the impact of the diagonally initialized bridge matrix on model expressiveness and adaptability across diverse domain distributions
3. Test the approach in a real-world, dynamic domain environment to validate its long-term effectiveness and generalizability
