# TempViz: On the Evaluation of Temporal Knowledge in Text-to-Image Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.14951
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14951
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduced TEMPVIZ dataset and found T2I models generally struggle with temporal cues, with best model achieving only 46% accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TEMPVIZ, the first dataset designed to evaluate temporal knowledge in text-to-image (T2I) models. The dataset contains 7,940 prompts across five categories (landscapes, animals, buildings, maps, and artworks) paired with appropriate temporal cues such as seasons, lifespans, and art periods. Reference images and expected visual descriptors are also provided to support evaluation.

The authors evaluate five T2I models (FLUX, SDXL, SDXL-T, SDv1.5, SDv3.5) using TEMPVIZ with human annotators assessing image quality, subject presence, and correct application of temporal knowledge. Results show that temporal competence is generally weak across all models, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy on temporal cues. FLUX achieved the highest overall temporal accuracy at 46% despite producing fewer visual errors. The study also examined automated evaluation methods including CLIPScore, captioning, decompositional VQA, and direct VLM judging, finding none reliably assess temporal knowledge with the best macro-F1 at only 72% for GPT-5 in direct judging.

## Method Summary
The study introduces TEMPVIZ, a dataset of 7,940 prompts designed to evaluate temporal knowledge in T2I models across five categories. Each prompt includes category-appropriate temporal cues (seasons, lifespans, art periods). The evaluation involves five T2I models (FLUX, SDXL, SDXL-T, SDv1.5, SDv3.5) with human annotators assessing image quality, subject presence, and temporal knowledge application. Additionally, the paper tests automated evaluation methods (CLIPScore, captioning, decompositional VQA, direct VLM judging) to assess their reliability for temporal knowledge evaluation.

## Key Results
- No T2I model exceeded 75% accuracy on temporal cues, with the lowest performance on historical maps (15%)
- FLUX achieved the highest overall temporal accuracy at 46% despite producing fewer visual errors
- Automated evaluation methods showed poor reliability for temporal knowledge assessment, with best macro-F1 at 72% for GPT-5 in direct judging
- Human evaluation revealed significant gaps in T2I models' ability to integrate temporal cues into image generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's approach works by creating a structured evaluation framework that isolates temporal knowledge as a distinct capability to be measured. By using human annotators to assess temporal accuracy alongside visual quality, the method captures nuanced failures that automated metrics miss. The dataset design ensures temporal cues are contextually appropriate and paired with reference standards, enabling consistent evaluation across diverse prompt types.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal reasoning in language models**: Why needed - to understand how T2I models interpret time-based prompts; Quick check - test model responses to counterfactual temporal scenarios
- **Visual-semantic alignment**: Why needed - to evaluate whether generated images match temporal descriptions; Quick check - compare CLIPScore performance on temporal vs non-temporal prompts
- **Prompt engineering for temporal concepts**: Why needed - to ensure prompts effectively communicate temporal information; Quick check - A/B test prompt variations with human raters
- **Cross-modal evaluation metrics**: Why needed - to develop reliable automated assessment methods; Quick check - correlation analysis between human and automated scores
- **Cultural specificity in temporal representation**: Why needed - to understand model biases in temporal interpretation; Quick check - test model performance on non-Western temporal concepts
- **Error classification in T2I generation**: Why needed - to identify patterns in temporal failures; Quick check - categorize failure modes across different temporal categories

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: TEMPVIZ Dataset Creation -> T2I Model Generation -> Human Evaluation Pipeline -> Automated Evaluation Methods -> Results Analysis

**Critical Path**: Dataset creation → Model generation → Human evaluation → Results synthesis. This path is critical because human evaluation serves as the ground truth for temporal accuracy, while automated methods are benchmarked against it.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes human evaluation for reliability over automated methods for scalability, accepting higher costs for more accurate temporal assessment. The dataset focuses on English prompts and Western temporal frameworks to ensure consistency but limits generalizability.

**Failure Signatures**: Temporal knowledge failures manifest as complete omission of temporal elements, incorrect application (wrong season, wrong art period), or superficial incorporation without understanding (generic "winter" imagery for any winter prompt).

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test FLUX on prompts with explicit time period references not present in training data
2. Evaluate human inter-annotator agreement on temporal knowledge assessment
3. Compare performance of human evaluators with different levels of art history knowledge

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Human evaluation relies on AMT workers whose consistency across diverse temporal concepts remains uncertain
- Binary classification approach may oversimplify nuanced temporal understanding
- Dataset focuses on English prompts and Western-centric temporal references, limiting generalizability
- Automated evaluation methods tested may not represent the full space of possible approaches

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The finding that T2I models struggle with temporal cues (no model exceeding 75% accuracy) is well-supported by human evaluation data across multiple models and categories.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that FLUX achieves the highest temporal accuracy (46%) is supported, though this must be interpreted cautiously given the overall low performance ceiling.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that automated evaluation methods are "insufficient" for temporal knowledge assessment is based on tested methods only; unexplored approaches might yield better results.

## Next Checks
1. **Temporal Transfer Validation**: Test whether models can correctly apply temporal knowledge when prompts explicitly reference time periods not present in the training data (e.g., "futuristic 18th century") to distinguish learned temporal patterns from memorized associations.

2. **Cross-Cultural Temporal Evaluation**: Develop and evaluate a culturally diverse subset of TEMPVIZ incorporating non-Western temporal references (lunar calendars, traditional seasonal divisions, non-Western art periods) to assess model generalization across temporal frameworks.

3. **Hybrid Evaluation Protocol Validation**: Design and test a human-in-the-loop automated evaluation system where initial model assessments are refined by human verification, measuring whether this hybrid approach achieves substantially better reliability than either pure human or pure automated evaluation.
