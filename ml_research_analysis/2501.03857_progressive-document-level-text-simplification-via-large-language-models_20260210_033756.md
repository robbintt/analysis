# Progressive Document-level Text Simplification via Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.03857
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03857
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ProgDS achieves state-of-the-art performance on Wiki-auto and Newsela datasets for long document-level text simplification

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ProgDS, a progressive simplification method for long document-level text simplification using Large Language Models (LLMs). The method addresses the limitations of LLMs in handling long documents by hierarchically decomposing the simplification task into discourse-level, topic-level, and lexical-level simplification, mirroring the approach used by human editors. ProgDS significantly outperforms existing smaller models and direct prompting with LLMs, particularly excelling when dealing with longer original documents.

## Method Summary
ProgDS implements a three-stage hierarchical approach to document simplification. The method first performs discourse-level simplification to adjust the overall structure and complexity of the document. It then applies topic-level simplification to refine and simplify individual sections or topics within the document. Finally, lexical-level simplification is applied to simplify specific words and phrases. This progressive decomposition allows the LLM to focus on manageable portions of the task at each stage, avoiding the context window limitations that plague direct simplification attempts.

## Key Results
- ProgDS significantly outperforms existing smaller models and direct LLM prompting on Wiki-auto and Newsela datasets
- Benefits are particularly pronounced when dealing with longer original documents
- Iterative simplification further enhances the quality of the generated text

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The progressive decomposition approach works by breaking down the complex task of document simplification into manageable subtasks that align with human editing strategies. By first addressing document structure (discourse-level), then refining topic organization, and finally simplifying vocabulary (lexical-level), the method ensures that complexity reduction occurs systematically at multiple levels. This hierarchical approach prevents the LLM from being overwhelmed by long documents and allows for more focused attention on each aspect of simplification.

## Foundational Learning
- **Document simplification concepts**: Understanding of text simplification techniques at document level, including content reduction and lexical simplification
- **LLM context window limitations**: Recognition that standard LLMs struggle with long documents due to token limits and attention mechanisms
- **Hierarchical text processing**: Knowledge of how text can be decomposed into discourse, topic, and lexical levels for processing
- **Evaluation metrics for simplification**: Familiarity with SARI and Gunning Fog metrics for measuring simplification quality
- **Progressive processing strategies**: Understanding how breaking complex tasks into sequential stages can improve performance

Why needed: These concepts form the theoretical foundation for understanding both the problem of long document simplification and the proposed solution's approach.
Quick check: Can you explain why direct LLM prompting fails for long documents but progressive decomposition succeeds?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Discourse-level simplification -> Topic-level simplification -> Lexical-level simplification

Critical path: Input document → Discourse simplification → Topic simplification → Lexical simplification → Output simplified document

Design tradeoffs: The three-stage approach adds complexity and potential error propagation but enables handling of long documents that would be impossible with direct prompting. The hierarchical decomposition trades computational efficiency for quality gains.

Failure signatures: Errors at the discourse level cannot be recovered at later stages; topic-level mistakes propagate to lexical simplification; quality degradation increases with document length despite the progressive approach.

First experiments:
1. Compare ProgDS performance against direct LLM prompting on documents of varying lengths
2. Conduct ablation studies removing each simplification stage to quantify individual contributions
3. Test ProgDS on non-Wikipedia/non-news domains to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on GPT-4-based automated metrics with limited human validation
- Error propagation cannot be recovered once mistakes are made at earlier stages
- Focus primarily on Wikipedia and news domain data, raising generalizability concerns

## Confidence

High Confidence: Core claim that ProgDS outperforms direct prompting and smaller models on benchmark datasets
Medium Confidence: Benefits are particularly pronounced for longer documents
Medium Confidence: Three-stage decomposition mimics human editing strategies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comprehensive human evaluation studies comparing ProgDS outputs with human references across different document types and complexity levels to validate automated metric scores.

2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the impact of each simplification stage and analyze error propagation patterns when individual components fail.

3. Test the generalizability of ProgDS on diverse text genres beyond Wikipedia and news articles, such as scientific literature, legal documents, and social media content, to assess domain robustness.
