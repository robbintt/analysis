# QuantEval: A Benchmark for Financial Quantitative Tasks in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08689
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08689
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: QuantEval introduces a financial benchmark evaluating LLMs on knowledge-based QA, mathematical reasoning, and strategy coding, revealing substantial gaps versus human experts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces QuantEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models on three essential dimensions of quantitative finance: knowledge-based question answering, quantitative mathematical reasoning, and quantitative strategy coding. Unlike prior financial benchmarks, QuantEval integrates a CTA-style backtesting framework that executes model-generated strategies and evaluates them using financial performance metrics, enabling a more realistic assessment of quantitative coding ability. The authors evaluate 13 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, observing substantial performance gaps relative to human experts, particularly in reasoning and strategy coding. To address these gaps, they conduct large-scale supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning experiments on domain-aligned data, demonstrating consistent improvements in reasoning and strategy execution. The full deterministic backtesting configuration is released to ensure strict reproducibility.

## Method Summary
QuantEval evaluates LLMs across three tasks: knowledge-based QA (KBQA) with 3,500 questions, quantitative mathematical reasoning (R&D Finance) with 2,000 problems, and quantitative strategy coding (QSC) using a CTA backtesting framework. The benchmark uses Python and OpenBB for execution, with strategies generated via few-shot prompts. Models are evaluated on metrics including accuracy, F1, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and total return. The paper also conducts supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) experiments using domain-aligned data to improve model performance on financial tasks.

## Key Results
- 13 evaluated LLMs show significant performance gaps compared to human experts, especially in reasoning and strategy coding tasks
- SFT and RL fine-tuning on domain-aligned data consistently improves performance in reasoning and strategy execution
- QuantEval's CTA-style backtesting framework enables realistic evaluation of model-generated quantitative strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
QuantEval works by providing a comprehensive, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that mirrors real-world quantitative finance workflows. The integration of execution frameworks (Python/OpenBB) with backtesting allows direct assessment of model-generated code, bridging the gap between theoretical capability and practical implementation. The benchmark's three-task structure captures different cognitive demands: factual knowledge retrieval, mathematical reasoning, and code generation with financial logic.

## Foundational Learning
- **CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) strategies**: Systematic trading rules for futures markets; needed for strategy coding evaluation; quick check: verify strategy logic follows CTA framework rules
- **Backtesting frameworks**: Simulating trading strategies on historical data; needed to validate strategy performance; quick check: ensure backtest parameters match real-world constraints
- **Financial performance metrics**: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, total return; needed to evaluate strategy quality; quick check: confirm metric calculations align with industry standards
- **Few-shot prompting**: Providing examples in prompts to guide model responses; needed for consistent strategy generation; quick check: test prompt variations affect output consistency
- **Reinforcement learning for financial tasks**: Reward-based fine-tuning on financial outcomes; needed to improve strategy generation; quick check: verify reward signals correlate with financial performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: KBQA Dataset -> LLM -> Answer Evaluation -> Score; R&D Finance Dataset -> LLM -> Mathematical Solution -> Accuracy/F1; Strategy Prompt -> LLM -> Code Generation -> OpenBB Execution -> CTA Backtest -> Financial Metrics

**Critical Path**: Strategy Prompt → LLM → Code Generation → OpenBB Execution → CTA Backtest → Financial Metrics

**Design Tradeoffs**: Execution framework choice (OpenBB vs alternatives) affects reproducibility and error attribution; few-shot vs fine-tuning impacts consistency vs adaptability; deterministic vs stochastic evaluation affects fairness across runs

**Failure Signatures**: Code generation errors causing execution failures; mathematical reasoning mistakes in formula application; knowledge gaps in domain-specific terminology; strategy logic flaws producing unrealistic backtest results

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare few-shot prompts with and without execution examples; 2) Test different execution frameworks (OpenBB vs manual implementation); 3) Evaluate model performance with and without fine-tuning on financial data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Potential data leakage in reasoning dataset (R&D Finance) where training and evaluation may share temporal or topical overlap
- Evaluation heavily depends on execution framework quality, which could mask model errors or propagate bugs
- Narrow financial domain coverage (equities and fixed-income) without derivatives, options, or FX markets

## Confidence
- KBQA results: High confidence - straightforward factual questions with clear answers
- Mathematical reasoning: Medium confidence - potential overlap issues in R&D Finance dataset
- Strategy coding: Low-Medium confidence - complex interplay between model quality, execution framework, and lack of error attribution analysis

## Next Checks
1) Conduct temporal split analysis to verify no overlap between training and evaluation datasets in the reasoning benchmark
2) Perform robustness analysis by varying execution frameworks (e.g., compare OpenBB with alternative APIs) to isolate model performance from framework-specific behaviors
3) Execute backtests with realistic transaction costs and slippage to assess whether reported strategy performances hold under more stringent market conditions
