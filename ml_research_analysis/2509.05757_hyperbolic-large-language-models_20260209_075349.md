# Hyperbolic Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05757
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05757
- Reference count: 40
- This paper surveys Hyperbolic Large Language Models that integrate hyperbolic geometry to better capture hierarchical structures in data.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Hyperbolic Large Language Models (HypLLMs), which integrate hyperbolic geometry into LLM architectures to better capture hierarchical structures in data. Traditional LLMs operate in Euclidean space, which has limited capacity to model tree-like hierarchies present in many real-world datasets. The paper introduces a taxonomy of HypLLMs organized into four categories: hybrid models using exp/log maps, fine-tuned models with hyperbolic adapters, fully hyperbolic models operating entirely in curved space, and hyperbolic state-space models.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes methods from the HypLLM literature, focusing on mathematical foundations (manifold theory, gyrovector spaces, isometric models) and implementation strategies (hybrid vs. fully hyperbolic architectures, Riemannian optimization). Key approaches include HypLoRA and HoRA for fine-tuning with 13-17% improvements on mathematical reasoning, fully hyperbolic models like Hypformer demonstrating linear-time attention through hyperbolic factorization, and hybrid approaches using exp/log maps to translate between Euclidean operations and hyperbolic geometry.

## Key Results
- HypLoRA and HoRA achieve 13-17% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks
- HiM-Poincaré achieves 85.9% F1 score on mixed-hop prediction outperforming Euclidean baselines
- Fully hyperbolic models like Hypformer demonstrate linear-time attention through hyperbolic factorization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Volume Growth Alignment
Hyperbolic space models hierarchical (tree-like) data with lower distortion and lower dimensionality than Euclidean space because its volume grows exponentially with radius, matching the branching factor of trees. In Euclidean space, volume grows polynomially ($r^n$), causing high distortion when embedding large taxonomies (nodes increase exponentially with depth). Hyperbolic space volume grows exponentially ($e^r$), allowing leaf nodes to lie near the boundary while root nodes stay near the origin, preserving hierarchy in fewer dimensions.

### Mechanism 2: Tangent Space Projection (Exp/Log Maps)
Hybrid and fine-tuned models leverage exponential/logarithmic maps to translate between Euclidean operations (matmul) and hyperbolic geometry, allowing standard backpropagation tools to operate on curved manifolds. The Logarithmic map ($\log_x$) projects a point on the manifold to the flat tangent space (Euclidean) where standard linear algebra applies. The Exponential map ($\exp_x$) projects the result back onto the curved manifold. This enables "Lorentz Low-Rank" adapters or hybrid attention layers.

### Mechanism 3: Curvature-Constrained Optimization
Standard SGD updates violate the manifold's curvature constraints; Riemannian optimization (RSGD) is required to update parameters along geodesics (curved shortest paths) rather than straight lines. Standard gradients are computed in the tangent space and then mapped back to the manifold via exponential maps. This ensures parameters (like embeddings) remain valid hyperbolic points (e.g., satisfying $\langle x, x \rangle_L = -r^2$ in Lorentz) during training.

## Foundational Learning

- **Manifolds & Curvature**: Hyperbolic LLMs operate on a negatively curved surface (like a saddle), not a flat grid. You cannot use standard vector addition. *Quick check: Can you explain why parallel lines diverge in hyperbolic space but stay parallel in Euclidean space?*

- **Gyrovector Spaces**: To perform "addition" and "linear transformations" in hyperbolic space without leaving the manifold, specialized operations like Möbius addition (⊕) are required. *Quick check: Why does standard vector addition $u + v$ not result in a valid point on the Poincaré ball?*

- **Isometric Models (Poincaré vs. Lorentz)**: The paper discusses two "views" of the same space. Poincaré is bounded (good for gradients); Lorentz is unbounded (better for stability/numerics). *Quick check: Which model is preferred for optimization stability according to the text? (Answer: Lorentz/Hyperboloid).*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Layer -> Exponential Map -> Hyperbolic Embeddings ($\mathbb{H}^n$) -> Encoder (Hyperbolic Transformer/Mamba) -> Adapters (Optional) -> Output: Logarithmic Map -> Euclidean Softmax/Head
- **Critical path**: Numerical stability. Operations like `arcosh` or squared norms in the Poincaré ball (denominator $1 - \|x\|^2$) are prone to gradient explosion/underflow
- **Design tradeoffs**: Hybrid (Exp/Log) is easier to implement and compatible with standard PyTorch/JAX layers but has mapping overhead and potential distortion. Fully Hyperbolic provides better theoretical fidelity and efficiency in low dimensions but requires custom CUDA kernels for operations like Lorentz-Dot-Product and is harder to debug
- **Failure signatures**: Gradient Vanishing (points "stuck" near boundary of Poincaré disk), NaN Blow-up (Lorentz time coordinate $x_0$ exploding due to $\cosh$ instability in float32), Metric collapse (curvature $K \to 0$, degenerating to Euclidean)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train a small 2-layer Hyperbolic MLP on WordNet nouns using RSGD and plot embeddings in 2D Poincaré disk checking hierarchy-depth correlation. 2) Compare Lorentz vs. Poincaré implementations on float32 vs. float64 monitoring for NaN frequency and gradient norms. 3) Swap standard LoRA for HypLoRA on a frozen Llama-7B for a simple math reasoning task measuring convergence speed and accuracy over Euclidean LoRA.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can unified benchmarking frameworks be developed to explicitly evaluate hierarchical structure preservation and multi-scale reasoning rather than relying solely on task-specific accuracy? The paper notes the current "absence of standardized evaluation protocols" and that "Future benchmarks should incorporate metrics that explicitly evaluate hierarchical structure preservation." This remains unresolved because current evaluation relies on disparate, task-specific metrics that fail to quantify how well models capture latent tree-like geometries or semantic entailment across different architectural categories.

### Open Question 2
What quantization techniques or memory-efficient representations are required to deploy HypLLMs efficiently on standard ML hardware without numerical instability? The paper identifies "Hardware Support" as a main challenge, explicitly listing "Quantization techniques" and "Memory-efficient representations" as necessary future directions. This is unresolved because hyperbolic operations often require high-precision arithmetic that are not natively supported by current GPU accelerators, forcing computationally expensive workarounds.

### Open Question 3
How can model architectures effectively learn or dynamically adapt curvature values to optimally represent data with varying hierarchical depths? The paper notes "Fixed curvature suboptimal for varying depths" and lists "Learnable curvature" and "Mixture-of-curvature experts" as potential solutions. This remains unresolved because while models like HELM introduce mixture-of-experts, fixed curvature remains the standard, and adaptive methods introduce optimization instability and hyperparameter complexity.

## Limitations

- Reproducibility challenges due to lack of detailed hyperparameter specifications for many models
- Hardware compatibility issues with current GPU architectures optimized for Euclidean operations
- Limited systematic analysis of when hyperbolic geometry fails or provides no benefit over standard approaches

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Mathematical foundations describing hyperbolic geometry properties (exponential volume growth, curvature constraints, exp/log maps) are well-established and correctly explained
- **Medium Confidence**: Reported performance improvements are based on cited papers but lack independent verification and discussion of variance across different datasets
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about numerical stability advantages of Lorentz over Poincaré models and effectiveness of Riemannian optimization require empirical validation not provided in the survey

## Next Checks

1. **Geometry-Task Alignment Analysis**: Systematically test HypLLMs across diverse datasets (hierarchical vs. flat) to quantify when hyperbolic geometry provides measurable benefits versus introducing unnecessary complexity

2. **Numerical Stability Benchmark**: Compare Lorentz vs. Poincaré implementations across different precision formats (float32 vs. float64) on identical tasks, measuring frequency of numerical instabilities and training convergence rates

3. **Computational Overhead Quantification**: Measure wall-clock training time and memory usage for HypLLMs versus equivalent Euclidean models across different hardware configurations, providing concrete efficiency trade-offs for different model sizes and tasks
