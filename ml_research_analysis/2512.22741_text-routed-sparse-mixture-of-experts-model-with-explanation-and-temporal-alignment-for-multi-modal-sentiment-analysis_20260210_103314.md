# Text-Routed Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Model with Explanation and Temporal Alignment for Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.22741
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22741
- Reference count: 8
- TEXT model achieves 0.353 mean absolute error on CH-SIMS dataset, 13.5% improvement over previous approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TEXT, a novel multi-modal sentiment analysis model that leverages explanation generation and temporal alignment to improve sentiment prediction accuracy. The model combines Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) for explanation generation with a unique architecture featuring a Mamba-TCA (Temporal Cross-Attention) block and text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts routing. TEXT addresses the challenge of aligning audio and video modalities with generated explanations while maintaining computational efficiency through its sparse expert architecture.

## Method Summary
TEXT operates by first generating explanations using MLLMs from input text, audio, and video modalities. These explanations are then aligned temporally with audio and video representations through a novel Mamba-TCA block that combines the efficiency of Mamba layers with the contextual understanding of temporal cross-attention. The model employs a text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts approach where routing decisions are based on textual features, allowing different experts to specialize in different sentiment contexts. Finally, a gate fusion mechanism combines the processed modalities for sentiment classification. The architecture is designed to capture both the temporal dynamics of multi-modal data and the semantic richness of generated explanations while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse routing.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.353 mean absolute error on CH-SIMS dataset
- Demonstrates 13.5% improvement over previous state-of-the-art approaches
- Outperforms three recently proposed models and three MLLMs across four datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TEXT's effectiveness stems from its multi-faceted approach to multi-modal sentiment analysis. The Mamba-TCA block provides efficient processing of temporal information while maintaining long-range dependencies through cross-attention mechanisms. The text routing mechanism ensures that expert selection is semantically informed, allowing the model to route different sentiment contexts to specialized experts. The temporal alignment between explanations and raw modalities creates a richer feature representation that captures both explicit and implicit sentiment cues. Additionally, the gate fusion approach allows for adaptive weighting of different modalities based on their relevance to the specific sentiment prediction task.

## Foundational Learning

**Mamba Layers**: State-space models that efficiently process sequential data while maintaining long-range dependencies. Needed for efficient temporal modeling without quadratic complexity. Quick check: Verify that Mamba layers reduce computational complexity compared to traditional attention mechanisms.

**Temporal Cross-Attention**: Mechanism that aligns features across different time steps and modalities. Essential for capturing temporal dependencies in multi-modal data. Quick check: Confirm that temporal alignment improves sentiment prediction accuracy compared to static feature fusion.

**Sparse Mixture-of-Experts**: Routing mechanism where different experts are activated based on input characteristics. Required for computational efficiency and specialized feature processing. Quick check: Measure computational savings from sparse routing compared to dense architectures.

**Gate Fusion**: Adaptive combination of multiple modality representations using learned gates. Necessary for balancing contributions from different modalities. Quick check: Validate that learned gates improve performance over simple concatenation or weighted averaging.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Modalities -> MLLM Explanation Generation -> Text Routing -> Sparse MoE Experts -> Mamba-TCA Block -> Gate Fusion -> Sentiment Classification

Critical Path: The most critical path involves explanation generation, text routing decisions, and the Mamba-TCA block's temporal alignment. These components directly impact the quality of feature representations and must be optimized for latency and accuracy.

Design Tradeoffs: The model trades increased architectural complexity for improved performance. The sparse MoE routing reduces computational cost but introduces routing overhead. The MLLM-based explanation generation adds latency but provides semantic richness. The Mamba-TCA block balances efficiency with temporal modeling capability.

Failure Signatures: Potential failures include poor routing decisions leading to suboptimal expert selection, misalignment between generated explanations and raw modalities, and gate fusion producing inappropriate modality weightings. These failures may manifest as degraded performance on specific sentiment categories or temporal segments.

First Experiments: 1) Evaluate routing accuracy and computational savings from the sparse MoE approach; 2) Measure temporal alignment quality between explanations and raw modalities; 3) Test gate fusion performance with different modality combinations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to single CH-SIMS dataset, limiting generalizability claims
- Insufficient ablation studies to isolate individual component contributions
- Quality and consistency of MLLM-generated explanations not directly validated or controlled

## Confidence
- **High** for CH-SIMS dataset results (directly reported and reproducible)
- **Medium** for broader superiority claims and architectural innovations (limited evaluation scope and insufficient component analysis)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of Mamba-TCA block, text routing mechanism, and gate fusion to overall performance
2. Evaluate model across multiple multi-modal sentiment analysis datasets beyond CH-SIMS to assess generalizability
3. Implement controlled study comparing performance with and without explanation generation from MLLMs to determine actual impact on sentiment prediction accuracy
