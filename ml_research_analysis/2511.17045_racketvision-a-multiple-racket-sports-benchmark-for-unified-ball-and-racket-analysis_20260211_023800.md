# RacketVision: A Multiple Racket Sports Benchmark for Unified Ball and Racket Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.17045
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17045
- **Reference count:** 8
- **Primary result:** Novel dataset and benchmark for racket sports analytics with fine-grained annotations for ball positions and racket poses across table tennis, tennis, and badminton.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for computer vision in racket sports analytics, featuring fine-grained annotations for both ball positions and racket poses across table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The authors define three interconnected tasks: ball tracking, racket pose estimation, and ball trajectory prediction, and evaluate several baseline models across these tasks. A key finding is that while naive concatenation of racket pose features degrades trajectory prediction performance, using a Cross-Attention fusion mechanism effectively leverages racket information to surpass strong unimodal baselines. The dataset and insights provide a foundation for future research in multi-modal, dynamic human-object interaction analysis in sports.

## Method Summary
The RacketVision benchmark consists of 1,672 broadcast video clips (1080p) from table tennis, tennis, and badminton, with sparse ground truth annotations (20% of frames) for ball positions and racket poses. The methodology involves training perception models (TrackNetV3 for ball tracking and RTMPose for racket pose estimation) on the sparse annotations, then running these models on full clips to generate dense "soft labels." A trajectory prediction model (LSTM with Cross-Attention) is trained on these soft labels, taking ball trajectory history as Query and racket pose history as Key/Value. The Cross-Attention mechanism dynamically weights racket features, focusing on them during critical impact events while suppressing them during flight phases where racket data is irrelevant.

## Key Results
- Cross-Attention fusion enables trajectory prediction models to utilize racket pose data, whereas naive concatenation degrades performance.
- Explicit background subtraction via median frames significantly reduces localization error for small, fast-moving objects (54.0% MDE reduction for table tennis).
- Multi-sport training acts as a regularizer that improves generalization on detection tasks, even if it slightly reduces hyper-specialized precision.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Cross-Attention fusion enables trajectory prediction models to utilize racket pose data, whereas naive concatenation degrades performance.
- **Mechanism:** The Cross-Attention mechanism treats the ball trajectory history as the Query and the racket pose history as the Key/Value. This allows the model to dynamically weigh racket features, focusing heavily on them during critical "event" frames (e.g., impacts) while suppressing them during flight phases where racket data is irrelevant or noisy.
- **Core assumption:** The model successfully learns to distinguish "event" frames from "flight" frames to adjust attention weights accordingly.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value"
  - [Experiments and Baseline Solutions - Ball Trajectory Prediction]: "This is likely because a large portion of trajectory samples... capture the ball in mid-flight... The Concat method indiscriminately fuses this noisy... data"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; corpus neighbors focus on robotics (SpikePingpong) rather than multi-modal fusion architectures.
- **Break condition:** If racket data is temporally misaligned with ball data, or if the dataset consists almost entirely of flight phases with few hits, the attention mechanism may fail to find correlated signals.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Explicit background subtraction via median frames significantly reduces localization error for small, fast-moving objects.
- **Mechanism:** By computing the difference between the current frame and a pre-computed median frame (representing the static background), the model isolates the dynamic foreground (the ball). This acts as a strong prior, reducing the search space and filtering out static visual noise.
- **Core assumption:** The camera is predominantly static, and the background does not change radically during the clip duration.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Experiments and Baseline Solutions - Ball Tracking]: "Incorporating a median frame for background subtraction... reduces MDE by a remarkable 54.0% for Table Tennis"
  - [RacketVision Dataset]: "This serves as a stable background reference, which is particularly useful for distinguishing the small, fast-moving ball from the environment."
  - [corpus]: Silent Impact (ID 47933) discusses tracking in tennis but relies on wearable sensors, not background subtraction; no direct validation of this specific computer vision technique in the provided corpus.
- **Break condition:** Failure is expected in highly dynamic backgrounds (e.g., moving crowds) or when the median frame calculation captures moving objects as part of the background.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multi-sport training acts as a regularizer that improves generalization on detection tasks, even if it slightly reduces hyper-specialized precision.
- **Mechanism:** Training on Table Tennis, Tennis, and Badminton simultaneously exposes the model to a wider variance of ball appearances, lighting, and racket geometries. This forces the learning of more robust, generic features rather than overfitting to the specific textures of a single sport.
- **Core assumption:** The visual features of balls and rackets across these sports share learnable underlying representations.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Experiments and Baseline Solutions - Ball Tracking]: "training on diverse data forces the model to learn more robust features, enhancing its ability to find the ball under varied conditions"
  - [Experiments and Baseline Solutions - Racket Pose Estimation]: "MS model achieves superior performance with PCK@0.2 improvements of 6.17%, 6.36%, and 5.97%"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; neighbors focus on single-sport mastery (e.g., HITTER for Table Tennis) rather than cross-sport generalization.
- **Break condition:** If the sports are too visually dissimilar (e.g., a squash ball vs. a shuttlecock), shared features may be too sparse to aid learning, leading to negative transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cross-Attention vs. Concatenation**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding that "more data ≠ better performance" is critical. You must understand how to fuse modalities. Concatenation forces the model to process all signals at all times, which acts as noise if the signal is sparse (like racket hits).
  - **Quick check question:** Why does concatenating racket features hurt the ball-only baseline in mid-flight scenarios?

- **Concept: Sparse-to-Dense Labeling (Soft Labels)**
  - **Why needed here:** The RacketVision pipeline uses manually annotated sparse frames to train detectors, which then generate dense "soft labels" for the trajectory predictor. Understanding this teacher-student pipeline is essential for data prep.
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't the Trajectory Predictor train directly on the raw video without the intermediate perception models?

- **Concept: Keypoint Normalization (PCK)**
  - **Why needed here:** Racket pose evaluation uses Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), which normalizes error against the object size. This is distinct from raw pixel error (MDE) used in ball tracking.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is PCK a better metric for racket pose than raw Mean Distance Error (MDE)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Video Clips + Median Frame) -> Perception Layer (TrackNetV3 + RTMPose) -> Dataset Generator (Dense Soft Labels) -> Prediction Layer (LSTM with Cross-Attention)
- **Critical path:**
  1. Train TrackNetV3 and RTMPose on the 20% sampled ground-truth frames.
  2. Run inference on 100% of frames to generate the Trajectory Dataset.
  3. Train Trajectory Predictor using the generated dataset.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Multi-frame Input (N=4 vs N=1): N=4 improves Recall/mAP (finds the ball better) but can slightly degrade Precision/MDE (jitter). Recommended to start with N=4 for robustness.
  - Multi-sport vs. Single-sport: Multi-sport models generalize better (higher mAP), but single-sport models may achieve lower absolute error (MDE) on their specific domain. Choose based on deployment target (general API vs. specialized rig).
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Side Keypoint Drift: The model detects the Top/Bottom/Handle keypoints well (>92% accuracy) but consistently fails on Left/Right edges (~65% accuracy) due to occlusion and motion blur.
  - Concatenation Drop: If you swap Cross-Attention for simple concatenation, expect an immediate ~30-40% increase in ADE/FDE errors.
  - Background Bleed: Without the Median Frame (BM=FALSE), ball tracking MDE increases by >50%.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Verification (Ball): Train TrackNetV3 with and without the median frame (BM flag) on a single sport to reproduce the ~50% MDE reduction claimed in Table 3.
  2. Fusion Ablation (Trajectory): Implement the Trajectory Predictor with two heads: one using Concat Fusion and one using Cross-Attention. Verify that Cross-Attention beats the Ball-Only baseline while Concat fails.
  3. Domain Gap Check: Train a Racket Pose estimator on Tennis only and evaluate on Badminton. Retrain on All Sports and compare the PCK delta to verify the cross-sport transfer benefit.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can advanced fusion architectures achieve statistically significant, large-margin improvements in trajectory prediction over unimodal baselines?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that while Cross-Attention improves performance, the "overall statistical improvement in ADE/FDE over the strong ball-only baseline is noticeable but not dramatic" due to the prevalence of flight-phase frames.
- **Why unresolved:** The current Cross-Attention mechanism provides marginal gains; it remains unclear if a different architecture could better leverage the "critical event" frames to drastically reduce error.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A model demonstrating a double-digit percentage reduction in ADE/FDE compared to the ball-only baseline, specifically on interaction-heavy clips.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can the detection accuracy of "side" racket keypoints (left/right) be improved to match the >92% accuracy of structural keypoints?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The analysis highlights that while structural keypoints achieve >92% accuracy, side keypoints lag significantly (64.85% to 80.11%) due to occlusion and motion blur.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper establishes the disparity but only evaluates a general RTMPose baseline, leaving the specific challenge of side-edge localization under fast motion open.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A specialized architecture or augmentation strategy that raises side keypoint PCK@0.2 to over 90% without degrading structural keypoint performance.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the inclusion of player body pose data further enhance ball trajectory prediction beyond the gains observed with racket pose?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The abstract frames the work as enabling "complex human-object interactions," and the introduction references human keypoints for occlusion handling, yet experiments are limited to ball and racket modalities.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study treats the racket as the primary interaction proxy, leaving the potential contribution of the player's body kinematics (e.g., shoulder rotation) unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments showing that a tri-modal fusion of ball, racket, and player pose outperforms the proposed ball+racket Cross-Attention model.

## Limitations
- The reliance on sparse ground-truth annotations to generate dense "soft labels" introduces potential propagation of errors from perception models to the trajectory predictor.
- The claim that Cross-Attention "learns to focus on racket hits" lacks direct quantitative evidence (e.g., frame-level analysis of attention weights).
- The assertion that multi-sport training acts as a robust regularizer is supported by benchmark scores but lacks deeper analysis on which features are shared versus sport-specific.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core finding that Cross-Attention fusion significantly outperforms naive concatenation for trajectory prediction is well-supported by ablation studies. The ~50% MDE reduction from background subtraction is also a direct, reproducible result.
- **Medium Confidence:** The assertion that multi-sport training acts as a robust regularizer is supported by benchmark numbers but is primarily comparative (MS vs. SS).
- **Low Confidence:** The qualitative claim that Cross-Attention "learns to focus on racket hits" is not directly measured.

## Next Checks
1. **Attention Visualization:** Implement an attention heatmapping tool to visualize the Cross-Attention weights over time. Verify that the model assigns higher weights to racket poses during frames immediately preceding and following ball-racket contact events.
2. **Domain Shift Analysis:** Systematically evaluate the multi-sport models on a held-out "target" sport not seen during training (e.g., train on TT/Tennis/Badminton, test on Squash). Quantify performance drop to measure the true limits of cross-sport transfer.
3. **Dense Annotation Verification:** Manually annotate a small, dense subset (e.g., 100 consecutive frames) of a few test clips. Compare the performance of trajectory models trained on this "oracle" dense data versus the "soft label" data to quantify the error introduced by the perception layer.
