## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ReVision, a novel approach for privacy-preserving multimodal interaction through visual instruction rewriting. The method converts multimodal instructions into text-only commands, enabling lightweight on-device vision-language models (250M parameters) to process visual queries without transmitting sensitive image data to servers. A curated dataset of 39,000+ examples across 15+ domains was created, and a compact vision-language model was pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. Experimental results demonstrate that even an 8-bit quantized version of the model (<500MB storage) achieves effective instruction rewriting with strong performance across NLG metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE) and semantic parsing accuracy.

## Method Summary
ReVision employs a two-stage approach: dataset curation and model development. The team first created a dataset of 39,000+ examples across 15+ domains by curating publicly available image captioning datasets and task-oriented visual instructions. They then developed a lightweight vision-language model with 250M parameters, pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned specifically for instruction rewriting. The model converts multimodal instructions (image + text) into text-only commands that can be processed on-device without sending images to servers. An 8-bit quantized version of the model was created to reduce storage requirements to under 500MB while maintaining performance.

## Key Results
- Dataset of 39,000+ examples across 15+ domains successfully created for visual instruction rewriting
- 250M parameter vision-language model achieves strong performance in converting multimodal instructions to text-only commands
- 8-bit quantized model (<500MB storage) maintains effective instruction rewriting performance across NLG metrics and semantic parsing accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ReVision works by leveraging the semantic understanding capabilities of vision-language models while removing the need for direct image transmission. The model learns to extract and verbalize the essential visual information from images, converting it into descriptive text that can be processed by standard language models. This approach preserves privacy by keeping sensitive visual data on the user's device while still enabling sophisticated multimodal interaction through text-based instruction rewriting.

## Foundational Learning

**Vision-Language Models**: Understanding visual content through multimodal learning
*Why needed*: Core capability for processing and interpreting visual information
*Quick check*: Model can accurately describe visual scenes in text format

**Instruction Rewriting**: Converting complex multimodal instructions into simpler text-only commands
*Why needed*: Enables privacy-preserving interaction without image transmission
*Quick check*: Rewritten instructions maintain task completion capability

**On-Device Processing**: Running AI models locally on user devices rather than in the cloud
*Why needed*: Ensures privacy by keeping sensitive data on the device
*Quick check*: Model inference completes within acceptable time limits on target hardware

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image Input -> Vision-Language Encoder -> Instruction Rewriter -> Text-Only Output

**Critical Path**: The vision-language encoder processes the image to extract visual features, which are then combined with the text instruction and passed through the instruction rewriting component to generate the final text-only command.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The team prioritized privacy and on-device execution over maximum model size and complexity. By using a 250M parameter model and 8-bit quantization, they achieved significant storage and privacy benefits at the potential cost of some performance compared to larger models.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may struggle with complex visual scenes requiring fine-grained spatial understanding, domain-specific terminology outside the 15+ curated categories, and nuanced multimodal reasoning that requires direct visual processing.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test instruction rewriting performance across all 15+ curated domains
2. Compare quantized vs full-precision model performance across NLG metrics
3. Evaluate semantic parsing accuracy of text-only instructions on downstream tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability to domains beyond the 15+ curated categories remains uncertain
- Performance may degrade in complex visual scenarios requiring fine-grained spatial understanding
- Reliance on publicly available image captioning datasets may introduce domain-specific biases

## Confidence

| Claim Cluster | Confidence Level |
|---------------|------------------|
| Feasibility of converting multimodal instructions to text-only commands for privacy preservation | High |
| Dataset creation methodology and scale (39,000+ examples across 15+ domains) | High |
| Effectiveness of lightweight model in achieving competitive performance across NLG metrics and semantic parsing accuracy | Medium |
| Approach's ability to bridge large-scale multimodal AI with privacy-centric, on-device execution | Medium |
| Long-term robustness of model in handling complex, unseen visual scenarios | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Test the model's performance on multimodal instructions involving fine-grained spatial relationships and multiple objects in complex scenes

2. Evaluate the system's ability to handle domain-specific terminology and visual concepts outside the 15+ curated categories

3. Conduct a user study comparing the effectiveness of privacy-preserving text-only instructions versus traditional multimodal approaches in real-world AR/VR and smartphone applications
