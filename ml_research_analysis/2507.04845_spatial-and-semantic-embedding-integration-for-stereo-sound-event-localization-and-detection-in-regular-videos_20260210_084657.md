# Spatial and Semantic Embedding Integration for Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection in Regular Videos

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.04845
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04845
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: 45.7% F≤20°/1, 15.0° DOAE, 80.5% on/off-screen accuracy on DCASE 2025 Task 3 stereo SELD dataset

## Executive Summary
This work presents a novel approach to stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) in regular videos by integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning through language-aligned embeddings. The method extends standard SELD architectures with CLAP (audio) and OWL-ViT (visual) embeddings fused via a Cross-Modal Conformer module. Additional autocorrelation-based features improve distance estimation. Models pre-trained on large synthetic datasets and fine-tuned on STARSS23 significantly outperform challenge baselines on both audio-only and audio-visual tracks.

## Method Summary
The method employs a CNN-Conformer encoder for SELD features, which are then fused with pre-trained CLAP audio and OWL-ViT visual embeddings through a modified Conformer module called Cross-Modal Conformer (CMC). The CMC replaces self-attention with cross-attention to enable intra- and inter-modal fusion while preserving convolutional inductive bias. The system incorporates short-term power of autocorrelation (stpACC) features for improved distance estimation. Models are pre-trained on synthetic datasets and fine-tuned on the stereo STARSS23 dataset, with augmentation including channel and frame swapping. A weighted BCE loss addresses on/off-screen class imbalance, and ensemble methods with visual post-processing using human keypoints further enhance performance.

## Key Results
- Audio-only model achieves 45.7% F≤20°/1 and 15.0° DOAE on development set
- Audio-visual model reaches 44.4% F≤20°/1, 15.6° DOAE, and 80.5% on/off-screen accuracy
- Systems significantly outperform challenge baselines across all metrics
- Ensemble methods and visual post-processing provide additional performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Language-aligned pre-trained embeddings provide semantic reasoning capabilities that complement traditional spatial-temporal SELD features. CLAP (audio) and OWL-ViT (visual) encoders produce embeddings rich in semantic relationships fused via cross-attention, allowing the model to leverage object identity and behavioral context that purely acoustic features cannot capture.

### Mechanism 2
The Cross-Modal Conformer enables effective intra- and inter-modal fusion by replacing self-attention with cross-attention while preserving convolutional inductive bias. This allows SELD embeddings to query CLAP embeddings for semantic context, or audio representations to query OWL-ViT tokens for spatial-semantic grounding.

### Mechanism 3
Short-term power of autocorrelation (stpACC) features provide reverberation-based cues that improve distance estimation. stpACC captures the decay pattern of autocorrelation within ~20 ms of the direct sound, encoding room response characteristics that correlate with source-receiver distance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD)
  - **Why needed here**: This is the core task—jointly classifying sound events, tracking their activity over time, and estimating spatial positions (DOA, distance). Without understanding SELD metrics (F≤20°/1, DOAE, RDE), you cannot interpret results.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the difference between SED and SSL, and why must SELD solve both simultaneously?

- **Concept**: Conformer Architecture (CNN + Convolution-augmented Transformer)
  - **Why needed here**: The SELD encoder and CMC are Conformer-based. Understanding the interleaving of convolution, self-attention, and feed-forward modules is essential to follow the CMC modifications.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does the Conformer use depthwise convolutions with a large kernel (k=51) in this context?

- **Concept**: Cross-Attention for Multimodal Fusion
  - **Why needed here**: The CMC replaces self-attention with cross-attention. You must understand query/key/value roles across modalities to diagnose fusion failures.
  - **Quick check question**: In the second CMC block, which modality provides queries and which provides keys/values?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Stereo features (log-mel + ILD + stpACC) → SELD Encoder (CNN + Conformer) → 50×512 embeddings → CMC 1 (SELD × CLAP) → fused audio → CMC 2 (audio × OWL-ViT) → multimodal representation → Prediction Head

- **Critical path**: 1. Stereo features → SELD Encoder → 50×512 embeddings; 2. Mono audio → CLAP (frozen) → 1×512 → CMC 1 (cross-attention with SELD embeddings); 3. Video frames → OWL-ViT (frozen) → 577×512 tokens → CMC 2 (cross-attention with fused audio); 4. CMC 2 output → Temporal AvgPool → Linear layers → SELD predictions

- **Design tradeoffs**: Sacrificed temporal granularity in vision (1 fps) to prioritize spatial-semantic richness from OWL-ViT tokens; frozen vs. fine-tuned encoders reduces overfitting but limits domain adaptation; spatial resolution preserved with 577 tokens vs. ResNet50's 49-vector collapse but increases memory.

- **Failure signatures**: Consistent "off-screen" predictions indicates on/off-screen class imbalance not adequately corrected; DOA errors near frame edges likely due to non-linear warping distortion; distance overestimation in anechoic scenes suggests stpACC features may not generalize.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Ablate CLAP: Train audio-only model without CMC 1 (replace with standard Conformer). Compare F≤20°/1 and DOAE to isolate CLAP's contribution. 2. Ablate stpACC: Remove stpACC from input features (use only log-mel + ILD). Measure RDE change to validate distance estimation mechanism. 3. Modality dropout stress test: During training, randomly zero OWL-ViT tokens with probability p∈{0.1, 0.3, 0.5}. Evaluate robustness to missing visual input and potential over-reliance on visual modality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. What are the individual quantitative contributions of the CLAP audio embeddings versus the OWL-ViT visual embeddings to the system's overall performance?
2. Can the visual post-processing based on human keypoints be refined to improve spatial accuracy rather than solely serving on/off-screen classification?
3. Does the low temporal resolution (1 fps) of the visual branch hinder the localization of fast-moving sound sources compared to frame-level visual processing?

## Limitations
- Frozen multimodal embeddings may not generalize across diverse sound event and object categories in target dataset
- Limited ablation of fusion design - superiority over alternative strategies not empirically validated
- Post-hoc visual post-processing introduces heuristic that is not learned jointly with model

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Integration of spatial and semantic embeddings via Cross-Modal Conformer is a plausible mechanism for enhancing SELD
- **Medium confidence**: Role of stpACC in improving distance estimation is supported by quantitative gains but lacks ablation studies
- **Low confidence**: Effectiveness of frozen, pre-trained multimodal embeddings in capturing task-relevant semantics is assumed but not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. Semantic embedding ablation: Train an audio-only model without CMC 1 (replace with standard Conformer) and compare F≤20°/1 and DOAE to isolate the contribution of CLAP semantic enhancement.
2. stpACC contribution isolation: Remove stpACC from input features and measure the change in RDE to validate the mechanism by which autocorrelation features improve distance estimation.
3. Modality dropout robustness: During training, randomly zero OWL-ViT tokens with probability p∈{0.1, 0.3, 0.5} to evaluate the model's robustness to missing visual input and potential over-reliance on the visual modality.
