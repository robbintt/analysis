# Semi-Supervised Mixture Models under the Concept of Missing at Radom with Margin Confidence and Aranda Ordaz Function

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14631
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14631
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: ECM-AO framework outperforms logistic baseline in AUC, LogLoss, and Brier score across various label missingness levels under MAR assumption.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework for Gaussian mixture models with missing labels under a Missing at Random (MAR) mechanism. The key innovation is explicitly modeling the missingness probability as a function of classification uncertainty, quantified via margin confidence and flexibly parameterized using the Aranda–Ordaz link function. An efficient ECM algorithm is developed to jointly estimate both the mixture parameters and the missingness mechanism, enabling robust imputation of missing labels. The method demonstrates consistent performance improvements over logistic regression baselines across various missingness levels and distributional settings.

## Method Summary
The framework assumes labels are missing at random based on classification uncertainty, quantified by margin confidence (difference between top two posterior probabilities). The Aranda–Ordaz link function flexibly captures asymmetric relationships between uncertainty and missing probability. An ECM algorithm jointly estimates GMM parameters and missingness mechanism parameters through alternating E-steps (computing posteriors and missingness probabilities) and CM-steps (updating parameters separately). The method is validated on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, non-Gaussian distributions, and real-world MAGIC Gamma Telescope data.

## Key Results
- ECM-AO consistently outperforms logistic regression baseline in AUC, LogLoss, and Brier score across missingness levels from 50-90%
- Maintains stable classification performance under distributional misspecification (non-Gaussian mixtures)
- Shows robust performance on real-world MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset
- Margin confidence provides efficient approximation to entropy for uncertainty quantification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Margin Confidence as Efficient Uncertainty Proxy
Margin confidence (δ²_j) approximates Shannon entropy via H(τ) ≈ log 2 − δ²_j/2, derived from second-order Taylor expansion. Valid when δ² < 0.36, covering posteriors in [0.2, 0.8]. The assumption is that classification uncertainty drives label missingness under MAR, and uncertainty can be captured by the margin between top two class probabilities.

### Mechanism 2: Aranda-Ordaz Link for Asymmetric Missingness
The AO link adds shape parameter λ: q(δ_j;α,λ) = 1 − (1 + λe^(α₀+α₁δ²_j))^(-1/λ). When λ ≠ 0, allows asymmetric response to uncertainty, capturing different missingness patterns in boundary vs confident regions.

### Mechanism 3: Joint ECM Estimation Reduces Selection Bias
Jointly estimating GMM parameters and missingness mechanism parameters reduces bias from ignoring non-random label missingness. The ECM algorithm decomposes full likelihood into identifiable and missingness terms, enabling unbiased estimation under MAR assumptions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Missing at Random (MAR) vs MCAR/MNAR taxonomy**: Why needed - framework assumes MAR; applying to MNAR data would violate core assumptions. Quick check - if labels are missing because annotators skip "hard" examples, is this MAR or MNAR?
- **EM/ECM algorithm for mixture models**: Why needed - understanding E-step and M-step is prerequisite to following Algorithm 1. Quick check - in a 2-component GMM, what does the E-step compute for each unlabeled observation?
- **Link functions in generalized linear models**: Why needed - AO link generalizes logit; understanding symmetric vs asymmetric links explains why flexibility matters. Quick check - why does standard logit link enforce symmetric response, and what structural change does the AO λ parameter introduce?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: GMM Module -> Margin Confidence Calculator -> Missingness Module -> ECM Optimizer -> Bayesian Classifier
- **Critical path**: Initialize Θ^(0) = {λ, θ, α} → E-step: compute τ_ij^(t), δ_j^(t), q_j^(t) → CM-step 1: update θ^(t+1) via quasi-Newton → CM-step 2: update (α^(t+1), λ^(t+1)) via Newton + line search → Check convergence → Impute missing labels
- **Design tradeoffs**: AO link vs Logit - AO adds flexibility (λ) but requires line search; Fixed λ vs estimated λ - fixed is faster, estimated improves fit but risks overfitting; Margin confidence vs entropy - margin is computationally cheaper but approximation degrades outside δ² ∈ [0, 0.36]
- **Failure signatures**: ECM non-convergence - check initialization, reduce missingness proportion, or simplify link; Degenerate clusters - add regularization to Σ_k or reduce components; High LogLoss despite good AUC - missingness model misspecified; Performance reversal at >90% missingness - expected, switch to simpler baselines
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate Table I: Generate 2-component Gaussian mixture, 70% MAR missingness, compare ECM-AO vs logistic baseline; 2) Validate margin approximation: Plot true entropy vs δ²/2 for posteriors [0.2, 0.8]; 3) Robustness test: Apply ECM-AO to non-Gaussian mixtures, verify calibration advantages persist

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the framework be generalized to mixture models with more than two components?
- What mechanisms drive the performance reversal of ECM-AO relative to the logistic baseline as missingness approaches 90%?
- How does the squared margin confidence approximation impact model accuracy in high-confidence regions (m² > 0.36)?

## Limitations
- MAR assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios where missingness depends on unobserved labels
- AO link function's asymptotic properties under sparse labeled data remain unclear
- Margin confidence approximation to entropy is valid only for δ² < 0.36, limiting applicability for highly uncertain classifications

## Confidence
- High Confidence: AUC improvement claims with clear statistical evidence across multiple datasets
- Medium Confidence: LogLoss/Brier score improvements under non-Gaussian mixtures - results are positive but based on synthetic data
- Low Confidence: Calibration advantage claims under distributional misspecification - limited empirical validation beyond controlled settings

## Next Checks
1. Test ECM-AO performance on MNAR data where missingness depends on unobserved labels to quantify bias when MAR assumption fails
2. Evaluate scalability to multi-class problems (K > 2) by extending margin confidence to consider top-K probabilities
3. Conduct ablation study comparing fixed vs. estimated λ in AO link across varying labeled data proportions to assess overfitting risk
