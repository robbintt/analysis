# Advocate for Complete Benchmarks for Formal Reasoning with Formal/Informal Statements and Formal/Informal Proofs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.04719
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04719
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: The paper argues for complete, error-free benchmarks in formal reasoning and automated theorem proving to accelerate progress, highlighting current barriers including scarce high-quality formal/informal data pairs, difficulty evaluating model accuracy, and errors in existing benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies critical barriers slowing progress in formal reasoning and automated theorem proving, primarily stemming from incomplete and error-prone benchmarks. The authors emphasize that current benchmarks often contain errors, lack complete formal/informal statement pairs, and fail to provide transparent training data and evaluation code. They demonstrate that automated evaluation methods can significantly overestimate model accuracy, potentially leading to deployment of unreliable systems. The paper calls for community-wide efforts to create complete benchmarks containing both formal and informal statements and proofs, full release of training data and evaluation code, and realistic evaluation pipelines that bridge informal and formal reasoning.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a comprehensive analysis of existing formal reasoning benchmarks and their limitations, drawing from the authors' observations and experiences in the field. The methodology involves examining multiple benchmarks to identify common issues such as errors in formal statements, missing informal-formal statement pairs, and inadequate evaluation methods. The authors analyze the impact of these limitations on research progress and propose solutions including complete benchmark creation, open data practices, and improved evaluation pipelines. While not presenting new empirical studies, the paper synthesizes evidence from various sources to support its claims about the state of formal reasoning benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Current benchmarks in formal reasoning contain significant errors and lack complete formal/informal statement pairs, creating barriers for researchers
- Automated evaluation methods can overestimate model accuracy by significant margins, necessitating manual verification before deployment
- Incomplete benchmarks require redundant manual verification efforts and create barriers for contributors unfamiliar with formal languages
- Open practices including full release of training data and evaluation code are essential for accelerating innovation in formal reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's arguments work by systematically identifying the fundamental infrastructure problems that hinder progress in formal reasoning research. By highlighting how incomplete and error-prone benchmarks create cascading problems - from requiring redundant manual work to potentially deploying unreliable systems - the authors establish a clear causal chain between benchmark quality and research advancement. The mechanism relies on demonstrating that current evaluation methods are insufficiently rigorous and that transparency in data and code release would enable better verification, collaboration, and innovation across the research community.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Research Community -> Benchmark Creation -> Evaluation Pipeline -> Model Development -> Deployment
                 \             \               /
                  \             \_____________/
                   \______________/

Critical Path:
The critical path for effective formal reasoning research flows from high-quality benchmark creation through robust evaluation pipelines to reliable model development and deployment. Errors or incompleteness at any stage can compromise the entire research process.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Complete vs. efficient benchmarks: Complete benchmarks with formal/informal pairs require more resources but enable better evaluation
- Automated vs. manual evaluation: Automated methods are faster but less accurate, requiring careful balance
- Open vs. proprietary data: Open practices accelerate research but may face practical implementation challenges

Failure Signatures:
- Overestimated model accuracy due to flawed evaluation methods
- Redundant manual verification efforts across research groups
- Barriers to entry for new researchers due to incomplete documentation
- Reproducibility issues stemming from unavailable training data or evaluation code

First Experiments:
1. Audit existing benchmarks to identify and document specific errors and completeness gaps
2. Implement a hybrid evaluation pipeline combining automated metrics with targeted manual verification
3. Create a small-scale complete benchmark with formal/informal statement pairs to demonstrate feasibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions in the field of formal reasoning and automated theorem proving. How can the community systematically address the scarcity of high-quality formal/informal data pairs? What are the most effective methods for combining automated and manual evaluation to ensure accuracy without excessive resource requirements? How can we create incentives for researchers to contribute to benchmark completion and correction efforts? What technical and social barriers prevent wider adoption of open data and code practices in formal reasoning research?

## Limitations
- The analysis is primarily based on the authors' observations rather than comprehensive empirical studies across the entire field
- The paper lacks systematic quantitative data on the extent of automated evaluation overestimation across different benchmark types
- Claims about the impact of incomplete benchmarks on research progress are reasonable but lack systematic empirical validation across multiple research groups
- The assertion that open practices would accelerate innovation may underestimate practical challenges such as privacy concerns and intellectual property issues

## Confidence
- High confidence: The assertion that complete, error-free benchmarks are essential for progress in formal reasoning is well-supported by documented issues in existing benchmarks and the logical connection between benchmark quality and research advancement
- Medium confidence: The claim that current benchmarks significantly slow progress due to requiring redundant manual efforts is reasonable but lacks systematic empirical validation across multiple research groups
- Medium confidence: The assertion that releasing training data and evaluation code would accelerate innovation is theoretically sound but may underestimate practical challenges such as privacy concerns and intellectual property issues

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic survey of formal reasoning researchers to quantify the actual time and effort spent on manual verification of benchmark correctness across different projects and institutions
2. Perform controlled experiments comparing research progress rates between groups using complete, verified benchmarks versus those using incomplete or error-prone benchmarks to establish causal relationships
3. Analyze existing formal reasoning papers to determine the prevalence of benchmark-related issues (such as unreported errors or incomplete data) and their impact on reported results and reproducibility
