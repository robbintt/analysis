# Wav2Arrest 2.0: Long-Horizon Cardiac Arrest Prediction with Time-to-Event Modeling, Identity-Invariance, and Pseudo-Lab Alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21695
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21695
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: PPG-only cardiac arrest prediction improves 24-hour time-averaged AUC from 0.74 to 0.78-0.80 range

## Executive Summary
Wav2Arrest 2.0 advances cardiac arrest prediction by enabling long-horizon warnings up to 24 hours in advance using only photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms. The framework addresses the challenge of scarce labeled data by introducing three orthogonal improvements: time-to-event modeling (both regression and survival approaches), identity-invariance learning using patient biometric models to deconfound patient-specific signals, and pseudo-lab alignment where auxiliary networks estimate blood biomarkers to enrich waveform labels. The system shows primary improvements over longer time horizons while maintaining performance near the event, advancing early warning system research for cardiac arrest prediction.

## Method Summary
The Wav2Arrest 2.0 framework employs a multi-task deep learning approach to predict cardiac arrest from PPG waveforms. The model uses a convolutional recurrent network architecture with attention mechanisms to process temporal waveform data. Three key innovations are integrated: time-to-event modeling that predicts both time-to-event regression and survival probabilities, identity-invariance learning that uses a pre-trained patient biometric model (p-vector) to remove patient-specific confounding signals, and pseudo-lab alignment where pre-trained auxiliary networks generate continuous estimates of blood biomarkers to provide additional supervision. The multi-task formulation exhibits high gradient conflict rates, partially mitigated using PCGrad optimization. The model operates on 8-second PPG segments with 50% overlap, processing them through 1D convolutional layers, bidirectional LSTM layers, and attention mechanisms to produce predictions across multiple time horizons.

## Key Results
- Time-to-event modeling improves 24-hour time-averaged AUC from 0.74 to 0.78-0.80 range
- Identity-invariance approach yields the highest individual gains among the three improvements
- Improvements are most pronounced over longer time horizons (24 hours) while maintaining performance near the event
- Multi-task optimization exhibits high gradient conflict rates (approximately 90%) requiring PCGrad mitigation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by addressing three fundamental challenges in long-horizon cardiac arrest prediction: temporal pattern learning, patient-specific confounding, and label scarcity. Time-to-event modeling captures the gradual physiological deterioration leading to cardiac arrest rather than binary classification. Identity-invariance learning removes patient-specific biometric signatures that may mask universal deterioration patterns. Pseudo-lab alignment enriches sparse labels with continuous biomarker estimates from pre-trained auxiliary networks, providing more granular supervision for the learning process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time-to-event modeling**: Needed because cardiac arrest is a gradual process rather than sudden event; quick check: compare regression vs survival vs binary classification performance
- **Identity-invariance learning**: Required to remove patient-specific biometric signatures that may confound universal deterioration patterns; quick check: ablate p-vector contribution and measure performance drop
- **Pseudo-lab alignment**: Necessary when labeled data is scarce; quick check: compare performance with and without auxiliary biomarker supervision
- **PCGrad optimization**: Essential for handling gradient conflicts in multi-task learning; quick check: measure conflict rate reduction with PCGrad vs standard optimization
- **PPG waveform analysis**: Fundamental input modality; quick check: validate signal quality and preprocessing pipeline
- **Attention mechanisms**: Critical for focusing on relevant temporal segments; quick check: visualize attention weights across different time horizons

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: PPG input -> 1D CNN feature extraction -> BiLSTM temporal modeling -> Attention aggregation -> Multi-task head (regression, survival, classification) with identity-invariance and pseudo-lab alignment modules
- **Critical path**: Raw PPG waveform → Convolutional feature extraction → Recurrent temporal modeling → Attention-based aggregation → Time-to-event predictions
- **Design tradeoffs**: Single-modality (PPG-only) for deployment simplicity vs. multi-modal approaches that might capture more information; complex multi-task optimization vs. simpler single-task models
- **Failure signatures**: High gradient conflicts (>90%) indicating task interference; performance degradation at longer time horizons suggesting temporal modeling limitations; potential overfitting to MIMIC-II population without external validation
- **First experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing each innovation (identity-invariance, pseudo-lab, time-to-event) to measure individual contributions; 2) PCGrad vs standard optimization comparison to quantify gradient conflict mitigation; 3) External validation on independent ICU datasets (MIMIC-III, eICU) to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single dataset evaluation (MIMIC-II) without external validation raises generalizability concerns across different clinical settings
- Gradient conflict mitigation through PCGrad shows only partial effectiveness, indicating persistent multi-task optimization challenges
- Identity-invariance approach increases model complexity, potentially affecting deployment feasibility in resource-constrained clinical environments

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: PPG-only approach is technically sound and time-to-event modeling framework is well-established
- **Medium confidence**: Individual component improvements are validated within the same dataset
- **Low confidence**: Clinical impact and real-world applicability of 24-hour advance predictions without additional vital signs or lab results

## Next Checks
1. External validation on independent ICU datasets (MIMIC-III, eICU) to assess generalizability
2. Ablation studies isolating each component's contribution while controlling for hyperparameter variations
3. Prospective clinical evaluation measuring the impact of false positives/negatives on clinical workflow and patient outcomes
