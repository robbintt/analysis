# Hallucination-Aware Generative Pretrained Transformer for Cooperative Aerial Mobility Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.10831
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10831
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: SafeGPT achieves 100% delivery success vs 98% for GPT-only, reduces battery consumption from 76.4% to 61.1%, and lowers travel distance through safer, more efficient routing.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces SafeGPT, a two-tiered framework for UAV last-mile delivery planning that combines GPT-based semantic reasoning with RL-based safety filters to mitigate hallucinations. The system uses Global GPT for high-level sector allocation and On-Device GPT for local route planning, with an RL module overriding unsafe actions. Dual replay buffers refine both GPT and RL modules over time. SafeGPT demonstrates improved delivery success rates, reduced battery consumption, and more efficient routing in simulated environments compared to GPT-only approaches.

## Method Summary
SafeGPT integrates semantic reasoning through a two-tiered GPT architecture with safety filtering via reinforcement learning. Global GPT performs sector allocation while On-Device GPT handles local route planning. An RL safety filter monitors GPT outputs and overrides unsafe actions in real-time. Dual replay buffers store successful and failure trajectories to continuously improve both the GPT and RL components. The framework operates on semantic embeddings of environmental features and task objectives, allowing flexible deployment across different urban layouts and UAV fleet sizes.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% delivery success rate versus 98% for GPT-only approach
- Reduced average battery consumption from 76.4% to 61.1%
- Lowered travel distance through safer, more efficient routing
- Demonstrated effective hallucination mitigation through RL safety filtering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SafeGPT works by combining the semantic reasoning capabilities of GPT models with the safety guarantees of RL-based filtering. The two-tiered approach allows Global GPT to handle high-level strategic decisions while On-Device GPT manages tactical route planning. The RL safety filter acts as a guardian, preventing unsafe actions that might arise from GPT hallucinations. Dual replay buffers enable continuous learning from both successes and failures, refining both semantic reasoning and safety filtering over time. This combination addresses the fundamental limitation of GPTs in safety-critical applications where hallucinations could lead to catastrophic failures.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic embeddings**: Representing environmental features and task objectives as semantic vectors - needed to enable GPT reasoning over complex spatial relationships; quick check: verify embedding quality through downstream task performance
- **Two-tiered architecture**: Separation of global planning and local execution - needed to balance strategic coordination with tactical flexibility; quick check: measure communication overhead between tiers
- **RL safety filtering**: Reinforcement learning for real-time safety validation - needed to provide guarantees beyond GPT's probabilistic outputs; quick check: evaluate false positive/negative rates of safety filter
- **Dual replay buffers**: Separate memory for successful and failed trajectories - needed to balance exploration and exploitation while learning from mistakes; quick check: analyze buffer utilization patterns over training
- **Semantic-temporal reasoning**: Understanding both spatial and temporal constraints - needed for coherent multi-UAV coordination; quick check: test temporal consistency across multiple delivery sequences

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Sensor Data -> Semantic Encoder -> Global GPT -> Local GPT -> RL Safety Filter -> Action Output

**Critical Path**: The critical path runs from semantic encoding through both GPT tiers to the RL safety filter, with the safety filter having veto power over final actions. This ensures that even if GPT planning produces unsafe outputs, the RL module can override them before execution.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture trades computational overhead for safety guarantees. The two-tiered GPT approach increases latency but improves coordination. The RL safety filter adds computational cost but provides essential safety guarantees. Dual replay buffers increase memory requirements but enable more effective learning from failures.

**Failure Signatures**: GPT hallucinations manifest as unsafe route suggestions or coordination conflicts. RL safety filter failures appear as overly conservative routing that increases delivery times. Memory buffer issues show up as degraded performance over time or inability to learn from new scenarios.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Validate individual component performance in isolation (GPT tiers, RL filter, semantic encoder)
2. Test end-to-end system with simplified delivery scenarios
3. Evaluate safety filter effectiveness by introducing controlled hallucinations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
