core_contribution: This paper proposes RLECEO, a novel Meta-Black-Box Optimization
  framework that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning to learn adaptive constraint
  handling policies for constrained expensive optimization problems (CEOPs). The core
  method formulates the optimization process as a Markov Decision Process where a
  deep Q-network-based policy dynamically controls constraint relaxation levels (epsilon
  values) to balance objective optimization and constraint satisfaction.

# Reinforcement Learning-assisted Constraint Relaxation for Constrained Expensive Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.00532
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00532
- Reference count: 40
- Proposes a novel Meta-BBO framework using DRL to learn adaptive constraint handling policies

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses constrained expensive optimization problems (CEOPs) by proposing a reinforcement learning-assisted approach called RLECEO. The method treats the optimization process as a Markov Decision Process where a deep Q-network learns to dynamically adjust constraint relaxation levels (epsilon values) to balance objective optimization and constraint satisfaction. Trained on the CEC 2017 benchmark suite, RLECEO demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to strong baselines including recent competition winners. The approach effectively learns generalizable constraint handling policies that adapt their strategy based on problem characteristics, focusing more on constraint handling for difficult problems and objective optimization for easier ones.

## Method Summary
RLECEO formulates constrained expensive optimization as a Markov Decision Process where the agent learns to control constraint relaxation levels during the optimization process. The method uses a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a policy that dynamically adjusts epsilon values, which determine how strictly constraints are enforced. The agent observes the current state (including objective values, constraint violations, and iteration count) and selects actions that modify the relaxation level. This adaptive constraint handling approach aims to find feasible solutions while optimizing the objective function. The framework is trained on the CEC 2017 benchmark suite and demonstrates effectiveness through extensive experiments including leave-one-out cross-validation and train-test split validation.

## Key Results
- RLECEO shows competitive or superior performance compared to strong baselines including CEC/GECCO competition winners
- The learned policy successfully adapts its strategy based on problem characteristics, focusing on constraint handling for difficult problems and objective optimization for easier ones
- Ablation studies confirm the importance of the designed components and demonstrate the framework's ability to learn generalizable constraint handling policies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging reinforcement learning to automatically discover effective constraint handling strategies without requiring human-designed rules. By treating constraint relaxation as a learnable policy, the DQN can dynamically balance the trade-off between exploring the search space (through constraint relaxation) and exploiting promising regions (through strict constraint enforcement). This adaptive approach allows the method to handle problems with varying difficulty levels and constraint structures more effectively than static constraint handling methods.

## Foundational Learning
- Markov Decision Processes: Needed for formulating the optimization process as a sequential decision-making problem; quick check: verify state transitions and reward structure properly capture the optimization dynamics
- Deep Q-learning: Required for approximating the Q-function that guides constraint relaxation decisions; quick check: ensure the DQN architecture is appropriate for the state and action spaces
- Constrained optimization theory: Essential for understanding the problem formulation and evaluation metrics; quick check: validate that the constraint violation measures align with problem requirements

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** DQN Policy -> State Representation -> Action Selection -> Constraint Relaxation -> Objective Evaluation -> Reward Calculation

**Critical Path:** The DQN policy selects actions (constraint relaxation levels) based on the current state, which directly affects constraint satisfaction and objective optimization. The reward signal guides policy learning by balancing feasibility and optimality.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational overhead during training (to learn the policy) for potential performance gains during optimization. The choice of state representation and reward function design significantly impacts learning effectiveness.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may result from inadequate state representation that fails to capture problem characteristics, suboptimal reward design that doesn't properly balance constraints and objectives, or insufficient training data leading to overfitting to specific problem types.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test on a simple 2D constrained problem to verify basic functionality; 2) Compare performance with and without constraint relaxation to quantify its impact; 3) Evaluate sensitivity to state representation choices on benchmark problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The generalizability of learned policies beyond the CEC 2017 benchmark suite remains uncertain
- The approach requires significant training data and computational resources, potentially limiting practical applicability for truly expensive problems
- Performance evaluation is primarily on relatively inexpensive benchmark functions, which may not represent real-world expensive optimization scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence in the methodological framework and its ability to learn adaptive constraint handling strategies
- Medium confidence in the competitive performance claims relative to baselines, as comparisons are primarily against other black-box methods on standardized benchmarks
- Low confidence in claims about effectiveness on genuinely expensive real-world problems, given validation on relatively inexpensive benchmark functions

## Next Checks
1) Test the learned policies on real-world expensive optimization problems from domains like engineering design or drug discovery to assess practical applicability
2) Evaluate the approach's robustness when trained on a subset of problem types and tested on previously unseen problem categories
3) Conduct ablation studies on the DQN architecture components and training hyperparameters to determine their impact on policy performance across different problem characteristics
