# Different types of syntactic agreement recruit the same units within large language models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.03676
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03676
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Different types of syntactic agreement recruit overlapping units within LLMs, suggesting agreement is a meaningful functional category in model representations.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how syntactic knowledge is represented within large language models (LLMs) by examining whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct model components. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, the authors identify units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena across seven open-weight models. They find that these units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern replicates in Russian and Chinese, and in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement. The findings reveal that syntactic agreement—a critical marker of syntactic dependencies—constitutes a meaningful category within LLMs' representational spaces.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a functional localization approach to identify units within LLMs that are responsive to specific syntactic phenomena. They analyze seven open-weight language models and test 67 English syntactic phenomena, including various types of agreement. Using activation correlation analysis, they identify units that respond consistently to sentences containing specific phenomena. They then conduct causal intervention experiments to test whether these identified units are functionally necessary for the models' syntactic performance. The analysis is extended to Russian and Chinese, and a cross-lingual study examines 57 languages to assess whether structurally similar languages share agreement-processing units.

## Key Results
- Different types of syntactic agreement (subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units within individual models
- Identified agreement units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support syntactic performance
- Structurally more similar languages (English, Russian, Chinese) share more units for subject-verb agreement in cross-lingual analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The findings suggest that LLMs organize syntactic knowledge around functional categories rather than processing each phenomenon through completely separate mechanisms. The overlap in units across different agreement types indicates that these models have developed a unified representation for agreement phenomena, which serves as a critical marker for syntactic dependencies. This organizational principle appears to be preserved across languages, with structurally similar languages sharing more agreement-processing units, suggesting that the models' representations align with linguistic typology.

## Foundational Learning
- **Functional localization in neural networks**: Identifying specific units responsible for particular cognitive functions is crucial for understanding how LLMs process syntax. Quick check: Verify unit identification through multiple localization methods.
- **Syntactic agreement phenomena**: Understanding different types of agreement (subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) is essential for analyzing syntactic processing. Quick check: Confirm phenomenon definitions match linguistic standards.
- **Cross-linguistic syntactic variation**: Knowledge of how different languages handle agreement helps interpret cross-lingual results. Quick check: Validate language selection covers major typological categories.
- **Causal intervention methods**: Testing whether identified units are functionally necessary requires proper intervention techniques. Quick check: Ensure interventions don't affect non-target processes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input text -> Token embedding -> Transformer layers (with attention mechanisms) -> Activation patterns -> Identified functional units -> Output predictions

**Critical path:** Token embeddings flow through transformer layers where attention mechanisms create representations that certain units become specialized for specific syntactic phenomena, particularly agreement processing.

**Design tradeoffs:** The study leverages open-weight models allowing unit-level analysis but may miss architectural differences that affect how syntactic knowledge is distributed across model components.

**Failure signatures:** If units identified for agreement phenomena don't show consistent recruitment or fail causal intervention tests, it would suggest either distributed processing or different organizational principles for syntactic knowledge.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Replicate unit localization using additional syntactic phenomena beyond agreement
2. Conduct systematic ablation studies removing identified agreement units
3. Extend cross-lingual analysis to typologically diverse languages with non-standard agreement systems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Major uncertainties remain regarding the generalizability of these findings beyond the specific syntactic phenomena and models examined. The study focuses primarily on agreement phenomena, leaving open questions about whether the observed unit sharing extends to other syntactic categories like movement or ellipsis. The functional localization approach, while powerful, relies on identifying units based on their response to specific phenomena, which may not capture the full complexity of how syntactic knowledge is distributed across model architectures.

## Limitations
- The study focuses primarily on agreement phenomena, leaving unclear whether the unit sharing pattern extends to other syntactic categories
- Cross-lingual analysis based on 57 languages may not fully represent the diversity of syntactic structures across all human languages
- Causal intervention experiments are suggestive but don't definitively prove that identified units are the sole or primary mechanisms for syntactic processing

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The finding that different types of syntactic agreement recruit overlapping units within individual models
- **Medium confidence**: The cross-lingual generalization that structurally similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement
- **Medium confidence**: The causal role of identified units in supporting syntactic performance

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the unit localization and sharing analysis using additional syntactic phenomena beyond agreement (e.g., wh-movement, island constraints) to test whether the pattern extends to other syntactic domains.
2. Conduct ablation studies that systematically remove identified agreement units to measure the impact on broader syntactic competence, not just agreement accuracy.
3. Extend the cross-lingual analysis to include typologically diverse languages with non-standard word orders or agreement systems (e.g., languages with polypersonal agreement or ergative alignment) to test the limits of the observed generalization.
