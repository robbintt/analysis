# Predicting Price Movements in High-Frequency Financial Data with Spiking Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05868
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05868
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: PSA-optimized SNN achieves 76.8% cumulative return, outperforming supervised baseline (42.5%)

## Executive Summary
This study explores Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for high-frequency trading price-spike prediction, addressing the limitations of conventional financial models in capturing fine temporal structure. A novel unsupervised STDP-trained SNN architecture with explicit inhibitory competition and temporal features is proposed. Bayesian Optimization (BO) is employed with a novel Penalized Spike Accuracy (PSA) objective to tune hyperparameters, ensuring alignment between predicted and empirical spike rates. Results show PSA-optimized models consistently outperform Spike Accuracy-tuned counterparts and supervised baselines, validating the potential of robustly tuned SNNs for effective price spike forecasting in HFT environments.

## Method Summary
The approach preprocesses AAPL tick data through VWAP smoothing (n=10), differencing, robust scaling, channel separation, and Poisson encoding. Three SNN architectures are evaluated: an established unsupervised STDP-trained model, a novel extended model with explicit inhibitory competition and temporal lags, and a supervised backpropagation baseline. Bayesian Optimization with a novel PSA objective tunes hyperparameters to maximize predictive performance while maintaining appropriate spike rates. Models are evaluated through rolling day-by-day backtesting using a momentum trading strategy.

## Key Results
- PSA-optimized extended SNN achieved 76.8% cumulative return versus 42.5% for supervised baseline
- PSA objective consistently produced more balanced spike rates than Spike Accuracy optimization
- Extended SNN with inhibitory competition outperformed simpler architectures in backtesting
- STDP-trained unsupervised learning demonstrated superior performance to gradient-based supervised methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Unsupervised STDP-trained SNNs can outperform supervised gradient-based methods for high-frequency price spike prediction when properly tuned. STDP strengthens synapses when presynaptic spikes precede postsynaptic spikes (LTP) and weakens them in reverse order (LTD), allowing neurons to become selectively responsive to recurring spatiotemporal patterns without explicit labels. The segregated pathway architecture separates positive and negative price change channels, enabling independent feature learning.

### Mechanism 2
The Penalized Spike Accuracy (PSA) objective produces more actionable trading signals than raw Spike Accuracy by preventing under-activation. PSA = Spike Accuracy × Penalty Factor, where the penalty exponentially decays if the model's spike rate deviates beyond tolerance from the empirically observed Real Spike Rate. This compels Bayesian Optimization to find hyperparameters that maintain both precision and sufficient signal frequency for trading opportunities.

### Mechanism 3
Explicit cross-pathway inhibitory connections improve momentum detection by suppressing responses to noisy, bidirectional price fluctuations. Model 2 adds inhibitory synapses from positive-change pathway to negative-hidden layer and vice versa. When price movement is consistently directional across multiple lags, one pathway dominates while suppressing the other. During noisy oscillation, mutual inhibition reduces output firing, filtering out non-actionable events.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**
  - Why needed here: The entire unsupervised learning framework depends on STDP for weight updates
  - Quick check question: If τ₊ = 45 and τ₋ = 42, what happens to a synapse when a presynaptic spike arrives 50ms before a postsynaptic spike vs. 50ms after?

- **Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Dynamics**
  - Why needed here: All models use LIF neurons with tunable membrane threshold and decay rate
  - Quick check question: A neuron has V_thresh = 2.0, β = 0.79, and receives regular input spikes. What happens to its firing rate if you increase β to 0.95 while keeping all else constant?

- **Concept: Poisson Rate Encoding**
  - Why needed here: Continuous price features must be converted to binary spike trains via Algorithm 1
  - Quick check question: A normalized feature value of 0.5 is encoded over T=20 timesteps. What is the expected number of spikes in the output train, and how does clipping this value to [0, 0.3] change the result?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Preprocessing: Raw tick data → VWAP (n=10 window) → Price differencing → Robust scaling + clipping → Channel separation → Min-max to [0,1] → Poisson encoding (T=20)
  - Model 1 (Double Input): X₁/X₂ → H₁/H₂ → Single output neuron
  - Model 2 (Extended): X₁/X₂ (k=3 lags each) → H₁/H₂ → Cross-pathway inhibitory connections → Single output neuron
  - Model 3 (Supervised Baseline): Fully connected 2-hidden-layer feedforward SNN → 2 output neurons → BPTT with surrogate gradient
  - Optimization Loop: Bayesian Optimization (Optuna, 100 iterations) → PSA objective → Select best hyperparameters → Rolling day-by-day evaluation

- **Critical path:**
  1. Data preprocessing correctness (especially channel separation for bipolar features)
  2. LIF parameter tuning (V_thresh, β control spike rates directly)
  3. STDP parameter selection (A±, τ± determine what temporal patterns become learned)
  4. Decoding threshold (D_thresh) for converting output spike count → binary prediction

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - SA vs. PSA optimization: SA yields higher precision but fewer trades; PSA yields more trades with slightly lower per-signal accuracy
  - Model 1 vs. Model 2: Model 2 is more expressive but harder to tune; Model 1 is simpler and may generalize better
  - Unsupervised vs. Supervised: Unsupervised enables online learning without labels; supervised is easier to implement but underperformed

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Spike Rate Deviation > |0.5|: Network is severely under- or over-firing; check V_thresh and normalization bounds
  - Training stability collapse: Mean weights → 1.0 without homeostasis; verify 5% weight reduction trigger is active
  - Zero True Positive Rate: D_thresh too high relative to output spike counts; lower D_thresh or increase network excitability
  - PSA objective stuck near zero: Spike Rate far from Real Spike Rate; penalty factor is dominating

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce preprocessing on sample day: Take raw AAPL tick data for one day, compute VWAP with n=10, apply differencing and normalization. Verify spike train encoding produces expected average rate.
  2. Single hyperparameter sweep on V_thresh: Fix all other parameters, vary V_thresh from 0.8 to 2.5. Plot Spike Rate and Spike Accuracy. Confirm V_thresh is the dominant control knob.
  3. Compare SA vs. PSA optimization on Model 1: Run 30-iteration Bayesian Optimization for each objective. Compare final Spike Rate Deviation and True Positive Rate.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper explicitly calls for standardized deployment on neuromorphic hardware to quantify energy and latency performance essential for HFT applications, which remains untested as the current study simulates on standard hardware.

## Limitations

- Limited generalizability beyond AAPL February 2015 data; single ticker over one month restricts external validity
- Transaction costs, slippage, and market impact not explicitly modeled in backtesting, potentially inflating performance metrics
- PSA-optimized hyperparameters may decay under concept drift as statistical properties of time series change over time

## Confidence

- Confidence: Low on generalizability beyond AAPL February 2015 data
- Confidence: Medium on hyperparameter optimization results
- Confidence: Medium on trading performance metrics

## Next Checks

1. Cross-asset validation: Apply PSA-optimized Model 2 to high-frequency data from at least 5 different stocks across multiple sectors and time periods
2. Robustness to noise: Introduce controlled microstructure noise into AAPL dataset and measure degradation in PSA-optimized model performance
3. Ablation study on inhibitory connections: Remove cross-pathway inhibitory synapses from Model 2 while keeping all other parameters PSA-optimized to quantify their contribution
