- Unified Bayesian framework addressing structured missingness, limited sample sizes, and interpretability in multimodal clinical data

## Executive Summary
This work introduces OSIRIS, a unified Bayesian framework that simultaneously addresses three major challenges in multimodal clinical data: structured missingness, limited sample sizes, and the need for interpretability. OSIRIS integrates generative and discriminative latent spaces within a single architecture: a generative space enables missing-data imputation and semi-supervised learning, while a discriminative space is optimized for task-specific classification. Sparsity-inducing priors allow automatic feature selection, enhancing interpretability. The model uses mean-field variational inference to approximate posterior distributions, and is validated on diverse multimodal datasets, achieving state-of-the-art classification performance and robust imputation accuracy. In a real clinical application on Alzheimer's disease data, OSIRIS successfully identified stable discriminative and generative factors linked to relevant biomarkers, demonstrating its capacity to disentangle complex multimodal relationships while providing interpretable insights. OSIRIS thus offers a principled, interpretable, and scalable solution for multimodal clinical data analysis.

## Method Summary
OSIRIS combines generative and discriminative learning within a unified Bayesian framework to handle multimodal clinical data with missing values. The architecture consists of two interconnected latent spaces: a generative space for modeling data distribution and handling missing values through imputation, and a discriminative space for task-specific classification. Both spaces share common factors while maintaining task-specific components. The model employs mean-field variational inference to approximate posterior distributions, enabling efficient learning from incomplete data. Sparsity-inducing priors are incorporated to promote feature selection and enhance interpretability. The framework supports semi-supervised learning by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, making it particularly suitable for clinical settings where labeled samples are scarce. The joint optimization of generative and discriminative objectives allows OSIRIS to simultaneously achieve accurate predictions, handle missing data, and provide interpretable feature importance rankings.

## Key Results
- OSIRIS achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on multimodal clinical datasets while handling structured missingness
- The framework demonstrates robust imputation accuracy across diverse missing data patterns and modalities
- In Alzheimer's disease application, OSIRIS identifies stable discriminative and generative factors linked to relevant biomarkers, enabling interpretable insights into disease mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-space architecture enables OSIRIS to leverage the complementary strengths of generative and discriminative modeling. The generative space captures the underlying data distribution and handles missing values through learned latent representations, while the discriminative space focuses on optimizing classification performance. This separation allows the model to learn task-specific features while maintaining a shared understanding of the data structure. The sparsity-inducing priors encourage the model to identify the most relevant features for each task, enhancing interpretability without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Mean-field variational inference provides a computationally efficient approximation of the posterior distributions, making the framework scalable to realistic clinical datasets. The semi-supervised learning capability is particularly valuable in clinical settings where labeled data is limited, as the generative component can leverage unlabeled data to improve model performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input modalities -> Shared latent space -> Generative space -> Imputation output
                          |
                          v
                   Discriminative space -> Classification output

Critical Path:
1. Data preprocessing and modality alignment
2. Initialization of shared and task-specific latent factors
3. Variational inference optimization loop
4. Sparsity-inducing prior application
5. Output generation (imputation and classification)

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational efficiency vs. model expressiveness: Mean-field approximation enables scalability but may limit representational capacity
- Interpretability vs. predictive accuracy: Sparsity-inducing priors enhance interpretability but may reduce model flexibility
- Generative vs. discriminative focus: Balancing these objectives affects performance on different tasks
- Number of latent factors: Tradeoff between model complexity and generalization

Failure Signatures:
- Poor imputation quality indicates insufficient generative modeling capacity
- Unstable feature selection suggests inappropriate sparsity prior specification
- Degraded classification performance may result from suboptimal balance between generative and discriminative objectives
- Convergence issues often stem from initialization problems or inappropriate hyperparameter choices

Three First Experiments:
1. Test imputation accuracy on synthetic datasets with controlled missingness patterns
2. Evaluate classification performance on benchmark multimodal datasets with complete data
3. Assess feature selection stability across multiple runs with different random seeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational complexity of mean-field variational inference may limit scalability to extremely large clinical datasets
- Model performance heavily depends on appropriate specification of hyperparameters and priors, requiring careful tuning
- Effectiveness in extremely sparse data scenarios (>50% missing values) remains untested
- Interpretability gains through sparsity-inducing priors may be dataset-specific and not universally applicable across all clinical domains

## Confidence

High confidence:
- The core theoretical framework and mathematical formulation are well-established and rigorously derived
- The integration of generative and discriminative latent spaces is methodologically sound

Medium confidence:
- The empirical validation results, while demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, are based on relatively small to moderate-sized clinical datasets
- The Alzheimer's disease application provides a compelling proof-of-concept but may not generalize to all clinical prediction tasks

Low confidence:
- The claim about "automatic feature selection" through sparsity-inducing priors may be overstated, as the degree of interpretability achieved could vary significantly depending on the specific clinical dataset and its characteristics

## Next Checks

1. Test OSIRIS on extremely large-scale clinical datasets (n > 10,000) to evaluate computational scalability and runtime efficiency
2. Conduct extensive sensitivity analyses on hyperparameter choices to quantify robustness across different clinical domains
3. Perform external validation on independent clinical cohorts to assess generalizability of the interpretability findings and biomarker identification capabilities
