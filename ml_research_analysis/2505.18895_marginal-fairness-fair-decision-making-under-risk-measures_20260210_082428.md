# Marginal Fairness: Fair Decision-Making under Risk Measures

## Quick Facts

- Introduces marginal fairness framework for equitable risk-based decision-making under statistical dependencies

## Executive Summary
This paper presents marginal fairness, a novel individual fairness notion designed to address indirect discrimination in regulated industries like insurance and finance. The framework tackles the challenge of statistical dependencies between protected attributes (e.g., gender, race) and outcomes when these attributes are excluded from final decisions. By formalizing insensitivity to distributional perturbations in protected attributes through differential sensitivity analysis, marginal fairness provides a consistent analytical approach for achieving equitable decision-making under various risk measures. The authors demonstrate both theoretical foundations and practical implementation, showing that marginal fairness adjustments can be applied with minimal sacrifice in predictive accuracy and segmentation efficiency.

## Method Summary
The marginal fairness framework models decision-making as a two-step process involving predictive modeling using both protected and non-protected covariates, followed by decision-making using generalized distortion risk measures applied only to non-protected covariates. The approach defines fairness through differential sensitivity analysis, measuring how risk-based decisions change under perturbations to the distribution of protected attributes. The authors provide theoretical characterization of optimal marginally fair decision rules that maintain minimal distance from original rules while eliminating sensitivity to protected attributes. They extend the framework with cascade sensitivity to account for statistical dependencies among covariates and demonstrate empirical implementation using French auto insurance data, showing feasible application with minimal accuracy loss.

## Key Results
- Theoretical characterization of marginally fair decision rules that minimize distance from original rules while eliminating sensitivity to protected attributes
- Extension of cascade sensitivity to handle statistical dependencies among covariates across various protected attribute types
- Empirical validation on French auto insurance data demonstrating feasible implementation with minimal predictive accuracy sacrifice

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Marginal fairness works by quantifying and eliminating the sensitivity of risk-based decisions to distributional changes in protected attributes. The mechanism relies on differential sensitivity analysis to measure how decision rules respond to perturbations in the distribution of protected characteristics. By enforcing insensitivity to these perturbations, the framework prevents indirect discrimination that arises from statistical dependencies between protected attributes and outcomes, even when protected attributes are excluded from final decisions. The cascade sensitivity extension captures complex dependencies among covariates, ensuring comprehensive fairness across multivariate protected attribute spaces.

## Foundational Learning
- **Differential Sensitivity Analysis**: Measures how decisions change under distributional perturbations of protected attributes. Needed to quantify indirect discrimination pathways and ensure decisions remain stable across demographic variations. Quick check: Verify that sensitivity measures are bounded and computable for the specific risk measure and attribute distributions.
- **Distortion Risk Measures**: Generalized risk measures that transform probability distributions to make decisions. Required for flexible risk assessment beyond traditional measures like VaR or CVaR. Quick check: Confirm distortion function satisfies necessary properties (e.g., concavity) for the chosen application.
- **Cascade Sensitivity**: Extension handling statistical dependencies among multiple covariates. Essential for realistic scenarios where protected attributes correlate with other features. Quick check: Validate that cascade formulation correctly propagates dependencies through the decision pipeline.
- **Generalized Distortion Risk Measures**: Framework for applying risk measures to transformed probability distributions. Needed to maintain mathematical consistency when implementing fairness constraints. Quick check: Ensure distortion measures preserve monotonicity and translation invariance properties.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Data -> Predictive Model (protected + non-protected) -> Risk Measure (non-protected only) -> Marginal Fairness Adjustment -> Final Decision
- **Critical Path**: The fairness adjustment step is critical, as it must modify decisions to eliminate sensitivity to protected attributes while preserving predictive performance. This involves computing sensitivity gradients and applying corrective transformations.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing fairness (eliminating sensitivity) against predictive accuracy (maintaining segmentation efficiency). The framework allows tunable parameters to control this tradeoff, but optimal settings depend on domain-specific fairness-accuracy requirements.
- **Failure Signatures**: If protected attribute distributions are misspecified or if dependencies among covariates are incorrectly modeled, the cascade sensitivity component may fail to achieve true fairness. Additionally, numerical instability can arise when computing sensitivity gradients for high-dimensional protected attribute spaces.
- **First 3 Experiments**:
  1. Apply marginal fairness to synthetic data with known protected attribute distributions to verify theoretical sensitivity bounds
  2. Compare predictive accuracy before and after fairness adjustment across multiple risk measures
  3. Test cascade sensitivity implementation on multivariate protected attributes with known dependency structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical characterization relies on assumptions about risk measure properties and complete knowledge of joint distributions
- Empirical validation currently limited to a single dataset (French auto insurance), raising generalizability concerns
- Computational complexity of cascade sensitivity for multivariate protected attributes may limit practical scalability
- Performance under distribution shifts and missing data scenarios remains unexplored

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework soundness: High
- Empirical validation breadth: Medium
- Scalability to real-world applications: Medium
- Generalizability across domains: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the marginal fairness approach across multiple datasets and risk domains to assess robustness and generalizability
2. Conduct controlled experiments to quantify fairness-accuracy trade-offs under varying levels of statistical dependency
3. Develop and evaluate scalable implementations for high-dimensional protected attribute spaces, measuring computational efficiency in practical settings
