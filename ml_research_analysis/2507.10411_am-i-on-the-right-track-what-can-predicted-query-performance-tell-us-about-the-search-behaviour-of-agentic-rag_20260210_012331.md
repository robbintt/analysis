# Am I on the Right Track? What Can Predicted Query Performance Tell Us about the Search Behaviour of Agentic RAG
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10411
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10411
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: QPP estimates of generated queries in Agentic RAG are positively correlated with final answer quality

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the use of Query Performance Prediction (QPP) in Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, specifically focusing on Search-R1 and R1-Searcher. The study investigates how different retrieval configurations affect answer quality and the number of reasoning iterations. It finds that more effective retrievers lead to fewer iterations and higher answer quality. Additionally, the research shows that QPP estimates of generated queries are positively correlated with the final answer quality, suggesting that QPP can be a useful signal in predicting answer quality in Agentic RAG.

## Method Summary
The research employs Agentic RAG systems (Search-R1 and R1-Searcher) to analyze the relationship between query performance prediction and answer quality. The study examines various retrieval configurations and their impact on reasoning iterations and final outputs. QPP models are used to estimate the performance of generated queries, which are then correlated with the quality of final answers produced by the system.

## Key Results
- More effective retrievers lead to fewer reasoning iterations and higher answer quality
- QPP estimates of generated queries show positive correlation with final answer quality
- The first retrieval iteration is crucial for determining overall answer quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of QPP in Agentic RAG stems from its ability to predict the potential success of generated queries before full retrieval and reasoning processes are executed. By providing early signals about query quality, QPP enables more informed decisions about whether to continue reasoning or adjust the search strategy, potentially reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving answer quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Query Performance Prediction (QPP)**: A technique to estimate the effectiveness of search queries before full retrieval. Why needed: Enables early quality assessment of generated queries. Quick check: Evaluate QPP correlation with actual retrieval performance.
- **Agentic RAG Systems**: AI systems that autonomously generate queries, retrieve information, and reason to produce answers. Why needed: Provides the framework for studying iterative search behavior. Quick check: Analyze iteration count vs. answer quality trends.
- **Retrieval Configurations**: Different setups for how information is retrieved (e.g., retriever models, indexing strategies). Why needed: Affects both iteration count and final answer quality. Quick check: Compare performance across multiple retriever types.
- **Reasoning Iterations**: The number of times the system generates new queries and retrieves information before producing a final answer. Why needed: Directly impacts computational cost and answer quality. Quick check: Measure correlation between iteration count and quality metrics.
- **Query Generation**: The process by which the agent creates new search queries based on previous results. Why needed: Determines the search trajectory and eventual answer quality. Quick check: Analyze diversity and relevance of generated queries.
- **Performance Correlation Analysis**: Statistical methods to determine relationships between predicted and actual performance metrics. Why needed: Validates the utility of QPP in real-world applications. Quick check: Calculate correlation coefficients between predicted and actual metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Query Generator -> QPP Model -> Retriever -> Reasoning Engine -> Answer Generator

Critical path: The most critical components are the QPP model and the first retrieval iteration, as these provide early signals that can determine whether to continue the reasoning process or adjust strategy.

Design tradeoffs: The study balances between computational efficiency (fewer iterations) and answer quality, showing that more effective initial retrieval reduces the need for multiple iterations.

Failure signatures: Poor QPP estimates may lead to unnecessary reasoning iterations or premature stopping, resulting in suboptimal answers.

First experiments:
1. Test QPP correlation with answer quality across diverse query types
2. Compare iteration counts across different retrieval configurations
3. Evaluate the impact of disabling QPP on computational efficiency and answer quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The findings may not generalize beyond the specific models (Search-R1 and R1-Searcher) and datasets studied
- The research examines a limited set of retrieval configurations, potentially missing important interactions
- The controlled experimental setup may not fully capture real-world RAG deployment complexities

## Confidence
- Generalizability of findings: Medium
- Correlation between QPP and answer quality: Medium
- Effectiveness of first retrieval iteration: High

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study across multiple diverse datasets and domains to assess the generalizability of QPP's predictive power in Agentic RAG systems.
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the relative importance of QPP versus other signals (e.g., iteration count, retrieval score distributions) in predicting answer quality.
3. Implement and evaluate a QPP-guided stopping criterion in a production Agentic RAG system to measure its impact on both efficiency and answer quality in real-world scenarios.
