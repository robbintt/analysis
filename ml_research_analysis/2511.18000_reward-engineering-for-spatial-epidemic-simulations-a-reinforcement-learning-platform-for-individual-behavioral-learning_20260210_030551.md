# Reward Engineering for Spatial Epidemic Simulations: A Reinforcement Learning Platform for Individual Behavioral Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18000
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18000
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces ContagionRL, a novel reinforcement learning platform for studying epidemic control through reward engineering.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ContagionRL, a novel reinforcement learning platform that integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable reward functions to study individual behavioral learning during epidemics. The platform enables systematic evaluation of how different reward function designs affect learned survival strategies, addressing a significant gap in epidemic modeling where reward engineering has received limited attention. By combining epidemic simulation with reinforcement learning, the authors create a framework for exploring the relationship between reward structures and agent behavior in spatial epidemic contexts.

The platform's modular design allows researchers to test various reward function configurations across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C) and conduct comprehensive ablation studies. The authors demonstrate that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes, with potential field-based rewards consistently achieving superior performance. Agents learn to maximize adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies, providing insights into how reward engineering can shape individual decision-making during disease outbreaks.

## Method Summary
ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with reinforcement learning to create a platform for studying epidemic control through reward engineering. The system uses PySIRD for epidemic simulation and Stable-Baselines3 for RL algorithms, with agents making decisions based on local infection status, movement vectors, and vaccination information. The platform features configurable parameters including population density, transmission rates, and spatial dimensions, allowing systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships. Five distinct reward function designs are evaluated across multiple RL algorithms, with comprehensive ablation studies conducted to understand the impact of different reward components on learned strategies.

## Key Results
- Five distinct reward designs tested across PPO, SAC, and A2C algorithms showed dramatically different survival outcomes and agent behaviors
- Potential field-based reward functions consistently achieved superior performance compared to other reward designs
- Agents learned sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies while maximizing adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions
- Systematic ablation studies revealed the critical importance of reward function structure in shaping learned epidemic control strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The platform works by creating a closed-loop system where agents learn to optimize their behavior based on reward signals that reflect both individual and population-level outcomes. The spatial SIRS+D model provides realistic infection dynamics that agents must navigate, while the configurable reward functions shape the learning objectives. This coupling allows agents to discover non-obvious strategies that balance personal safety with population-level considerations, demonstrating how reward engineering can guide behavior in complex epidemic scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- Spatial epidemic modeling (why needed: to capture realistic disease spread patterns; quick check: verify infection rates match expected epidemiological curves)
- Reinforcement learning algorithms (why needed: to enable autonomous behavior learning; quick check: confirm convergence across different RL methods)
- Reward function design (why needed: to shape agent behavior and learning objectives; quick check: test multiple reward configurations systematically)
- SIRS+D epidemiological dynamics (why needed: to model realistic disease progression with immunity and death; quick check: validate model against known epidemic patterns)
- Spatial agent-based simulation (why needed: to capture local interactions and movement patterns; quick check: ensure agents respond appropriately to local infection status)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
PySIRD model -> RL agent interface -> Reward function processor -> Action executor -> Environment state updater

**Critical Path:**
Simulation state -> Agent observation -> Decision-making -> Action execution -> State update -> Reward calculation -> Learning update

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The platform prioritizes modularity and configurability over computational efficiency, allowing researchers to experiment with different model parameters and reward structures. This design choice enables comprehensive exploration of the reward-behavior design space but requires significant computational resources for systematic studies. The integration of existing open-source tools (PySIRD and Stable-Baselines3) facilitates reproducibility while potentially limiting customization options for advanced users.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Agents failing to learn meaningful strategies may indicate inappropriate reward function design or insufficient exploration
- Unrealistic infection patterns could signal issues with the epidemiological model parameters or agent behavior logic
- Computational bottlenecks during training suggest the need for optimization or reduced model complexity

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Run baseline simulation with default parameters to verify proper integration of PySIRD and RL components
2. Test single reward function across multiple RL algorithms to establish baseline performance
3. Conduct ablation study by removing individual reward components to identify their impact on agent behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are confined to a single epidemiological model (SIRS+D) with specific parameter ranges, limiting generalizability
- Computational demands of extensive RL experiments create practical constraints on systematic exploration
- Simplified representation of human behavior and environmental factors may limit real-world applicability
- Reliance on existing open-source frameworks means limitations in these tools may propagate through results

## Confidence
- High: Core findings regarding reward function impact on agent behavior, supported by systematic ablation studies and multiple algorithm comparisons
- Medium: Generalizability of spatial avoidance strategies to real-world epidemic scenarios, due to simplified behavior representation
- Medium: Computational efficiency claims, based on single algorithm implementations without broader comparative analysis

## Next Checks
1. Test the platform with alternative epidemiological models (e.g., SEIR, network-based) to assess model dependency of findings
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis across different spatial domain sizes and population densities to evaluate scalability
3. Implement real-time constraint scenarios to test the practical applicability of learned strategies in dynamic epidemic conditions
