## Executive Summary
This paper introduces judo calculus, an intuitionistic framework for decentralized causal discovery using sheaves and Lawvere-Tierney topologies. The method addresses the limitation of classical causal inference that assumes universal truth by allowing causal claims to be proven locally on a cover of regimes rather than globally. Judo calculus formalizes context dependence through j-stability, where a causal claim holds constructively and consistently across a family of regimes.

The paper develops j-stable variants of popular causal discovery algorithms (GES, ψ-FCI, DCDI) by aggregating per-regime results and keeping only edges that persist across environments. Experimental results show that j-stable methods achieve substantially lower Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) and higher F1 scores compared to pooled baselines, particularly on synthetic DAGs with perfect interventions.

## Method Summary
Judo calculus extends classical causal discovery by introducing j-stability, which requires causal claims to hold consistently across a cover of regimes. The framework uses sheaves and Lawvere-Tierney topologies to formalize context-dependent truth values. J-stable algorithms are constructed by running standard causal discovery methods (GES, ψ-FCI, DCDI) on individual regimes and then aggregating results to retain only edges that persist across environments. This decentralized approach allows for causal inference that acknowledges heterogeneity while maintaining computational tractability through parallel execution.

## Key Results
- J-stable ψ-FCI achieved F1=0.33 vs 0.29 for pooled baseline, with SHD=4 vs 10
- Decentralized nature provides significant computational efficiency gains through parallelism
- Per-iteration wall-clock time comparable to or lower than vanilla methods
- Substantial wall-clock reductions through parallel execution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Judo calculus works by recognizing that causal relationships may vary across different regimes or contexts. By allowing causal claims to be proven locally and requiring only j-stable (contextually consistent) claims to be accepted, the framework avoids the unrealistic assumption of universal causal laws. The sheaf-theoretic foundation ensures that local causal inferences can be consistently combined, while Lawvere-Tierney topologies provide the mathematical machinery to handle context-dependent truth values.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Sheaves** - Mathematical structures for tracking locally defined data: needed for formalizing local causal inference; quick check: can represent local observations on different regimes
2. **Lawvere-Tierney topologies** - Intuitionistic logic framework for context-dependent truth: needed for handling regime-specific causal claims; quick check: can model varying truth values across environments
3. **J-stability** - Context-consistent causal claims: needed for filtering spurious regime-specific edges; quick check: persists across regime variations
4. **Causal sufficiency** - Assumption that no latent confounders exist: needed for valid causal inference; quick check: impacts algorithm validity
5. **Structural Hamming Distance** - Metric for comparing DAG structures: needed for quantitative evaluation; quick check: lower values indicate better structural recovery
6. **F1 score** - Harmonic mean of precision and recall: needed for balanced performance assessment; quick check: high values indicate good edge recovery

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data -> Regime Partitioning -> Per-Regime Causal Discovery -> J-Stable Aggregation -> Final Causal Graph

**Critical Path:** The core pipeline processes data through regime identification, independent causal discovery per regime, and aggregation of j-stable edges. The most critical steps are accurate regime partitioning and the j-stable aggregation mechanism.

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- Pros: Handles causal heterogeneity, provides computational efficiency through parallelism, maintains formal guarantees
- Cons: Requires regime identification, may lose fine-grained regime-specific information, theoretical completeness not fully established

**Failure Signatures:** Poor regime partitioning leads to mixing incompatible causal structures; overly strict j-stability criteria may eliminate true causal edges that vary slightly across regimes; latent confounders violate the causal sufficiency assumption underlying the algorithms.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Run j-stable GES on synthetic data with known regime shifts and compare to pooled baseline
2. Evaluate computational speedup from parallel execution on multi-core system
3. Test sensitivity to regime partitioning granularity on a simple two-regime synthetic dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Practical scalability to very large DAGs remains uncertain
- Results highly dependent on choice of cover or regime partitioning strategy
- Theoretical completeness and consistency guarantees not fully explored
- Performance gains primarily demonstrated on synthetic data with perfect interventions

## Confidence
**High**: Decentralized implementation and computational efficiency claims are well-supported by experimental timing results
**Medium**: Causal discovery accuracy improvements shown on synthetic benchmarks, but real-world generalizability uncertain
**Low-Medium**: Theoretical foundations of j-stability and relationship to classical causal discovery guarantees lack formal proofs

## Next Checks
1. Apply j-stable algorithms to real-world datasets with documented regime shifts or heterogeneous data sources to assess practical performance
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the choice of cover/partitioning strategy to understand its impact on causal accuracy and stability
3. Extend experiments to include imperfect interventions, latent confounders, and larger DAGs to test scalability and robustness beyond synthetic benchmarks
