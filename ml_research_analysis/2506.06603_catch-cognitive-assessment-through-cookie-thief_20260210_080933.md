# CAtCh: Cognitive Assessment through Cookie Thief

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.06603
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06603
- Reference count: 40
- This study evaluated multiple ML methods for predicting cognitive impairment from Cookie Thief Test recordings, finding that interpretable acoustic features significantly outperformed linguistic features, with multimodal methods showing marginal improvements over unimodal acoustic approaches.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated six machine learning methods for predicting cognitive impairment (CI) from Cookie Thief Test (CTT) recordings using a dataset of 157 older adults. The research found that multimodal approaches outperformed unimodal ones, with interpretable acoustic features relating to affect and prosody significantly outperforming BERT-based linguistic features. The Memory Fusion Network (MFN) and methods combining acoustic features achieved the highest performance, demonstrating the potential of acoustic-based approaches for CI detection. The study also revealed that methods optimized for Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD) did not translate sufficiently well to broader CI prediction.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated six open-source methods for CI prediction using 157 CTT audio recordings (28 CI cases) from primary care patients. CI was defined as MoCA z-scores below -1.0 SD. Methods included: Heitz et al. (RF on NLP features), Chen et al. (HuBERT finetuning), Ying et al. (Wav2Vec2.0 + BERT + IS10), Farzana et al. (NLP + prosody), MISA, and MFN. The evaluation used 100 random 75/25 train/test splits with minority class oversampling. Features included acoustic IS10/COVAREP, BERT/Wav2Vec2.0 embeddings, and expert NLP features. The best performers were MISA (AUC 0.672) and Ying et al. (Fmax 0.510).

## Key Results
- Interpretable acoustic features relating to affect and prosody significantly outperformed BERT-based linguistic features (p<0.001)
- Multimodal methods generally outperformed unimodal approaches for CI prediction
- Methods optimized for ADRD detection showed degraded performance when applied to broader CI prediction
- MISA achieved the highest mean AUC (0.672) while Ying et al. achieved the highest mean Fmax (0.510)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Acoustic features (affect and prosody) outperform linguistic features for broader cognitive impairment prediction from speech.
- Mechanism: Interpretable acoustic features capture paralinguistic characteristics—speech rate, silence patterns, pitch variation—that may be more robust across linguistically diverse populations than language-specific syntactic and lexical markers.
- Core assumption: CI manifests in vocal production patterns that are somewhat language-independent, whereas linguistic deficits (pronoun use, repetitions) are more specific to ADRD and require fluency in the test language.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multimodal fusion of acoustic and linguistic representations provides marginal but consistent improvements over unimodal approaches for CI prediction.
- Mechanism: Acoustic and linguistic modalities capture partially independent information streams—prosody/affect vs. semantic/syntactic structure—whose combination can recover signal lost in either single modality.
- Core assumption: The information gain from fusion outweighs the noise introduced by ASR errors and the small dataset's risk of overfitting multimodal parameters.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Methods optimized for ADRD detection transfer imperfectly to broader CI prediction, with expected performance degradation.
- Mechanism: CI is a superset category encompassing various etiologies; speech biomarkers calibrated for dementia-specific language deficits may not capture the subtler or different patterns present in non-dementia cognitive impairment.
- Core assumption: The acoustic and linguistic signatures of early-stage, heterogeneous CI differ qualitatively from those of diagnosed ADRD.

## Foundational Learning

- **Cookie Thief Test (CTT) Protocol**: Picture description task (60 seconds max) used to elicit spontaneous speech; participants describe a kitchen scene while audio is recorded. Assesses language, communication, and executive function in an ecologically valid way.
  - Why needed here: This is the input signal; understanding the task constraints (duration, prompt structure, potential for prompting) is essential for feature engineering and interpreting ASR quality.
  - Quick check question: What is the minimum and maximum recording duration, and how might variable lengths affect segment-based feature extraction?

- **Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and CI Operationalization**: MoCA raw scores converted to age- and education-adjusted z-scores; CI defined as z-scores below 1.0 standard deviation from normative mean.
  - Why needed here: This defines the ground truth label; understanding that CI is a statistical construct (not a clinical diagnosis) shapes how you interpret classifier boundaries and class imbalance.
  - Quick check question: Why would using raw MoCA scores instead of adjusted z-scores introduce confounds in CI prediction?

- **Class Imbalance Handling (Oversampling + Fmax metric)**: Dataset had 28 CI vs. 129 healthy (18% minority); authors oversampled minority class in training and evaluated using Fmax(CI)—maximum F-measure along the precision-recall curve.
  - Why needed here: Imbalanced data skews accuracy and AUC interpretation; Fmax specifically optimizes for the minority class of interest. Replicating this protocol requires implementing both the sampling strategy and the correct evaluation metric.
  - Quick check question: Why is Fmax preferred over accuracy or even raw F1 for imbalanced CI detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: CTT audio recordings -> ASR (Whisper Large-V2) -> Feature extraction (acoustic: IS10/COVAREP/HuBERT/W2V2/prosody; linguistic: BERT/expert NLP) -> Fusion (MISA/MFN/early concatenation) -> Classification (SVM/Neural Networks) -> Patient-level aggregation

- **Critical path**: Acoustic feature extraction -> patient-level aggregation -> classification. The authors' results suggest this path alone may be sufficient; linguistic branch adds complexity with uncertain payoff.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Finetuning pretrained models (BERT, W2V2, HuBERT) vs. frozen embeddings: Finetuning showed mixed results—helped W2V2 but showed no significant gain for BERT; risk of overfitting on 157 samples
  - Multimodal vs. acoustic-only: Multimodal gives marginal gains for some methods (MISA, Ying) but actively hurts others (Farzana); acoustic-only is a safer baseline
  - Expert-defined features vs. learned embeddings: Expert acoustic features (IS10, prosody) performed comparably to learned embeddings with more interpretability

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Multimodal performance below acoustic-only (Farzana et al.): Linguistic features introducing noise, likely from ASR errors or language-specific assumptions not matching cohort diversity
  - BERT-based classifiers underperforming acoustic baselines by large margins: Signal-to-noise ratio in transcribed text is too low for this task/cohort size
  - High variance across train/test splits: Dataset too small (28 CI cases) for stable model selection; expect wide confidence intervals

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Acoustic-only baseline using IS10 features + SVM**: Replicate the strongest unimodal finding; establish floor performance without ASR dependency
  2. **Ablation on Farzana et al.'s multimodal vs. unimodal**: Confirm whether linguistic features actively harm performance in your data; if so, drop linguistic branch entirely
  3. **Frozen vs. finetuned W2V2 comparison**: Test whether finetuning acoustic embeddings helps on your specific cohort, given the small sample size and the authors' mixed findings (significant for W2V2, not for BERT)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Do acoustic features maintain their superiority over linguistic features for cognitive impairment prediction in multilingual cohorts compared to English-specific NLP features?
- **Open Question 2**: Does the addition of a video modality significantly improve the performance of multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) architectures for cognitive impairment detection?
- **Open Question 3**: Can non-open-source algorithms for Alzheimer's disease detection translate more effectively to broader cognitive impairment prediction than the open-source baselines evaluated?
- **Open Question 4**: How does the prevalence of non-native English speakers in a cohort influence the relative degradation of linguistic versus acoustic features for CI detection?

## Limitations
- Small sample size (28 CI cases) introduces high variance in model performance estimates
- ASR-based transcription may introduce errors that disproportionately affect linguistic feature quality
- Methods were optimized for ADRD detection and may not capture the full spectrum of CI etiologies

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Acoustic features significantly outperform linguistic features for CI prediction; multimodal methods generally outperform unimodal approaches
- **Medium confidence**: Specific ranking of methods (MISA > Ying et al. > others) due to high variance from small sample size
- **Medium confidence**: Transfer gap between ADRD-optimized and CI detection performance, though magnitude uncertain
- **Low confidence**: Clinical utility estimates and population-level prevalence implications

## Next Checks
1. **External validation on independent CI cohort**: Test the best-performing methods (MISA, acoustic-only approaches) on a separate dataset with different demographic characteristics and CI definitions
2. **Ablation study on linguistic feature contribution**: Systematically remove linguistic features from multimodal methods to confirm they provide net benefit or harm across different methods and demographic subgroups
3. **Longitudinal prediction validation**: Evaluate whether these methods can predict future CI onset in healthy individuals, not just detect existing CI, using longitudinal MoCA data if available
