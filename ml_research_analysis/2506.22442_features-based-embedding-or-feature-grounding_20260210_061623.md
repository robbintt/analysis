- Feature-grounded embeddings inject domain-specific knowledge into word embeddings using a token-specific saturation operator, resulting in improved modularity and interpretability in NLP models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces feature-grounded embeddings, a method for integrating domain-specific knowledge into word embeddings before training large language models. The approach uses a token-specific saturation operator—a soft-triangular projection matrix with rotation—to map embeddings into a structured feature space. Training is guided by reconstruction and contrastive losses to align embeddings with interpretable, knowledge-based features. Experiments on SST-2, AG News, and TREC datasets show that models with feature-grounded embeddings exhibit improved modularity: swapping embeddings between independently trained models results in only minor performance drops, suggesting consistent internal representations. The method enhances interpretability and enables reusable, transferable embedding components.

## Method Summary
Feature-grounded embeddings inject domain-specific knowledge into word embeddings before training large language models. The approach uses a token-specific saturation operator—a soft-triangular projection matrix with rotation—to map embeddings into a structured feature space. Training is guided by reconstruction and contrastive losses to align embeddings with interpretable, knowledge-based features. The method enables improved modularity and interpretability by enforcing consistent, knowledge-grounded representations across models.

## Key Results
- Feature-grounded embeddings improve modularity across independently trained models, with minimal performance loss when swapping embeddings.
- The method enhances interpretability by aligning embeddings with structured, knowledge-based feature spaces.
- Experiments on SST-2, AG News, and TREC datasets demonstrate consistent internal representations and improved transferability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by injecting domain-specific knowledge into embeddings via a structured projection mechanism, ensuring that learned representations are both interpretable and transferable. The soft-triangular projection matrix with rotation constrains the embedding space, promoting consistency across models. Reconstruction and contrastive losses align embeddings with knowledge-based features, enabling modularity and interpretability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Token-specific saturation operator**: A projection mechanism that maps embeddings into a structured feature space; needed to inject domain knowledge and ensure consistency.
  - Quick check: Verify the projection matrix is soft-triangular and includes rotation.
- **Reconstruction loss**: Used to ensure embeddings align with knowledge-based features; needed for training stability and feature alignment.
  - Quick check: Confirm loss is applied during training to enforce feature consistency.
- **Contrastive loss**: Encourages embeddings to cluster around knowledge-grounded features; needed for improved interpretability.
  - Quick check: Ensure contrastive loss is computed between embeddings and feature representations.
- **Soft-triangular projection matrix**: Geometrically constrains the embedding space; needed to promote modularity and transferability.
  - Quick check: Validate the matrix structure and its effect on embedding distribution.
- **Knowledge-based features**: Domain-specific concepts injected into embeddings; needed to ground representations in interpretable semantics.
  - Quick check: Confirm features are derived from domain knowledge and used during training.
- **Modularity**: The ability to swap embeddings between models with minimal performance loss; needed to demonstrate transferability.
  - Quick check: Test embedding swapping across independently trained models.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Token embeddings -> Token-specific saturation operator (soft-triangular projection matrix with rotation) -> Feature-grounded embeddings -> Reconstruction and contrastive losses -> Aligned embeddings
- **Critical path**: Token embeddings flow through the saturation operator, then reconstruction and contrastive losses guide alignment with knowledge-based features, resulting in feature-grounded embeddings.
- **Design tradeoffs**: The soft-triangular projection matrix introduces a geometric constraint that promotes modularity but may limit representational flexibility; reconstruction and contrastive losses improve alignment but increase training complexity.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor alignment with knowledge-based features, high performance loss during embedding swapping, or lack of interpretability in the resulting embeddings.
- **First experiments**:
  1. Validate the projection matrix structure and its effect on embedding distribution.
  2. Test reconstruction and contrastive loss contributions via ablation.
  3. Evaluate modularity by swapping embeddings between independently trained models.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- It is unclear whether modularity gains are due to the feature-grounding mechanism or the specific reconstruction and contrastive losses used.
- Experiments are limited to three text classification datasets, raising questions about generalization to other NLP tasks or modalities.
- The paper does not address computational overhead during inference, which could be significant given the additional projection and reconstruction steps.

## Confidence
- Feature-grounded embeddings improve modularity across independently trained models: **Medium**
- The token-specific saturation operator meaningfully shapes feature space alignment: **Low**
- Improved interpretability is a direct consequence of the feature-grounding approach: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Perform an ablation study removing the rotation component from the projection matrix to isolate its contribution to modularity gains.
2. Test feature-grounded embeddings on a broader set of NLP tasks (e.g., question answering, summarization) and non-text modalities (e.g., vision-language models) to assess generalizability.
3. Measure and compare inference-time latency and memory usage between standard and feature-grounded embeddings to quantify practical overhead.
