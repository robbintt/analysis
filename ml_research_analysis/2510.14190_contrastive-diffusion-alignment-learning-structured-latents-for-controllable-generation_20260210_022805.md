# Contrastive Diffusion Alignment: Learning Structured Latents for Controllable Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.14190
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14190
- Reference count: 40
- Method: ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment) enables controllable generation by organizing diffusion model latents through supervised contrastive learning

## Executive Summary
ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment) addresses the problem of controlling complex spatiotemporal dynamics in diffusion models by organizing their latent spaces to reflect underlying dynamical factors. The core method applies supervised contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to create a compact, structured embedding space where traversal directions correspond to meaningful changes in system dynamics. This separation of editing (in the contrastively structured space) from rendering (in original diffusion latents) enables smooth nonlinear trajectory traversal for interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation. Across five domains—fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, neurostimulation, facial expressions, and monkey motor control—ConDA achieves superior performance compared to linear baselines, with up to 35.7 PSNR versus 28.3 for linear methods, and demonstrates improved temporal consistency, controllable condition-dependent transitions, and identity preservation while maintaining high generative fidelity.

## Method Summary
ConDA introduces a novel approach to controlling diffusion models by first training them on spatiotemporal data, then applying supervised contrastive learning to organize the diffusion embeddings according to underlying dynamical factors. The method creates a compact embedding space where trajectories through this space correspond to meaningful changes in system dynamics. By separating the editing space (contrastively structured) from the rendering space (original diffusion latents), ConDA enables smooth nonlinear trajectory traversal for various applications including interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation. The framework is evaluated across five diverse domains: fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, neurostimulation, facial expressions, and monkey motor control, demonstrating superior performance compared to linear baselines in terms of PSNR values, temporal consistency, and identity preservation.

## Key Results
- ConDA achieves up to 35.7 PSNR versus 28.3 for linear methods in controllable generation tasks
- Superior temporal consistency and identity preservation across all five evaluated domains
- Enables smooth nonlinear trajectory traversal for interpolation, extrapolation, and condition-dependent transitions
- Maintains high generative fidelity while providing controllable generation capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ConDA works by leveraging supervised contrastive learning to organize diffusion embeddings according to underlying dynamical factors, creating a structured latent space where traversal directions correspond to meaningful changes in system dynamics. This approach addresses the challenge that standard diffusion models learn to map random noise to data samples but lack the structure needed for controllable generation along specific dimensions. By separating the editing space (contrastively structured) from the rendering space (original diffusion latents), ConDA enables smooth nonlinear trajectory traversal that respects the underlying dynamics of the system. The method's effectiveness across diverse domains—from fluid dynamics to neural calcium imaging—demonstrates its ability to capture and organize complex spatiotemporal patterns in a way that supports controlled manipulation while maintaining generative quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion models**: Generative models that learn to reverse a gradual noising process, requiring understanding of forward and reverse processes for controllable generation
- **Supervised contrastive learning**: A technique that learns representations by pulling together similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, needed to organize latent spaces according to dynamical factors
- **Spatiotemporal dynamics**: The study of systems that evolve over both space and time, critical for applications ranging from fluid dynamics to neural activity
- **Embedding spaces**: Lower-dimensional representations that capture essential features of data, required for efficient manipulation and control of generative models
- **Nonlinear trajectory traversal**: Methods for moving through latent spaces in ways that capture complex relationships, essential for smooth transitions between states

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Pre-trained diffusion model -> Diffusion embeddings -> Supervised contrastive alignment -> Structured latent space -> Nonlinear trajectory traversal -> Controllable generation

### Critical Path
The critical path involves training a diffusion model on spatiotemporal data, extracting diffusion embeddings, applying supervised contrastive learning to organize these embeddings according to dynamical factors, and using the resulting structured latent space for controllable generation through nonlinear trajectory traversal.

### Design Tradeoffs
ConDA trades computational overhead from the contrastive alignment step for significantly improved controllability and temporal consistency. The method requires labeled datasets encoding underlying dynamical factors, which may limit applicability in domains where such labels are expensive or impossible to obtain. The separation of editing and rendering spaces enables smooth nonlinear traversal but adds complexity compared to direct manipulation approaches.

### Failure Signatures
Potential failures include poor generalization when dynamical structures differ significantly from training data, collapse of the contrastive learning objective leading to loss of structure in the embedding space, and computational bottlenecks during the alignment phase for high-resolution spatiotemporal data. The method may also struggle when the underlying dynamical factors are not well-captured by the available supervision signals.

### First 3 Experiments
1. Compare ConDA's PSNR performance against linear baselines on a held-out test set from each of the five domains
2. Evaluate temporal consistency by measuring frame-to-frame similarity in generated sequences
3. Test identity preservation by computing similarity metrics between generated and ground truth samples for facial expression and monkey motor control domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalization capability across domains with different dynamical structures remains uncertain
- Requirement for labeled datasets encoding dynamical factors may limit applicability in domains where such labels are expensive or impossible to obtain
- Computational overhead introduced by the contrastive alignment step could impact real-time or large-scale deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Quantitative results demonstrating superior PSNR values (35.7 vs 28.3) and qualitative improvements in temporal consistency and identity preservation
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical framework for organizing latent spaces through supervised contrastive learning and its broader applicability
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about smooth nonlinear trajectory traversal and controllable condition-dependent transitions, pending more extensive ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Apply ConDA to a previously unseen dynamical system (e.g., climate modeling or financial time series) to evaluate cross-domain generalization
2. Systematically vary the amount and quality of supervision signals to determine minimum labeling requirements and test semi-supervised alternatives
3. Measure precise computational cost (training time, inference latency, memory usage) compared to standard diffusion models for high-resolution spatiotemporal data
