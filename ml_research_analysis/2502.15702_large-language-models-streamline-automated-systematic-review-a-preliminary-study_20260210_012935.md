# Large language models streamline automated systematic review: A preliminary study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15702
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15702
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: GPT-4 achieved highest accuracy in search strategy (0.78), abstract screening (0.92), and data extraction (0.81)

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated three large language models (GPT-4, Claude-3, and Mistral 8x7B) for automating systematic review tasks including study design, search strategy, screening, and data extraction. GPT-4 achieved the highest accuracy in search strategy formulation (0.78), abstract screening (0.92), and data extraction (0.81). Claude-3 showed superior performance in PICO design, while all models demonstrated varying degrees of reliability across tasks. The results indicate that GPT-4 and Claude-3 are promising assistive tools for systematic review automation, though human oversight remains essential for accuracy and quality.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated three LLMs on four systematic review tasks using a dataset from a published review on neuraxial vs general anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery. Models were accessed via API with temperature=0, and prompts were iteratively refined on 2 pilot RCTs. Each task was run 5 times for reliability assessment. Ground truth included 811 abstracts, 29 full-texts, and 20 RCTs with 1,120 data points. Accuracy was measured across PICO design, search strategy retrieval, screening decisions, and structured data extraction fields (answer, quote, location).

## Key Results
- GPT-4 achieved highest accuracy in search strategy formulation (0.78), abstract screening (0.92), and data extraction (0.81)
- Claude-3 outperformed others in PICO design with higher integrity and relevance scores
- All models showed varying reliability, with GPT-4 and Claude-3 demonstrating low variability (CV<0.10)
- Mistral 8x7B performed significantly worse in data extraction (46% accuracy) compared to proprietary models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Higher information density in shorter texts (abstracts) correlates with higher model accuracy compared to diffuse long-form texts (full articles).
- **Mechanism:** LLMs utilize attention mechanisms more effectively when relevant criteria are concentrated in a single paragraph (abstract) rather than distributed across sections (full text). The paper suggests that full-text screening imposes a higher "attentional load" and contains "secondary information" that may distract the model from eligibility criteria.
- **Core assumption:** The drop in performance from abstract to full-text screening is primarily due to context length and noise, not just model reasoning capability.
- **Evidence anchors:** GPT-4 achieved highest accuracy (0.92) for abstract screening vs (0.75) for full-text screening. Full-text documents contain extensive details, increasing attentional load.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Setting the sampling temperature to zero enforces determinism, which improves reliability for structured academic tasks.
- **Mechanism:** By forcing the model to select the highest probability token at each step (Temperature = 0), the model eliminates stochastic variance. This allows for consistent "correctness" evaluation, as the model will not deviate from its learned "best" path for a given prompt.
- **Core assumption:** The model's highest probability output represents its optimal capability for the specific prompt design.
- **Evidence anchors:** For all tested models, the temperature parameter was set to zero to ensure more reliable and reproducible results. GPT-4 and Claude-3 showed low variability (CV<0.10).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Proprietary large-scale models (GPT-4, Claude-3) currently outperform open-source mixture-of-experts models (Mistral 8x7B) in complex, multi-step reasoning required for data extraction.
- **Mechanism:** Data extraction requires mapping unstructured text to a strict schema (Answer, Quote, Location). The significant performance gap suggests that larger parameter counts or superior instruction tuning in proprietary models provide better "grounding"—the ability to locate the specific source text supporting an answer.
- **Core assumption:** The gap is due to model capability/architecture rather than the specific API integration or prompt formatting used in the study.
- **Evidence anchors:** In data extraction, GPT-4 significantly outperformed other models (accuracy: GPT-4: 0.81 vs Claude-3: 0.59 vs Mistral: 0.46). Mistral showed moderate variability and lower accuracy in quantitative outcomes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: PICO Framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the standard schema the models were prompted to generate. Without understanding that "P" represents the patient cohort (e.g., hip fracture patients), one cannot evaluate why Claude-3 scored higher in "integrity" or "relevance."
  - **Quick check question:** If a study compares Drug A vs. Surgery for lung cancer, which part of PICO is "Surgery"?

- **Concept: Hallucination vs. Grounding (with Quotes)**
  - **Why needed here:** The study evaluated models on "Answer," "Quote," and "Location." Models often fabricated answers. Understanding that "Quote" verification is the mechanism to prevent hallucination is critical for system design.
  - **Quick check question:** If an LLM extracts a mortality rate of 5% but provides a quote saying "mortality was negligible," which data field indicates the error?

- **Concept: Systematic Review (SR) Screening Workflow**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper differentiates between Abstract Screening (high volume, low detail) and Full-Text Screening (low volume, high detail). The system architecture depends on this cascade.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a model achieve 92% accuracy on abstracts but only 75% on full texts, despite having more information in the full text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** PDF/Text documents converted to JSON (stripped of formatting via PyMuPDF) -> LLM APIs (GPT-4/Claude) accessed with temperature=0 and specific prompt templates -> Python scripts comparing LLM JSON output against "Ground Truth" JSON
- **Critical path:** The Data Extraction phase. This showed the largest variance (GPT-4 at 81% vs Mistral at 46%) and processes the highest volume of data points (1,120 points). Optimizing prompts here yields the highest ROI.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Context vs. Cost:** Feeding full texts (high context) costs more and lowers accuracy compared to abstracts, but is necessary for extraction.
  - **Model Selection:** Claude-3 is preferred for Protocol/PICO design (creative/structural), while GPT-4 is preferred for Screening/Extraction (factual/grounding).
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"Criteria Drift":** The paper notes LLMs failed to restrict age or study types in eligibility criteria.
  - **"Numerical Hallucination":** Mistral and Claude struggled with quantitative outcomes (accuracy < 51% for Claude), suggesting they inferred results rather than extracting them.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validation of "Temp=0":** Rerun the PICO generation task with Temperature=0.7 to quantify the variance introduced (checking the reliability analysis claim).
  2. **Quote Verification Test:** Run the extraction task asking the model *only* for the Quote and Location first, then ask for the Answer in a second pass to see if two-step reasoning improves grounding accuracy.
  3. **Full-text Truncation:** Chunk full-text articles into sections (Methods, Results) and screen sections individually to test if "attentional load" is the primary bottleneck for full-text screening accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does LLM performance in systematic review automation vary across different clinical domains and review types beyond the specific anesthesia topic tested?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors explicitly state in the limitations that "only one SR type was included, necessitating further exploration across more types and studies."
- **Why unresolved:** The study utilized a single dataset derived from a review on neuraxial versus general anesthesia, leaving the generalizability of these results to other medical fields or review methodologies unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A multi-domain evaluation replicating this protocol across diverse medical specialties and systematic review typologies.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can advanced techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or refined prompt engineering significantly improve LLM accuracy in full-text screening and data extraction?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors acknowledge they "did not employ additional techniques to enhance their capabilities across various tasks," despite identifying these methods as advancements in the introduction.
- **Why unresolved:** The study utilized a baseline API approach with zero temperature, but did not test optimization strategies that could mitigate the observed drop in performance during full-text analysis.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative studies applying RAG or chain-of-thought prompting to the same systematic review tasks to measure accuracy gains against the baseline.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How do LLMs compare to traditional, non-generative automation tools in terms of accuracy and efficiency for screening and data extraction?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors note the study "offers a horizontal comparison of three leading LLMs, yet does not compare them against other types of automation tools."
- **Why unresolved:** Without benchmarking against established machine learning classifiers or specialized systematic review software, it is difficult to determine if LLMs offer a distinct advantage over current automation standards.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A head-to-head benchmark study evaluating leading LLMs and traditional automation tools on the same dataset for screening and extraction tasks.

## Limitations

- The evaluation was conducted on a single review topic (neuraxial vs. general anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery), limiting generalizability across medical domains
- The study did not evaluate cost-effectiveness or compare LLM performance against human reviewers working at equivalent speeds
- Exact prompt formulations that achieved these results were not provided, requiring reconstruction for replication

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Abstract screening accuracy (0.92) and reliability metrics (CV<0.10 for GPT-4 and Claude-3)
- **Medium confidence:** Data extraction accuracy differences between models (81% vs 46-59%) given consistent methodology across tasks
- **Medium confidence:** The mechanism explaining why abstracts outperform full-text screening due to attentional load
- **Low confidence:** The specific prompt formulations that achieved these results, as exact prompts were not provided

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain validation:** Test the same models and methodology on systematic reviews from different medical specialties to assess generalizability of performance patterns.

2. **Human comparison study:** Compare LLM performance against human reviewers using the same screening protocols and time constraints to establish relative efficiency.

3. **Error analysis replication:** Replicate the study's error analysis focusing on the "Criteria Drift" and "Numerical Hallucination" failure modes to validate their prevalence and develop targeted mitigation strategies.
