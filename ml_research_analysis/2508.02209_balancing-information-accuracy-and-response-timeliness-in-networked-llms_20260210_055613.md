# Balancing Information Accuracy and Response Timeliness in Networked LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.02209
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02209
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Ensemble responses consistently outperform individual LLMs in balancing accuracy and latency

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of balancing information accuracy and response timeliness in multi-user systems with networked large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a centralized task processor architecture that routes binary queries to specialized LLM clusters and aggregates responses using a MAP-based adaptive majority voting scheme. The work provides closed-form expressions for both accuracy and timeliness metrics, and formulates an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of response time and error rate. Through extensive simulations across multiple benchmarks and LLM models, the paper demonstrates that their approach consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs compared to individual models, particularly when participating LLMs have similar standalone performance.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a centralized task processor that routes binary queries to specialized LLM clusters, where each cluster contains multiple LLM instances with similar capabilities. A MAP-based adaptive majority voting scheme is employed to aggregate responses, accounting for query priors and individual LLM expertise. The authors derive closed-form expressions for information accuracy (incorporating error rates and voting mechanisms) and response timeliness (considering communication and processing delays). An optimization framework is formulated to minimize a weighted sum of response time and error rate, parameterized by the number of LLMs queried per cluster. The approach is validated through simulations using various benchmarks (MMLU, BoolQ, ARC) and multiple LLM models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1), comparing ensemble responses against individual model performance.

## Key Results
- Ensemble responses consistently outperform individual LLMs across all tested benchmarks and models
- Greater accuracy gains observed when participating LLMs have similar standalone performance
- The optimization framework successfully tunes system performance based on accuracy and latency requirements
- MAP-based adaptive majority voting effectively incorporates query priors and LLM expertise to improve accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The centralized task processor architecture enables efficient routing and aggregation of responses from specialized LLM clusters. The MAP-based adaptive majority voting scheme leverages query priors and individual LLM expertise to make more informed decisions, while the closed-form expressions for accuracy and timeliness provide theoretical guarantees. The optimization framework allows for principled tuning of the system based on specific accuracy-latency trade-offs required by different applications.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM clustering and specialization**: Grouping similar LLMs enables efficient resource utilization and targeted query routing
  - Why needed: Different LLMs have varying strengths and weaknesses across domains
  - Quick check: Verify cluster performance consistency within groups
- **MAP-based adaptive majority voting**: Incorporates probabilistic reasoning about query priors and model expertise
  - Why needed: Simple majority voting ignores valuable information about query difficulty and model capabilities
  - Quick check: Test voting accuracy against ground truth on labeled datasets
- **Closed-form accuracy expressions**: Mathematical modeling of ensemble performance enables optimization
  - Why needed: Empirical testing alone cannot efficiently explore the full design space
  - Quick check: Validate theoretical bounds against simulation results
- **Response timeliness modeling**: Incorporates both processing and communication delays in the timeliness metric
  - Why needed: Real-world systems must account for network effects and queuing delays
  - Quick check: Measure actual end-to-end latency in deployed systems

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User queries -> Centralized task processor -> LLM clusters -> MAP voting -> Aggregated response
- **Critical path**: Query reception → Task routing → LLM inference → Response aggregation → Final answer delivery
- **Design tradeoffs**: Centralized vs. distributed processing, number of LLMs per cluster vs. latency, accuracy vs. timeliness weighting
- **Failure signatures**: LLM failures cause reduced accuracy, network delays increase response time, misrouting leads to suboptimal answers
- **First experiments**: 1) Benchmark individual LLM performance on test queries, 2) Test centralized routing with different cluster configurations, 3) Validate MAP voting accuracy with known priors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical expressions rely on assumptions about LLM error independence that may not hold in practice
- MAP-based voting scheme implementation challenges with dynamic estimation of priors and expertise
- Optimization framework assumes static query distributions and fixed LLM capabilities
- Simulation-based validation may not capture real-world deployment complexities

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Ensemble responses outperform individual LLMs (well-established in literature)
- **Medium confidence**: Closed-form expressions for accuracy and timeliness (mathematically derived but dependent on assumptions)
- **Medium confidence**: Optimization framework effectiveness (principled but requires accurate parameter estimation)

## Next Checks
1. Experimental validation on real-world multi-LLM systems with diverse query types and varying user loads
2. Empirical testing of MAP-based voting scheme with actual query priors and LLM expertise measurements in dynamic environments
3. Deployment studies comparing centralized task processor against distributed approaches in terms of accuracy-latency trade-offs and robustness
