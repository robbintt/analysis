- Introduces graph-based evaluation framework for multi-agent language model systems

## Executive Summary
GEMMAS introduces a graph-based evaluation framework that moves beyond final-task accuracy to assess collaboration quality in multi-agent language model systems. By modeling agent interactions as a directed acyclic graph, the framework defines two structural metrics—Information Diversity Score (IDS) and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR)—to capture semantic uniqueness and reasoning redundancy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that systems with similar accuracy can vary significantly in internal collaboration patterns, revealing hidden inefficiencies in multi-agent workflows.

## Method Summary
GEMMAS represents multi-agent interactions as a directed acyclic graph where nodes are messages and edges represent dependencies. The framework extracts two key metrics: Information Diversity Score measures semantic uniqueness across messages to quantify information flow diversity, while Unnecessary Path Ratio identifies redundant reasoning paths that don't contribute to final outputs. This structural analysis provides insights into collaboration quality beyond traditional accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- Systems with only 2.1% accuracy difference showed 12.8% difference in IDS and 80% difference in UPR
- Small open-source models (Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen 2.5-7B-Instruct) demonstrated varied collaboration patterns on mathematical reasoning tasks
- Traditional accuracy metrics failed to capture significant differences in collaboration efficiency and redundancy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by transforming multi-agent interactions into graph structures where semantic relationships between messages can be quantified. By measuring information diversity and path redundancy, GEMMAS captures aspects of collaboration quality that accuracy metrics miss. The directed acyclic graph representation allows for systematic analysis of information flow and reasoning patterns, revealing inefficiencies that impact system performance and resource utilization.

## Foundational Learning

**Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**: Why needed - To model message dependencies without cycles that could create infinite loops. Quick check - Verify graph has no cycles and edges represent valid dependencies.

**Semantic Embedding Similarity**: Why needed - To compare message content for diversity and redundancy analysis. Quick check - Ensure embeddings capture meaningful semantic differences between messages.

**Graph Metrics for Collaboration**: Why needed - To quantify collaboration quality beyond task completion. Quick check - Validate metrics correlate with human judgments of collaboration effectiveness.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Message Nodes -> Graph Construction -> Metric Calculation -> Analysis Pipeline

**Critical Path**: Message collection → DAG construction → Semantic embedding generation → IDS and UPR calculation → Result interpretation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Fixed vs. fine-tuned embeddings for semantic comparison
- Strict vs. relaxed definitions of message uniqueness
- Computational cost vs. metric granularity

**Failure Signatures**:
- Low IDS may indicate redundant information sharing
- High UPR suggests inefficient reasoning paths
- Inconsistent metrics across domains may indicate embedding space issues

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate DAG construction on simple agent interaction logs
2. Test IDS sensitivity to embedding model changes
3. Measure UPR on known redundant reasoning patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the limitations section raises implicit questions about cross-domain applicability and metric robustness that warrant further investigation.

## Limitations
- DAG representation may oversimplify complex agent interactions and context sharing
- Semantic uniqueness relies on potentially unstable embedding spaces
- Experiments limited to mathematical reasoning with small open-source models
- No ablation studies on embedding noise or DAG construction variations

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core insight that accuracy alone is insufficient for multi-agent evaluation
**Medium confidence**: Structural validity of IDS and UPR as generalizable metrics
**Low confidence**: Cross-domain applicability without additional benchmarking

## Next Checks

1. Replicate IDS and UPR calculations on a held-out mathematical reasoning dataset (e.g., MATH) to test metric stability
2. Apply GEMMAS to a non-mathematical domain (e.g., multi-agent dialogue or planning) and assess whether the metrics still capture meaningful collaboration patterns
3. Conduct an ablation study varying the embedding model and DAG construction rules to quantify metric sensitivity
