# MGTS-Net: Exploring Graph-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Augmented Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.16350
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16350
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: MGTS-Net achieves average MSE improvements of 1.95% and 5.6% over Time-VLM, and 0.045 MSE reduction compared to Time-LLM

## Executive Summary
MGTS-Net introduces a multimodal graph-enhanced framework to address time series forecasting challenges, specifically capturing fine-grained temporal patterns, effectively integrating multimodal information, and adapting to dynamic multi-scale features. The core method involves a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE) with customized encoders for time series, images, and text; a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF) using a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment; and a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP) with dynamic weighting of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, with MGTS-Net achieving average MSE improvements of 1.95% and 5.6% over Time-VLM, and 0.045 MSE reduction compared to Time-LLM. The model also shows strong performance in few-shot scenarios, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency.

## Method Summary
MGTS-Net addresses multimodal time series forecasting through a three-layer architecture: MFE extracts features from time series, images, and text using customized encoders; MFF constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment; MSP dynamically weights short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. The model demonstrates superior performance on traffic and energy datasets, with significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including Time-VLM and Time-LLM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves average MSE improvements of 1.95% and 5.6% over Time-VLM
- Demonstrates 0.045 MSE reduction compared to Time-LLM
- Shows strong performance in few-shot learning scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MGTS-Net's effectiveness stems from its ability to capture fine-grained temporal patterns through customized encoders, model complex intra-modal and cross-modal relationships via heterogeneous graph construction, and adapt to dynamic multi-scale features through weighted prediction. The framework addresses key challenges in multimodal time series forecasting by integrating information across modalities while maintaining temporal coherence and scale-specific accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combining information from different data types (time series, images, text) is essential for capturing complementary patterns in forecasting tasks. Quick check: Verify each modality contributes unique predictive signals.
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Used to model complex dependencies between modalities and temporal sequences. Quick check: Confirm graph structure captures meaningful relationships.
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjusting predictor importance across different time scales enables adaptive forecasting. Quick check: Validate weight adjustments correlate with prediction accuracy.
- **Heterogeneous Graph Construction**: Manual definition of connections between modalities may limit adaptability. Quick check: Test automated graph learning alternatives.
- **Few-shot Learning**: Ability to perform well with limited training data is crucial for practical deployment. Quick check: Evaluate performance degradation with decreasing training samples.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: MFE (TS, Image, Text Encoders) -> MFF (Heterogeneous Graph) -> MSP (Short/Medium/Long-term Predictors)

**Critical Path**: Time series data flows through MFE to extract temporal features, combines with image and text features in MFF via graph-based fusion, then passes to MSP for multi-scale prediction with dynamic weighting.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Manual graph construction provides interpretability but may limit adaptability; fixed modality combinations simplify implementation but reduce flexibility; dynamic weighting improves accuracy but adds complexity.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on irregular or non-stationary time series; degradation when partial modalities are missing; overfitting to structured domains like traffic and energy.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test MGTS-Net on high-volatility financial time series with news text and satellite imagery
2. Implement automated graph structure learning to replace manual connection strategies
3. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of available modalities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope focused on traffic and energy datasets, raising questions about generalization to volatile domains like financial markets
- Graph construction relies on manual definition of intra-modal and cross-modal dependencies without automated structure learning
- Performance uncertainty when partial modalities are unavailable or when introducing novel modalities

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Performance improvements on tested datasets | High |
| Few-shot learning effectiveness | Medium |
| Cross-domain generalization | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test MGTS-Net on high-volatility financial time series datasets with news text and satellite imagery to assess robustness to irregular patterns and market shocks
2. Implement an automated graph structure learning module that can discover optimal inter-modal connections without manual specification
3. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying the number of available modalities to quantify performance degradation and identify minimum viable multimodal combinations
