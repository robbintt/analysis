core_contribution: This paper introduces Rank-Induced PL Mirror Descent (RIPLM), a
  new algorithm for the sleeping experts problem that maintains rank-faithfulness
  while achieving variance-adaptive regret bounds. The key insight is that RIPLM updates
  directly in the rank-induced Plackett-Luce parameterization rather than over expert
  identities, ensuring the algorithm's played distributions remain within the class
  of rank-induced distributions at every round.

# Rank-Induced PL Mirror Descent: A Rank-Faithful Second-Order Algorithm for Sleeping Experts

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18138
- Reference count: 20
- Introduces RIPLM, achieving variance-adaptive regret bounds while maintaining rank-faithfulness in sleeping experts problems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Rank-Induced PL Mirror Descent (RIPLM), a novel algorithm for the sleeping experts problem that achieves both rank-faithfulness and variance adaptivity. RIPLM updates directly in the rank-induced Plackett-Luce parameterization rather than over expert identities, ensuring played distributions remain within the rank-induced distribution class at every round. The algorithm achieves second-order regret bounds of O(√V_T log N + ln ln T), matching minimax lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.

## Method Summary
RIPLM leverages the structural equivalence between rank benchmarks and distributional benchmarks, using centered residuals with AdaGrad scaling to achieve variance-adaptive regret bounds. The algorithm maintains rank-faithfulness by updating directly in the rank-induced Plackett-Luce parameterization, avoiding the pitfall of traditional algorithms that may play outside the rank-induced distribution class. This approach enables RIPLM to achieve O(√V_T log N + ln ln T) regret while preserving the rank-faithful property.

## Key Results
- First algorithm achieving both rank-faithfulness and variance adaptivity in sleeping experts setting
- Second-order regret bounds of O(√V_T log N + ln ln T) matching minimax lower bounds
- Matching lower bound of Ω(√V_T log N) establishes RIPLM's optimality up to logarithmic factors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RIPLM works by directly parameterizing updates in the rank-induced Plackett-Luce space rather than over expert identities. This structural choice ensures that the algorithm's played distributions remain within the rank-induced distribution class at every round, preserving the rank-faithful property while enabling variance-adaptive regret bounds through AdaGrad scaling.

## Foundational Learning
1. Sleeping experts problem - why needed: Understanding the problem setting where experts may be unavailable at different rounds; quick check: experts have availability vectors that change over time
2. Rank-induced distributions - why needed: Characterizing distributions that can be represented as Plackett-Luce models over expert rankings; quick check: distributions factor through a ranking of experts
3. Variance-adaptive regret - why needed: Achieving bounds that depend on the actual variance of the losses rather than worst-case bounds; quick check: regret scales with √V_T where V_T is cumulative variance
4. AdaGrad scaling - why needed: Adaptive learning rates that depend on historical gradients to achieve variance adaptivity; quick check: learning rate inversely proportional to square root of accumulated squared gradients
5. Mirror descent framework - why needed: Optimization framework that enables updates in the parameter space while maintaining constraints; quick check: updates follow gradient flow in dual space
6. Plackett-Luce model - why needed: Probabilistic ranking model that forms the basis for rank-induced distributions; quick check: probability of ranking proportional to product of individual scores

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Rank-induced PL space -> Mirror descent update -> AdaGrad scaling -> Centered residuals -> Regret bound

Critical path: Parameterization choice → Update rule → AdaGrad scaling → Regret analysis

Design tradeoffs: Rank-faithfulness vs computational efficiency; variance adaptivity vs parameter estimation requirements

Failure signatures: Loss of rank-faithfulness when parameterization drifts; poor adaptivity when variance estimates are inaccurate

First experiments:
1. Verify rank-faithfulness property on small synthetic datasets with known rankings
2. Test variance-adaptive regret scaling on datasets with varying loss variances
3. Compare RIPLM performance against state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark sleeping experts datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, focusing instead on establishing theoretical guarantees and proving matching lower bounds.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation on real-world datasets to complement theoretical guarantees
- Analysis assumes access to accurate variance information through AdaGrad scaling
- Limited characterization of algorithm's behavior under noisy variance estimates
- Stationary setting assumption may not capture non-stationary real-world scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical framework and proof techniques, given rigorous connection to established PL mirror descent methods
- Medium confidence in practical applicability, due to lack of empirical validation
- Medium confidence in novelty claims, as rank-faithful property is established but practical implications require further study

## Next Checks
1. Implement RIPLM on benchmark sleeping experts datasets to empirically verify the variance-adaptive regret bounds and compare against state-of-the-art algorithms

2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on RIPLM's performance when variance estimates are noisy or incomplete, particularly in the AdaGrad scaling component

3. Test the algorithm's behavior on non-stationary variants of the sleeping experts problem to evaluate robustness beyond the stationary setting assumed in the theoretical analysis
