# Probability Signature: Bridging Data Semantics and Embedding Structure in Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20124
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20124
- Reference count: 37
- This work investigates how embedding structures in language models are formed, focusing on the relationship between data distribution and semantic patterns.

## Executive Summary
This work investigates how embedding structures in language models are formed, focusing on the relationship between data distribution and semantic patterns. The authors propose a set of probability signatures that capture semantic relationships among tokens, derived from label distribution, input distribution, and co-occurrence patterns. Through controlled experiments on composite addition tasks using linear models and feedforward networks, combined with gradient flow analysis, they demonstrate that these probability signatures significantly influence the formation of embedding structures. The theoretical analysis reveals that the dynamics of embedding vectors are primarily driven by these probability signatures.

## Method Summary
The authors propose probability signatures derived from label distribution, input distribution, and co-occurrence patterns to capture semantic relationships among tokens. They conduct controlled experiments on composite addition tasks using linear models and feedforward networks, combined with gradient flow analysis to demonstrate the influence of these probability signatures on embedding structure formation. The framework is then extended to large language models trained on subsets of the Pile corpus to verify alignment between probability signatures and embedding structures.

## Key Results
- Probability signatures significantly influence the formation of embedding structures in language models
- The dynamics of embedding vectors are primarily driven by probability signatures derived from data distribution
- In LLMs trained on Pile corpus subsets, probability signatures align with embedding structures, particularly capturing strong pairwise similarities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism operates through probability signatures that encode semantic relationships based on label, input, and co-occurrence patterns. These signatures guide the gradient flow during training, which in turn shapes the embedding structure. The theoretical analysis shows that embedding dynamics are directly influenced by these signatures, creating a bridge between data semantics and learned representations.

## Foundational Learning
- Probability signatures: Mathematical constructs capturing semantic relationships from data distribution patterns
  - Why needed: To formalize how data semantics influence embedding structure formation
  - Quick check: Verify signature calculation matches expected semantic relationships
- Gradient flow analysis: Mathematical framework for understanding how parameters evolve during training
  - Why needed: To connect probability signatures to actual embedding dynamics
  - Quick check: Confirm gradient trajectories align with theoretical predictions
- Co-occurrence patterns: Statistical relationships between tokens appearing together in data
  - Why needed: To capture contextual semantic relationships in the data
  - Quick check: Validate co-occurrence statistics reflect linguistic patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Distribution -> Probability Signatures -> Gradient Flow -> Embedding Structure

**Critical Path**: The theoretical framework establishes that probability signatures derived from data distribution drive gradient flow dynamics, which directly shapes embedding structure formation during training.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study focuses on feedforward networks and linear models for theoretical clarity, trading off direct applicability to modern transformer architectures. This choice enables cleaner theoretical analysis but may limit generalizability.

**Failure Signatures**: When probability signatures do not align with actual semantic patterns in the data, embedding structures may fail to capture meaningful relationships. Additionally, synthetic tasks may not reveal issues that emerge with complex real-world language patterns.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Implement probability signature calculation on a small text corpus and verify semantic relationships
2. Train a feedforward network on composite addition tasks and analyze embedding structure evolution
3. Compare embedding structures in models trained with and without probability signature guidance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on feedforward networks and linear models may not capture transformer architecture complexities
- Synthetic tasks used in controlled experiments may not reflect real-world language data complexity
- Analysis limited to pairwise similarities, not exploring higher-order semantic relationships
- Does not address potential confounding factors like pretraining objectives or architectural biases

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The theoretical framework linking probability signatures to embedding dynamics is well-supported by analysis and experiments
- **Medium confidence**: The alignment between probability signatures and embedding structures in LLMs is demonstrated, but generalizability remains uncertain
- **Low confidence**: The extent to which findings apply to higher-order semantic relationships and complex real-world tasks is unclear

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on transformer-based architectures to assess generalizability beyond feedforward networks and linear models
2. Investigate the role of pretraining objectives and architectural biases in shaping embedding structures alongside probability signatures
3. Explore higher-order semantic relationships and their alignment with probability signatures in larger, more diverse datasets
