# AutoML Algorithms for Online Generalized Additive Model Selection: Application to Electricity Demand Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.24019
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24019
- Reference count: 8
- Achieves 54% improvement in RMSE over state-of-the-art models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing electricity demand forecasting models by automating the selection of both the formula and hyperparameters for adaptive Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The authors propose using the DRAGON package, originally designed for neural architecture search, to efficiently explore the search space of GAM formulae and adaptation parameters. They encode the GAM structure using DRAGON's building blocks and adapt its search operators to prevent duplicate effects and ensure interpretability. The approach is evaluated on French electricity demand forecasting, demonstrating that simultaneously optimizing both the formula and adaptation parameter using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) significantly outperforms handcrafted models and methods that optimize them separately.

## Method Summary
The authors adapt DRAGON's neural architecture search framework to automate GAM selection for electricity demand forecasting. They encode GAM structures using DRAGON's building blocks while modifying its search operators to prevent duplicate effects and maintain interpretability. The method uses an evolutionary algorithm to jointly optimize both the GAM formula structure and adaptation parameters, addressing the challenge of online model selection where demand patterns change over time.

## Key Results
- Joint optimization of formula and adaptation parameters using EA achieves 54% RMSE improvement over state-of-the-art models
- Simultaneous optimization significantly outperforms methods that optimize formula and parameters separately
- Method demonstrates effectiveness specifically for French electricity demand forecasting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging DRAGON's evolutionary search to explore the combined space of GAM formula structures and adaptation parameters simultaneously. This joint optimization allows the algorithm to discover interactions between structural choices and hyperparameter settings that would be missed when optimizing them separately. The encoding using DRAGON's building blocks provides a structured yet flexible way to represent different GAM configurations while maintaining interpretability.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)**
   - Why needed: Core modeling framework being optimized
   - Quick check: Understand additive structure and smooth terms

2. **Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)**
   - Why needed: Search method for exploring GAM space
   - Quick check: Know basic concepts of mutation, crossover, selection

3. **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**
   - Why needed: DRAGON framework foundation
   - Quick check: Understand how NAS transfers to GAM selection

4. **DRAGON Package**
   - Why needed: Provides search infrastructure and building blocks
   - Quick check: Familiarize with its operators and encoding schemes

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data -> Preprocessor -> GAM Encoder -> EA Search -> Model Evaluation -> Best Model

Critical Path: The evolutionary algorithm search loop, which iteratively generates, evaluates, and evolves candidate GAM models until convergence.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Using DRAGON's building blocks ensures interpretability but may limit model diversity
- EA-based search provides thorough exploration but at computational cost
- Joint optimization improves performance but increases search space complexity

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance may indicate insufficient search time or inadequate encoding of GAM structures
- Interpretability issues could arise if EA creates redundant or overly complex models

First Experiments:
1. Run baseline comparison with handcrafted GAMs on the same French electricity data
2. Test the impact of search time/iterations on final model performance
3. Evaluate model performance on held-out validation periods to assess online adaptation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational cost of EA-based optimization may limit real-time application
- Encoding GAM structures using DRAGON's building blocks may restrict model diversity
- Performance validation limited to French electricity demand forecasting data

## Confidence
High confidence in the 54% RMSE improvement claim, given the specific evaluation on French electricity demand forecasting data and clear demonstration that joint optimization outperforms separate optimization.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method on electricity demand datasets from multiple countries to assess robustness across different demand patterns and market structures
2. Compare computational efficiency with other AutoML approaches for GAM selection, particularly for real-time online adaptation scenarios
3. Test the method's performance on other time series forecasting domains (e.g., financial, weather, or traffic data) to establish broader applicability beyond electricity demand forecasting
