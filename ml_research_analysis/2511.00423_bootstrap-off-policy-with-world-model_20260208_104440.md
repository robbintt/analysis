core_contribution: This paper proposes BOOM, a framework that tightly integrates online
  planning and off-policy learning to address the divergence issue when collecting
  data with a planning-augmented policy rather than the policy itself. The key innovation
  is a likelihood-free alignment loss that bootstraps the policy using the planner's
  non-parametric action distribution, combined with a soft value-weighted mechanism
  that prioritizes high-return behaviors.

- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-dimensional locomotion tasks, outperforming existing planning-driven and imagination-driven model-based RL baselines on DeepMind Control Suite and Humanoid-Bench benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BOOM, a framework that integrates online planning and off-policy learning to address divergence issues in planning-augmented policy learning. The key innovation is a likelihood-free alignment loss that bootstraps the policy using the planner's non-parametric action distribution, combined with a soft value-weighted mechanism that prioritizes high-return behaviors. BOOM demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing model-based RL baselines on locomotion tasks, suggesting a promising direction for bridging planning and learning in reinforcement learning.

## Method Summary
BOOM addresses the challenge of learning from data collected by a planning-augmented policy rather than the policy itself. The framework introduces a likelihood-free alignment loss that enables the policy to bootstrap from the planner's non-parametric action distribution without requiring explicit likelihood modeling. Additionally, a soft value-weighted mechanism prioritizes high-return behaviors during training. This tight integration of online planning and off-policy learning aims to mitigate divergence issues while leveraging the strengths of both approaches. The method is evaluated on high-dimensional locomotion tasks from DeepMind Control Suite and Humanoid-Bench benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-dimensional locomotion tasks
- Outperforms existing planning-driven and imagination-driven model-based RL baselines by substantial margins
- Demonstrates effectiveness on both DeepMind Control Suite and Humanoid-Bench benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BOOM addresses divergence issues by bootstrapping the policy using the planner's non-parametric action distribution through a likelihood-free alignment loss. This allows the policy to learn from the planner's diverse action choices without being constrained by parametric assumptions. The soft value-weighted mechanism further enhances learning by prioritizing behaviors with higher returns, effectively focusing the policy on successful strategies. This dual approach of leveraging planning diversity while emphasizing high-performing actions enables more robust policy learning in complex environments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Likelihood-free alignment**: Needed to enable policy bootstrapping without parametric assumptions on action distributions. Quick check: Verify that the loss function properly aligns policy and planner distributions without requiring explicit likelihood estimation.
- **Soft value-weighted prioritization**: Required to focus learning on high-return behaviors. Quick check: Confirm that the weighting mechanism effectively scales with return values and doesn't introduce bias toward suboptimal strategies.
- **Planning-augmented data collection**: Essential for generating diverse training data that combines planning and learned policies. Quick check: Ensure the data collection process maintains sufficient diversity while avoiding planner dominance.
- **Non-parametric action distributions**: Allows flexible representation of planner outputs. Quick check: Validate that the planner can generate diverse actions across different states without collapsing to deterministic behavior.
- **Model-based RL fundamentals**: Core concepts of using learned dynamics models for policy improvement. Quick check: Verify model accuracy and its impact on planning quality.
- **Off-policy learning stability**: Techniques for learning from non-on-policy data. Quick check: Monitor for divergence or instability during training with mixed data sources.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
World Model -> Planner -> Likelihood-free Alignment Loss -> Policy Network -> Soft Value-weighted Mechanism -> Off-policy Learning Loop

**Critical Path:**
1. World model generates environment predictions
2. Planner uses predictions to generate action distributions
3. Likelihood-free alignment loss aligns policy with planner outputs
4. Soft value-weighted mechanism prioritizes high-return data
5. Off-policy learning updates policy parameters

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades computational complexity for improved sample efficiency and policy performance. The planning-augmented approach requires more computation per step but generates higher-quality data. The likelihood-free alignment avoids parametric assumptions but may be harder to optimize than explicit likelihood-based methods. The soft value-weighting improves learning focus but requires additional bookkeeping of return values.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Policy divergence when planner quality degrades
- Overfitting to planner behavior rather than learning robust policies
- Computational bottlenecks in planning or alignment loss computation
- Instability in soft value-weighting when return distributions are skewed
- World model inaccuracies propagating to policy learning

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Verify that the policy can learn basic behaviors using only the alignment loss without value-weighting
2. Test planner quality and diversity in isolation from the learning loop
3. Validate that the soft value-weighting mechanism correctly prioritizes high-return trajectories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on locomotion tasks, limiting generalizability to other domains
- Computational overhead compared to standard off-policy methods is not thoroughly analyzed
- Theoretical justification for the likelihood-free alignment loss mechanism is limited
- Sparse reward environments and long-horizon tasks are not addressed
- Implementation details for key mechanisms are sparse, making reproduction challenging

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Experimental results showing improved performance over baseline methods on tested benchmarks
- The general approach of combining planning and learning is sound and follows established RL principles

**Medium Confidence:**
- The likelihood-free alignment loss mechanism's effectiveness depends on implementation details not fully disclosed
- The soft value-weighted prioritization mechanism's advantages require further validation

**Low Confidence:**
- The "state-of-the-art" claim requires broader baseline comparisons and comprehensive ablation studies
- Scalability to more complex environments with sparse rewards is unproven

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study Required:** Perform systematic ablation experiments removing the likelihood-free alignment loss and soft value-weighted mechanisms separately to quantify their individual contributions to performance improvements.

2. **Computational Overhead Analysis:** Measure and report wall-clock time, memory usage, and training efficiency compared to standard off-policy methods to assess practical scalability limitations.

3. **Generalization Testing:** Evaluate BOOM on diverse task types beyond locomotion, including sparse reward environments, tasks with long time horizons, and domains requiring complex reasoning to validate the approach's broader applicability.
