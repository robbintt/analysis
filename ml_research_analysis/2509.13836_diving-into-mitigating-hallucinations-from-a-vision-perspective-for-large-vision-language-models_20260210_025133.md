# Diving into Mitigating Hallucinations from a Vision Perspective for Large Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.13836
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13836
- **Reference count:** 31
- **Primary result:** Introduces VisionWeaver, a context-aware routing network that significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs by dynamically aggregating features from multiple visual experts.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical issue of object hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate descriptions of non-existent objects or attributes. The authors hypothesize that different visual encoder training paradigms lead to distinct hallucination behaviors, and they introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately 10,000 samples across ten fine-grained hallucination categories. To mitigate hallucinations, they propose VisionWeaver, a context-aware routing network that dynamically aggregates visual features from multiple specialized experts using global visual features to generate routing signals. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant reductions in hallucinations while improving overall model performance.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs by introducing VisionWeaver, a context-aware routing network. VisionWeaver works by dynamically aggregating visual features from multiple specialized visual experts, where the routing decisions are made based on global visual features. The method leverages the observation that different visual encoders exhibit unique hallucination characteristics due to their diverse training paradigms. By creating a network that can route to the most appropriate visual expert based on context, the approach aims to reduce the likelihood of hallucination generation. The method is evaluated on both hallucination-specific benchmarks (POPE, AutoHallusion) and general LVLM benchmarks, showing significant improvements in reducing hallucinations while maintaining or improving overall model performance.

## Key Results
- VisionWeaver significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while improving overall model performance on benchmark datasets
- Different visual encoders exhibit distinct hallucination characteristics, validating the hypothesis about training paradigm impacts
- VHBench-10 benchmark provides comprehensive evaluation across ten fine-grained hallucination categories grouped into detection, segmentation, localization, and classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
VisionWeaver works by addressing the root cause of hallucinations through specialized visual experts. Each expert is trained with a different visual encoder paradigm, creating diverse feature representations. The context-aware routing mechanism analyzes global visual features to determine which expert is most appropriate for the current input, effectively leveraging the strengths of each encoder while mitigating their individual weaknesses. This dynamic aggregation approach allows the model to select the most reliable visual features for generating accurate descriptions, reducing the likelihood of hallucinated content.

## Foundational Learning
- **Visual Encoder Training Paradigms:** Different training approaches (supervised, self-supervised, contrastive) create distinct feature representations and biases - essential for understanding why different encoders hallucinate differently
- **Hallucination Classification:** Understanding the taxonomy of hallucinations (detection, segmentation, localization, classification) is crucial for targeted mitigation strategies
- **Context-aware Routing:** The mechanism for dynamically selecting appropriate features based on global context is fundamental to VisionWeaver's operation
- **Expert Aggregation:** Combining multiple specialized feature sets requires careful balancing to maintain coherence while reducing hallucinations
- **Benchmark Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation frameworks like VHBench-10 are necessary to measure and compare hallucination reduction effectiveness

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Image -> Multiple Visual Encoders -> Feature Extraction -> Context-aware Router -> Selected Expert Features -> Language Model

**Critical Path:** Image input flows through parallel visual encoders, their features are routed based on context analysis, and the selected expert features are passed to the language model for generation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The architecture trades increased computational complexity for improved hallucination reduction, balancing the benefits of multiple experts against routing overhead

**Failure Signatures:** Hallucinations may still occur when all experts fail similarly, or when the routing mechanism incorrectly selects an inappropriate expert for the given context

**First Experiments:** 1) Evaluate individual visual encoder hallucination rates on VHBench-10, 2) Test routing accuracy on simple image-text pairs, 3) Measure performance degradation when forcing incorrect routing decisions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Potential over-reliance on VHBench-10 benchmark which may not capture all real-world scenarios or edge cases
- Assumption that visual encoder training paradigms are the primary cause of varied hallucination behaviors, while other factors like model architecture or training data might also contribute
- Effectiveness demonstrated primarily on benchmark datasets with limited validation in diverse real-world applications

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the existence of diverse hallucination behaviors across different visual encoders, as supported by empirical evidence
- **Medium confidence** in the proposed VHBench-10 benchmark's comprehensiveness and its ability to generalize to all hallucination scenarios
- **Medium confidence** in the effectiveness of VisionWeaver, given its demonstrated performance on benchmark datasets but limited real-world validation
- **Low confidence** in the scalability and computational efficiency of VisionWeaver for larger models or datasets

## Next Checks
1. Test VisionWeaver on a broader range of real-world datasets and applications to assess its generalizability and robustness beyond benchmark scenarios
2. Investigate the impact of other factors, such as model architecture and fine-tuning procedures, on hallucination behaviors to validate the hypothesis about visual encoder training paradigms
3. Evaluate the computational efficiency and scalability of VisionWeaver when applied to larger models or datasets to ensure its practicality for real-world deployment
