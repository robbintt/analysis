# CardioEmbed: Domain-Specialized Text Embeddings for Clinical Cardiology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10930
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10930
- Reference count: 30
- CardioEmbed achieves 99.60% Acc@1 on cardiac retrieval tasks, improving by +15.94 percentage points over MedTE.

## Executive Summary
CardioEmbed addresses the gap between biomedical text embeddings trained on PubMed research abstracts and the clinical knowledge in cardiology textbooks. It uses contrastive learning on a 150k-sentence corpus from seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks to specialize Qwen3-Embedding-8B for cardiology-specific semantic relationships. The model achieves 99.60% Acc@1 on cardiac retrieval tasks, improving by +15.94 percentage points over MedTE. On MTEB benchmarks it scores BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on broader biomedical tasks.

## Method Summary
CardioEmbed fine-tunes Qwen3-Embedding-8B using contrastive learning on a corpus of 150,000 sentences extracted from seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks. The training employs InfoNCE loss with temperature τ=0.05, using LLM-generated paraphrases (GLM-4-32B and Mistral-8B) as positive pairs and sentences from other textbooks as negatives. LoRA adapters (rank r=16, alpha α=32) enable efficient fine-tuning on a single GPU. Sentence embeddings are extracted using EOS token pooling from the decoder-only architecture.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.60% Acc@1 on cardiac retrieval tasks, +15.94 percentage points over MedTE
- Outperforms existing medical embeddings across cardiology benchmarks (Medline, BIOSSES, SciFact)
- Base Qwen3-8B model (without medical fine-tuning) already achieves 93.83% Acc@1

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Textbook-based training captures procedural and clinical knowledge absent from research literature.
- Mechanism: Clinical textbooks systematically cover diagnostic procedures, treatment protocols, and integrative reasoning patterns; research abstracts focus on novel findings and hypotheses. Training on the former embeds clinical practice knowledge directly into semantic representations.
- Core assumption: The semantic relationships in textbooks accurately reflect the knowledge clinicians need in practice (Assumption: validated through expert selection of standard textbooks, but not directly measured).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts"
  - [PAGE 2] "Cardiology textbooks specifically contain detailed procedural knowledge for interventional techniques, specialized imaging protocols, and comprehensive differential diagnosis frameworks that are rarely detailed in research abstracts"
  - [corpus] Related work "Towards Domain Specification of Embedding Models in Medicine" notes most models are trained on "narrow slice of medical" data, supporting the breadth-vs-depth trade-off hypothesis
- Break condition: If textbook content becomes outdated relative to current practice, or if target application requires emerging research not yet in textbooks, performance gains may diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: InfoNCE contrastive learning with in-batch negatives creates fine-grained semantic distinctions between similar cardiology concepts.
- Mechanism: Triplets of (anchor, LLM-paraphrased positive, distant-corpus negative) are optimized using InfoNCE loss with temperature τ=0.05. In-batch negatives provide additional contrastive signal without explicit hard negative mining.
- Core assumption: LLM-based paraphrasing (GLM-4-32B, Mistral-8B) preserves medical accuracy while creating semantic equivalence (Assumption: not independently validated in paper).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [PAGE 4] "InfoNCE was selected over alternative contrastive losses... because it naturally incorporates in-batch negatives, providing additional contrastive signal without requiring explicit hard negative mining"
  - [PAGE 4] "A total of 106,386 triplets were generated for training"
  - [corpus] "Comparative Analysis of LoRA-Adapted Embedding Models for Clinical Cardiology Text Representation" similarly uses LoRA fine-tuning on cardiology text pairs, suggesting this approach is being validated independently
- Break condition: If paraphrased positives drift in meaning or if negatives are too easy/hard, contrastive signal degrades.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Strong foundation models provide substantial baseline capability; domain specialization adds incremental but meaningful gains.
- Mechanism: The base Qwen3-8B without medical fine-tuning achieved 93.83% Acc@1 (+10.17 over MedTE). Domain-specific training added +5.77 percentage points. Both foundation quality and specialization contribute.
- Core assumption: The 8B parameter scale and decoder-only architecture of Qwen3 provides stronger general language understanding than smaller encoder-only medical models (Assumption: architectural comparison not directly tested).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [PAGE 5] "CardioEmbed achieved 99.60% Acc@1... The base Qwen3-8B model (without any medical fine-tuning) achieved 93.83% Acc@1"
  - [PAGE 11] "A notable finding is that the base Qwen3-8B model (without any medical fine-tuning) outperformed all existing medical-specialized models"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on foundation model scaling effects for medical embeddings
- Break condition: If computational constraints require smaller base models, the foundation advantage may not hold.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive Learning / InfoNCE Loss
  - Why needed here: Core training objective; understanding how anchor-positive-negative triplets shape embedding space is essential for debugging retrieval quality.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why in-batch negatives improve training efficiency compared to explicit hard negative mining?

- Concept: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
  - Why needed here: Enables fine-tuning an 8B model on single GPU; understanding rank, alpha, and target modules is necessary for reproduction and hyperparameter tuning.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between LoRA rank (r=16) and alpha (α=32), and how does this affect effective learning rate?

- Concept: EOS Token Pooling for Decoder Models
  - Why needed here: Extraction method for sentence embeddings from autoregressive models; differs from [CLS] or mean pooling used in encoder architectures.
  - Quick check question: Why does the final token position accumulate contextual information in decoder-only models during a forward pass?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
```
Raw PDFs → DeepSeek-OCR → Text cleaning/deduplication → 150k sentences
                                                        ↓
                           Triplet generation (GLM-4-32B/Mistral-8B paraphrasing)
                                                        ↓
              Qwen3-Embedding-8B (INT8) + LoRA adapters (r=16, α=32)
                                                        ↓
              InfoNCE training (2 epochs, batch=128, τ=0.05)
                                                        ↓
              EOS pooling → CardioEmbed embeddings
```

- Critical path:
  1. Textbook selection and legal acquisition (blocking: cannot proceed without corpus)
  2. OCR quality validation (poor OCR propagates noise through entire pipeline)
  3. Triplet generation quality (paraphrase accuracy determines contrastive signal)
  4. LoRA adapter convergence (monitor loss on validation set of 12,516 triplets)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Depth vs. breadth: Near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60%) traded for lower NFCorpus performance (0.20 NDCG@10). Explicit architectural decision, not a bug.
  - Training efficiency vs. quality: INT8 quantization enables single-GPU training but may affect embedding precision; not ablated in paper.
  - Paraphrase generation: Using LLMs for positive generation is efficient but introduces potential semantic drift; manual validation not described.

- Failure signatures:
  - Acc@1 drops below 90% on held-out cardiology pairs → likely training instability or data quality issue
  - MRR significantly lower than Acc@1 → ranking degradation, check temperature parameter
  - High similarity scores on unrelated concepts → negative sampling insufficient or in-batch negatives too similar
  - Memory errors on TRECCOVID benchmark → expected per paper; requires multi-GPU or smaller batch evaluation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate base model: Run Qwen3-8B-Base on the 6,259 test pairs without fine-tuning; should achieve ~93.83% Acc@1 per paper. If significantly lower, check tokenization or pooling implementation.
  2. Ablate training epochs: Train for 1 epoch only and measure performance gap from 2-epoch model; paper does not report this, so this provides new signal on convergence.
  3. Test generalization boundary: Evaluate on cardiovascular content from sources outside the seven training textbooks (e.g., recent guideline documents); paper notes this as a limitation needing validation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does textbook-based domain specialization generalize to other medical specialties beyond cardiology?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future directions state: "the approach should be extended to other medical domains beyond cardiology, including oncology, neurology, radiology, and other specialties, to validate the generalizability of textbook-based domain specialization."
- Why unresolved: Only cardiology was tested; the depth-first training strategy may or may not transfer to domains with different knowledge structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training separate embedding models on textbooks from oncology, neurology, and radiology corpora, then evaluating on specialty-specific retrieval benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What biases exist in CardioEmbed from training on copyrighted cardiology textbooks, and how do they affect clinical fairness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Limitations state: "the model has not been evaluated for biases that may be present in the training textbooks."
- Why unresolved: Textbooks may reflect historical practice patterns, demographic biases in clinical trial data, or geographic variations in treatment guidelines.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic bias audits across protected patient attributes, demographic representation analysis of textbook content, and fairness evaluations on diverse clinical populations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does CardioEmbed perform on real clinical text (notes, discharge summaries) versus textbook-derived evaluation sets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The test set (6,259 pairs) was held out from the same textbook corpus; no evaluation was conducted on actual clinical documentation, limiting claims about clinical applicability.
- Why unresolved: Textbook language differs systematically from clinical notes in structure, abbreviations, and information density.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on de-identified clinical corpora (e.g., MIMIC-IV discharge summaries) measuring retrieval accuracy for cardiology-specific queries.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can multi-domain models maintain cardiology-level specialization while enabling knowledge transfer across medical specialties?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future directions state: "investigating optimal training strategies for multi-domain models that maintain specialization while enabling knowledge transfer across related medical fields represents an important theoretical challenge."
- Why unresolved: Current results show depth-versus-breadth trade-offs; whether joint training can preserve near-perfect domain performance while gaining breadth is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with multi-domain contrastive training, measuring retention of cardiology Acc@1 while improving NFCorpus and general medical retrieval scores.

## Limitations

- The evaluation framework shows strong domain specialization but has limited testing on generalization to new cardiovascular content sources or cross-domain biomedical tasks.
- The use of LLM-generated paraphrases for positive examples introduces uncertainty about semantic drift and potential degradation of medical accuracy.
- Training corpus of seven cardiology textbooks may not reflect current clinical practice if textbook content lags behind recent guidelines or emerging procedures.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: CardioEmbed achieves near-perfect retrieval performance on cardiology-specific tasks (99.60% Acc@1), representing a substantial improvement over existing medical embeddings. The paper provides clear evaluation metrics and direct comparisons showing consistent gains across all cardiology benchmarks.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that textbook-based training captures procedural and clinical knowledge absent from research literature is supported by the performance gap but relies on expert selection without direct measurement of the clinical knowledge content. The effectiveness of InfoNCE contrastive learning with LLM-paraphrased positives is demonstrated through results but lacks independent validation of paraphrase accuracy.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that Qwen3-8B provides a stronger foundation than existing medical-specialized models due to its decoder-only architecture and 8B scale is stated but not directly tested through architectural ablation studies. The computational efficiency claims (single-GPU training via INT8 quantization) are not independently verified.

## Next Checks

1. **Manual Paraphrase Validation**: Sample 100 paraphrased positive pairs and have clinical experts rate semantic equivalence on a 5-point scale. Compute inter-rater reliability and report percentage of pairs maintaining medical accuracy. This addresses the unverified assumption about LLM paraphrase quality.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate CardioEmbed on cardiovascular content from sources outside the seven training textbooks (e.g., recent ACC/AHA guidelines, FDA drug labels, or contemporary case reports). Measure performance degradation compared to in-domain textbook pairs to quantify domain boundary effects.

3. **Temporal Relevance Assessment**: Compare textbook-derived embeddings against embeddings trained on recent cardiovascular research abstracts for tasks involving emerging procedures or recent guideline changes. This would reveal whether textbook specialization becomes a liability when clinical practice evolves faster than textbook publication cycles.
