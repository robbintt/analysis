# Towards Interpretable Deep Neural Networks for Tabular Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.08617
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08617
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: XNNTab achieves interpretable predictions on par with or exceeding black-box models through monosemantic feature learning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces XNNTab, a deep neural network architecture specifically designed to improve both interpretability and predictive performance on tabular data. The method uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for prediction. An automated method assigns human-interpretable semantics to these features by learning rules that describe training instances with high activation. Predictions are then represented as linear combinations of these semantically meaningful components.

## Method Summary
XNNTab employs a sparse autoencoder to extract a dictionary of monosemantic features from the latent space, which are then used for prediction. The method includes an automated semantic assignment process that learns interpretable rules for feature activation patterns. Predictions are expressed as linear combinations of these semantically meaningful components, enabling transparent decision-making while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy.

## Key Results
- XNNTab achieves performance on par with or exceeding state-of-the-art black-box neural models
- The method demonstrates superior interpretability through semantically meaningful feature representations
- Empirical evaluations show comparable performance to classical machine learning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
XNNTab works by decomposing complex tabular data into a sparse set of monosemantic features that capture distinct, interpretable patterns in the data. The sparse autoencoder learns these features through dimensionality reduction while maintaining semantic coherence. The automated rule-learning component identifies which training instances activate each feature, creating interpretable mappings between features and real-world concepts. This decomposition enables both accurate prediction through linear combination and human-understandable explanations.

## Foundational Learning

**Sparse Autoencoders**: Learn compressed representations by reconstructing input data through a bottleneck layer. Why needed: Enable dimensionality reduction while preserving essential information. Quick check: Verify reconstruction error is low while maintaining sparsity.

**Monosemantic Features**: Each feature represents a single, coherent concept rather than mixing multiple meanings. Why needed: Ensures interpretability by preventing feature ambiguity. Quick check: Confirm feature activations correspond to distinct patterns.

**Automated Semantic Assignment**: Learns rules that map feature activations to interpretable concepts from training data. Why needed: Bridges the gap between learned representations and human understanding. Quick check: Validate that learned rules accurately describe feature behavior.

**Linear Combination Prediction**: Uses weighted sums of interpretable features for final predictions. Why needed: Maintains transparency while leveraging learned representations. Quick check: Verify prediction accuracy matches non-interpretable baselines.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> Sparse Autoencoder -> Monosemantic Features -> Semantic Assignment -> Linear Predictor -> Output

**Critical Path**: The bottleneck layer of the sparse autoencoder represents the critical component, as it determines the quality and interpretability of learned features. Issues here propagate through semantic assignment and prediction.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades some model complexity for interpretability. While sparse autoencoders add computational overhead, they enable transparent predictions. The semantic assignment process may introduce brittleness if training data coverage is incomplete.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor semantic assignment occurs when features activate on heterogeneous patterns. Model underperformance indicates the sparse autoencoder failed to capture relevant data structure. Interpretability breaks down when features lack clear semantic meaning.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test reconstruction quality of the sparse autoencoder on a simple tabular dataset
2. Validate semantic assignment accuracy by comparing learned rules against ground truth labels
3. Measure prediction accuracy using only linear combinations of interpretable features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability across diverse tabular domains remains uncertain due to limited evaluation scope
- Semantic assignment depends on training data coverage, potentially lacking meaningful interpretations for rare patterns
- Computational overhead from sparse autoencoder pre-training and semantic assignment is not discussed

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Interpretability claims | Medium |
| Performance claims | Medium |
| Generalizability | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate XNNTab across 10+ diverse tabular datasets spanning different data types, distributions, and problem domains to assess robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the sparse autoencoder component to quantify its contribution to both interpretability and performance
3. Implement a runtime and memory complexity analysis comparing XNNTab with standard deep learning approaches for tabular data
