# Generalized Kernelized Bandits: A Novel Self-Normalized Bernstein-Like Dimension-Free Inequality and Regret Bounds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.01681
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01681
- Reference count: 13
- Introduces generalized kernelized bandits (GKBs) unifying kernelized and generalized linear bandits with a novel self-normalized concentration inequality

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces generalized kernelized bandits (GKBs), a novel framework unifying kernelized bandits and generalized linear bandits. The authors develop a new Bernstein-like self-normalized concentration inequality for martingales in Hilbert spaces that overcomes limitations of existing approaches when dealing with non-linear mean functions and infinite-dimensional RKHS. Based on this theoretical advance, they propose GKB-UCB, an optimistic algorithm achieving regret bounds of order Õ(γT√(T/κ*)), where γT is the maximal information gain and κ* characterizes the non-linearity of the link function. The paper also presents Trac-GKB-UCB, a tractable implementation with similar regret guarantees.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a novel Bernstein-like self-normalized concentration inequality for martingales in Hilbert spaces that addresses the challenge of simultaneously handling non-linear mean functions and potentially infinite-dimensional RKHS. This inequality forms the theoretical foundation for GKB-UCB, which uses an optimistic principle to balance exploration and exploitation. The authors also introduce Trac-GKB-UCB, a computationally tractable variant that maintains similar regret guarantees while being implementable in practice. The regret analysis explicitly captures the trade-off between the information gain parameter γT and the non-linearity parameter κ*.

## Key Results
- Introduces generalized kernelized bandits (GKBs) unifying kernelized and generalized linear bandits
- Develops a novel Bernstein-like self-normalized concentration inequality for martingales in Hilbert spaces
- Achieves regret bound of Õ(γT√(T/κ*)) that matches state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs
- Proposes Trac-GKB-UCB with tractable implementation and similar theoretical guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed framework succeeds by introducing a novel self-normalized concentration inequality that properly handles both the infinite-dimensional nature of RKHS and the non-linear link function of exponential family distributions. The key insight is that traditional approaches fail because they cannot simultaneously manage the complexity of kernel methods and the non-linearity of generalized linear models. The Bernstein-like inequality provides tighter concentration bounds by leveraging the variance structure of the exponential family, while the explicit dependence on κ* captures how the non-linearity of the link function affects the regret.

## Foundational Learning

**Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**: Function spaces with kernel methods that allow working with infinite-dimensional features implicitly - needed for kernelized bandits, check by verifying kernel trick applications.

**Exponential Family Distributions**: A class of probability distributions with specific mathematical properties that enable tractable inference - needed for modeling rewards, check by confirming moment generating function properties.

**Self-Normalized Concentration Inequalities**: Probabilistic bounds that adapt to observed data without requiring prior knowledge of variance - needed for bandit analysis, check by verifying martingale difference sequences.

**Bernstein Conditions**: Assumptions about the variance of random variables that enable tighter concentration bounds - needed for improved regret analysis, check by confirming variance bounds.

**Maximal Information Gain**: A measure of the complexity of a function class that quantifies how much information can be extracted - needed for regret bounds, check by computing information ratios.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: RKHS + EF distribution -> Non-linear mean function µ(f*) -> GKB framework -> Self-normalized inequality -> GKB-UCB algorithm -> Regret bound

Critical path: The theoretical foundation (novel concentration inequality) enables the algorithm design (GKB-UCB), which directly determines the regret guarantees. The tractable variant (Trac-GKB-UCB) follows as a practical implementation.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational tractability for theoretical generality - the full GKB-UCB achieves optimal regret but may be intractable, while Trac-GKB-UCB sacrifices some generality for implementability.

Failure signatures: Poor performance indicates either kernel misspecification, violation of exponential family assumptions, or insufficient exploration due to the non-linearity parameter κ*.

First experiments: 1) Verify the novel self-normalized inequality through independent proof checking or formal verification; 2) Implement Trac-GKB-UCB and benchmark against state-of-the-art KB and GLB algorithms on synthetic data; 3) Test the algorithm's sensitivity to kernel misspecification and parameter estimation errors.

## Limitations

- Assumes access to the true kernel and parameters of the exponential family, limiting practical applicability
- Computational complexity of Trac-GKB-UCB remains polynomial in problem dimension and could be prohibitive for large-scale applications

- Theoretical results assume idealized conditions that may not hold in real-world scenarios

## Confidence

Theoretical claims: High
- Novel concentration inequality proof appears mathematically sound
- Regret bound derivation follows logically from the theoretical framework

Practical implications: Medium
- Absence of empirical validation makes real-world performance uncertain
- Computational complexity concerns may limit scalability
