# Not All Data are Good Labels: On the Self-supervised Labeling for Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.14704
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14704
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Self-supervised re-labeling with pseudo labels from intermediate reconstructions improves time series forecasting across multiple backbone models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitations of using raw labels in time series forecasting by introducing a self-supervised approach that generates pseudo labels from intermediate model reconstructions. The method, called Self-Correction with Adaptive Mask (SCAM), selectively replaces overfitted components in raw labels with these pseudo labels, improving model generalization. Spectral Norm Regularization (SNR) is also employed to further suppress overfitting. Experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements across various backbone models, including MLP and Transformer architectures.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a self-supervised labeling framework for time series forecasting that leverages intermediate reconstructions to generate pseudo labels. The core innovation is the Self-Correction with Adaptive Mask (SCAM) mechanism, which adaptively identifies and replaces overfitted components in the original labels with these pseudo labels. This approach treats raw labels as imperfect and uses the model's own reconstructions as a form of self-correction. Spectral Norm Regularization is integrated to provide additional control over overfitting. The framework operates through an iterative process where the model learns from both original and pseudo labels, with the adaptive masking determining which components to trust at each step.

## Key Results
- Consistent forecasting accuracy improvements across eleven diverse real-world datasets
- Performance gains observed across multiple backbone architectures including MLP and Transformer models
- Self-supervised re-labeling demonstrates effectiveness as both a model enhancement technique and a new perspective on dataset construction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by recognizing that raw labels in time series forecasting may contain noise or overfitting artifacts that hinder model generalization. By generating pseudo labels from intermediate reconstructions, the model can self-correct and learn more robust representations. The adaptive masking mechanism (SCAM) intelligently determines which components of the original labels are unreliable and should be replaced, allowing the model to gradually shift from supervised learning to a more self-supervised regime. The Spectral Norm Regularization provides additional control by constraining the model's capacity to overfit to potentially noisy labels.

## Foundational Learning
- Self-supervised learning in time series: Why needed - to leverage abundant unlabeled data and improve generalization without requiring additional labeled data. Quick check - verify that pseudo labels are meaningfully different from raw labels and contribute to performance gains.
- Adaptive masking strategies: Why needed - to selectively replace only the components of labels that are likely to be unreliable or overfitted. Quick check - analyze the masking criteria and ensure it's not too aggressive or too conservative.
- Spectral Norm Regularization: Why needed - to provide additional control over model capacity and prevent overfitting to noisy labels. Quick check - compare performance with and without SNR to quantify its contribution.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data -> Backbone Model -> Reconstruction Module -> SCAM Module -> Masked Labels -> Loss Function -> Updated Model

**Critical Path:**
Raw time series data flows through the backbone model, generates intermediate reconstructions, which are processed by SCAM to create masked labels, then these masked labels are used in the loss function to update the model parameters.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The main tradeoff is between trusting original labels versus pseudo labels. Too much reliance on pseudo labels might lead to model collapse or drift, while too little might not provide sufficient correction. The adaptive masking mechanism attempts to balance this by selectively replacing components based on their reliability.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Model performance degrades if pseudo labels are of poor quality or the masking becomes too aggressive
- Training instability if the reconstruction module is not well-calibrated with the backbone model
- Limited improvement if the original labels are already of high quality

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Test the approach on a simple dataset with known label noise to verify that SCAM correctly identifies and replaces noisy components
2. Compare performance with varying levels of label corruption to establish the method's effectiveness across different noise scenarios
3. Analyze the evolution of masking patterns during training to understand how the model's confidence in its own predictions changes over time

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Theoretical justification for why the approach works particularly well for time series forecasting compared to other domains remains underdeveloped
- Limited ablation studies on reconstruction architecture variations and simpler pseudo-label generation methods
- Computational overhead and scalability concerns with the self-supervised training loop are not addressed

## Confidence
- High confidence: Experimental results showing consistent improvements across multiple datasets and backbone architectures
- Medium confidence: Claim that this represents a fundamentally new perspective on dataset construction for time series forecasting
- Low confidence: Assertion that the approach is broadly applicable without modification across all time series domains

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments varying the reconstruction network architecture and pseudo-label generation frequency to determine sensitivity to design choices and establish optimal configurations for different dataset characteristics
2. Perform ablation studies on the spectral norm regularization component to quantify its individual contribution and test alternative regularization methods
3. Test the approach on high-frequency time series data (sub-minute intervals) and very long time series (thousands of timesteps) to evaluate scalability and identify potential limitations in real-world deployment scenarios
