# SortingEnv: An Extendable RL-Environment for an Industrial Sorting Process

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.10466
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10466
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: RL agents outperform rule-based agents in industrial sorting simulation, especially under seasonal input patterns and noise.

## Executive Summary
SortingEnv is a novel reinforcement learning environment simulating industrial sorting processes, featuring two variants: a basic version with discrete belt speed adjustments and an advanced version with multiple sorting modes and enhanced observations. The environment models material flow dynamics and operational parameters like belt speed and occupancy, following the digital twin concept. It allows testing RL algorithms like PPO, DQN, and A2C against a rule-based baseline in evolving setups.

## Method Summary
The environment simulates a material sorting process with two variants - basic (10 discrete belt speeds: 10-100%) and advanced (30 actions: 10 speeds × 3 sorting modes). Material flows through Input → Belt → Sorting Machine → Storage compartments. Two material types (A, B) arrive via random or seasonal input patterns with optional noise. The reward function combines accuracy and speed metrics, with agents trained using PPO, DQN, and A2C from Stable-Baselines3 for 100,000 timesteps. A rule-based agent serves as baseline. Experiments tested performance under varying conditions including seasonal patterns and noise levels.

## Key Results
- RL agents outperformed rule-based agents across all tested conditions
- Advanced environment achieved higher cumulative rewards than basic environment
- Seasonal input patterns with noise showed the largest performance gap between RL and rule-based approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The environment captures essential industrial sorting dynamics through discrete belt speed control and material flow management. The reward structure incentivizes both sorting accuracy and throughput efficiency, while the seasonal input patterns and noise create realistic challenges that test agent adaptability. The digital twin approach enables safe experimentation with various operational scenarios before real-world deployment.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gymnasium environment interface**: Needed for standard RL framework integration; quick check: verify environment reset() and step() methods work correctly
- **Material flow dynamics**: Essential for understanding belt occupancy and sorting constraints; quick check: confirm material transfer follows specified rules
- **Reward shaping**: Critical for balancing accuracy vs speed objectives; quick check: validate reward calculation matches specification
- **Seasonal pattern generation**: Important for testing agent adaptability; quick check: ensure 9 patterns across 3 phases are correctly implemented
- **Noise injection**: Key for robustness testing; quick check: verify uniform random perturbation affects observations as specified

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input -> Belt -> Sorting Machine -> Storage compartments

Critical path: Material generation → Belt occupancy management → Sorting action selection → Reward calculation → Storage update

Design tradeoffs: Discrete belt speeds vs continuous control (simplifies action space but limits precision); Basic vs advanced variants (tradeoff between simplicity and realism); Random vs seasonal inputs (benchmarking vs real-world simulation)

Failure signatures: A2C collapsing to static speed selection; poor performance under seasonal input with high penalty; inability to maintain target purity levels under noise

First experiments: 1) Test basic environment with random input, no noise; 2) Compare PPO performance with rule-based agent; 3) Evaluate agent behavior under seasonal input patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exact occupancy limit values (O_limit) per belt speed not specified
- Reward factor weights (r_acc, r_speed) not defined
- Network architectures for RL algorithms unspecified
- Seasonal pattern length selection range unclear

## Confidence

High confidence: Environment structure, action spaces, and basic reward formula are clearly specified and reproducible.

Medium confidence: Training procedures and hyperparameters are mostly specified, though some parameter interactions may require tuning.

Low confidence: Exact occupancy limit values, reward weights, and seasonal pattern implementations cannot be precisely replicated without additional information.

## Next Checks
1. Verify occupancy limit values by implementing Equation 3 and checking belt capacity constraints across all speed settings
2. Test multiple reward weight combinations to assess sensitivity of agent performance to r_acc and r_speed values
3. Implement and validate seasonal pattern generation with the specified 9 patterns across 3 phases, ensuring proper distribution matching
