# Are vision language models robust to uncertain inputs?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.11804
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11804
- Authors: Xi Wang; Eric Nalisnick
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: VLMs improve uncertainty handling but still hallucinate on ambiguous inputs; prompting for abstention and caption diversity mechanisms offer reliability gains.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the robustness of vision language models (VLMs) to uncertain inputs, focusing on anomaly detection and ambiguous classification tasks. While newer, larger VLMs show improved performance compared to earlier models, they still tend to produce overconfident responses even when faced with unclear inputs. The authors demonstrate that prompting VLMs to abstain from uncertain predictions can significantly enhance reliability, particularly for natural images. However, VLMs struggle with domain-specific tasks due to insufficient specialized knowledge. A novel caption diversity mechanism is proposed to reveal internal model uncertainty, enabling reliable abstention predictions without labeled data.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate VLMs on two classic uncertainty quantification tasks: anomaly detection (identifying inputs outside predefined categories) and classification under inherently ambiguous conditions. They test various VLM architectures across different dataset types, including natural images (ImageNet) and domain-specific tasks (galaxy morphology classification). The study examines the impact of model size and architecture on robustness, comparing newer and larger VLMs against earlier models. A key experimental component involves prompting VLMs to abstain from uncertain predictions and measuring the resulting reliability gains. Additionally, the authors develop a caption diversity mechanism to assess internal model uncertainty based on the diversity of generated captions, allowing prediction of successful abstention without requiring labeled data.

## Key Results
- Newer and larger VLMs show improved robustness compared to earlier models but still hallucinate confident responses on uncertain inputs
- Prompting VLMs to abstain from uncertain predictions achieves near-perfect robustness for natural images like ImageNet
- VLMs fail to reliably estimate uncertainty in domain-specific tasks like galaxy morphology classification due to insufficient specialized knowledge
- A novel caption diversity mechanism can reveal internal model uncertainty and predict successful abstention without labeled data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's findings demonstrate that VLMs can be made more reliable through strategic prompting and uncertainty quantification mechanisms. The effectiveness of abstention prompts works by explicitly asking models to recognize and decline to answer when uncertain, leveraging the model's ability to self-assess confidence when properly guided. The caption diversity mechanism reveals uncertainty by measuring the variability in generated descriptions - higher diversity indicates greater uncertainty about the input. These approaches work because VLMs have inherent capabilities for reasoning about their own confidence, but require appropriate prompting and interpretation frameworks to activate these capabilities reliably.

### Prompt Engineering
- **Why needed**: Key technique for improving model reliability
- **Quick check**: Abstention prompts enable models to decline uncertain predictions

### Caption Diversity Metrics
- **Why needed**: Novel mechanism for measuring internal uncertainty
- **Quick check**: Diversity of generated captions correlates with model uncertainty

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Image -> VLM Backbone -> Language Generation -> Confidence Assessment -> Abstention Decision -> Output

### Critical Path
Image → Feature Extraction → Caption Generation → Diversity Analysis → Uncertainty Quantification → Output Decision

### Design Tradeoffs
- Model size vs. computational efficiency
- Abstention rate vs. coverage
- Domain generality vs. specialized performance
- Caption diversity vs. generation quality

### Failure Signatures
- Overconfident predictions on anomalous inputs
- Inability to abstain on domain-specific tasks
- Low caption diversity failing to indicate high uncertainty
- Prompt insensitivity to model confidence levels

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test abstention prompting on ImageNet with various VLM architectures
2. Evaluate caption diversity correlation with known uncertainty cases
3. Compare domain-specific vs. general VLM performance on specialized tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings may not generalize beyond tested tasks and datasets
- Domain-specific knowledge requirements limit VLM applicability
- Caption diversity mechanism reliability needs broader validation
- Prompt effectiveness may vary across different VLM architectures

## Confidence

**Confidence labels for major claim clusters:**
- General robustness improvements in newer VLMs: **Medium**
- Prompting for abstention effectiveness: **High**
- Caption diversity mechanism reliability: **Low-Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Test the prompting strategy and caption diversity mechanism across diverse VLM architectures beyond those specifically evaluated, including newer models released after this study
2. Evaluate the proposed methods on domain-specific tasks requiring specialized knowledge (e.g., medical imaging, technical drawings) to assess generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of prompt specificity and caption diversity metrics on uncertainty estimation reliability
