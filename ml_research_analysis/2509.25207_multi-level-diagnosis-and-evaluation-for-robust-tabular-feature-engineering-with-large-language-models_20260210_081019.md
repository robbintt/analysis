# Multi-level Diagnosis and Evaluation for Robust Tabular Feature Engineering with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25207
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Introduces a multi-level framework to evaluate LLM robustness in tabular feature engineering, finding domain-dependent performance variations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of assessing the robustness of large language models (LLMs) when generating features for tabular data. The authors propose a systematic, multi-level evaluation framework that examines LLMs' ability to identify key variables, understand relationships between variables and target classes, and set appropriate decision boundary values. Through experiments with six LLMs across eight datasets, the study demonstrates that LLM-generated features can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%, though robustness varies significantly across different domains. The framework provides practitioners with tools to diagnose and evaluate the quality of LLM-generated features before deployment.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a multi-level diagnosis and evaluation framework that systematically assesses LLM performance in tabular feature engineering through three core components: variable identification (detecting which features are most relevant), relationship understanding (comprehending how variables relate to target classes), and decision boundary setting (determining appropriate thresholds for classification). The framework was validated using six different LLMs on eight diverse tabular datasets, with evaluation metrics focusing on both the quality of generated features and their impact on downstream prediction tasks. The experiments specifically measured few-shot learning performance to assess practical utility in data-scarce scenarios.

## Key Results
- LLM robustness in feature engineering varies significantly across different tabular domains
- High-quality features generated by LLMs can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%
- The multi-level evaluation framework successfully identifies weaknesses in LLM-generated features across all three diagnostic levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing a structured approach to decompose the complex task of feature engineering into three assessable components. By isolating variable identification, relationship understanding, and decision boundary setting, the method can pinpoint exactly where LLMs struggle in different domains. This granular evaluation enables targeted improvements and provides confidence metrics for deployed features, addressing the black-box nature of LLM feature generation.

## Foundational Learning

Variable Importance in Tabular Data: Why needed - Understanding which features drive predictions is fundamental to interpretable machine learning; Quick check - Evaluate correlation coefficients and feature importance scores from baseline models.

Domain Adaptation in LLMs: Why needed - Tabular data from different domains (healthcare vs. finance) requires different feature engineering approaches; Quick check - Compare feature generation quality across domain-specific datasets.

Decision Boundary Calibration: Why needed - Properly calibrated decision boundaries are essential for reliable classification performance; Quick check - Measure precision-recall trade-offs at different threshold values.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Tabular Data -> Variable Identification -> Relationship Understanding -> Decision Boundary Setting -> Feature Quality Assessment -> Downstream Model Performance

Critical path: The framework's critical path flows from raw tabular data through each diagnostic level to final performance evaluation, with bottlenecks typically occurring at relationship understanding for complex domains.

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes interpretability and diagnostic granularity over computational efficiency, potentially limiting scalability to very large datasets or requiring optimization for production deployment.

Failure signatures: Common failure modes include over-reliance on obvious features during variable identification, incorrect relationship assumptions between variables and classes, and poorly calibrated decision boundaries leading to suboptimal classification thresholds.

First experiments: 1) Run baseline feature importance analysis on clean data, 2) Test LLM variable identification on a simple dataset, 3) Evaluate relationship understanding on a dataset with clear class-variable correlations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Limited generalizability due to testing on only eight datasets across six LLMs
- Does not address potential biases in LLM-generated features that could affect downstream predictions
- Computational overhead of the multi-level evaluation framework may impact practical adoption in resource-constrained environments

## Confidence

The findings have Medium confidence. While the framework provides a novel and structured approach to evaluating LLM feature engineering, the limited scope of tested models and datasets, combined with unaddressed concerns about bias and computational efficiency, prevents stronger claims about universal applicability.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate experiments across a broader range of tabular datasets, particularly including domain-specific data (healthcare, finance, etc.) to assess generalizability of robustness findings.
2. Test additional LLM architectures and sizes beyond the current six models to determine if results hold for both smaller and larger models.
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the relative contributions of each evaluation level (variable identification, relationship understanding, decision boundaries) to overall feature quality and downstream performance.
