# Continuous Monitoring of Large-Scale Generative AI via Deterministic Knowledge Graph Structures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.03857
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03857
- Reference count: 17
- This paper proposes a real-time evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Knowledge Graphs (KGs), contrasting deterministic, rule-based KGs with LLM-generated KGs derived from live news streams, leveraging metrics like ICR, IPR, and CI to quantify structural fidelity.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a real-time evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Knowledge Graphs (KGs). It contrasts a deterministic, rule-based KG with an LLM-generated KG derived from live news streams, leveraging metrics like Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI) to quantify structural fidelity. A Hallucination Score based on entity tracing and rule conformance further supports semantic validation. The method dynamically detects anomalies through weighted scores and time-series analysis. Experiments across nine LLMs show varying structural alignment and hallucination rates, with some models like gemini-1.5 and vicuna demonstrating more consistent behavior. This approach enables scalable, interpretable, and vendor-agnostic monitoring, particularly useful for deployment, procurement, and compliance in dynamic environments.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a three-phase approach: (1) construct parallel KGs via deterministic rules vs. LLM API calls on news batches, (2) compute structural metrics (ICR, IPR, CI) and validate entities via SPARQL queries, (3) continuous time-series monitoring with anomaly detection triggering alerts when A(G_t) > α_t. The method dynamically detects anomalies through weighted scores and time-series analysis. The framework uses Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI) metrics to quantify structural fidelity, alongside a Hallucination Score for semantic validation.

## Key Results
- Nine LLMs tested across three temporal snapshots show varying structural alignment and hallucination rates.
- Gemini-1.5 and Vicuna demonstrated more consistent behavior compared to other models.
- The approach enables scalable, interpretable, and vendor-agnostic monitoring for deployment, procurement, and compliance in dynamic environments.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by constructing two parallel knowledge graphs: one deterministic (rule-based) and one LLM-generated from live news streams. By comparing these graphs using structural metrics like ICR, IPR, and CI, it quantifies the fidelity of LLM outputs. The Hallucination Score, based on entity tracing and rule conformance, validates semantic accuracy. Anomaly detection through time-series analysis and dynamic thresholds enables real-time monitoring of LLM reliability, making it scalable and interpretable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Building KGs from text using both deterministic rules and LLM extraction is essential for comparing structural fidelity. *Why needed*: Provides the basis for measuring LLM reliability. *Quick check*: Verify that both KGs contain the same entities and relations for a given input.
- **Structural Metrics (ICR, IPR, CI)**: These metrics quantify the completeness and consistency of KG structures. *Why needed*: Enables objective comparison between deterministic and LLM-generated KGs. *Quick check*: Ensure metrics are computed consistently across both KG types.
- **Hallucination Detection**: Entity tracing and rule conformance validate semantic accuracy. *Why needed*: Identifies fabricated or incorrect information in LLM outputs. *Quick check*: Confirm that SPARQL queries correctly identify hallucinated entities.
- **Time-Series Anomaly Detection**: Dynamic thresholds and weighted scores detect deviations over time. *Why needed*: Enables real-time monitoring of LLM reliability. *Quick check*: Validate that anomalies are detected when A(G_t) exceeds α_t.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: News articles -> Deterministic KG construction -> LLM KG construction -> Metric computation (ICR, IPR, CI) -> Hallucination Score -> Anomaly detection -> Alerts
- **Critical Path**: News ingestion -> KG construction (deterministic and LLM) -> Metric computation -> Anomaly detection -> Alert generation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Rule-based KG vs. LLM-generated KG balances precision and recall; dynamic thresholds vs. static thresholds affects sensitivity to anomalies.
- **Failure Signatures**: Incomplete deterministic KG due to dictionary gaps or pattern overfitting; low IPR or high Hallucination Score in LLM-generated KG due to prompt misalignment or API temperature settings.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Define a fixed domain ontology and run both deterministic and LLM-based KG pipelines on a curated news corpus; verify ICR, IPR, CI metrics are computed consistently.
  2. Define entity validation rules and SPARQL queries for the Hallucination Score; compare hallucination rates across LLMs on identical inputs to check detection reliability.
  3. Implement anomaly detection with varying λ values and window sizes; assess stability and sensitivity of A(G_t) thresholds and alert rates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework depends critically on an externally defined ontology schema, which is not provided in the paper, making metric computation non-standardized.
- The Hallucination Score calculation relies on unspecified entity validation rules and SPARQL queries, introducing potential inconsistencies in hallucination detection.
- The choice of metric weights w_M and the sensitivity parameter λ for anomaly detection are left open, allowing results to shift significantly based on tuning.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The overall method architecture (parallel KG construction, metric computation, time-series anomaly detection) is clearly specified and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: Comparative rankings of LLMs are internally consistent within the study but may not generalize without a standardized ontology and evaluation protocol.
- **Low confidence**: Absolute metric values and threshold choices are not reproducible without further specification of schema, rules, and weights.

## Next Checks
1. **Schema Definition and Test Corpus**: Construct a fixed domain ontology (e.g., news events, entities, relations) and run both deterministic and LLM-based KG pipelines on the same curated news corpus; verify ICR, IPR, CI metrics are computed consistently.
2. **Hallucination Detection Validation**: Define entity validation rules and SPARQL queries for the Hallucination Score; compare hallucination rates across LLMs on identical inputs to check detection reliability.
3. **Dynamic Anomaly Threshold Tuning**: Implement the anomaly detection with varying λ values and window sizes; assess stability and sensitivity of A(G_t) thresholds and alert rates.
