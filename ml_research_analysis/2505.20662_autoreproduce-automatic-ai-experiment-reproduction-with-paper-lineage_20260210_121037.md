# AutoReproduce: Automatic AI Experiment Reproduction with Paper Lineage

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20662
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20662
- Authors: Xuanle Zhao; Zilin Sang; Yuxuan Li; Qi Shi; Weilun Zhao; Shuo Wang; Duzhen Zhang; Xu Han; Zhiyuan Liu; Maosong Sun
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Achieves 22.1% average performance gap on 89.74% of executable runs compared to official implementations

## Executive Summary
AutoReproduce is an LLM-based multi-agent framework designed to automatically reproduce AI experiments from research papers. The system introduces a paper lineage algorithm that extracts implicit domain knowledge from cited references to enhance reproduction accuracy. By combining literature review, paper lineage extraction, and code development in a three-stage pipeline with unit testing, AutoReproduce generates executable code that closely matches original implementations. The framework is evaluated on ReproduceBench, a curated benchmark of 13 diverse papers with verified implementations.

## Method Summary
AutoReproduce employs a three-stage pipeline for automatic AI experiment reproduction. First, it conducts comprehensive literature review to understand the paper's context and methodology. Second, it applies a paper lineage algorithm that extracts implicit knowledge from cited references, treating citations as a knowledge graph to uncover relevant implementation details. Third, it generates code through a code development agent, validated through unit testing to ensure executability. The framework leverages large language models as reasoning engines while using multi-agent collaboration to handle different aspects of the reproduction process systematically.

## Key Results
- Achieves 22.1% average performance gap on 89.74% of executable runs compared to official implementations
- Outperforms existing baselines on all five evaluation metrics in ReproduceBench benchmark
- Successfully generates executable code for 11 out of 13 papers in the evaluation set

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AutoReproduce works by systematically addressing the information gaps in research papers through its paper lineage approach. While papers often omit implementation details, the citations within them contain implicit knowledge about methodology, parameter choices, and implementation tricks. The framework treats the citation network as a knowledge graph, extracting relevant information from referenced papers to fill these gaps. The multi-agent architecture allows specialized agents to handle different aspects of reproduction - one for understanding literature, another for extracting lineage knowledge, and a third for code generation. This division of labor, combined with unit testing validation, ensures both accuracy and executability of the reproduced experiments.

## Foundational Learning

**LLM-based multi-agent systems**: Needed for decomposing complex reproduction tasks into specialized subtasks. Quick check: Verify agent communication protocols and task allocation logic.

**Paper lineage extraction**: Required to systematically extract implicit knowledge from citation networks. Quick check: Validate lineage relevance scoring and citation filtering mechanisms.

**Knowledge graph construction from citations**: Essential for representing relationships between papers and their methodological connections. Quick check: Confirm citation parsing accuracy and graph traversal algorithms.

**Unit testing for code validation**: Critical for ensuring generated code is not just syntactically correct but functionally executable. Quick check: Review test coverage and error handling in validation pipeline.

**Literature review automation**: Necessary for understanding paper context without manual intervention. Quick check: Assess comprehension accuracy of automated literature analysis.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Literature Review Agent -> Paper Lineage Extractor -> Code Development Agent -> Unit Test Validator -> Executable Output

**Critical path**: Input paper → Literature analysis → Citation network parsing → Lineage extraction → Code generation → Unit testing → Output

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes accuracy over speed by using comprehensive literature analysis and multiple validation stages. This increases reliability but extends reproduction time compared to direct code generation approaches.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Poor citation parsing leads to incomplete lineage knowledge
- Inadequate literature understanding results in wrong methodology implementation
- Unit test failures indicate code execution problems
- Incomplete reference analysis causes missing implementation details

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test on a simple paper with clear methodology and few citations
2. Run with paper lineage disabled to measure its contribution
3. Validate with papers from different AI subfields to test generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, focusing instead on presenting its framework and evaluation results.

## Limitations

- ReproduceBench benchmark contains only 13 papers, limiting generalizability assessment
- Paper lineage approach assumes citations contain relevant implementation knowledge, which may not hold for all papers
- Evaluation focuses on executability and performance but lacks assessment of generated code quality and maintainability

## Confidence

- High confidence: Technical framework design and three-stage pipeline implementation appear sound and well-documented
- Medium confidence: Performance improvements over baselines are demonstrated but limited by small benchmark size
- Medium confidence: Paper lineage methodology shows promise but needs validation across more diverse paper types

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Expansion**: Test AutoReproduce on a larger and more diverse set of papers (50+ papers) spanning different AI subfields to assess generalizability
2. **Lineage Algorithm Validation**: Conduct ablation studies to quantify the actual contribution of paper lineage versus baseline reproduction methods
3. **Code Quality Assessment**: Evaluate the generated code beyond executability, including readability, adherence to coding standards, and maintainability metrics
