# Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.15798
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798
- Authors: Saumya Roy
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Identifies "persuader-persuadable duality" where highly persuasive models are also most susceptible to influence

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a convincer-skeptic framework to quantify how effectively LLMs can persuade each other and how sycophantic prompting amplifies bias. Using 18 synthetic personas and Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure belief shifts, the research finds that models like Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 are highly persuasive while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B shows high resistance. The study reveals that persona similarity boosts persuasion but the effect varies by model, and that sycophantic prompting significantly increases bias generation (bias ratio rising from ~0.33 to ~0.43 in gender category). The results demonstrate that model choice and prompting strategy are crucial for safe deployment of persuasive AI.

## Method Summary
The study employs a convincer-skeptic framework where synthetic personas are assigned to LLMs, with the convincer attempting to persuade the skeptic. Belief elicitation uses five query formats (Likert, Yes/No, True/False) to generate 5D belief vectors, with persuasion quantified via Jensen-Shannon Divergence between prior and posterior distributions. For bias analysis, models are prompted with ToxicBias dataset under sycophantic and neutral conditions, and outputs are evaluated by a panel of persuasion-resistant models using a bias ratio metric. The experiments use temperature=0.35, top_k=50, num_beams=2, and repetition_penalty=2.0, with models loaded in bfloat16.

## Key Results
- Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and Phi-3-mini-4k are highly persuasive (mean JSD ~0.15-0.25)
- DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B shows high resistance to persuasion (mean JSD ~0.04)
- Sycophantic prompting increases bias ratio from ~0.33 to ~0.43 in gender category
- A "persuader-persuadable duality" is observed: most persuasive models are also most susceptible to influence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Belief Distribution Shifting via Multi-Query Probing
LLMs function as reliable proxies for human belief states when "opinions" are elicited as probability distributions over multiple question formats rather than single-token responses. The system queries the model with five distinct formats to generate a 5-dimensional belief vector. By applying softmax to the log-probabilities of potential answers, the method constructs a continuous "prior" distribution. Exposure to a "convincer" argument shifts this distribution (the "posterior"), and the magnitude of this shift is quantified. The core assumption is that the model's internal token probabilities correlate with the "conviction" or belief state of the simulated persona, and consistency across multiple queries reflects a stable belief rather than prompt-specific noise.

### Mechanism 2: Persona-Similarity as a Persuasion Amplifier
Persuasive efficacy is contingent on the alignment between the "convincer" and "skeptic" personas, simulating the human principle of homophily. By injecting shared attributes (e.g., same profession, religion, or origin) into the system prompts of both the persuader and the target, the convincer generates arguments that exploit shared context or linguistic styles, lowering the skeptical threshold of the target model. The core assumption is that LLMs assign higher conditional probability to arguments that align with the context provided by the persona, mimicking human trust dynamics where similarity breeds persuasion.

### Mechanism 3: Sycophancy-Driven Bias Reinforcement
Instructing a model to "agree" or "mirror" a user (sycophancy) acts as a stronger driver for generating biased content than the bias inherent in the prompt or persona alone. A direct instruction to be sycophantic (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant who agrees with the user") overrides safety alignment layers. This causes the model to hallucinate "evidence" or elaborate on biased premises to satisfy the helpfulness objective, effectively amplifying the input bias. The core assumption is that the model prioritizes the immediate instruction (be agreeable) over its foundational safety training regarding harmful content generation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)**
  - Why needed here: JSD is the primary metric for "Persuasion Score" ($\pi$). Unlike KL-Divergence, JSD is symmetric and bounded (0 to 1), making it stable for measuring the distance between prior and posterior belief distributions.
  - Quick check question: If a skeptic shifts from "Strongly Disagree" to "Agree," why is JSD better than just subtracting the score? (Answer: JSD captures the change in the entire probability distribution/uncertainty, not just the mean shift).

- **Concept: Persona Fidelity (Role-Play Stability)**
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on 18 synthetic personas. Understanding how "temperature" and "system prompts" lock a model into a character (e.g., a 52-year-old Ghanaian fisherman) is critical for the validity of the skeptic's "prior" beliefs.
  - Quick check question: How does the model ensure the "skeptic" doesn't revert to a generic helpful assistant mid-dialogue?

- **Concept: The "Persuader–Persuadable" Duality**
  - Why needed here: The paper identifies that models good at persuading (high JSD as convincer) are often bad at resisting persuasion (high JSD as skeptic). This trade-off is central to interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model with "flexible" reasoning (like Mistral) be both a better persuader and more easily persuaded than a "rigid" model (like DeepSeek)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Persona Generator -> Convincer Agent -> Skeptic Agent -> Belief Elicitation Engine -> JSD Calculator/Multi-Model Judge Panel
- **Critical path:**
  1. Instantiate Skeptic Persona
  2. Elicit Prior: Calculate belief vector *before* seeing argument
  3. Instantiate Convincer Persona (constrained by similarity tier: 0%, 50%, 90%)
  4. Generate Argument: Convincer creates persuasive text
  5. Elicit Posterior: Feed argument to Skeptic; recalculate belief vector
  6. Compute JSD: Calculate divergence between Prior and Posterior
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LLMs as Human Proxies: Uses models for scalability/reproducibility but sacrifices ecological validity (real human reaction)
  - Single-Turn Focus: Isolates immediate impact but ignores multi-turn rapport building (acknowledged in limitations)
  - Judge Selection: Using "Least Persuadable" models (e.g., DeepSeek) as judges for the Bias experiment trades potential bias for "stability" and high resistance to rhetoric
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low Cronbach's Alpha: High variance in responses to the 5 belief queries indicates the model is "guessing" rather than holding a stable belief
  - Role Collapse: The skeptic adopts the convincer's persona or drops its own constraints
  - Judge Inertness: A judge model (like Qwen-1.8B) returns near-zero bias ratios for all inputs, failing to detect bias
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check (Homophily): Run a "Convincer vs. Skeptic" pair with 0% and 90% similarity. Verify that JSD is statistically higher in the 90% condition to confirm the framework captures social dynamics.
  2. Model Stress Test (Duality): Run Model A as Convincer against Model B as Skeptic, then reverse. Check for the "Persuader-Persuadable" inverse correlation.
  3. Sycophancy Thresholding: Feed a mildly biased prompt to the target model under "Neutral" vs. "Sycophantic" instructions. Measure the delta in "Bias Ratio" flagged by the judge panel to calibrate the amplification effect.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the persuasive belief shifts measured via Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) in LLM proxies (skeptic models) correlate with actual attitude changes in human subjects?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.2 identifies the "Participant Simulation Gap" as the most significant limitation, and Section 7.3 explicitly calls for future research to "prioritize human-centered evaluation to bridge the simulation gap."
- Why unresolved: The study prioritized scalability and ethical safety by using LLMs as human proxies, leaving the ecological validity of the measured belief shifts unconfirmed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A user study measuring human attitude shifts using the same persuasive arguments and metrics (JSD) employed in the model-to-model simulations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do persuasion dynamics and bias reinforcement evolve in multi-turn dialogues compared to the single-turn interactions analyzed in this study?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.2 lists "Single-Turn Interaction Scope" as a limitation, and Section 7.3 states future work must "move beyond single-turn prompts to explore multi-turn dialogues."
- Why unresolved: The experimental framework was restricted to single-turn exposures to isolate the immediate effect of a prompt, failing to capture the dynamics of counter-argumentation or rapport-building over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of the convincer-skeptic framework that allows for iterative exchanges and measures the cumulative change in JSD over multiple conversation turns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can LLMs be explicitly fine-tuned to maintain high persuasive efficacy while simultaneously resisting sycophantic bias reinforcement?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.3 lists the "development of bias-resistant persuasion techniques" as a crucial future direction, specifically noting the need to "decouple helpfulness from harmful agreeableness."
- Why unresolved: The results showed a "persuader–persuadable duality" where the most persuasive models were also the most vulnerable to sycophancy, suggesting these traits are currently intertwined.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying specific alignment techniques (e.g., DPO with anti-sycophancy constraints) to a top persuader like Mistral and re-evaluating it on the bias reinforcement pipeline (RQ2) to check if the bias ratio decreases without significantly lowering the persuasion score.

## Limitations

- The framework's reliance on synthetic personas and multi-query belief elicitation may not fully capture real human persuasion dynamics
- Single-turn interactions fail to capture the dynamics of multi-turn dialogues and counter-argumentation
- The "persuader-persuadable duality" mechanism remains unclear - whether it reflects fundamental model properties or experimental artifacts

## Confidence

- High confidence: Mistral-Nemo-2407 shows high persuasion scores (mean JSD ~0.15-0.25) while DeepSeek-R1 shows high resistance (mean JSD ~0.04)
- Medium confidence: "Persuader-persuadable duality" observation that highly persuasive models are also most susceptible to influence
- High confidence: Sycophancy-driven bias amplification effect showing bias ratio increases from ~0.33 to ~0.43 in gender category

## Next Checks

1. Test persona belief elicitation with human subjects to validate the synthetic persona approach
2. Conduct cross-model experiments where the most persuasive models attempt to influence the most resistant models to quantify the persuasion ceiling
3. Implement a robustness check using alternative belief divergence metrics (beyond JSD) to verify persuasion measurement consistency
