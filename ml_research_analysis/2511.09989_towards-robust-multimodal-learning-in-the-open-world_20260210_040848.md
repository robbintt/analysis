# Towards Robust Multimodal Learning in the Open World

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09989
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09989
- Authors: Fushuo Huo
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: This thesis introduces three methods to enhance robustness in multimodal learning for open-world environments, addressing compositional generalization, modality-missing scenarios, and hallucination mitigation.

## Executive Summary
This thesis tackles fundamental robustness challenges in multimodal learning systems operating in open-world environments. It presents three distinct approaches: ProCC for compositional generalization, C2KD for modality-missing robustness, and SID for hallucination mitigation in vision-language models. The work systematically addresses the limitations of current multimodal systems in handling novel compositions, missing modalities, and modality-prior biases that commonly occur in real-world applications.

The contributions collectively advance the field toward more reliable multimodal AI systems capable of maintaining performance when faced with distribution shifts, incomplete sensory data, and generation errors. Through curriculum learning, knowledge distillation, and token selection mechanisms, the proposed methods demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks while highlighting important directions for future research in multimodal system robustness.

## Method Summary
The thesis introduces three novel methods to address different aspects of multimodal robustness. ProCC enhances compositional generalization by modeling cross-primitive interactions through a curriculum learning approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MIT-States and C-GQA benchmarks. C2KD addresses modality-missing scenarios through On-the-Fly Selection Distillation (OFSD) and proxy-guided bidirectional knowledge transfer, improving cross-modal knowledge transfer across audio-visual, image-text, and RGB-depth tasks. SID mitigates hallucinations in large vision-language models using Context and Text-aware Token Selection (CT2S), reducing hallucinations by 12-20% while maintaining generative quality.

## Key Results
- ProCC achieves state-of-the-art performance on compositional generalization benchmarks MIT-States and C-GQA
- C2KD improves cross-modal knowledge transfer across audio-visual, image-text, and RGB-depth tasks
- SID reduces hallucinations in LVLMs by 12-20% while maintaining generative quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The thesis addresses three fundamental robustness challenges in multimodal learning through targeted mechanisms. ProCC works by explicitly modeling cross-primitive interactions during compositional tasks, allowing the system to generalize better to novel combinations of concepts through curriculum-based training. C2KD leverages knowledge distillation with proxy representations to maintain performance when one modality is missing, using bidirectional transfer to capture comprehensive cross-modal relationships. SID employs context and text-aware token selection to filter out hallucinatory content while preserving the model's generative capabilities, addressing the inherent bias toward textual generation in vision-language models.

## Foundational Learning
- Compositional generalization: Why needed - Systems must handle novel combinations of concepts not seen during training. Quick check - Evaluate performance on zero-shot compositional tasks.
- Cross-modal knowledge transfer: Why needed - Real-world scenarios often involve incomplete or missing sensory data. Quick check - Test robustness under varying levels of modality absence.
- Vision-language model hallucinations: Why needed - LVLMs frequently generate content not supported by visual input. Quick check - Compare hallucination rates across different context conditions.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: ProCC -> Curriculum Learning -> MIT-States/C-GQA; C2KD -> OFSD + Proxy Guidance -> Cross-Modal Transfer; SID -> CT2S -> LVLM Hallucination Reduction

Critical path: Input data → Modality-specific feature extraction → Robustness mechanism (ProCC/C2KD/SID) → Output generation with enhanced reliability

Design tradeoffs: ProCC trades computational complexity for better compositional generalization; C2KD balances knowledge transfer quality against proxy representation accuracy; SID optimizes between hallucination reduction and generative quality maintenance

Failure signatures: ProCC may struggle with highly complex compositional spaces; C2KD performance degrades with poor proxy representations; SID might over-filter valid content

First experiments: 1) Test ProCC on compositional generalization benchmarks, 2) Evaluate C2KD under various modality-missing scenarios, 3) Measure SID's hallucination reduction across different LVLM architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- ProCC's effectiveness on complex real-world compositional scenarios beyond benchmark datasets remains uncertain
- C2KD may fail when proxy-guided bidirectional knowledge transfer cannot adequately capture cross-modal relationships in highly heterogeneous feature distributions
- SID's hallucination reduction evaluation may not capture the full spectrum of hallucination types that can occur in diverse real-world scenarios

## Confidence
High: Individual contributions show measurable improvements on respective evaluation metrics within controlled benchmark settings
Medium: Methods will maintain performance advantages when scaled to more complex, real-world multimodal datasets
Low: Approaches will generalize effectively across all three robustness challenges simultaneously in truly open-world environments

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies on ProCC to quantify the contribution of individual cross-primitive interaction modeling components versus the full curriculum learning framework
2. Evaluate C2KD on datasets with extreme modality imbalance and complete modality absence to test robustness boundaries beyond current benchmarks
3. Perform human evaluation studies on SID's outputs across multiple domains to validate that hallucination reduction doesn't compromise the utility and coherence of generated content in practical applications
