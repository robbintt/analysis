# A reinforcement learning agent for maintenance of deteriorating systems with increasingly imperfect repairs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20725
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Reinforcement learning agent using DDQN architecture achieves approximately 41% cost reduction compared to fail replacement policies and 17% reduction compared to age and threshold-based maintenance policies for systems with increasingly imperfect repairs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for optimizing maintenance policies of deteriorating systems where repair effectiveness decreases with successive interventions. The agent uses a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) architecture to learn maintenance policies without requiring predefined preventive thresholds, operating in a continuous degradation state space. The study models deterioration using a gamma process and considers imperfect repairs whose effectiveness decreases with successive repairs. The proposed approach demonstrates flexibility across different scenarios and significantly improves long-run maintenance costs compared to conventional maintenance strategies.

## Method Summary
The methodology combines a gamma process-based degradation model with a DDQN reinforcement learning agent. Degradation follows a gamma process with shape parameter v(t)=0.0115t and scale β=4.63, accumulating between periodic inspections. Maintenance actions include do nothing, preventive repair, or replacement (preventive or corrective). Repairs are modeled as increasingly imperfect using a truncated normal distribution conditioned on the previous maintenance state. The DDQN agent learns optimal policies through 50,000 training episodes using epsilon-greedy exploration, ADAM optimization, and experience replay. The state space consists of current degradation and degradation after last maintenance, allowing the agent to operate in continuous space without discretization.

## Key Results
- Agent achieves approximately 41% cost reduction compared to fail replacement policies
- Agent demonstrates 17% cost reduction compared to conventional age and threshold-based maintenance policies
- Flexibility across scenarios: agent adapts to varying inspection frequencies (100-150 time units) and cost ratios (C_P/C_R from 0.17 to 0.43)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The gamma process provides a mathematically tractable model for monotonic, continuous degradation that preserves the Markov property when combined with periodic inspections.
- Mechanism: Degradation increments ΔX ~ Γ(v(t,Δt), β) accumulate over time, with shape parameter v(t,Δt) as a linear function for stationary processes. The state evolves continuously between discrete inspection times T_n, creating a hybrid discrete-time/continuous-state MDP.
- Core assumption: Degradation is strictly monotonic (irreversible) and follows a single-mechanism deterioration pattern.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "The study models deterioration using a gamma process"; [Section 4, p.9-10]: Equations 10-12 define the gamma process with pdf, cdf, and survival functions; states "gamma-process-based models were introduced in 1975 by Abdel-Hameed"; [corpus]: Weak direct evidence—neighboring papers on degradation (e.g., "Modeling Discrete Coating Degradation Events via Hawkes Processes") use different stochastic processes; no direct validation of gamma superiority.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Increasingly imperfect repairs—where each successive repair is less effective—can be modeled via a truncated normal distribution conditioned on the previous maintenance state.
- Mechanism: After repair action a1, the system deteriorates to state X^P_Tn = X^-_Tn - Z_n, where Z_n ~ TruncatedNormal(μ, σ, X^M, X^-_Tn). The bounds ensure post-repair state cannot fall below the previous minimum X^M, encoding cumulative damage memory.
- Core assumption: Repair effectiveness degrades predictably with cumulative intervention count, and the truncated normal adequately captures variability in repair outcomes.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "repairs are increasingly imperfect, i.e., the beneficial effect of system repairs decreases as more repairs are performed"; [Section 4, p.11-12]: Equation 13 defines the truncated normal; "the system deterioration after a repair action is bounded by the current deterioration state and the deterioration state after the previous maintenance intervention"; [corpus]: No direct corpus validation for this specific repair model; related work (Huynh, van Bérenger cited) uses different imperfect repair formulations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DDQN's decoupled action selection and evaluation reduces Q-value overestimation bias compared to standard DQN, enabling stable learning in continuous state spaces without discretization.
- Mechanism: The main network θ selects actions via argmax, while the target network θ' evaluates those actions. Bellman update (Eq. 9): Q(s,a;θ) = r + γQ(s', argmax_a' Q(s',a';θ); θ'). Experience replay breaks temporal correlations.
- Core assumption: The continuous degradation state can be adequately represented by neural network function approximation without explicit discretization.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "Double Deep Q-Network architecture...it works without a predefined preventive threshold, and it can operate in a continuous degradation state space"; [Section 3, p.9]: "The main difference between a DDQN and a DQN is that the process of action selection and action evaluation are separate"; [corpus]: Indirect support from "Digital Twin Framework for Generation-IV Reactors with Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Health-Aware Supervisory Control" (FMR=0.49), which applies RL to complex system control; no direct DDQN validation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
  - Why needed here: The RL framework relies on the Markov property—future states depend only on current state and action. Understanding the tuple (S, A, T, R) is essential to grasp why periodic inspections preserve Markovian structure despite continuous-time degradation.
  - Quick check question: Given state S_Tn = {X_Tn, X^M}, can you identify what information is "forgotten" versus retained for decision-making?

- Concept: **Q-Learning and Overestimation Bias**
  - Why needed here: The paper's choice of DDQN over DQN hinges on understanding why max-selection in standard Q-learning systematically overestimates values, and why decoupling selection from evaluation mitigates this.
  - Quick check question: Why would using the same network to both select and evaluate the "best" next action lead to optimistic bias?

- Concept: **Gamma Distribution and Stochastic Processes**
  - Why needed here: The degradation model assumes familiarity with shape/scale parameterization and why gamma processes are suited to monotonic deterioration (versus, e.g., Wiener processes which allow negative increments).
  - Quick check question: If degradation were non-monotonic (could self-recover), would the gamma process still be appropriate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Environment: Gamma degradation simulator with inspection intervals Δt, failure threshold L, and imperfect repair logic (truncated normal with memory)
  - State representation: 2-tuple {X_Tn (current degradation), X^M (post-last-maintenance degradation)}—continuous values, no discretization
  - Action space: Discrete 3-action set {a0: do nothing, a1: preventive repair, a2: replacement (preventive or corrective)}
  - Reward function: Negative costs (0, -C_P, -C_R, or -C_R-C_down depending on action and failure state)
  - DDQN networks: Main network (parameters θ) for action selection; target network (parameters θ') for value estimation; experience replay buffer (length 10,000)
  - Training loop: Epsilon-greedy exploration with decay 0.005, ADAM optimizer, batch size 64, discount factor 0.99

- Critical path:
  1. Implement gamma process sampler: ΔX ~ Γ(v(t,Δt), β) with linear shape function
  2. Implement imperfect repair sampler: truncated normal with bounds [X^M, X^-_Tn]
  3. Build DDQN: two neural networks, replay buffer, epsilon decay schedule
  4. Define reward function per Equation 15
  5. Train for 50,000 episodes (max 500 steps each); monitor convergence via episode reward

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Inspection frequency (Δt)**: Longer intervals reduce information but may lower inspection costs (not modeled); paper shows Case 7 (Δt=150) increases corrective replacements
  - **Repair/replacement cost ratio (C_P/C_R)**: High C_P/C_R discourages repairs (Case 3 shows 50% fewer repairs, 14% more replacements)
  - **Failure threshold L**: Higher L reduces all maintenance actions but increases risk tolerance; Case 4 (L=12) eliminates corrective replacements entirely
  - **Neural network architecture**: Paper uses MATLAB defaults; customizing depth/width may improve sample efficiency but risks overfitting to specific scenarios

- Failure signatures:
  - **Non-convergent training**: Check if epsilon decay is too fast (<0.001) or learning rate too high (>0.05); verify reward magnitudes aren't causing gradient instability
  - **Agent never repairs (only replaces)**: Likely C_P too high relative to C_R, or repair effectiveness parameters (μ, σ) misconfigured
  - **High corrective replacement rate**: Inspection interval Δt may be too long, or agent hasn't converged—extend training episodes
  - **State representation collapse**: If X^M is not properly updated after repairs, agent loses memory of repair history

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Reproduce Case 2* parameters (β=4.63, C_P=600, C_R=3500, C_down=2000, L=8, Δt=100). Train agent, compute long-run cost rate via Monte Carlo (200 iterations × 1000 inspections). Compare to paper's reported ~1800 cost rate.
  2. **Ablation on repair memory**: Disable the memory effect by setting repair bounds to [0, X^-_Tn] (no lower bound). Compare long-run cost rate and repair frequency to baseline—expect lower costs if memory constraint is overly conservative.
  3. **Sensitivity to inspection frequency**: Run Cases 2* (Δt=100) and Case 7 (Δt=150) side-by-side. Verify that longer intervals increase corrective replacements and total cost rate (paper reports ~3700 for Case 7). Test intermediate values (Δt=125) to characterize tradeoff curve.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the reinforcement learning agent be adapted to optimize maintenance for safety-critical systems where failure entails catastrophic consequences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state the methodology is "not applicable in its current formulation to critical safety systems such as maintenance of aircrafts, nuclear plants, etc, where failures can be catastrophic."
- Why unresolved: The current reward function is designed to minimize long-run economic costs ($C_P, C_R, C_{down}$) rather than maximizing reliability or enforcing strict safety constraints.
- Evidence: A modified agent that successfully balances economic optimization with hard constraints on failure probability or reliability metrics in a simulated high-stakes environment.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed DDQN architecture effectively scale to multi-component systems with economic and stochastic dependencies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper restricts the proposed model to a "single-unit system" (Section 4), despite acknowledging that real-world industrial systems are often complex and multi-component.
- Why unresolved: The curse of dimensionality in state and action spaces for multi-component systems may render the current DDQN structure insufficient without significant architectural modifications.
- Evidence: Successful application of the agent to a system with multiple interdependent components where the action space grows combinatorially.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the agent's performance degrade when the assumption of "perfect inspection" is violated by measurement noise or partial observability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study relies on the assumption of "perfect inspection, i.e., the system state is revealed with certainty" (Section 4).
- Why unresolved: In practice, sensors introduce noise. An agent trained on perfect state information may fail to generalize or make sub-optimal decisions when fed uncertain or partially observable degradation data.
- Evidence: A sensitivity analysis evaluating the policy's long-run cost rate when the input state $X_{T_n}$ is subject to Gaussian noise or partial observability.

## Limitations

- The gamma process assumption for degradation lacks empirical validation against real-world maintenance data
- The increasingly imperfect repair model using truncated normal with memory bounds is novel but not directly validated
- The methodology is explicitly not applicable to safety-critical systems where failures have catastrophic consequences
- Neural network architecture details are underspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism by which DDQN reduces overestimation bias through decoupled action selection/evaluation is well-established in RL literature and directly supported by the paper's methodology.
- **Medium confidence**: The gamma process as a degradation model is appropriate for monotonic deterioration, but the specific parameterization (linear shape function, scale β=4.63) lacks empirical grounding. The cost savings claims (~41% vs fail replacement, ~17% vs age/threshold policies) are internally consistent but require independent validation.
- **Low confidence**: The increasingly imperfect repair model using truncated normal with memory bounds is novel and not directly validated. The claim that this captures "cumulative damage" is plausible but not empirically demonstrated.

## Next Checks

1. **Degradation process validation**: Generate synthetic degradation paths using the gamma model with parameters from Case 2* (β=4.63, v(t)=0.0115t). Compare the resulting failure time distributions and degradation trajectories against real-world maintenance data from similar systems (e.g., industrial machinery, infrastructure assets). Test whether the monotonic assumption holds across different operating conditions.

2. **Repair effectiveness sensitivity**: Perform a parameter sweep on the repair distribution (μ, σ) to determine how sensitive the long-run cost rate is to repair effectiveness assumptions. Specifically, test cases where repair mean approaches the failure threshold (μ → L) and where repair variance increases (σ → L/3). Compare whether the agent adapts its policy appropriately or if it becomes overly conservative.

3. **DDQN architecture reproducibility**: Implement the DDQN agent using the paper's specifications (ε-greedy with decay 0.005, ADAM lr=0.01, batch=64, buffer=10000) but vary the neural network architecture systematically (e.g., [32,32], [64,32], [128,64] with ReLU activations). Train each configuration on the baseline scenario and measure convergence speed and final cost rates. Determine whether the reported performance is robust to architectural choices or highly sensitive to unspecified design decisions.
