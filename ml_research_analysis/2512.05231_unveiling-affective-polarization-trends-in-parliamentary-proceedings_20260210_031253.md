# Unveiling Affective Polarization Trends in Parliamentary Proceedings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.05231
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05231
- **Reference count:** 26
- **Primary result:** Affective polarization in the Israeli Knesset increased over time, driven by rising Valence variance and Arousal levels among parliamentary speakers.

## Executive Summary
This study operationalizes affective polarization using Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) emotional dimensions applied to Hebrew parliamentary proceedings from the Knesset. After creating a large Hebrew VAD lexicon and training regression models on sentence embeddings, the authors find that government members use more positive and assertive language than opposition members, while opposition speakers show higher emotional intensity. Most importantly, they detect a statistically significant increase in affective polarization over time, driven by rising variance in Valence and higher Arousal, even after controlling for gender and coalition composition.

## Method Summary
The researchers created a Hebrew VAD lexicon by manually correcting an English lexicon, then fine-tuned a multilingual sentence encoder on Knesset data. They trained three separate binomial regression models to predict VAD scores for each sentence. Protocols were aggregated to compute Valence variance and Arousal mean, which operationalized affective polarization. Temporal trends were tested using Mann-Kendall tests and OLS regression with controls for gender and coalition composition.

## Key Results
- Government members show significantly higher mean Valence than opposition members across 10 of 13 committees
- Opposition speakers exhibit higher Arousal in 9 of 13 committees, indicating greater emotional intensity
- A statistically significant increase in affective polarization was detected in 4 of 13 committees over time
- Dominance values decreased for both coalition and opposition members, suggesting more ambiguous speech patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: VAD-Based Operationalization of Affective Polarization
- **Claim:** Affective polarization can be detected through rising variance in Valence combined with elevated Arousal over time.
- **Mechanism:** Polarized discourse produces both positive (in-group) and negative (out-group) statements, creating high Valence variance. Simultaneously, emotional intensity (Arousal) increases as disagreements become more heated. The combination captures the "dislike and strong negative feelings" dimension of polarization rather than ideological stance.
- **Core assumption:** Emotional language in parliamentary text faithfully reflects underlying affective polarization among speakers.
- **Evidence anchors:** Related work shows anger and disgust scores are substantially higher in interactions between people of opposing ideologies.

### Mechanism 2: Sentence Embeddings + Binomial Regression for Continuous VAD Prediction
- **Claim:** Context-sensitive sentence embeddings passed through binomial regression models can predict continuous VAD scores more effectively than word-counting approaches.
- **Mechanism:** The encoder LLM captures contextual meaning beyond individual words. Binomial regression (GLM with logit link) constrains predictions to [0,1], appropriate for proportional VAD scores. The combination allows nuanced, context-aware emotion prediction at sentence level.
- **Core assumption:** The VAD lexicon values (translated from English) transfer validly to Hebrew parliamentary language despite cultural differences.

### Mechanism 3: Coalition-Opposition Style Divergence as Construct Validity
- **Claim:** Systematic VAD differences between government and opposition speakers validate that the models capture meaningful emotional variation.
- **Mechanism:** Opposition members use more negative and conflictual rhetoric to attract media attention, producing lower Valence and higher Arousal. Government members use more positive, assertive language reflecting authority, producing higher Valence and Dominance. Detecting these expected patterns confirms VAD measures reflect real stylistic differences.
- **Core assumption:** The theoretical motivations (media logic, opposition behavior) correctly predict emotional style differences in Israeli parliamentary culture.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: VAD (Valence, Arousal, Dominance) Emotional Dimensions**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core representational framework; without understanding what each dimension measures, you cannot interpret polarization results.
  - **Quick check question:** Would a calm, authoritative critique of policy score high on Arousal or Dominance?

- **Concept: Affective vs. Ideological Polarization**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly distinguishes emotional style (affective) from policy disagreement (ideological); conflating them would misinterpret findings.
  - **Quick check question:** If two parties disagree on tax policy but express mutual respect, is this affective polarization?

- **Concept: Binomial Regression for Bounded Continuous Targets**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard linear regression can predict values outside [0,1]; understanding why binomial GLM with logit link is appropriate prevents implementation errors.
  - **Quick check question:** Why not use standard MSE loss with a simple linear layer for predicting VAD scores?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Knesset Corpus → committee-filtered sentences → speaker metadata → Hebrew VAD lexicon → MLM fine-tuned multilingual-e5-large → sentence embeddings → three binomial regression models → per-sentence VAD scores → protocol-level statistics → committee-level time series → trend analysis

- **Critical path:** Lexicon quality → embedding quality → regression model training → VAD assignment → protocol aggregation → trend detection. Errors propagate; weak lexicon validation undermines all downstream conclusions.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Committee-only analysis (excludes plenary) trades coverage for spontaneity and topic control
  - Binomial regression vs. transformer regression head: simpler model performed better
  - Fine-tuning only encoder, recombining with original sentence-transformer: unconventional but effective

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Dominance predictions with negative correlations → regression head approach failing
  - Arousal correlations ~0.4-0.5 → weaker signal than Valence; may indicate annotator subjectivity
  - Non-significant trends in some committees → polarization may not affect all topics equally

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce validation:** Train binomial models on lexicon + EmoBank, test on held-out Knesset sentences; verify Pearson r > 0.5 for all dimensions
  2. **Ablate fine-tuning:** Compare Knesset-multi-e5-large vs. original multilingual-e5-large on VAD prediction to quantify domain adaptation benefit
  3. **Control check:** Run OLS regression on a single committee; verify TP coefficient is positive and significant for V_var and A_mean

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Is the detected increase in affective polarization driven by a bottom-up trend (citizens influencing politicians) or a top-down process (politicians influencing the public)?
- **Basis in paper:** The conclusion states an interest in understanding "why polarization increases," specifically asking if it originates from citizens or politicians, and plans to compare Knesset data with general media to determine temporal causality.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study analyzes only the parliamentary proceedings (the output of politicians) and lacks a parallel analysis of public sentiment or social media data to establish the direction of influence.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative temporal analysis correlating the rise of emotional metrics in parliamentary protocols with similar metrics in social media or public opinion polls to see which leads the trend.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the trend of increasing affective polarization hold in structured, prepared plenary speeches, or is it unique to the spontaneous discourse of committee meetings?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors note they focused on committee protocols because they are spontaneous and topical, but explicitly state future work will "extend the analysis also to plenary protocols" to see if polarization exists in prepared discourse.
- **Why unresolved:** Plenary sessions were excluded from the current analysis due to the possibility that prepared speeches might not reflect the same emotional dynamics as the unscripted committee debates.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying the same VAD regression models and polarization operationalization to the plenary session data in the Knesset Corpus.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What specific linguistic or rhetorical strategies are driving the observed decline in Dominance values among both coalition and opposition members over time?
- **Basis in paper:** The results show a consistent decline in Dominance (control/assertiveness) over time. The authors suggest this reflects a shift toward ambiguous speech but explicitly call for "future research" to investigate the underlying linguistic strategies.
- **Why unresolved:** While the study quantifies the Dominance score decline, it does not perform a fine-grained qualitative or linguistic analysis of the specific sentence structures or vocabulary shifts causing this numerical drop.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A qualitative linguistic analysis of high-Dominance vs. low-Dominance sentences over time to identify specific rhetorical shifts (e.g., increased hedging, passive voice, or ambiguity).

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Can the rise in emotional discourse be attributed to the "mediatization of politics" (adapting to media logic) rather than solely to inter-party polarization?
- **Basis in paper:** The Limitations section notes that "increasing dominance of media logic" and inconsistent protocol editing could be alternative explanations for the findings, alongside polarization.
- **Why unresolved:** The study controls for time and coalition composition but does not control for the structural influence of media cycles or changes in journalistic standards, which may cause politicians to use emotional language for coverage rather than out of genuine animosity.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Analyzing the correlation between protocol emotionality and media metrics (e.g., news coverage volume or tone) or controlling for major non-political media events that might influence rhetoric.

## Limitations

- The VAD lexicon validation relies on relatively small annotated datasets, limiting confidence in Arousal and Dominance predictions particularly
- Cultural translation of English VAD lexicon to Hebrew may not fully capture context-specific emotional expressions in Israeli parliamentary discourse
- The study excludes plenary sessions, potentially missing broader patterns of affective polarization

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Coalition-opposition VAD differences (empirical observation with clear statistical significance across 13 committees)
- **Medium confidence:** Temporal increase in affective polarization (trend significant in 4 committees but requires cautious interpretation of causality)
- **Medium confidence:** VAD-based operationalization of affective polarization (theoretically sound but requires more validation against alternative measures)

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the validation study using larger, Hebrew-specific emotion annotation datasets to verify Pearson correlations remain above 0.5 for all VAD dimensions
2. Apply the VAD prediction pipeline to another language-pair parliamentary corpus (e.g., English → German) to test cross-linguistic validity of the translation-and-predict approach
3. Conduct ablation study: rerun trend analysis using only Valence variance vs. only Arousal mean to isolate which component drives the observed polarization signal
