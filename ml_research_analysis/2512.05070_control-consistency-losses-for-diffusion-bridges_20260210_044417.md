core_contribution: This work introduces a self-consistency property of diffusion bridge
  solutions, derived from stochastic analysis, that relates control values at different
  times along the solution path. Leveraging this, the authors propose an iterative

# Control Consistency Losses for Diffusion Bridges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05070
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05070

- Primary result: Iterative online algorithm for learning control drift in diffusion bridges without backpropagation, achieving competitive KL divergence (0.02–0.06) on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridges

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a self-consistency property for diffusion bridge solutions derived from stochastic analysis, which relates control values at different times along the solution path. The authors propose an iterative online algorithm that learns the control drift without backpropagation through trajectories, enforcing terminal bridging and gradient-form properties by construction. The method leverages fixed-point-style self-consistency losses and generalizes to avoid numerical issues via auxiliary drift terms.

## Method Summary
The authors develop an iterative online algorithm that exploits a self-consistency property of diffusion bridge solutions to learn control drift parameters. By avoiding backpropagation through entire trajectories, the method reduces computational complexity while maintaining competitive performance. The algorithm enforces both terminal bridging constraints and gradient-form properties intrinsically, using auxiliary drift terms to handle numerical instabilities that may arise in practice.

## Key Results
- Competitive performance with existing methods, achieving KL divergence of approximately 0.02–0.06 in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridge experiments
- Lower computational cost compared to backpropagation-based approaches
- Successful generalization through auxiliary drift terms to avoid numerical issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting a mathematical self-consistency property of diffusion bridge solutions that relates control values at different time points along the trajectory. This property allows the algorithm to learn control drift parameters iteratively without needing to backpropagate through entire trajectories. By enforcing terminal bridging and gradient-form properties by construction, the method ensures solution quality while avoiding the computational burden of trajectory-wide backpropagation.

## Foundational Learning
- Stochastic analysis: Essential for deriving the self-consistency property of diffusion bridges
  - Quick check: Verify the mathematical derivation of the self-consistency relationship
- Diffusion bridge theory: Required understanding of how stochastic processes conditioned on endpoints behave
  - Quick check: Confirm the terminal bridging property is correctly enforced
- Fixed-point iteration: Core algorithmic technique for the online learning procedure
  - Quick check: Validate convergence properties of the iterative scheme

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Control drift function -> Self-consistency loss computation -> Iterative update -> Auxiliary drift terms (if needed)
- Critical path: Initial control estimate → Self-consistency evaluation → Iterative refinement → Final bridge solution
- Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs. solution accuracy; online learning vs. offline optimization
- Failure signatures: Non-convergence of iterative updates; violation of terminal bridging constraints; numerical instability without auxiliary terms
- First experiments:
  1. Test algorithm convergence on simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridges
  2. Verify self-consistency property holds empirically in learned solutions
  3. Compare KL divergence with backpropagation-based baseline methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability to high-dimensional or complex diffusion processes beyond Ornstein-Uhlenbeck remains uncertain
- Limited experimental validation scope restricts generalizability claims
- The auxiliary drift terms' effectiveness across diverse diffusion processes needs further verification

## Confidence
- Theoretical derivation and algorithmic framework: High
- Empirical performance and generalizability: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on higher-dimensional diffusion processes and compare performance with established methods
2. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of auxiliary drift terms on numerical stability and accuracy
3. Evaluate the scalability of the iterative online algorithm with increasing trajectory length and complexity
