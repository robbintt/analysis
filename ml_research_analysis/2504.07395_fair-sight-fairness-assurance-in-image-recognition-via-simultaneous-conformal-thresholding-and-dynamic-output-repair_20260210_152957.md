# FAIR-SIGHT: Fairness Assurance in Image Recognition via Simultaneous Conformal Thresholding and Dynamic Output Repair

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.07395
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07395
- **Authors:** Arya Fayyazi; Mehdi Kamal; Massoud Pedram
- **Reference count:** 31
- **Primary result:** Reduces Demographic Parity Difference (DPD) and Equalized Odds Difference (EOD) by over 30% and 25% respectively on CelebA and UTKFace datasets

## Executive Summary
FAIR-SIGHT is a post-hoc framework that ensures fairness in computer vision systems by integrating conformal prediction with dynamic output repair mechanisms. The method computes a fairness-aware non-conformity score that simultaneously assesses prediction errors and fairness violations, establishing adaptive thresholds that provide finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees. When the non-conformity score exceeds the calibrated threshold, targeted corrective adjustments are applied to reduce both group and individual fairness disparities without requiring retraining or internal model parameter access.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs a fairness-aware non-conformity score by combining predictive error with a weighted fairness penalty, then uses split-conformal prediction to establish adaptive thresholds. For classification tasks, it applies logit shifts when fairness violations are detected, while for detection tasks it scales bounding-box confidence scores. An optional dynamic threshold update mechanism incrementally tightens fairness constraints in response to recurring violations, providing adaptability to distribution shifts while maintaining statistical guarantees under the exchangeability assumption.

## Key Results
- Reduces DPD and EOD by over 30% and 25% respectively on CelebA and UTKFace classification datasets
- Narrows AP Gap between protected and non-protected groups from 0.071 to 0.033 for ResNet50 detection backbone
- Narrows AP Gap from 0.042 to 0.008 for MambaVision-L2-1K detection backbone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** If the data distribution is exchangeable, FAIR-SIGHT can statistically bound the rate of fairness violations using a calibrated threshold on a combined error-fairness score.
- **Mechanism:** The framework constructs a "fairness-aware non-conformity score" $S(I)$ by summing predictive error $d(h(I), y)$ and a weighted fairness penalty $\lambda \Delta(I, A)$. It uses split-conformal prediction on a calibration set to find a threshold $Q_\alpha$ such that $P(S(I_{new}) > Q_\alpha) \le \alpha$.
- **Core assumption:** The calibration and test data are exchangeable (i.e., drawn from the same distribution); violations of this assumption break the finite-sample coverage guarantees.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "establishing adaptive thresholds that provide finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees."
  - [section 3.5] "Conformal prediction provides a powerful guarantee... selecting the ⌈(n + 1)(1 − α)⌉-th score as Qα ensures... Pr[S(Inew) ≤ Qα] ≥ 1 − α."
  - [corpus] Related work (FACTER) confirms the viability of CP-based fairness thresholding in recommendation systems, supporting the general approach.
- **Break condition:** Significant distribution shift (non-exchangeability) between calibration and deployment will likely cause the actual violation rate to exceed the user-specified $\alpha$.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Targeted output repairs (logit shifts or confidence scaling) can reduce specific group disparities without accessing model internals.
- **Mechanism:** When $S(I) > Q_\alpha$, the system applies a repair function. For classification, it shifts the logit of the true class; for detection, it scales bounding-box confidence scores. This forces the output back into the acceptable non-conformity region.
- **Core assumption:** The output space is sufficiently plastic that small, localized adjustments (defined by $\kappa$ or $\eta$) can correct the fairness penalty term without destabilizing the global accuracy.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "targeted corrective adjustments... reduce both group and individual fairness disparities... without requiring retraining."
  - [section 3.4] "We adjust the logit corresponding to the true class by adding a constant correction term... [or] bounding-box confidence scores... [are] scaled."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence for this specific "output repair" dynamic in vision is weak; related papers focus on ranking or time-series inference, suggesting this visual repair mechanism is a distinct contribution.
- **Break condition:** If the base model is fundamentally broken (e.g., random guessing), post-hoc logit shifts will not simultaneously satisfy accuracy and fairness constraints.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Dynamic threshold updates allow the system to tighten fairness constraints incrementally in response to recurring violations.
- **Mechanism:** An optional feedback loop updates the threshold $Q_\alpha$ using an exponential moving average: $Q^{(t+1)}_\alpha = \gamma Q^{(t)}_\alpha + (1-\gamma)\min\{Q^{(t)}_\alpha, S_{new}\}$. This lowers the threshold if high non-conformity scores are frequent.
- **Core assumption:** A sequence of high scores indicates a systemic drift or underestimation of bias, requiring stricter thresholds, rather than transient noise that should be ignored.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "adaptability is further demonstrated through optional dynamic threshold updates that incrementally tighten fairness constraints."
  - [section 3.4] "Recurrent violations lead Qα to decrease, imposing more stringent fairness constraints... converging to a fixed point."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence was found validating "dynamic tightening" specifically for fairness, marking this as a higher-risk, exploratory component of the architecture.
- **Break condition:** Aggressive updates (low $\gamma$) in a noisy environment could collapse the threshold to zero, blocking all predictions (extreme conservatism).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Conformal Prediction (CP)**
  - **Why needed here:** CP is the mathematical engine that converts heuristic "fairness scores" into rigorous statistical guarantees (bounding the probability of unfair outcomes).
  - **Quick check question:** If you change the significance level $\alpha$ from 0.1 to 0.05, how should the calibrated threshold $Q_\alpha$ change, and what does this imply for the repair frequency?

- **Concept: Group vs. Individual Fairness**
  - **Why needed here:** The non-conformity score $S(I)$ must balance standard error against two distinct types of fairness (group parity vs. individual consistency), requiring the designer to tune $\lambda$ appropriately.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the "fairness penalty" $\Delta(I, A)$ in the paper primarily target group statistical parity or individual consistency, and how is it calculated for a detection task?

- **Concept: Black-box Model Access**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire architecture relies on treating the vision model as $f: I \to Y$ without gradient access. Understanding this constraint explains why the solution uses "output repair" (logit shifting) rather than "adversarial debiasing" (weight updates).
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the "Detection Repair" mechanism scale confidence scores instead of modifying the feature extractor?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Image $I$ + Protected Attribute $A$ -> Black Box CV Model -> Scorer (computes $S(I)$) -> Controller (compares $S(I)$ vs. $Q_\alpha$) -> Repair Module (applies $\Delta_c$ or $\eta$) -> Feedback (optional threshold update)
- **Critical path:** The definition and calibration of the **Fairness-Aware Non-Conformity Score ($S(I)$)**. If the fairness penalty $\Delta(I, A)$ does not correlate well with actual bias, or if the calibration set is not representative, the guarantees are invalid.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **$\lambda$ (Fairness Weight):** High $\lambda$ reduces disparity (lower DPD/EOD) but risks accuracy drops by over-penalizing correct predictions that happen to be unfair.
  - **$\alpha$ (Significance):** Low $\alpha$ provides stronger guarantees (fewer unfair outcomes allowed) but forces a higher threshold, potentially triggering more invasive repairs.
  - **Static vs. Dynamic Threshold:** Dynamic updates adapt to drift but introduce non-stationarity that complicates debugging and formal verification.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Accuracy Collapse:** Repair mechanism overshoots, causing accurate predictions to flip (monitor $\Delta_{max}$ and $\kappa$).
  - **Stagnant Disparity:** DPD/EOD metrics do not improve, indicating the penalty term $\Delta$ is not capturing the actual bias or $\lambda$ is too low.
  - **Threshold Collapse:** $Q_\alpha$ rapidly decreases to near-zero due to the dynamic update rule, blocking valid outputs.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Calibration Validation:** Verify the finite-sample guarantee. Run inference on a held-out test set and confirm that the fraction of samples flagged as "unfair" ($S > Q_\alpha$) is indeed $\le \alpha$.
  2. **Hyperparameter Sweep ($\lambda$):** Sweep $\lambda$ on the validation set to plot the Pareto frontier between Accuracy and DPD/EOD. Identify the "knee" point where fairness gains justify accuracy costs.
  3. **Noise Robustness:** Corrupt the protected attribute labels $A$ in the calibration set (flip 10-20%) and measure the degradation in fairness reduction (DPD) to test the system's sensitivity to label noise.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework's theoretical guarantees critically depend on the exchangeability assumption between calibration and test data, which may be violated in real-world deployments.
- The dynamic threshold update mechanism introduces non-stationarity that complicates debugging and formal verification.
- Method requires protected attribute information at inference time, which may not always be available or ethical to collect.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core conformal prediction mechanism for establishing statistical guarantees (Mechanism 1) has strong theoretical foundations and empirical validation.
- **Medium Confidence:** The output repair mechanisms (Mechanism 2) show promise but lack extensive corpus validation specifically in computer vision contexts.
- **Low Confidence:** The dynamic threshold update mechanism (Mechanism 3) is largely exploratory with limited supporting evidence from the broader literature.

## Next Checks
1. **Distribution Shift Robustness:** Systematically evaluate performance under various types of data distribution shifts (covariate shift, label shift, concept drift) to quantify the degradation of fairness guarantees when exchangeability is violated.
2. **Repair Mechanism Bounds:** Determine the maximum allowable correction magnitude ($\kappa$ for classification, $\eta$ for detection) before accuracy degradation becomes unacceptable, establishing operational limits for the repair module.
3. **Dynamic Update Stability:** Conduct extensive experiments varying the decay parameter $\gamma$ across different dataset characteristics to identify conditions under which the dynamic threshold update mechanism converges versus diverges or becomes overly conservative.
