- Primary result: Novel algorithm achieves exponential decay of dynamic regret with prediction window size for online convex optimization with memory

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses online convex optimization with memory and limited predictions, where the cost function at each time step depends on past decisions and the decision maker can only query a limited number of points to obtain predictions of future cost values. The authors propose a novel predictive algorithm that combines two subroutines: one for online convex optimization with memory and bandit feedback, and another for zeroth-order methods that achieves linear convergence rates for general convex optimization. The key innovation is the use of truncated Gaussian smoothing when querying decision points to obtain predictions, which enables exponential decay of regret with prediction window size.

## Method Summary
The proposed algorithm combines two key subroutines: (1) an online convex optimization method with memory and bandit feedback that achieves √T VT-dynamic regret, and (2) a zeroth-order optimization method that attains linear convergence rates for general convex functions. The algorithm uses truncated Gaussian smoothing when making prediction queries, which is crucial for proving the improved convergence rate. The prediction window allows the algorithm to query future cost values, and the exponential decay of regret with window size is achieved through careful integration of the two subroutines.

## Key Results
- The proposed algorithm achieves dynamic regret that decays exponentially with the length of the prediction window, matching the performance of algorithms for the full information setting
- The first subroutine achieves √T VT-dynamic regret for online convex optimization with memory and bandit feedback
- The second subroutine is a zeroth-order method that attains linear convergence rates for general convex optimization, improving upon existing zeroth-order methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The exponential decay of regret with prediction window size is achieved through the combination of two subroutines that handle different aspects of the problem. The truncated Gaussian smoothing technique when querying predictions is crucial for proving the improved convergence rate. The algorithm leverages the memory dependence structure of the cost functions while using limited predictions to anticipate future costs, creating a feedback loop that improves decision-making over time.

## Foundational Learning

**Online Convex Optimization**: A sequential decision-making framework where decisions are made without knowledge of future cost functions, but can adapt based on observed costs. Needed to understand the problem setting and performance metrics. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between static and dynamic regret?

**Bandit Feedback**: A setting where the decision maker only observes the cost of the chosen action, not the entire cost function. Required for understanding the limited information setting. Quick check: How does bandit feedback differ from full information feedback?

**Zeroth-Order Optimization**: Optimization methods that only require function evaluations, not gradient information. Essential for understanding the second subroutine's approach. Quick check: What are the main challenges in zeroth-order optimization compared to first-order methods?

**Dynamic Regret**: A performance metric that measures the difference between the algorithm's cumulative cost and the cost of the best dynamic strategy. Needed to evaluate performance in non-stationary environments. Quick check: How does dynamic regret differ from static regret?

**Truncated Gaussian Smoothing**: A technique that smooths a function using truncated Gaussian noise, enabling better gradient estimation in noisy environments. Critical for the prediction query mechanism. Quick check: Why is truncation necessary in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Main Algorithm -> Subroutines (Bandit OCO with Memory, Zeroth-Order Method) -> Prediction Query System with Truncated Gaussian Smoothing

**Critical Path**: At each time step: (1) Use truncated Gaussian smoothing to query predictions, (2) Update state using bandit OCO with memory subroutine, (3) Make decision using zeroth-order method, (4) Observe actual cost and update predictions

**Design Tradeoffs**: The algorithm trades off between exploration (through truncated Gaussian smoothing) and exploitation (through memory-based decisions). The prediction window size is a key hyperparameter that balances the benefit of future information against the cost of making more prediction queries.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance when predictions are highly inaccurate, when the memory dependence structure is weak, or when the prediction window is too small to capture meaningful future information. The truncated Gaussian smoothing may also fail if the noise level is not properly calibrated.

**Three First Experiments**: (1) Test on a simple quadratic problem with known memory structure, (2) Vary prediction window size and measure regret decay rate, (3) Compare performance against baseline algorithms without memory or predictions
