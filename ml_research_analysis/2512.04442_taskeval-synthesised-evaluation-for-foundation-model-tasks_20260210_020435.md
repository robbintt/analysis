# TaskEval: Synthesised Evaluation for Foundation-Model Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04442
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04442
- Reference count: 34
- TaskEval introduces a framework for synthesising task-specific evaluators for foundation model tasks using a task-agnostic meta-model and interaction protocol

## Executive Summary
TaskEval presents a novel framework for evaluating foundation model (FM) tasks when traditional metrics and datasets are unavailable. The system employs a task-agnostic meta-model to extract task knowledge through an interaction protocol, then generates custom evaluators or selects from known ones. Demonstrated on chart data extraction and document QA tasks, TaskEval achieved 93% and 90% accuracy respectively. The framework produces task-specific UIs and APIs for automated evaluation and human inspection, addressing a critical gap in FM task evaluation during both development and operational phases.

## Method Summary
TaskEval employs a three-component architecture: a task-agnostic meta-model for knowledge extraction, an interaction protocol for gathering task requirements from users, and an eval synthesiser that generates custom evaluators or selects from existing ones. The system operates by first understanding the task through user interaction, then synthesising appropriate evaluation mechanisms tailored to the specific requirements. This approach enables evaluation of novel FM tasks without pre-existing metrics or datasets, with evaluators that can be deployed as either APIs or user interfaces for flexible usage scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieved 93% accuracy in chart data extraction task evaluation
- Achieved 90% accuracy in document QA task evaluation
- Demonstrated capability to generate task-specific UIs and APIs for both automated and human-in-the-loop evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TaskEval addresses the fundamental challenge of evaluating foundation model tasks when traditional evaluation datasets and metrics don't exist. By using a task-agnostic meta-model as the foundation, the system can adapt to any FM task through a structured interaction protocol that extracts domain-specific knowledge. The eval synthesiser then leverages this knowledge to create custom evaluation mechanisms that are precisely calibrated to the task requirements, rather than forcing tasks into predefined evaluation molds.

## Foundational Learning
- Task-agnostic meta-model: A general-purpose model that can understand and extract knowledge about any foundation model task, enabling the system to work across diverse domains without task-specific training
- Interaction protocol: The structured process for gathering task requirements from users, ensuring consistent and complete knowledge extraction that feeds into evaluator generation
- Eval synthesiser: The component that transforms extracted task knowledge into functional evaluators, either by generating new ones or selecting from existing templates
- Task-specific UI/API generation: The ability to create appropriate interfaces for evaluation deployment, enabling both automated testing and human inspection workflows

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User -> Interaction Protocol -> Task-Agnostic Meta-Model -> Eval Synthesiser -> Task-Specific UI/API

Critical path: The user interacts with the protocol to describe their FM task, the meta-model processes this description to extract requirements, and the synthesiser generates or selects appropriate evaluators that are then deployed via UI or API.

Design tradeoffs: The system trades off between custom evaluator generation (more precise but computationally expensive) versus selecting from known evaluators (faster but potentially less accurate). The choice depends on task complexity and available resources.

Failure signatures: Poor task descriptions lead to inaccurate evaluators; complex tasks may overwhelm the meta-model's extraction capabilities; generated evaluators may fail to capture nuanced task requirements.

First experiments:
1. Test the interaction protocol with a simple, well-defined FM task to verify knowledge extraction quality
2. Evaluate the synthesiser's ability to generate evaluators for a task with existing metrics to compare against ground truth
3. Deploy a generated evaluator via both UI and API to verify functionality and usability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns across diverse task domains, particularly for complex or abstract tasks
- Heavy dependency on GPT-4, limiting applicability in resource-constrained environments
- Reliance on user's ability to articulate task requirements effectively, potentially introducing variability

## Confidence
- High confidence in the framework's core concept and preliminary demonstration on structured tasks
- Medium confidence in the generalizability across diverse task domains
- Low confidence in the framework's performance with smaller foundation models or in resource-constrained environments

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TaskEval's performance across a broader range of task types, including more abstract or creative tasks, to assess scalability and robustness
2. Conduct user studies to quantify the variability in evaluator quality based on different user inputs and identify best practices for knowledge extraction
3. Test the framework's dependency on GPT-4 by attempting to replicate results using smaller foundation models or alternative large language models
