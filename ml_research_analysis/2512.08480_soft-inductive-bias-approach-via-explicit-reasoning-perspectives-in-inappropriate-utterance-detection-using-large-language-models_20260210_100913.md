## Executive Summary
This study addresses inappropriate utterance detection in Korean conversational texts by introducing a soft inductive bias approach through explicit reasoning perspectives. The framework guides large language models to reason through surface-level, causal, impact-based, and comprehensive perspectives, preventing errors during inference. The Kanana-1.5 model demonstrates a 3.89% improvement over standard supervised learning by constraining the reasoning process rather than relying solely on knowledge imitation.

The research highlights that guided reasoning frameworks produce more consistent and precise judgments for inappropriate utterance detection. By explicitly defining reasoning perspectives, the approach mitigates the tendency of large language models to make errors when evaluating conversational context. This method proves particularly effective for detecting subtle inappropriate remarks that could escalate into verbal abuse in online environments.

## Method Summary
The study proposes a soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines four reasoning perspectives: surface-level, causal, impact-based, and comprehensive. These perspectives serve as constraints during the fine-tuning process of Korean large language models. The framework guides the model through structured reasoning steps rather than allowing free-form knowledge application. Kanana-1.5, the resulting model, was fine-tuned using this constrained reasoning approach on Korean conversational datasets. The method focuses on improving detection accuracy by preventing reasoning errors through explicit perspective definition rather than relying on standard supervised learning techniques.

## Key Results
- Kanana-1.5 achieved 87.0046% average accuracy in inappropriate utterance detection
- The model demonstrated a 3.89% improvement over standard supervised learning baselines
- The constrained reasoning framework showed effectiveness in producing more precise and consistent judgments compared to knowledge imitation approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The soft inductive bias approach works by constraining the reasoning process through explicitly defined perspectives, which prevents the model from making reasoning errors common in free-form inference. By guiding the model through surface-level, causal, and impact-based considerations before reaching comprehensive judgments, the framework ensures more consistent evaluation of conversational context. This structured approach is particularly effective because inappropriate utterance detection requires nuanced understanding of intent and impact, which can be lost when models rely solely on pattern matching or knowledge retrieval.

## Foundational Learning

**Large Language Model Fine-tuning**: The process of adapting pre-trained language models to specific downstream tasks through additional training on task-specific data. Why needed: Standard LLMs require task-specific adaptation to perform well on domain-specific problems like inappropriate utterance detection. Quick check: Verify fine-tuning dataset size and training parameters.

**Inductive Bias**: The set of assumptions that help a learning algorithm generalize beyond training data. Why needed: Without appropriate inductive bias, models may overfit or make inconsistent judgments in nuanced tasks. Quick check: Examine how the reasoning perspectives constrain model behavior.

**Conversational Context Understanding**: The ability to interpret utterances within their broader conversational context. Why needed: Inappropriate content often depends on context rather than explicit keywords. Quick check: Review examples showing context-dependent inappropriate content.

**Reasoning Perspectives Framework**: The systematic approach of evaluating content through multiple analytical lenses. Why needed: Complex judgment tasks require multiple viewpoints for accurate assessment. Quick check: Verify the four perspectives adequately cover relevant evaluation dimensions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Pre-trained Korean LLM -> Reasoning Perspective Encoder -> Constrained Fine-tuning Module -> Kanana-1.5 Output

**Critical Path**: Input utterance → Surface-level perspective analysis → Causal perspective analysis → Impact-based perspective analysis → Comprehensive perspective synthesis → Final classification decision

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational efficiency for improved accuracy and consistency. While the multi-perspective analysis requires more processing time than standard classification, it produces more reliable judgments. The framework also requires domain expertise to define appropriate reasoning perspectives, making it less generalizable than pure data-driven approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: The model may struggle with cross-cultural contexts where reasoning perspectives differ significantly. It could also exhibit bias toward explicitly stated harm rather than subtle inappropriate content. The framework might fail when conversational contexts are ambiguous or when perspectives conflict with each other.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Evaluate model performance on a held-out test set with diverse inappropriate utterance examples
2. Conduct ablation study removing individual reasoning perspectives to assess their contribution
3. Test model consistency by evaluating the same utterances with slight contextual variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study focuses exclusively on Korean conversational data without cross-linguistic validation
- The reasoning perspectives framework may not generalize to other languages or cultural contexts
- The 3.89% improvement stems from comparisons with a single baseline model, lacking broader comparative analysis

## Confidence

**Kanana-1.5 Performance Claims**: Medium
- Based on single dataset evaluation
- Lacks external validation
- Proprietary model architecture prevents independent verification

**Reasoning Framework Effectiveness**: Medium
- Theoretically sound but requires more empirical substantiation
- Claims about improved consistency need further testing
- Cross-cultural applicability remains unproven

**Comparative Advantage Claims**: Medium
- Improvement metrics positive but limited baseline comparisons
- Alternative approaches not evaluated
- Generalization to other domains uncertain

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study using multilingual datasets to assess cross-linguistic generalization of the reasoning perspectives framework

2. Compare the soft inductive bias approach against established toxic language detection benchmarks like Detoxify or Perspective API using standardized evaluation metrics

3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual reasoning perspectives to determine which components contribute most to performance improvements
