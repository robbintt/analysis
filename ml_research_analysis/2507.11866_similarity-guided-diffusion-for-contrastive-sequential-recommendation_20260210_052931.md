# Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.11866
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11866
- Authors: Jinkyeong Choi; Yejin Noh; Donghyeon Park
- Reference count: 40
- Key result: Achieves up to 13.36% improvement in HR@5 and 12.40% in HR@10 on five benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SimDiffRec, a novel similarity-guided diffusion model for contrastive sequential recommendation. The key innovation is generating semantically consistent noise using similarity between item embeddings rather than random noise, preserving contextual information during augmentation. The model combines this with confidence score-based augmentation position selection and hard negative sampling for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets with significant improvements in ranking metrics.

## Method Summary
SimDiffRec addresses data sparsity and contextual distortion issues in sequential recommendation by introducing a similarity-guided diffusion framework. Instead of using random noise during diffusion, the model generates noise based on the similarity between item embeddings, ensuring semantic consistency. Augmentation positions are selected using the diffusion model's confidence scores, making transformations context-aware. The approach integrates hard negative sampling into contrastive learning to improve representation quality. The model is trained end-to-end with a loss function that combines reconstruction loss and contrastive loss objectives.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 13.36% improvement in HR@5 compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- Achieves up to 12.40% improvement in HR@10 on benchmark datasets
- Ablation studies confirm the importance of similarity-guided noise, confidence-based augmentation, and hard negative sampling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The similarity-guided diffusion approach preserves semantic relationships during data augmentation by generating noise that respects item embedding similarities. This maintains contextual coherence when sequences are augmented, unlike random noise which can introduce semantically inconsistent transformations. The confidence-based position selection ensures that augmentations occur in locations where the model is most uncertain, focusing on the most informative transformations. Hard negative sampling further enhances representation learning by providing challenging contrastive examples that push the model to learn more discriminative features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Models in Recommendation**: Used to generate augmented data while preserving semantic relationships; needed to address data sparsity through controlled augmentation
- **Contrastive Learning**: Learns representations by comparing similar and dissimilar examples; needed to improve embedding quality through hard negative mining
- **Sequential Recommendation**: Predicts next items based on user interaction history; needed to capture temporal dependencies in user behavior
- **Hard Negative Sampling**: Selects challenging negative examples for contrastive learning; needed to improve model discrimination between similar items
- **Confidence Scoring in Diffusion**: Uses model uncertainty to guide augmentation positions; needed to focus on most informative transformations
- **Semantic Consistency in Augmentation**: Ensures augmented data maintains meaningful relationships; needed to prevent semantic drift during data augmentation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Item Embeddings -> Similarity-Guided Noise Generator -> Confidence Score Calculator -> Augmentation Selector -> Diffusion Transformer -> Contrastive Loss

**Critical Path**: User sequence -> Item embedding lookup -> Similarity-guided noise generation -> Confidence score calculation -> Augmentation position selection -> Sequence transformation -> Representation learning -> Next-item prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model trades computational efficiency for semantic consistency in augmentation. While random noise would be faster to generate, it risks semantic distortion. The confidence-based position selection adds inference complexity but focuses on the most informative transformations. Hard negative sampling improves representation quality but requires additional computation for negative example selection.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on cold-start items, degraded performance with very short sequences, increased inference latency compared to baseline models, potential overfitting when similarity matrices are too dense, and computational bottlenecks during large-scale similarity calculations.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. HR@5 and HR@10 ranking metrics on benchmark datasets (ML-1M, ML-10M, Gowalla, Amazon-Books, Amazon-CDs)
2. Ablation study removing similarity-guided noise, confidence-based augmentation, and hard negative sampling
3. Visualization of sequence representations before and after diffusion augmentation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Computational overhead during inference due to confidence score calculation and similarity-based noise generation
- Limited discussion of scalability to extremely large item catalogs beyond tested datasets
- Focus on ranking metrics without examining diversity, cold-start performance, or user satisfaction
- No analysis of temporal performance or adaptation to evolving user preferences

## Confidence
**Technical Implementation Concerns**: Medium - Theoretical soundness is demonstrated, but computational overhead and real-time applicability need further validation
**Generalizability Questions**: Medium - Strong performance on five datasets, but real-world diversity and scalability remain untested
**Evaluation Scope Limitations**: Low - Narrow focus on ranking metrics without examining important practical considerations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct scalability testing on datasets with 10x-100x more items to evaluate computational efficiency and memory requirements
2. Perform ablation studies specifically measuring inference latency and computational overhead compared to baseline models
3. Evaluate model performance on temporal validation splits to assess stability and adaptation to changing user preferences over time
