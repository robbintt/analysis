# Thoughts without Thinking: Reconsidering the Explanatory Value of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs through Agentic Pipelines

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.00875
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00875
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CoT reasoning in agentic pipelines may hinder rather than help user understanding

## Executive Summary
This study challenges the conventional wisdom that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves explainability in large language model (LLM) agentic pipelines. Through testing with toy assembly tasks and organizational/social questions, the research reveals that CoT reasoning alone does not enhance output quality or explainability. The findings suggest that CoT explanations can actually mislead users by introducing irrelevant or erroneous content, reinforcing logical fallacies, or focusing on generic machine-related tokens rather than task-specific details.

The research employs a perceptive task guidance system to evaluate both quantitative and qualitative aspects of CoT reasoning in agentic pipelines. Human and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations show weak correlation between CoT thoughts and final answers, with non-CoT models consistently outperforming their CoT-trained counterparts. These results call into question the assumed benefits of CoT reasoning for improving user understanding in LLM applications.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates CoT reasoning's explanatory value through a perceptive task guidance system tested on toy assembly tasks and participatory organizational/social questions. Researchers conducted both quantitative evaluations comparing model performance and qualitative analysis of explanation quality. Human evaluators and LLM-as-a-Judge systems assessed output quality and explainability, with particular attention to the relationship between intermediate CoT thoughts and final answers.

## Key Results
- Non-CoT models outperformed CoT-trained counterparts in quantitative evaluations
- Human and LLM-as-a-Judge scores showed weak correlation between CoT thoughts and final answers
- CoT explanations often misled by introducing irrelevant content, reinforcing logical fallacies, or focusing on generic tokens

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that CoT reasoning in agentic pipelines fails to improve explainability because the intermediate reasoning steps frequently introduce noise rather than clarity. The mechanism appears to involve CoT explanations creating cognitive load through irrelevant or erroneous content, while simultaneously failing to connect meaningfully to the final answer. This disconnect undermines the presumed transparency benefits of showing intermediate reasoning steps.

## Foundational Learning

**LLM Agentic Pipelines**: Systems where LLMs make autonomous decisions through sequential reasoning steps. Needed because CoT is typically implemented within these pipeline architectures. Quick check: Identify where CoT reasoning is inserted in the pipeline flow.

**Explainability Metrics**: Methods for measuring how well model reasoning can be understood by humans. Critical because the study evaluates whether CoT actually improves this metric. Quick check: Compare human evaluation scores with and without CoT explanations.

**CoT Reasoning Failure Modes**: Specific ways CoT can mislead, including irrelevant content, logical fallacies, and generic token focus. Essential for understanding why CoT doesn't help in agentic contexts. Quick check: Analyze CoT explanations for presence of these failure modes.

**Perceptive Task Guidance**: System architecture for evaluating task completion and explanation quality. Fundamental to the study's methodology. Quick check: Verify the system can accurately assess both task completion and explanation coherence.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Task Input -> Perceptive Guidance System -> LLM Model (with/without CoT) -> Output Generation -> Evaluation Layer (Human/LLM-as-Judge)

Critical Path: The evaluation process where task inputs flow through the perceptive guidance system to generate outputs, which are then assessed for both task completion quality and explanation clarity. The critical insight is that CoT reasoning adds intermediate steps that may degrade rather than enhance this evaluation.

Design Tradeoffs: The study highlights a fundamental tradeoff between showing intermediate reasoning (potentially improving transparency) versus the risk of introducing misleading or irrelevant content. The architecture must balance these competing concerns.

Failure Signatures: CoT explanations that contain logical fallacies, focus on generic machine tokens, or introduce irrelevant content represent clear failure modes that degrade user understanding rather than enhance it.

First Experiments:
1. Replicate the toy assembly task evaluation with controlled variations in CoT implementation
2. Conduct parallel evaluations using mathematical reasoning tasks to test domain generalizability
3. Perform ablation studies removing specific CoT failure modes to isolate their individual impacts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Tested only on narrow task sets (toy assembly and organizational/social questions) limiting generalizability
- Sample size for qualitative analysis not specified, affecting statistical confidence
- Human evaluation methodology not detailed, raising concerns about evaluator bias

## Confidence
- CoT reasoning doesn't enhance explainability: Medium (limited task scope, unclear model specifications)
- Non-CoT models outperform CoT models quantitatively: Medium (metrics not fully described)
- CoT explanations often mislead users: Low (unclear sample size and evaluation methodology)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate across diverse task domains (mathematical reasoning, code generation, medical diagnosis) to test generalizability
2. Conduct controlled experiment comparing identical model architectures with and without CoT training, ensuring equal parameter counts and training data exposure
3. Perform ablation studies isolating specific CoT failure modes (irrelevant content, logical fallacies, generic tokens) to determine which aspects most harm explainability
