# MoLAN: A Unified Modality-Aware Noise Dynamic Editing Framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.09145
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09145
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: MoLAN improves MSA performance across five models and four datasets through block-level noise suppression

## Executive Summary
MoLAN addresses noise interference in multimodal sentiment analysis by introducing a modality-aware noise dynamic editing framework. The approach partitions each modality into blocks and assigns distinct denoising strengths based on noise levels and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while preserving essential information. Experiments demonstrate that MoLAN improves performance over baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results when integrated into MoLAN+. The framework is flexible and applicable to diverse MSA models and MLLMs.

## Method Summary
MoLAN implements a three-stage pipeline: (1) block partitioning of visual features into 2D blocks and audio features into 1D blocks based on dimensional factors closest to the square root, (2) denoising strength computation using normalized cosine similarity between each block and text features, and (3) noise editing where features are scaled by their denoising strength values. The framework integrates with MSA models through noise-suppressed cross-attention (injecting binary masks derived from denoising strength into attention logits) and denoising-driven contrastive learning (minimizing distance between denoised and original features while maximizing distance to unrelated samples).

## Key Results
- MoLAN consistently improves performance across five MSA models and four datasets compared to baselines
- MoLAN+ achieves state-of-the-art results when integrated with existing MSA architectures
- Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of dynamic editing, modality-aware block partitioning, noise-suppressed cross attention, and denoising-driven contrastive learning
- Performance peaks at denoising strength threshold θ=0.5, with over-denoising at θ=0.8 and under-denoising at θ=0.3

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Block-level partitioning enables fine-grained noise suppression that preserves semantic information better than whole-modality denoising. The framework partitions visual features into 2D blocks (matching spatial information distribution) and audio features into 1D blocks (matching temporal continuity). Each block receives a distinct denoising strength based on its computed noise level, allowing high-noise regions to be aggressively filtered while semantically relevant regions retain information. Core assumption: Noise distributes unevenly within modalities, and appropriate block granularity can localize noise without fragmenting semantic units.

### Mechanism 2
Using text modality as the reference signal for computing denoising strength yields more reliable noise suppression than audio or visual guidance. Denoising strength σ(B, X_t) is computed as normalized cosine similarity between each block and the text representation. Pilot studies show text performance degrades monotonically with masking while audio/visual show fluctuating improvements—indicating text contains less noise and serves as a stable reference. Core assumption: Text modality in MSA datasets is inherently higher-quality (less noisy) than audio/visual modalities.

### Mechanism 3
Denoising-driven contrastive learning improves feature discriminability by explicitly separating denoised representations from noisy originals in embedding space. The contrastive loss minimizes distance between denoised features and their corresponding originals while maximizing distance to other samples. Alignment and uniformity metrics show improved clustering of positive pairs and better separation of negative pairs after adding DC. Core assumption: Denoised features should be semantically close to their original modalities but distinguishable from unrelated samples.

## Foundational Learning

- **Cross-modal attention mechanisms**: Why needed here: MoLAN+ modifies standard cross-attention by injecting noise-suppression masks derived from denoising strength scores. Quick check: Can you explain how adding a mask term M̃ to the attention logits changes which key-value pairs receive high attention weights?

- **Contrastive learning objectives (InfoNCE-style)**: Why needed here: The denoising-driven contrastive loss uses the standard InfoNCE formulation to pull denoised-original pairs together and push apart non-matching pairs. Quick check: What happens to gradient magnitude when the temperature parameter τ is too large vs. too small?

- **Feature blocking/patching strategies**: Why needed here: Understanding why 2D blocking suits visual (spatial) and 1D blocking suits audio (temporal) is essential for adapting MoLAN to new modalities. Quick check: If you applied 1D blocking to visual features, what semantic structures might be fragmented?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input encoders (text/visual/audio) → MoLAN framework (block partitioning → denoising strength computation → noise editing) → Noise-suppressed cross-attention (mask-injected attention) → Self-attention → Fusion + prediction head. Auxiliary: Denoising-driven contrastive learning branch (operates on encoder outputs)

- **Critical path**: 1) Block partitioning parameters (k*, j*) determine granularity—incorrect values cause over-segmentation or noise leakage. 2) Denoising strength σ directly scales feature values—if similarity computation is miscalibrated, entire modality signals collapse. 3) Threshold θ (default 0.5) controls mask binarization—too aggressive suppresses signal, too lenient retains noise.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Block size vs. semantic coherence: Smaller blocks enable finer noise localization but risk fragmenting meaningful patterns. Threshold θ: Higher values increase noise suppression but may remove task-relevant features (Figure 4 shows performance peaks at 0.5). Contrastive weight: Not explicitly tuned in paper; default weighting in Eq. 16 may need adjustment for different noise levels.

- **Failure signatures**: MAE increases, correlation decreases: Over-denoising (θ too high or σ miscalibrated). Performance identical to baseline: MoLAN not receiving gradients (check contrastive loss is active). Large variance across seeds: Block partitioning may be unstable for non-square feature dimensions.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Sanity check: Run MulT+MoLAN on CMU-MOSI with default parameters; verify ACC2 improvement matches Table 1 (~77.94→81.04). 2) Ablation sweep: Remove dynamic editing (use uniform σ), confirm performance drops to w/o DE levels (~78.25 on MOSI). 3) Threshold calibration: Sweep θ ∈ {0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7} on validation set; verify peak near 0.5 per Figure 4.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions including systematic evaluations under more challenging settings such as cross-domain generative tasks or more complex real-world scenarios, robustness when the text modality is highly noisy or unreliable, and whether the fixed "square root factor" block partitioning strategy is universally optimal for varying input resolutions.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes text modality is less noisy than audio/visual, which may not generalize to domains with poor transcripts
- Block partitioning strategy assumes uniform noise distribution within modalities, potentially failing when noise clusters in semantic regions
- Denoising strength computation via cosine similarity with text is not validated against direct noise metrics (SNR, entropy)

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Block-level noise suppression improves performance over uniform denoising (validated by ablation in Table 3 and Figure 4)
- **Medium confidence**: Text-guided denoising strength computation reliably identifies noisy blocks (pilot masking study supports this, but lacks corpus validation)
- **Medium confidence**: Contrastive learning improves feature discriminability (alignment/uniformity metrics show improvement, but impact on end-task performance is modest)

## Next Checks
1. **Noise Quality Validation**: Run MoLAN with visual/audio as the reference modality instead of text on a dataset with known transcript quality variations; compare performance degradation patterns.
2. **Block Granularity Sensitivity**: Systematically vary block sizes (k*, j*) across {2,4,8,16} for both modalities on MOSI; measure trade-off between MAE improvement and semantic coherence loss.
3. **Contrastive Learning Ablation**: Remove denoising-driven contrastive loss from MoLAN+; verify that alignment/uniformity improvements directly translate to performance gains rather than being spurious optimization artifacts.
