# Real-Time System for Audio-Visual Target Speech Enhancement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20741
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20741
- Reference count: 23
- RAVEN is the first publicly available real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system running entirely on CPU hardware

## Executive Summary
This paper presents RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual target speech enhancement system designed to extract clean speech from complex acoustic environments. The system operates with 120ms algorithmic latency and runs entirely on CPU hardware, making it accessible without specialized GPU equipment. RAVEN uses a mask-based late-fusion architecture that combines visual embeddings from a pretrained visual speech recognition model with audio features to generate magnitude masks for speech enhancement. The demonstration allows users to experience live audio-visual speech enhancement through a microphone and webcam setup, enabling testing in various interference conditions including clapping and singing.

## Method Summary
RAVEN employs a mask-based late-fusion architecture where visual embeddings extracted from a pretrained visual speech recognition model (VSRiW) are combined with audio features through a CNN-LSTM network. The system processes audio-visual inputs in real-time using Python with PyAudio and OpenCV libraries. The algorithmic pipeline operates with 120ms latency (3 frames at 25 fps) and runs entirely on CPU hardware, achieving real-time performance without GPU acceleration. The demonstration setup uses microphone and webcam inputs to capture target speech in the presence of environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and singing voices.

## Key Results
- First publicly available real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system running entirely on CPU hardware
- Operates with 120ms algorithmic latency (3 frames at 25 fps)
- Successfully demonstrates speech enhancement in the presence of environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and singing voices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RAVEN leverages the complementary nature of audio and visual speech information to enhance target speech extraction. The visual modality provides spatial and speaker-specific cues that help the system distinguish the target speaker from background noise and interfering sources. By using a mask-based approach, the system can selectively preserve target speech components while suppressing unwanted interference. The late-fusion architecture allows for flexible combination of audio and visual features, enabling the CNN-LSTM network to learn complex relationships between the modalities for optimal speech enhancement.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mask-based speech enhancement**: Used to selectively preserve target speech components while suppressing interference - Quick check: Verify mask generation produces values between 0 and 1 for magnitude scaling
- **Visual speech recognition (VSRiW)**: Provides speaker-specific visual embeddings that complement audio features - Quick check: Confirm visual embeddings capture lip movements and facial expressions
- **Late-fusion architecture**: Combines audio and visual features at a higher level rather than early integration - Quick check: Evaluate performance impact of fusion timing
- **CNN-LSTM networks**: Processes temporal audio-visual patterns for speech enhancement - Quick check: Validate network captures both spatial and temporal dependencies
- **Real-time processing constraints**: Requires efficient algorithms to maintain low latency on CPU hardware - Quick check: Measure actual processing latency under different load conditions
- **Audio-visual synchronization**: Ensures temporal alignment between audio and visual streams - Quick check: Verify synchronization accuracy at 25 fps frame rate

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Microphone/Webcam -> Audio Preprocessing -> Visual Preprocessing -> VSRiW Model -> Audio-Visual Fusion -> CNN-LSTM Network -> Mask Generation -> Speech Enhancement
- **Critical Path**: The audio-visual fusion and CNN-LSTM network processing represents the most computationally intensive portion of the pipeline, directly affecting real-time performance
- **Design Tradeoffs**: CPU-only implementation prioritizes accessibility over potential performance gains from GPU acceleration, accepting 120ms latency as a reasonable tradeoff for real-time operation
- **Failure Signatures**: System performance degrades significantly when visual input is poor (low lighting, occlusions) or when multiple speakers are active simultaneously
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test speech enhancement performance with clean visual input under varying noise conditions
  2. Evaluate system latency and real-time capability with different hardware configurations
  3. Assess performance degradation when visual input quality is reduced through simulated occlusions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Designed for single active speaker scenarios only, not suitable for multiple simultaneous speakers
- Heavy reliance on clear visual input from target speaker limits performance in poor lighting or with occlusions
- Real-time CPU-only implementation may limit scalability compared to GPU-accelerated alternatives

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Technical architecture description and real-time implementation details are well-documented
- Medium Confidence: Performance claims in various interference conditions based on limited demonstration setup
- Medium Confidence: "First publicly available" claim requires broader literature verification

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic evaluation of RAVEN's performance across different types of environmental noise and interference levels
2. Test the system's behavior in controlled multi-speaker environments to characterize limitations and failure modes
3. Benchmark RAVEN's performance against GPU-accelerated audio-visual speech enhancement systems to quantify tradeoffs
