# Quantifying Epistemic Predictive Uncertainty in Conformal Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01667
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01667
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes using Maximum Mean Imprecision (MMI) to quantify epistemic predictive uncertainty in conformal prediction by measuring conflicting information within induced credal sets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of quantifying epistemic predictive uncertainty (EPU) within the conformal prediction framework. EPU arises when multiple plausible predictive models exist, making predictions difficult. While the size of the conformal prediction region (CPR) is often used as a proxy for uncertainty, it does not directly measure the uncertainty encountered during the prediction process itself.

The authors leverage recent connections between conformal prediction and imprecise probabilities, showing that under a mild assumption, any split conformal prediction procedure implicitly induces a credal set of predictive distributions. They propose using the Maximum Mean Imprecision (MMI) to quantify EPU by measuring the degree of conflicting information within the induced credal set. This approach, called MMI-CP, provides a principled way to assess EPU beyond relying solely on CPR size.

## Method Summary
The proposed method, MMI-CP, quantifies epistemic predictive uncertainty by leveraging the connection between conformal prediction and imprecise probabilities. Under a mild assumption, split conformal prediction procedures implicitly induce a credal set of predictive distributions. The authors use Maximum Mean Imprecision (MMI) as a measure of epistemic uncertainty, which quantifies the degree of conflicting information within the induced credal set. MMI-CP provides a principled approach to assess EPU beyond relying solely on CPR size, offering more informative and fine-grained uncertainty assessments.

## Key Results
- MMI-CP provides more informative and fine-grained uncertainty assessments than CPR size alone
- The method consistently outperforms CPR size-based approaches, especially in lower-class problems
- Fundamental limitations for quantifying EPU in conformal regression are identified, attributed to intrinsic properties of standard conformal regression

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the theoretical connection between conformal prediction and imprecise probabilities. Under a mild assumption, split conformal prediction procedures implicitly induce a credal set of predictive distributions. The Maximum Mean Imprecision (MMI) quantifies the degree of conflicting information within this credal set, providing a principled measure of epistemic uncertainty. This approach captures the inherent uncertainty in the prediction process itself, rather than just the size of the prediction region.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal Prediction**: A framework for uncertainty quantification that provides prediction regions with guaranteed coverage. Why needed: Forms the basis for the uncertainty quantification approach.
- **Imprecise Probabilities**: A framework for representing uncertainty when precise probabilities are not available or appropriate. Why needed: Enables the construction of credal sets from conformal prediction procedures.
- **Credal Sets**: Sets of probability distributions representing epistemic uncertainty. Why needed: Provide a mathematical structure for representing multiple plausible predictive models.
- **Maximum Mean Imprecision (MMI)**: A measure of the degree of conflicting information within a credal set. Why needed: Quantifies the epistemic uncertainty in the prediction process.
- **Split Conformal Prediction**: A specific conformal prediction procedure that splits data into training and calibration sets. Why needed: The mild assumption required for credal set construction holds for this procedure.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Data -> Split Conformal Prediction -> Induced Credal Set -> Maximum Mean Imprecision Calculation -> Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification

Critical Path:
1. Data preparation and splitting
2. Split conformal prediction procedure execution
3. Credal set construction from conformal prediction outputs
4. MMI calculation on the credal set
5. EPU quantification and interpretation

Design Tradeoffs:
- MMI-CP vs. CPR size-based uncertainty quantification: MMI-CP provides more fine-grained uncertainty assessments but requires additional computational overhead.
- Split conformal prediction restriction: Ensures the mild assumption holds but limits applicability to other conformal methods.
- Kernel selection for MMI calculation: Impacts the sensitivity and specificity of uncertainty quantification.

Failure Signatures:
- High MMI values with low prediction accuracy: Indicates significant epistemic uncertainty in the model.
- MMI values not correlating with prediction difficulty: Suggests limitations in the MMI measure or its application.
- Computational overhead becoming prohibitive: Indicates scalability issues for large datasets or complex models.

Three First Experiments:
1. Compare MMI-CP with CPR size-based uncertainty quantification on a synthetic dataset with known epistemic uncertainty.
2. Evaluate MMI-CP's performance on a real-world dataset with multiple plausible predictive models.
3. Investigate the sensitivity of MMI-CP to hyperparameter choices, particularly kernel selection and threshold parameters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Restricted to split conformal prediction procedures, excluding other popular conformal methods
- The mild assumption required for credal set construction may not hold in all practical scenarios
- Computational overhead of calculating MMI could become prohibitive for very large datasets or complex models

## Confidence

High confidence:
- The theoretical connection between conformal prediction and imprecise probabilities
- The formal definition of Maximum Mean Imprecision as a measure of epistemic uncertainty

Medium confidence:
- The empirical superiority of MMI-CP over CPR size-based uncertainty quantification
- The identified fundamental limitations for quantifying EPU in conformal regression

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate MMI-CP across a broader range of real-world datasets and problem domains, including high-dimensional data and imbalanced classification tasks.

2. Conduct extensive ablation studies to assess the sensitivity of MMI-CP to hyperparameter choices, particularly the kernel selection for MMI calculation and the threshold parameter.

3. Investigate the theoretical bounds on MMI values and their relationship to prediction accuracy and calibration, potentially establishing formal guarantees for the method's uncertainty quantification performance.
