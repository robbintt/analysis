core_contribution: This paper introduces a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for
  a learnable analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Unlike traditional
  approaches that design the AFE and backend classifiers separately, this work jointly
  optimizes the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass filter (BPF) bank
  with the neural network classifier.

# LearnAFE: Circuit-Algorithm Co-design Framework for Learnable Audio Analog Front-End

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.00755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00755
- Reference count: 40
- Jointly optimizes AFE transfer function and classifier parameters for improved audio classification efficiency

## Executive Summary
This paper presents LearnAFE, a circuit-algorithm co-design framework that jointly optimizes the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass filter bank with a neural network classifier for audio signal classification. Unlike traditional approaches that treat analog front-end design and digital classification separately, LearnAFE integrates these stages through a unified optimization process. The framework introduces a novel co-design loss function, LBPF, that combines classification accuracy with power consumption and area constraints during training. Implemented in 130nm CMOS technology, the framework demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining high classification accuracy across various signal-to-noise ratios.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a novel co-design loss function LBPF that integrates classification loss, power loss, and area loss into the training process. Bayesian optimization is used for hyperparameter tuning, while genetic algorithms guide the circuit synthesis. The joint optimization process simultaneously learns optimal transfer function parameters for an analog bandpass filter bank and the weights of a neural network classifier. The approach uses simulated S-parameters to estimate power and area metrics, which are incorporated into the loss function alongside classification accuracy. The framework is evaluated on a 10-keyword audio classification task across SNRs from 5 dB to 20 dB, demonstrating improved efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieves 90.5%-94.2% classification accuracy for 10-keyword audio classification across SNRs from 5 dB to 20 dB
- Reduces power consumption by 8.7% and capacitor area by 12.9% compared to conventional methods
- Requires only 22k classifier parameters while maintaining robust performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by breaking the traditional separation between analog front-end design and digital classification. By jointly optimizing the transfer function parameters of the bandpass filter bank with the neural network classifier parameters, the system learns an optimal signal transformation that balances classification accuracy with hardware efficiency. The LBPF loss function ensures that during training, the model considers not just how well it classifies signals, but also how efficiently the underlying analog circuitry can implement the learned transformation. This integrated approach allows the system to discover transfer functions that may not be optimal for classification alone but provide better overall system efficiency when hardware constraints are considered.

## Foundational Learning

**Bayesian Optimization**
- Why needed: Efficiently searches the high-dimensional hyperparameter space for optimal filter and classifier parameters
- Quick check: Verify convergence speed and final parameter quality against random search baselines

**Genetic Algorithms**
- Why needed: Guides the circuit synthesis process to explore different analog filter configurations
- Quick check: Compare convergence behavior and solution quality against other optimization methods

**Simulated S-parameters**
- Why needed: Provides analytical estimates of power and area without requiring full circuit simulations at each optimization step
- Quick check: Validate S-parameter predictions against post-layout simulation results

**Joint Loss Optimization**
- Why needed: Enables simultaneous optimization of accuracy, power, and area objectives
- Quick check: Monitor individual loss components during training to ensure balanced convergence

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Analog BPF Bank -> Learnable Parameters -> Neural Network Classifier -> Classification Output

**Critical Path**
Signal acquisition → Analog BPF filtering → ADC conversion → Neural network classification

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework trades some classification accuracy for significant improvements in power and area efficiency. The joint optimization may converge to transfer functions that are suboptimal for classification alone but provide better overall system efficiency when hardware constraints are considered.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor optimization convergence manifests as high classification loss with minimal improvement in power/area metrics. Local minima in the joint loss landscape can trap the optimization in solutions that are neither accurate nor efficient.

**First Experiments**
1. Train with classification loss only to establish baseline accuracy
2. Add power/area constraints incrementally to observe their impact on accuracy
3. Compare different optimization strategies (Bayesian vs. genetic) for hyperparameter tuning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to more complex audio classification tasks beyond the 10-keyword dataset remains unproven
- Scalability to different AFE topologies has not been demonstrated
- Long-term reliability and robustness under real-world environmental conditions (temperature variations, aging effects) lacks experimental validation

## Confidence

High confidence in technical methodology and LBPF loss function integration, as these are well-defined and supported by experimental results.

Medium confidence in reported power and area improvements, as these are based on simulations and post-layout analysis rather than extensive silicon measurements.

Low confidence in long-term reliability and robustness claims, which require further empirical validation under diverse operating conditions.

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on a larger, more diverse audio dataset (e.g., 100+ keywords) to evaluate scalability and performance generalization.

2. Implement the design on silicon and measure actual power consumption and area under varying temperature and voltage conditions to validate simulation results.

3. Evaluate the framework's robustness to noise types beyond AWGN, such as impulse noise or reverberation, to ensure real-world applicability.
