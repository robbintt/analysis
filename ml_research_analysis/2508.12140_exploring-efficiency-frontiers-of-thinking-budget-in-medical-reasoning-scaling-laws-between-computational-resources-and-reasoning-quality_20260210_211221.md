# Exploring Efficiency Frontiers of Thinking Budget in Medical Reasoning: Scaling Laws between Computational Resources and Reasoning Quality

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.12140
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12140
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Systematic evaluation of thinking budget mechanisms across 15 medical datasets reveals logarithmic scaling laws between computational resources and reasoning accuracy, establishing three efficiency regimes for different clinical applications.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates thinking budget mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks across 15 datasets spanning multiple specialties and difficulty levels. Using Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 model families with thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, the research establishes logarithmic scaling laws between computational resources and reasoning accuracy. Three distinct efficiency regimes emerge: high-efficiency (0-256 tokens) for real-time applications, balanced (256-512 tokens) for optimal cost-performance tradeoffs, and high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) for critical diagnostic tasks. The findings demonstrate that smaller models benefit disproportionately more from extended thinking budgets compared to larger models, suggesting a complementary relationship between model capacity and reasoning depth.

## Method Summary
The research evaluates thinking budget efficiency through systematic testing of Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 model families across 15 medical datasets representing various specialties and difficulty levels. Thinking budgets range from zero to unlimited tokens, with the truncation method proposed for DeepSeek-R1 validated against native thinking budget APIs. The study establishes logarithmic scaling relationships between computational resources and reasoning accuracy, identifying three distinct efficiency regimes based on token thresholds. Domain-specific patterns are analyzed to determine specialty-specific reasoning requirements, while comparative analysis examines how different model sizes respond to extended thinking budgets.

## Key Results
- Logarithmic scaling laws established between computational resources and reasoning accuracy across 15 medical datasets
- Three distinct efficiency regimes identified: high-efficiency (0-256 tokens), balanced (256-512 tokens), and high-accuracy (above 512 tokens)
- Smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from extended thinking (15-20% improvement) compared to larger models (5-10%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The thinking budget mechanism works by allocating computational resources to intermediate reasoning steps before generating final answers. This allocation enables models to explore multiple solution paths, verify intermediate conclusions, and correct potential reasoning errors before committing to final responses. The logarithmic scaling relationship emerges because initial tokens provide substantial accuracy gains through basic problem structuring, while subsequent tokens yield diminishing returns as models approach optimal reasoning paths. The truncation method effectively simulates native thinking budget capabilities by controlling the depth of reasoning chains, validating the generalizability of thinking budget concepts across different architectural implementations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Logarithmic scaling relationships** - Understanding why accuracy improvements follow logarithmic rather than linear patterns with increasing computational resources is crucial for predicting efficiency thresholds and optimizing resource allocation in medical reasoning tasks.
- **Efficiency regime identification** - Recognizing the three distinct regimes (high-efficiency, balanced, high-accuracy) enables practitioners to select appropriate thinking budgets based on specific clinical application requirements and cost constraints.
- **Model size complementarity** - The finding that smaller models benefit more from extended thinking budgets than larger models challenges conventional wisdom about model scaling and suggests strategic combinations of model capacity and reasoning depth.
- **Domain-specific reasoning requirements** - Different medical specialties require varying depths of reasoning, with neurology and gastroenterology needing deeper analysis than cardiovascular or respiratory medicine, informing specialty-specific deployment strategies.
- **Architecture-agnostic validation** - The consistency between truncation method and native thinking budget APIs across model families demonstrates that thinking budget concepts can be generalized beyond specific architectural implementations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Qwen3/DeepSeek-R1 models -> Thinking budget allocation -> Intermediate reasoning steps -> Final answer generation

**Critical Path:**
Token allocation → Reasoning chain development → Verification steps → Answer generation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- High-efficiency regime prioritizes speed over accuracy (0-256 tokens)
- Balanced regime optimizes cost-performance tradeoffs (256-512 tokens)
- High-accuracy regime maximizes diagnostic precision at computational cost (above 512 tokens)
- Smaller models benefit more from extended thinking but may have baseline accuracy limitations

**Failure Signatures:**
- Diminishing returns beyond optimal token thresholds
- Computational cost escalation without proportional accuracy gains
- Specialty-specific underperformance when applying generic thinking budgets
- Architecture-specific limitations in truncation method effectiveness

**First Experiments:**
1. Test thinking budget efficiency on a small subset of medical datasets to validate logarithmic scaling patterns
2. Compare truncation method performance against native thinking budget APIs on additional model families
3. Evaluate domain-specific reasoning requirements across three representative medical specialties

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on synthetic medical scenarios rather than real patient data, limiting clinical applicability
- Logarithmic scaling relationships may not generalize to other medical specialties or reasoning paradigms
- Truncation method validation lacks comprehensive error analysis across diverse model families and edge cases

## Confidence
**High confidence:** The core finding of logarithmic scaling between thinking budget and accuracy is well-supported across multiple datasets and model families.

**Medium confidence:** Comparative analysis of model size responses and domain-specific patterns shows clear trends but requires further validation.

**Low confidence:** Generalizability of truncation method and real-world clinical applicability remain uncertain without additional testing.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate thinking budget efficiency patterns on real patient case data from electronic health records to assess clinical applicability
2. Test identified scaling laws and efficiency regimes across additional medical specialties and reasoning architectures
3. Conduct comprehensive error analysis on truncation method across broader range of model families
