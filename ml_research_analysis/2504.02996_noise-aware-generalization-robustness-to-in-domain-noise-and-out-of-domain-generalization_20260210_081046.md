core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of training models that can handle
  both label noise within domains and generalize across domains (Noise-Aware Generalization,

# Noise-Aware Generalization: Robustness to In-Domain Noise and Out-of-Domain Generalization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.02996
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02996
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DL4ND achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets by leveraging cross-domain comparisons to detect and correct label noise

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of training models that can simultaneously handle label noise within domains and generalize across domains (Noise-Aware Generalization, NAG). Existing methods for domain generalization or learning with noisy labels often fail when both issues are present simultaneously, as they cannot effectively distinguish between noisy labels and samples from different domains. The authors propose DL4ND, a method that leverages cross-domain comparisons to detect label noise by exploiting the observation that noisy samples exhibit larger distances when compared across domains because they lack the invariant features of the true class. The method is integrated with domain generalization techniques and shows significant improvements on both in-domain accuracy under noise and out-of-domain generalization.

## Method Summary
DL4ND (Domain Generalization with Noisy Labels Detection) is a method that leverages cross-domain comparisons to detect and correct label noise. The key insight is that noisy samples, which may appear similar within a single domain due to spurious features, exhibit larger distances when compared across domains because they lack the invariant features of the true class. DL4ND uses low-loss samples as proxies for comparison and relabels high-loss samples based on cross-domain distances. The method is integrated with domain generalization techniques and evaluated on both real-world datasets (VLCS, CHAMMI-CP) and synthetic noisy datasets, showing significant improvements in both in-domain accuracy under noise and out-of-domain generalization.

## Key Results
- DL4ND outperforms naive combinations of existing domain generalization and noise handling methods
- Significant improvements on synthetic noise benchmarks across multiple noise rates and datasets
- Strong performance on real-world noisy datasets (CHAMMI-CP) when integrated with domain generalization techniques

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DL4ND works by exploiting the fundamental difference in how noisy and clean samples behave across domains. Clean samples share domain-invariant features that remain consistent across different domains, while noisy samples lack these invariant features and instead rely on domain-specific spurious correlations. By comparing samples across domains, DL4ND can identify noisy samples based on their larger inter-domain distances. The method uses low-loss samples as reliable proxies for comparison, assuming these samples are more likely to be clean, and relabels high-loss samples based on their cross-domain distances to these proxies.

## Foundational Learning
- **Domain Generalization**: Training models to perform well on unseen target domains by leveraging multiple source domains. Needed because real-world deployment often involves data from distributions different from training data. Quick check: Model performance degrades when tested on domains not seen during training.
- **Label Noise**: The presence of incorrect labels in training data, which can severely degrade model performance. Needed because real-world datasets often contain mislabeled examples due to human error or automated labeling processes. Quick check: Training accuracy remains high even when validation/test accuracy is low.
- **Cross-Domain Distance**: A metric measuring the similarity or dissimilarity of samples across different domains. Needed for DL4ND to identify noisy samples by comparing their behavior across domains. Quick check: Clean samples show smaller cross-domain distances than noisy samples.
- **Low-Loss Proxy Selection**: Using samples with low training loss as reliable references for comparison. Needed because these samples are assumed to be more likely to have correct labels and capture true class characteristics. Quick check: Low-loss samples consistently belong to the correct class across domains.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data -> Feature Extractor -> Domain Generalization Module -> Loss Function -> Noisy Label Detection -> Relabeling Module -> Updated Labels

**Critical Path**: The core workflow involves extracting features from multi-domain data, applying domain generalization techniques, computing cross-domain distances, identifying high-loss samples as potential noise, and relabeling them based on their distances to low-loss proxy samples.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (due to cross-domain comparisons) for improved robustness to both noise and domain shifts. The reliance on low-loss samples as proxies assumes these are more likely to be clean, which may not hold in all scenarios.

**Failure Signatures**: The method may struggle when both clean and noisy samples achieve low loss due to strong spurious correlations, or when domain-invariant features are subtle and difficult to distinguish across domains.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate cross-domain distance distributions for clean vs. noisy samples on synthetic datasets with controlled noise injection
2. Test the sensitivity of proxy selection to different loss thresholds on datasets with known ground truth
3. Compare performance with and without the relabeling module on domain-shifted test sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Performance depends on the assumption that low-loss samples are reliable proxies, which may not hold when spurious correlations are strong
- Computational overhead from cross-domain comparisons may be prohibitive for very large datasets
- The method's effectiveness relies on the presence of sufficient domain diversity to compute meaningful cross-domain distances

## Confidence
- **High**: The core observation that combining domain generalization and noise handling methods does not automatically yield good performance
- **High**: Experimental results showing DL4ND's superior performance on synthetic noise benchmarks
- **Medium**: Generalizability of the cross-domain distance heuristic for noise detection across all data distributions
- **High**: Claim that DL4ND achieves robust performance across both noise levels and domain shifts based on presented results

## Next Checks
1. Test on larger-scale real-world noisy datasets with known ground truth to validate the noise detection capability independently
2. Evaluate performance on domain shift scenarios where spurious correlations are strong but invariant features are subtle
3. Analyze failure cases to understand when the low-loss proxy assumption breaks down and whether alternative proxy selection strategies could improve robustness
