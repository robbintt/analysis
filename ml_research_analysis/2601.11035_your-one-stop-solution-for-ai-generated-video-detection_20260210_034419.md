# Your One-Stop Solution for AI-Generated Video Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.11035
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11035
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces AIGVDBench, a large-scale benchmark for AI-generated video detection with over 440,000 videos from 31 state-of-the-art generation models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents AIGVDBench, a comprehensive benchmark addressing critical limitations in existing AI-generated video detection datasets. The benchmark overcomes issues of outdated models, limited scale, and insufficient diversity by incorporating 31 state-of-the-art generation models, including both open-source and closed-source approaches. The authors establish a standardized pipeline ensuring representativeness through attribute-balancing and comprehensive model selection, while maintaining replicability through alignment with public benchmarks and strict quality control. AIGVDBench comprises over 440,000 videos covering text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video tasks, providing a robust foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a standardized pipeline for constructing AIGVDBench that ensures representativeness through attribute-balancing and comprehensive model selection while guaranteeing replicability via alignment with public benchmarks and strict quality control. The benchmark includes over 440,000 videos from 31 state-of-the-art generation models, with 20,000 videos per open-source model and 2,000 per closed-source model simulated under real-world conditions. The dataset covers text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video tasks, enabling comprehensive evaluation of detection methodologies. The paper evaluates 33 existing detectors across more than 1,500 evaluations, providing empirical evidence for the benchmark's effectiveness in advancing AI-generated video detection capabilities.

## Key Results
- AIGVDBench comprises over 440,000 videos from 31 state-of-the-art generation models, including 20 open-source and 11 closed-source approaches
- The benchmark evaluates 33 existing detectors across more than 1,500 evaluations, revealing that AI-generated video detection remains challenging across all four detection paradigms
- The study identifies that improvements in video generation model quality do not ensure reduced detectability or better detector generalization
- Eight in-depth analyses uncover novel findings about the relationships between generation quality, detectability, and detector performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None provided in the source material.

## Foundational Learning

**Video Generation Models**
- Why needed: Understanding the diversity of generation approaches is crucial for creating representative detection benchmarks
- Quick check: Verify that the benchmark includes models from all major categories (text-to-video, image-to-video, video-to-video)

**Detection Paradigms**
- Why needed: Different detection approaches have varying strengths and weaknesses across generation methods
- Quick check: Ensure the benchmark evaluates all four detection paradigms comprehensively

**Quality Control in Dataset Construction**
- Why needed: Maintaining high data quality while ensuring diversity is essential for benchmark validity
- Quick check: Confirm that the strict quality control process doesn't exclude relevant edge cases

**Attribute-Balancing**
- Why needed: Balanced representation of video attributes ensures fair evaluation across detection methods
- Quick check: Verify that the attribute-balancing process covers resolution, duration, and content diversity

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
AIGVDBench Construction -> Quality Control -> Detection Evaluation -> Analysis Pipeline

**Critical Path**
Generation Model Selection → Video Generation (with attribute-balancing) → Quality Control → Detector Evaluation → Analysis

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Scale vs. Quality: Large dataset size required compromising on perfect quality control in some edge cases
- Diversity vs. Representativeness: Including all model types while maintaining balanced representation of attributes
- Open vs. Closed Source: Different sampling strategies needed for open-source (20,000 samples) versus closed-source models (2,000 samples)

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor generalization to unseen models due to dataset composition bias
- Performance degradation when detection conditions deviate from simulated real-world scenarios
- Inconsistent detection accuracy across different video generation paradigms

**3 First Experiments**
1. Evaluate detector performance across different generation paradigms to identify which approaches are most challenging
2. Test generalization by evaluating detectors on subsets of the dataset with progressively different generation parameters
3. Analyze detection performance as a function of video attributes to identify which factors most influence detectability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations

- Simulated conditions for closed-source models may not perfectly reflect real-world generation scenarios, potentially affecting detection generalizability
- Heavy bias toward open-source models (20 models with 20,000 videos each versus 11 closed-source models with 2,000 videos each) could introduce systematic bias in detection performance
- Strict quality control process may inadvertently exclude edge cases that are relevant for real-world detection scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Benchmark construction methodology and comprehensive coverage of 31 generation models are well-documented and reproducible
- Evaluation of 33 existing detectors across more than 1,500 evaluations provides robust empirical evidence

**Medium Confidence:**
- Claim that improvements in video generation quality do not ensure reduced detectability requires careful interpretation
- Relationship between generation quality and detectability may vary across different detection paradigms and model types

**Low Confidence:**
- Assertion about detector generalization across all four detection paradigms needs further validation
- Results translation to completely unseen generation models and real-world adversarial conditions remains uncertain

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the benchmark's detector performance on independently collected real-world AI-generated video samples to verify generalization claims beyond controlled dataset conditions

2. **Temporal robustness analysis**: Evaluate detector performance on videos generated by newer models not included in the benchmark, particularly those released after the dataset collection period, to assess predictive value for future detection capabilities

3. **Attribute importance validation**: Conduct ablation studies to determine which specific video attributes (e.g., resolution, duration, generation parameters) most significantly impact detection performance, helping to identify potential blind spots in benchmark design
