# How Data Quality Affects Machine Learning Models for Credit Risk Assessment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.10964
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10964
- **Reference count**: 19
- **Primary result**: ML model performance varies significantly under different types of data corruption, with some models showing unexpected resilience or even improved performance under specific noise conditions.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically investigates how data quality issues impact machine learning model performance in credit risk assessment. Using a credit risk dataset, the research introduces controlled corruption across five dimensions: duplicates, noise, outliers, missing values, and label errors, utilizing the PuckTrick library. Ten common ML models are evaluated on both clean and corrupted training data. The findings reveal surprising variations in model robustness, with some models performing better under certain types of noise while others degrade significantly. This work provides practical insights for building more resilient credit risk models in real-world settings where data quality is often imperfect.

## Method Summary
The study employs a controlled experimental approach using the PuckTrick library to systematically introduce data corruption across five dimensions (duplicates, noise, outliers, missing values, and label errors) into a credit risk dataset. Ten common ML models are evaluated on both clean and corrupted training data to measure performance degradation or improvement. The experimental design allows for precise measurement of how different types and severities of data quality issues affect model performance, providing a comprehensive analysis of model robustness across various data corruption scenarios.

## Key Results
- Model robustness varies significantly with both the type and severity of data imperfections
- Some models showed improved performance under specific types of noise, contrary to expectations
- Performance degradation patterns differ markedly across the five corruption dimensions
- The findings offer practical insights for practitioners to build more resilient credit risk models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's controlled approach to introducing data corruption allows for precise measurement of how different types of data quality issues affect model performance. By systematically varying corruption types and severities, the research isolates specific mechanisms through which data quality impacts learning algorithms. The use of standardized corruption methods through the PuckTrick library ensures reproducibility and comparability across experiments, while the evaluation of multiple model types reveals differential vulnerabilities and resiliencies to various data imperfections.

## Foundational Learning
- **Data corruption types** (duplicates, noise, outliers, missing values, label errors): Understanding these five corruption dimensions is essential for identifying and mitigating data quality issues in ML pipelines
- **Model robustness assessment**: The systematic evaluation framework provides a methodology for testing how different ML algorithms respond to imperfect data
- **Credit risk modeling context**: The domain-specific application highlights the practical implications of data quality on financial decision-making systems
- **Controlled experimentation**: The use of PuckTrick for standardized corruption demonstrates a reproducible approach to testing ML robustness
- **Performance metric selection**: Understanding which metrics are most sensitive to different types of data corruption helps prioritize quality improvements
- **Generalization limitations**: The study highlights the importance of testing findings across multiple datasets and contexts

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
PuckTrick library -> Data corruption pipeline -> ML model training -> Performance evaluation

**Critical path:**
1. Load clean credit risk dataset
2. Apply controlled corruption using PuckTrick
3. Train ten ML models on corrupted data
4. Evaluate model performance metrics
5. Compare results against clean data baseline

**Design tradeoffs:**
The study prioritizes methodological rigor and controlled experimentation over ecological validity. By using synthetic corruption rather than real-world data quality issues, the research sacrifices some realism for the ability to precisely measure and compare effects across different corruption types and severities.

**Failure signatures:**
- Unexpected performance improvements with certain noise types
- Significant degradation for some models under specific corruption scenarios
- Non-linear relationships between corruption severity and performance impact
- Dataset-specific effects that may not generalize to other credit risk contexts

**First experiments:**
1. Replicate the baseline experiment using the same credit risk dataset to verify the reported findings
2. Test a single model type (e.g., Random Forest) with one corruption type (e.g., noise) at varying severity levels
3. Compare model performance on clean data versus data with only duplicate records removed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Findings are based on a single credit risk dataset and may not generalize to other financial contexts
- Controlled corruption methods may not capture the complex, unstructured nature of real-world data quality issues
- The study does not address potential fairness implications of using corrupted data in credit risk assessment
- Computational resource requirements for extensive experiments may limit reproducibility

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Methodological framework for introducing and measuring data corruption effects

**Medium confidence:**
- Generalizability of results to other credit risk datasets and contexts
- Specific findings about individual model performance under different corruption types

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study using multiple credit risk datasets from different financial institutions to test the generalizability of findings
2. Conduct a longitudinal study to assess how data corruption effects evolve over time as models are updated with new data
3. Extend the analysis to include fairness metrics and bias detection to understand the potential discriminatory effects of using corrupted data in credit risk assessment
