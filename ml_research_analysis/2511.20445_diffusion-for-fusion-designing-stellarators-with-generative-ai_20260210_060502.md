# Diffusion for Fusion: Designing Stellarators with Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20445
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Conditional diffusion model generates quasisymmetric stellarators with controlled aspect ratio and rotational transform

## Executive Summary
This work tackles the inverse problem of generating stellarator designs with desired physical properties using conditional diffusion models. The authors train a generative AI model on the QUASR dataset to rapidly generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs given target values for aspect ratio, rotational transform, field period number, and helicity. The model demonstrates solid performance in generating devices that meet target specifications within 5% deviation for key parameters, while maintaining quasisymmetry within 2.5-6% deviation. The approach establishes a foundation for AI-assisted fusion research and shows promising generalization to out-of-sample conditions.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a conditional diffusion model trained on the QUASR dataset to generate stellarator configurations. The model takes target values for aspect ratio, mean rotational transform, field period number, and helicity as conditioning inputs and generates corresponding stellarator designs. Training involves standard diffusion model techniques with noise schedule and denoising steps, adapted for the fusion physics domain. The model is evaluated both on in-sample conditions (using targets from the training data) and out-of-sample conditions (using novel target values) to assess generalization capabilities.

## Key Results
- Generated stellarators exhibit less than 5% deviation from target aspect ratio and rotational transform
- Quasisymmetry maintained within 2.5-6% deviation from target, falling short of sub-1% target
- Out-of-sample devices successfully maintain quasisymmetry, demonstrating model generalization
- Model generates designs rapidly compared to traditional optimization methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The diffusion model learns the underlying distribution of stellarator configurations that satisfy physical constraints through iterative denoising. By conditioning on target parameters, the model can navigate the design space efficiently to find configurations that meet specified criteria. The QUASR dataset provides sufficient diversity in stellarator designs to learn meaningful representations of the design manifold, enabling the model to generalize to novel conditions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Stellarator physics**: Understanding of magnetic confinement fusion and quasisymmetry requirements
  - *Why needed*: Essential for interpreting physical metrics and design constraints
  - *Quick check*: Can explain why quasisymmetry matters for particle confinement

- **Diffusion models**: Knowledge of denoising diffusion probabilistic models
  - *Why needed*: Core mechanism for generating novel stellarator configurations
  - *Quick check*: Understands the forward noising and reverse denoising process

- **Conditional generation**: Principles of conditioning generative models on target parameters
  - *Why needed*: Enables control over generated stellarator properties
  - *Quick check*: Can explain how conditioning influences the generation process

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data Preprocessing -> Diffusion Model Architecture -> Training Loop -> Generation Pipeline

Critical path: QUASR dataset → Data preprocessing → Conditional diffusion model → Training → Evaluation → Generation of stellarators

Design tradeoffs: The authors balance model complexity with training efficiency, choosing a diffusion model architecture that can handle the high-dimensional stellarator representation while remaining computationally tractable. The conditioning mechanism trades off between specificity of control and model flexibility.

Failure signatures: 
- High deviation from target parameters indicates poor conditioning or insufficient training
- Loss of quasisymmetry suggests the model hasn't learned the physical constraints properly
- Mode collapse would result in repetitive or limited stellarator designs

Three first experiments:
1. Test generation with different noise schedule parameters to optimize convergence
2. Vary conditioning strength to find optimal balance between control and diversity
3. Evaluate model performance with different latent space dimensionalities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The authors identify several promising research directions including physics-informed architectures that incorporate domain knowledge directly into the model structure, multi-fidelity models that can work with both high-fidelity and approximate stellarator simulations, and improved evaluation protocols that better capture the physical performance of generated designs.

## Limitations
- Quasisymmetry deviation of 2.5-6% falls short of the desired sub-1% target
- Reliance on QUASR dataset may limit diversity of explored stellarator designs
- Evaluation protocols could benefit from more comprehensive testing scenarios

## Confidence

High confidence: Model can generate stellarators with controlled aspect ratio and rotational transform within 5% of target values

Medium confidence: Model demonstrates generalization capabilities for out-of-sample conditions, though with modest quasisymmetry deviation

Low confidence: Achieving the sub-1% quasisymmetry target based on current results

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the model on a more diverse set of stellarator configurations beyond the QUASR dataset to assess robustness

2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of different architectural choices on quasisymmetry performance

3. Compare the generated stellarators against traditional optimization methods in terms of computational efficiency and design quality
