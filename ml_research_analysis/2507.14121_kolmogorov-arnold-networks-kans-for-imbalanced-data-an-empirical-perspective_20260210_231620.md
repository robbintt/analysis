# Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) for Imbalanced Data -- An Empirical Perspective

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.14121
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14121
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Primary result**: KANs outperform MLPs on raw imbalanced data but suffer severe degradation with standard imbalance techniques

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical evaluation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for imbalanced tabular classification. The study reveals a paradoxical finding: KANs excel on raw imbalanced data (improving G-mean by 54% and F1-score by 55% over MLPs) but experience catastrophic performance degradation when standard imbalance mitigation techniques like SMOTE resampling or focal loss are applied. The research identifies fundamental architectural incompatibilities between KANs and conventional imbalance handling methods, while also documenting prohibitive computational overhead that limits practical deployment. The authors conclude that KANs are specialized tools for raw imbalanced data where resources permit, but their current incompatibility with standard preprocessing and massive computational costs restrict their broader applicability.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates KANs against MLPs across 10 KEEL tabular datasets with imbalance ratios ranging from 1:5 to 1:50. Models are tested under three conditions: raw data, SMOTE-Tomek resampling, and focal loss. KANs use learnable B-spline functions with configurable grid sizes and spline orders, while MLPs serve as baselines (though exact MLP architecture is unspecified). Performance is measured using G-mean, F1-score, balanced accuracy, and AUC. The evaluation includes statistical significance testing via pairwise t-tests to validate observed performance differences.

## Key Results
- KANs achieve 54% higher G-mean and 55% higher F1-score than MLPs on raw imbalanced data
- SMOTE resampling causes 32-39% G-mean degradation in KANs while marginally improving MLP performance
- KANs require ~1000x longer training times and significantly more memory than MLPs
- Statistical validation shows resampled KANs perform equivalently to resampled MLPs (|d| < 0.08) at 1000x higher computational cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: KANs may inherently handle raw class imbalance better than MLPs by modeling complex decision boundaries without data augmentation.
- **Mechanism**: Unlike MLPs with fixed activation functions (e.g., ReLU), KANs utilize learnable B-spline functions on edges. This allows the architecture to adapt its shape to fit minority class distributions "for free," effectively internalizing the complex boundaries that usually require resampling in MLPs.
- **Core assumption**: The flexibility of spline-based univariate functions allows the model to isolate sparse minority signals within the raw feature space without being overwhelmed by the majority class gradient.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data... effectively than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy."
  - [section]: Page 5, Section 4.2 notes this is "likely due to their adaptive activation functions that capture complex decision boundaries without explicit resampling."
  - [corpus]: "Scientific Machine Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks" supports the premise that KANs are increasingly adopted to capture local features and nonlinearities MLPs miss.
- **Break condition**: If the dataset is extremely high-dimensional or the minority class is represented by too few instances to define a spline curve (data sparsity).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Conventional resampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE) appear to degrade KAN performance by disrupting the topological structure required for univariate decomposition.
- **Mechanism**: KANs rely on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem to decompose functions along stable input dimensions. Resampling modifies the data manifold (topology) artificially; this "conflicts" with the KAN's mathematical structure, potentially introducing noise into the spline optimization process.
- **Core assumption**: The optimization of B-splines assumes a consistent underlying function distribution, which synthetic oversampling violates, leading to the observed "performance erosion."
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical structure as resampling... significantly degrade KANs performance."
  - [section]: Page 6, Section 4.2 states resampling "actively conflicts with KANs mathematical structure... disrupting their univariate function learning."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers focus on efficiency/architecture rather than imbalanced learning failure modes.
- **Break condition**: If a KAN-specific augmentation technique is developed that respects the spline domain constraints (currently an identified research gap).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The computational cost of KANs scales non-linearly with data complexity, creating a massive resource-to-performance gap compared to MLPs.
- **Mechanism**: Optimizing the control points of B-splines (the learnable functions) is computationally heavier than the matrix multiplications in MLPs. The paper notes this overhead does not result in proportional accuracy gains when imbalance mitigation is applied.
- **Core assumption**: The implementation of B-spline evaluation and differentiation creates a bottleneck in the training loop that standard backpropagation through linear weights avoids.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "KANs incur severe computational costs—orders of magnitude higher training times and memory."
  - [section]: Page 5, Figure 4 shows KANs occupy a "low-efficiency quadrant," demanding ~1000x longer training times.
  - [corpus]: "PRKAN: Parameter-Reduced Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks" explicitly validates this mechanism by proposing methods to reduce the parameter count and computational burden.
- **Break condition**: If hardware-aware implementations or efficient-spline approximations (like PRKAN) are utilized.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - **Why needed here**: This is the theoretical justifications for the architecture. It posits that any multivariate continuous function is a composition of univariate functions. Understanding this explains *why* the network uses learnable edges (functions) rather than fixed nodes.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why a multivariate function decomposition allows for replacing fixed activation functions with learnable splines?

- **Concept**: **B-Splines (Basis Splines)**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper identifies B-splines as the specific implementation for the learnable functions to avoid the "Runge Phenomenon" (oscillations) seen in high-degree polynomials. Understanding this is key to tuning the `Grid` size hyperparameter.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the trade-off between increasing the grid size (G) versus the spline order (k) in terms of approximation smoothness vs. overfitting?

- **Concept**: **Imbalanced Metrics (G-Mean & F1)**
  - **Why needed here**: Standard accuracy fails here. The paper relies on G-Mean (geometric mean of sensitivity/specificity) to prove KANs beat MLPs on raw data. You must understand why G-Mean penalizes a model that ignores the minority class.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does G-Mean provide a "stricter measure of balance" than Balanced Accuracy when evaluating minority class performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Layer -> KAN Layer (Learnable B-Spline Functions on edges) -> Aggregation Nodes (sum incoming spline outputs) -> Output (logits)
- **Critical path**:
  1.  **Data Prep**: Use **Raw Data**. Do *not* apply SMOTE or resampling (per paper findings).
  2.  **Model Init**: Configure KAN with `[width]` (e.g., [7]), `grid` (e.g., 5), and `k` (spline order).
  3.  **Training**: Expect high latency; monitor for memory blowout on CPU.
  4.  **Eval**: strictly use F1 and G-Mean to validate minority class learning.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Raw Performance vs. Cost**: KANs win on raw accuracy/G-mean but lose heavily on training time (1000x slower) and memory.
  - **Resampling vs. Architecture**: Resampling helps MLPs but *hurts* KANs. You trade preprocessing simplicity (KAN needs none) for computational complexity.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Performance Collapse**: G-Mean drops significantly after applying SMOTE or Focal Loss (conflicts with spline learning).
  - **Resource Exhaustion**: Training times exceeding 500s on small datasets (orders of magnitude slower than MLP baseline).
  - **Statistical Parity**: Resampled KAN performs identically to Resampled MLP (|d| < 0.08) but at 1000x the cost.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1.  **Baseline Sanity Check**: Train a KAN vs. MLP on raw, imbalanced data (e.g., `yeast4`) to replicate the +54% G-Main advantage.
  2.  **Resampling Ablation**: Apply SMOTE-Tomek to the same dataset and observe the degradation in KAN G-Mean (should drop ~32%).
  3.  **Resource Profiling**: Benchmark training time and memory usage for a single epoch on KAN vs. MLP to quantify the "prohibitive cost" constraint.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: What is the theoretical mechanism causing standard resampling and focal loss techniques to degrade KAN performance while benefiting MLPs?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors explicitly identify the need for "theoretical reconciling their conflict with data augmentation," hypothesizing that augmentation disrupts the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem's assumptions.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper empirically observes the performance drop (32-39% G-mean decline) but does not mathematically derive why altering data distributions disrupts the univariate function learning specific to KANs.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A formal analysis demonstrating how synthetic samples or re-weighting violate the continuity or compact domain assumptions of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can KAN-specific architectural modifications, such as sparsity constraints or attention mechanisms, be developed to handle imbalance without inducing computational inflation?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The conclusion states that future work must develop "architectural modifications that preserves KANs intrinsic imbalance handling" to replace standard techniques that currently conflict with the architecture.
- **Why unresolved**: The study only evaluated standard off-the-shelf imbalance techniques (SMOTE, focal loss) and found them incompatible; no KAN-native solutions were tested.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: The design and empirical validation of a modified KAN architecture that maintains baseline performance levels while utilizing a mechanism (like attention) to amplify minority class features.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can algorithmic optimizations, such as basis function quantization, close the computational gap between KANs and MLPs for imbalanced learning?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors list "optimizing computational efficiency" as a critical research priority, noting that "dedicated KAN compression research" is essential to mitigate the orders-of-magnitude higher training times.
- **Why unresolved**: The study quantifies the resource disparity (1000× longer training times) but does not propose or test methods to reduce the overhead of B-spline evaluations.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A study demonstrating that a quantized or hardware-optimized KAN achieves statistical performance parity with standard KANs while matching MLP resource consumption.

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to tabular datasets, limiting generalizability to other data modalities
- Unspecified MLP baseline architecture creates uncertainty about fairness of comparative claims
- Computational overhead analysis based on implementation-specific performance rather than theoretical complexity
- Does not explore hybrid approaches that might combine KAN advantages with computational efficiency

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: KANs outperform MLPs on raw imbalanced data (supported by multiple datasets and metrics)
- **Medium Confidence**: Resampling techniques degrade KAN performance (mechanism understood but not fully validated across architectures)
- **Medium Confidence**: Computational overhead is prohibitive (based on implementation-specific measurements)

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture Fairness Validation**: Implement a standardized MLP baseline with specified depth, width, and hyperparameters to verify comparative claims are architecture-fair.
2. **Computational Efficiency Benchmark**: Conduct theoretical complexity analysis of KAN vs MLP operations to validate whether implementation-specific overhead can be reduced through optimization.
3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate KAN performance on non-tabular imbalanced datasets (image, text) to assess architectural limitations beyond the current domain.
