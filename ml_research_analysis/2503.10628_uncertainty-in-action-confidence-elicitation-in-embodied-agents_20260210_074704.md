core_contribution: This paper introduces the first systematic approach to embodied
  confidence elicitation in open-ended multimodal environments, addressing the challenge
  of agents expressing uncertainty in perception and decision-making. The proposed
  framework combines Elicitation Policies (for inductive, deductive, and abductive
  reasoning) with Execution Policies (for scenario reinterpretation, action sampling,
  and hypothetical reasoning) to improve confidence calibration and failure prediction.

# Uncertainty in Action: Confidence Elicitation in Embodied Agents
arXiv ID: 2503.10628

Primary result: First systematic framework for confidence elicitation in embodied agents, improving calibration from ECalE 0.27 to 0.15 in Minecraft

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a systematic approach to confidence elicitation in embodied agents operating in open-ended multimodal environments. The framework addresses a critical gap in current embodied AI systems: the inability to express uncertainty in perception and decision-making. By combining structured reasoning methods (Elicitation Policies) with scenario exploration techniques (Execution Policies), the approach enables agents to better calibrate their confidence estimates and predict potential failures.

The proposed system is evaluated in Minecraft, demonstrating significant improvements in confidence calibration and failure prediction compared to baseline approaches. The framework's modular design allows for flexible integration of different reasoning strategies and exploration methods, making it adaptable to various embodied AI applications.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a dual-policy architecture consisting of Elicitation Policies and Execution Policies. Elicitation Policies use structured reasoning approaches including inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning methods to generate confidence estimates. Execution Policies expand the agent's action space through scenario reinterpretation, action sampling, and hypothetical reasoning. The system processes multimodal inputs through a perception module, applies the reasoning policies to generate confidence scores, and uses execution policies to explore alternative scenarios and actions. This combination enables the agent to both reason about uncertainty and actively explore ways to validate or refute its confidence estimates.

## Key Results
- Confidence calibration improved significantly, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECalE) from 0.27 to 0.15
- Failure prediction capability enhanced, increasing AUROC from 0.69 to 0.83
- Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve reasoning methods showed particular effectiveness
- Abductive reasoning remained challenging, indicating need for more sophisticated approaches
- Diminishing returns observed with excessive Execution Policy iterations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to uncertainty quantification through structured reasoning and active exploration. By explicitly modeling different types of reasoning (inductive, deductive, abductive), the system can capture various sources of uncertainty in perception and decision-making. The Execution Policies complement this by allowing the agent to actively test its confidence through scenario reinterpretation and action sampling, creating a feedback loop that improves calibration over time.

## Foundational Learning
- **Confidence Calibration**: Aligning predicted confidence with actual performance accuracy - needed to ensure reliable decision-making in uncertain environments; quick check: compare predicted vs actual success rates across confidence bins
- **Structured Reasoning Methods**: Using formal reasoning patterns (inductive, deductive, abductive) - needed to systematically explore different sources of uncertainty; quick check: verify each reasoning type produces distinct confidence patterns
- **Multimodal Perception Processing**: Integrating visual, spatial, and contextual information - needed for comprehensive environmental understanding; quick check: ensure all input modalities contribute to final confidence scores
- **Scenario Reinterpretation**: Generating alternative interpretations of current situations - needed to test confidence robustness; quick check: measure diversity of generated alternative scenarios
- **Action Sampling**: Exploring multiple possible action sequences - needed to validate confidence through empirical testing; quick check: track success rates of sampled vs planned actions
- **Hypothetical Reasoning**: Considering counterfactual scenarios - needed for abductive reasoning about potential failures; quick check: verify system can generate meaningful counterfactuals

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Perception Module -> Elicitation Policies (Inductive/Deductive/Abductive) -> Confidence Score Generation -> Execution Policies (Scenario Reinterpretation/Action Sampling/Hypothetical Reasoning) -> Action Selection -> Environment Interaction

**Critical Path:**
The most critical path runs through the Elicitation Policies to Confidence Score Generation, as these provide the foundational uncertainty estimates that guide all subsequent decision-making and exploration.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework balances computational complexity against reasoning depth. More sophisticated reasoning (especially abductive) provides better uncertainty quantification but increases computational overhead. The modular design allows selective activation of policies based on task requirements and available resources.

**Failure Signatures:**
Poor calibration manifests as systematic over/under-confidence in specific scenario types. Abductive reasoning failures typically show as inability to generate plausible alternative explanations. Execution Policy failures appear as excessive computation without performance gains.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test baseline confidence calibration without any Elicitation Policies to establish performance floor
2. Evaluate individual Elicitation Policy contributions through ablation studies
3. Measure the impact of different Execution Policy iteration limits on calibration quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding the generalizability of the approach beyond Minecraft, the optimal selection and combination of reasoning strategies, and the computational efficiency implications for real-time embodied agent applications.

## Limitations
- Current evaluation limited to Minecraft environment, raising questions about cross-domain generalizability
- Computational overhead not addressed, which could impact real-time deployment feasibility
- Abductive reasoning remains particularly challenging, suggesting need for more sophisticated approaches
- The three implemented reasoning strategies may not be optimal for all embodied AI scenarios

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The framework's general architecture and the positive impact of Elicitation and Execution Policies on calibration metrics are well-supported by the experimental results
- Medium Confidence: The generalizability of results beyond Minecraft environments and the optimal selection of reasoning strategies remain uncertain
- Medium Confidence: The computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach for real-world deployment require further investigation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-environment validation by implementing the framework in at least two additional embodied AI domains (e.g., robotics simulation environments and real-world robotic systems) to assess generalizability
2. Perform ablation studies to identify which specific components of Elicitation and Execution Policies contribute most to performance improvements, and test alternative reasoning strategies beyond the three currently implemented
3. Measure and analyze computational overhead, including inference time and resource utilization, to establish practical deployment constraints and identify optimization opportunities
