# Unified Game Moderation: Soft-Prompting and LLM-Assisted Label Transfer for Resource-Efficient Toxicity Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.06347
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06347
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieved macro F1-scores from 32.96% to 58.88% across seven languages using a unified model with soft-prompting and LLM-assisted label transfer

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of scaling real-time toxicity detection across multiple games and languages. The authors propose a soft-prompting approach to unify game-specific models into a single scalable solution, and develop an LLM-assisted label transfer framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend detection to seven additional languages. Evaluations on real game chat data demonstrate that a single model can match the performance of game-specific models while significantly reducing computational resources and maintenance overhead. The system successfully identifies an average of 50 players per game per day engaging in sanctionable behavior in production.

## Method Summary
The method combines soft-prompting with LLM-assisted label transfer to create a unified, multilingual toxicity detection system. A single XLM-RoBERTa-base model is fine-tuned with game-specific context tokens (GAME_TYPE_TOKEN) prepended to the input sequence. The model undergoes domain-adaptive pre-training on game chat data before fine-tuning. To extend beyond English, the authors use GPT-4o-mini to re-label external datasets according to their toxicity schema, retaining only samples where the LLM's binary classification agrees with original human annotations. This creates the MLSNT dataset covering seven languages. The approach prioritizes operational scalability by requiring only one model deployment while maintaining detection performance.

## Key Results
- Soft-prompting achieves 43.16% Overall Macro F1, statistically matching game-specific curriculum learning (43.35%)
- German language detection achieves the highest score at 58.88% Macro F1, surpassing the English benchmark of 45.39%
- Japanese detection shows significant challenges with only 19.07% Macro F1 due to adversarial/translated chat content
- LLM-assisted label transfer improves toxic class F1 from ~38% (unfiltered) to ~97% (agreed labels)
- Production deployment identifies an average of 50 players per game per day engaging in sanctionable behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** A single transformer model can effectively serve multiple games by conditioning on game-specific context tokens.
- **Mechanism:** The model prepends a learned `GAME_TYPE_TOKEN` (e.g., `GAME_1`, `GAME_2`) to the input sequence. This token acts as a conditioning signal, steering the model's attention mechanism to apply game-specific norms without requiring separate model instances.
- **Core assumption:** The model can disentangle game-specific features from general toxicity features within the shared parameter space.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "soft-prompting approach that enables a single model... matching the performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning"
  - [section] Table 1 shows Soft-Prompting (43.16% Overall Macro F1) statistically matching Curriculum Learning (43.35%).
  - [section] Table 2 Ablation: Token placement "Before Context" (43.16%) outperforms "Before Current Line" (41.84%).
- **Break condition:** Placing the context token immediately before the current line rather than the start of the sequence degrades performance to below baseline.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Filtering for agreement between Large Language Model (LLM) re-annotations and original human labels produces high-fidelity training data.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of fully automating labeling, the system uses GPT-4o-mini to map external datasets to proprietary toxicity definitions. It retains only samples where the LLM's binary classification agrees with the original human annotation, filtering out ambiguous or misaligned examples.
- **Core assumption:** Cases where the LLM and human annotators agree represent "clear-cut" examples that are safe to train on, while disagreements indicate noise or schema mismatch.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "LLM-assisted label transfer framework... to extend support to seven additional languages"
  - [section] Table 4: Restricting training to "Agreed Labels" improves class-wise F1 for toxic content from ~38% (unfiltered) to ~97% (agreed).
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific consensus-filtering mechanism in neighbor papers.
- **Break condition:** If the source dataset labels are low quality or the LLM prompt is misaligned with the target schema, the rejection rate may exceed 70% (e.g., HASOC dataset), making the process inefficient.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Domain-adaptive pre-training on in-game chat preserves multilingual detection performance while minimizing inference costs.
- **Mechanism:** The authors take `xlm-roberta-base` and perform continued pre-training (Masked Language Modeling) on a week of game chat data. This adapts the model's embeddings to the specific vernacular and brevity of game chat before fine-tuning on toxicity tasks.
- **Core assumption:** General multilingual pre-training (CC-100 dataset) does not fully capture the nuances of real-time, short-form game chat.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Evaluations on real game chat data... achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%"
  - [section] Table 7: `xlm-roberta-base-adapted` slightly improves Overall Macro F1 (40.96%) compared to the base version (40.71%).
  - [section] Section 3.2.5 notes the adapted model underwent pre-training until loss plateaued.
- **Break condition:** Performance degrades significantly for languages with complex scripts or adversarial inputs (e.g., Japanese Macro F1 dropped to 19.07% due to adversarial/translated chat).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Soft-Prompting / Prefix-Tuning**
  - **Why needed here:** To solve the "multi-tenancy" problem where deploying one model per game is resource-prohibitive.
  - **Quick check question:** If you remove the `GAME_TYPE_TOKEN` during inference, does the model revert to a generic average of all games or fail completely? (Answer based on paper: It performs slightly worse but remains functional, see Table 1 ** entries).

- **Concept:** **Label Transfer / Schema Alignment**
  - **Why needed here:** Toxicity definitions are subjective and change over time. You rarely find open-source data that matches your exact 2025 policy.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is "binary agreement" used as the filter rather than accepting the LLM's label as ground truth? (Answer: LLMs alone are inconsistent/low-performance on specific schemas; consensus reduces noise).

- **Concept:** **Macro vs. Weighted F1-Score**
  - **Why needed here:** Game chat is heavily imbalanced (mostly non-toxic). The paper relies on Macro F1 to prove the model actually catches the rare toxic events rather than just guessing "non-toxic" for high accuracy.
  - **Quick check question:** A model achieves 99% accuracy but 0% Macro F1. What is it doing? (Answer: Predicting the majority class for everything).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - **Input:** Raw Chat + `GAME_TYPE_TOKEN` (Soft Prompt).
  - **Backbone:** `xlm-roberta-base-adapted` (Domain-adapted Transformer).
  - **Training Data Generator:** External Dataset -> GPT-4o-mini (Re-labeler) -> Agreement Filter -> MLSNT Dataset.
  - **Head:** Classification layer for Toxic/Non-Toxic + Categories.

- **Critical path:** The definition of the "System Prompt" (Figure 2) is the dependency bottleneck. If the prompt used for Label Transfer does not perfectly match the evaluation criteria, the "Agreed Labels" will be invalid.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Scalability vs. Precision:** Soft-prompting was chosen over Curriculum Learning. While Curriculum Learning had a marginally higher ceiling (43.35% vs 43.16%), Soft-prompting requires only one training run and one model deployment, offering better operational scalability.
  - **Data Volume vs. Quality:** The Label Transfer mechanism discards 10%–70% of data (Table 6) to ensure alignment. You trade training set size for label reliability.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High Weighted F1, Low Macro F1:** Indicates the model is biasing toward the "Non-Toxic" majority class and failing to detect minority toxic categories (common in Portuguese/Japanese results).
  - **Adversarial Collapse:** If inputs are translated or adversarial (as noted in Japanese chat), the model fails to generalize (Macro F1 < 20%).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Token Position Ablation:** Verify that prepending the context token *before* the chat history yields higher scores than prepending it before the current line (confirms Table 2).
  2. **Agreement Threshold Analysis:** Run the label transfer pipeline on a small validation set and measure the "discard rate." If >60%, the source dataset may be incompatible with your definitions.
  3. **Zero-Shot Language Test:** Take the English-trained model and evaluate on German/French without MLSNT training to establish a baseline for transfer learning capability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does human moderator review of discarded cases (where original annotators and LLM labels diverge) significantly improve downstream model performance compared to using only agreed-upon labels?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Due to certain constraints, our current implementation ends here. Our planned next step would be having moderators review the discarded cases where the previous human annotators and LLM labels diverge."
- Why unresolved: The current framework only retains human-LLM agreed labels; the value of manually reviewing disagreements remains untested despite 10-70% of data being discarded across languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: A/B comparison training models on (1) agreed-only labels vs. (2) agreed labels plus human-reviewed disagreed cases, measuring macro F1 on held-out game chat data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What factors explain the dramatic cross-lingual performance variation (19.07% Japanese to 58.88% German macro F1), and can these be systematically addressed?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The human evaluation reveals substantial disparities across languages. Authors note Japanese chat "was mostly adversarial / translated from another language" and attribute variation to "linguistic divergences, cultural communication norms, platform-specific discourse patterns, and potentially divergent annotation strategies."
- Why unresolved: The paper documents the problem but does not isolate which factors drive performance gaps or test targeted interventions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying (1) training data volume per language, (2) native vs. translated content filtering, (3) language-specific annotation consistency checks, measuring impact on macro F1.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the soft-prompting approach with GAME_TYPE_TOKENs generalize effectively to gaming genres beyond the two multiplayer games tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Our evaluation focused on two popular Ubisoft games — representing different gaming genres with distinct player interactions — though future work could explore additional gaming genres."
- Why unresolved: Only two games were evaluated; generalization to single-player games, mobile games, VR environments, or other genres remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training the unified model on 3-5 additional games spanning diverse genres (e.g., battle royale, MMORPG, sports, mobile) and reporting macro F1 with and without game-specific soft prompts.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the choice of LLM (GPT-4o-mini vs. alternatives) affect label transfer quality and downstream toxicity detection performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The methodology uses only GPT-4o-mini for label transfer without comparing against other LLMs or examining sensitivity to model selection.
- Why unresolved: Different LLMs may have varying cultural biases, language capabilities, and annotation agreement rates that could affect the MLSNT dataset quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Parallel label transfer using multiple LLMs (e.g., Claude, Llama, Mistral) on identical source datasets, comparing human-LLM agreement rates and downstream model F1-scores.

## Limitations

- **Dataset representativeness**: The MLSNT dataset, while the largest available multilingual toxicity corpus for game chat, is still limited to 15 sources and may not fully represent toxicity patterns across all games, cultures, and languages.
- **Generalizability of label transfer**: The LLM-assisted label transfer relies on binary agreement between GPT-4o-mini and human annotators, which may not capture nuanced cultural contexts and could miss certain toxic behaviors.
- **Operational context missing**: Production claims lack details on false positive rates, human review burden, and handling of edge cases, making real-world effectiveness uncertain.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The soft-prompting approach effectively enables a single model to serve multiple games with performance comparable to game-specific models (43.16% vs 43.35% Macro F1). The ablation study (Table 2) provides clear evidence for token placement and game-specific conditioning.
- **Medium Confidence**: The LLM-assisted label transfer improves toxicity detection performance by filtering for human-LLM agreement. While Table 4 shows strong results for agreed labels, the mechanism assumes LLMs and humans agree on "clear-cut" cases, which may not hold for culturally nuanced toxicity.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about production effectiveness and resource efficiency are based on limited operational metrics. Without details on false positive rates, human review workflows, or long-term stability, these claims remain weakly supported.

## Next Checks

1. **Zero-shot transfer validation**: Evaluate the unified model on German/French without MLSNT fine-tuning to measure baseline transfer capability and validate whether soft-prompting alone provides multilingual benefits.

2. **Agreement threshold sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the LLM-human agreement threshold (e.g., 90%, 95%, 100%) and measure the impact on training data volume and detection performance. This will reveal whether the current filtering approach is optimal or overly conservative.

3. **Adversarial robustness test**: Create a test set with translated, paraphrased, or adversarial game chat inputs (similar to the Japanese chat issue) and measure performance degradation. This will quantify the model's vulnerability to non-standard inputs and identify languages requiring additional adaptation.
