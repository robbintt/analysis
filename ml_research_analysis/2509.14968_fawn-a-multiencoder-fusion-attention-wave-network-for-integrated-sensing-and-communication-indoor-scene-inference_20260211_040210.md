# FAWN: A MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for Integrated Sensing and Communication Indoor Scene Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14968
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14968
- Authors: Carlos Barroso-Fernández; Alejandro Calvillo-Fernandez; Antonio de la Oliva; Carlos J. Bernardos
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: FAWN achieves 96% classification accuracy and sub-meter localization precision (≤0.6 m in 84% of cases) for indoor scene inference using Wi-Fi 6 and 5G NR CSI fusion

## Executive Summary
FAWN introduces a novel multi-encoder fusion-attention wave network that leverages integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities to detect and localize people and robots in indoor environments without requiring them to be network users. The system fuses channel state information from commercial Wi-Fi 6 and 5G NR deployments using a transformer-inspired architecture. Tested in a warehouse testbed, FAWN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, achieving 96% classification accuracy and sub-meter localization precision that could significantly benefit robotics and cyber-physical systems.

## Method Summary
FAWN employs a multi-encoder architecture that processes Wi-Fi and 5G CSI data through separate encoders before fusing them using attention mechanisms. The system uses transformer-inspired components including self-attention, cross-attention, and feedforward networks to capture both spatial and temporal features from wireless signals. The architecture is designed to handle the heterogeneous nature of multi-technology CSI data while maintaining robustness to environmental variations. The model is trained on synchronized Wi-Fi 6 and 5G NR channel measurements collected from a warehouse testbed containing various scenarios with people and robots moving through different locations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 96% classification accuracy for detecting and localizing people and robots
- Delivers sub-meter localization precision with 84% of cases showing ≤0.6 m error
- Outperforms state-of-the-art models by more than 9% in accuracy metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of FAWN stems from its ability to exploit complementary information from multiple wireless technologies. Wi-Fi 6 and 5G NR operate at different frequencies and have distinct propagation characteristics, which means they capture different aspects of the indoor environment. The transformer-inspired fusion architecture allows the model to learn complex relationships between these complementary data streams, enabling more robust scene inference than single-technology approaches. The multi-encoder design preserves the unique characteristics of each technology's CSI before intelligently combining them through attention mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning

Channel State Information (CSI) - Why needed: CSI captures detailed information about wireless channel properties including amplitude and phase variations. Quick check: Verify that CSI measurements are synchronized across both Wi-Fi and 5G interfaces to ensure proper fusion.

Transformer Architecture - Why needed: Transformers provide powerful attention mechanisms for learning complex relationships in sequential data. Quick check: Confirm that self-attention and cross-attention layers are properly configured to handle the multi-modal CSI inputs.

Multi-Encoder Fusion - Why needed: Separate encoders preserve technology-specific characteristics before fusion. Quick check: Validate that each encoder maintains its respective technology's unique signal properties during initial processing.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: CSI-WiFi6 -> Encoder-WiFi -> Fusion-Attention -> Classifier -> Output
                           CSI-5GNR -> Encoder-5G -> Fusion-Attention

Critical path: Data acquisition → Pre-processing → Multi-encoder processing → Cross-attention fusion → Classification/Localization → Output

Design tradeoffs: The architecture trades computational complexity for improved accuracy by using separate encoders and attention mechanisms rather than simple concatenation or averaging of CSI data.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation occurs when CSI synchronization is lost, when wireless signals are heavily attenuated by obstacles, or when the number of simultaneous targets exceeds model capacity.

First experiments: 1) Test single-technology performance to establish baseline for each wireless interface. 2) Evaluate fusion performance with varying ratios of Wi-Fi to 5G data availability. 3) Assess localization accuracy under different mobility patterns and target densities.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions for future research.

## Limitations

- Experimental validation limited to warehouse environment with controlled conditions
- Performance metrics based on specific Wi-Fi 6 and 5G NR configuration, effectiveness with other technologies unverified
- Claims of 9% improvement over state-of-the-art lack detailed statistical significance testing

## Confidence

- 96% classification accuracy: High confidence
- Sub-meter localization precision (≤0.6 m in 84% of cases): High confidence
- Outperforms state-of-the-art models by more than 9%: Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1) Test FAWN's performance across diverse indoor environments including offices, homes, and industrial facilities with varying sizes and layouts to assess generalizability.

2) Evaluate the system's robustness under dynamic conditions including multiple simultaneous targets, varying mobility patterns, and different wireless interference scenarios.

3) Conduct long-term deployment studies to assess FAWN's performance under real-world operational conditions, including varying network loads, environmental changes, and hardware aging effects.
