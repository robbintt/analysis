# Performance improvement of spatial semantic segmentation with enriched audio features and agent-based error correction for DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.21174
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21174
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: 14.7% relative improvement in CA-SDRi over baseline

## Executive Summary
This work addresses spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4) by enriching audio-tagging inputs with spectral roll-off and chroma features, and introducing an agent-based post-processing system for error correction. The approach combines mel-spectrograms with high-frequency transient information (roll-off) and harmonic characteristics (chroma) to improve event differentiation. An agent-based label correction system reduces false positives by re-evaluating separation outputs, while dataset refinement through duration filtering and manual curation enhances model robustness. These improvements yield a 14.7% relative increase in class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) compared to the baseline.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage pipeline: audio tagging followed by source separation. The tagging module uses a pretrained M2D backbone with a dual-path head that processes mel-spectrograms, spectral roll-off, and chroma features in parallel, then concatenates them for classification. The separation module uses ResUNetK, fine-tuned on a refined dataset that removes short samples and inconsistent entries while augmenting underrepresented classes. Post-processing applies an agent-based label correction system that re-classifies separated sources to identify and remove false positives. An ensemble of four model variants (baseline, roll-off, chroma, combined) is used for final predictions with specified weights.

## Key Results
- 14.7% relative improvement in CA-SDRi over baseline
- 0.12 dB CA-SDRi increment from chroma feature addition
- 0.2 dB CA-SDRi improvement from agent-based label correction
- 10.9% CA-SDRi improvement from dataset refinement and augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spectral Feature Enrichment for Event Differentiation
Incorporating spectral roll-off and chroma features alongside mel-spectrograms improves classification of spectrally similar sound events. Spectral roll-off captures high-frequency transient information (helpful for impulsive vs. continuous sounds), while chroma features encode harmonic/tonal characteristics across 12 pitch classes. These are concatenated with M2D embeddings via parallel processing paths (MLPs for roll-off, CNN for chroma), providing discriminative cues that mel-spectrograms alone may miss. Mixed audio contains subtle acoustic cues that mel-spectrograms incompletely represent, and these additional features offer non-redundant information. Break condition: If target sound classes lack distinct roll-off patterns or harmonic structure, auxiliary features provide minimal discriminative value.

### Mechanism 2: Agent-Based Label Correction via Re-Classification Consistency
A post-hoc agent that re-classifies separated audio reduces false positives, improving CA-SDRi. After separation, each estimated source is re-input to the audio-tagging model. If the re-predicted label (Label-2) disagrees with the original (Label-1), the prediction is discarded. The system also allows expansion beyond top-3 predictions when sigmoid scores exceed a threshold, then re-ranks via re-classification. False-positive predictions often yield separated audio that, when re-classified, produces inconsistent labels; true positives maintain consistency. Break condition: If the tagging model is unreliable on separated audio (due to poor separation quality), re-classification introduces noise, potentially discarding true positives.

### Mechanism 3: Dataset Refinement via Duration Filtering and Manual Curation
Removing short (<1.5s) and perceptually inconsistent samples, plus targeted augmentation of underrepresented classes, improves model robustness. Short samples are excluded (observed to degrade classification). Remaining samples are manually audited for intraclass consistency. Underrepresented/confusable classes (e.g., 'Doorbell', 'MusicalKeyboard') receive supplemental samples from AudioSet. Synthesized mixtures inherit quality issues from source data; even small amounts of out-of-class or ambiguous samples disproportionately degrade performance. Break condition: Over-aggressive filtering reduces class diversity; external augmentation may introduce label noise if source quality is unverified.

## Foundational Learning

- **Mel-spectrograms vs. spectral roll-off vs. chroma features**: Why needed here: The system relies on understanding what each feature captures—mel for general spectral shape, roll-off for brightness/transients, chroma for pitch/harmony. Quick check question: Given an impulsive sound (e.g., clap) and a tonal sound (e.g., doorbell), which feature would most clearly differentiate them?

- **CA-SDRi (Class-aware Signal-to-Distortion Ratio improvement)**: Why needed here: This is the primary evaluation metric; optimizing for it requires understanding its sensitivity to false positives and class-specific separation quality. Quick check question: Why would a system with high tagging accuracy but many false positives score poorly on CA-SDRi?

- **Two-stage audio source separation pipeline (tagging → separation)**: Why needed here: The architecture decouples event detection from source isolation; errors propagate from tagging to separation. Quick check question: If the tagging module misses an event, can the separation module recover it? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw audio → feature extraction (mel, roll-off, chroma) → M2D embedding + auxiliary features → dual-path fusion → class logits → top-k selection → ResUNetK separation → agent re-classification → final labels/separated sources

- **Critical path**: Audio input flows through feature extraction, M2D embedding, dual-path fusion, classification, separation, and post-processing to produce final separated sources with corrected labels.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Feature enrichment increases representational power but adds preprocessing and fusion complexity. Agent correction improves CA-SDRi (reduces FPs) at potential cost to recall (removes some TPs). Data refinement improves quality but reduces dataset size; external augmentation risks label noise. Ensemble improves performance but increases inference cost and requires careful weight tuning.

- **Failure signatures**: High tagging accuracy but low CA-SDRi → likely excessive false positives (check agent threshold). Confusion between 'Doorbell' and 'MusicalKeyboard' → insufficient chroma feature contribution or inadequate class augmentation. Degraded performance after refinement → over-filtering reduced critical training samples.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Ablation on auxiliary features**: Train tagging model with mel-only, mel+roll-off, mel+chroma, mel+both; measure tagging accuracy and CA-SDRi to isolate each feature's contribution.
  2. **Agent threshold sweep**: Vary the sigmoid threshold for label expansion and the consistency-check rejection criteria; plot CA-SDRi vs. recall to find operating point.
  3. **Data refinement sensitivity**: Train on original vs. refined vs. refined+augmented dataset; compare per-class CA-SDRi to identify which classes benefit most from curation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can adaptive or class-specific thresholds for the agent-based label correction mitigate the decrease in true-positive rate while maintaining false-positive reduction? Only a single global threshold was tested; the trade-off between improving CA-SDRi through FP reduction versus losing true positives was not optimized per-class, despite known class imbalances. What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing class-specific or adaptive thresholding strategies against the fixed-threshold approach, showing improved recall without CA-SDRi degradation.

### Open Question 2
Can a unified training objective be developed that jointly optimizes both tagging accuracy and separation performance, given their weak correlation? Current training decouples tagging from separation; the tagging model is selected using proxy metrics (macro-averaged accuracy, FP-penalized accuracy) rather than direct CA-SDRi optimization. What evidence would resolve it: A jointly-trained model with a loss function incorporating separation-quality signals, demonstrating stronger correlation between training objective and final CA-SDRi scores.

### Open Question 3
What is the optimal balance between data refinement for intraclass consistency and maintaining sufficient training diversity, particularly for low-resource classes? The 1.5s duration threshold and manual removal of "perceptually heterogeneous" samples were heuristic; the systematic trade-off between consistency and diversity was not quantified. What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying refinement thresholds and measuring both per-class consistency metrics and downstream task performance, identifying optimal operating points per class.

### Open Question 4
Would learned feature fusion mechanisms (e.g., attention or gating) outperform the current concatenation approach for integrating spectral roll-off and chroma features with M2D embeddings? Concatenation assumes equal feature importance across all samples and classes, but the discriminative value of roll-off versus chroma likely varies by sound event type. What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments with attention-based or learned gating fusion mechanisms, reporting per-class performance differences relative to concatenation.

## Limitations

- Manual curation process introduces potential subjectivity that may not generalize
- Individual component ablations not reported, limiting understanding of critical improvements
- Exact parameter values for spectral roll-off, agent threshold, and refinement criteria not specified
- No direct corpus evidence for agent-based correction mechanism

## Confidence

**Medium confidence** approach with promising results but several implementation uncertainties. The reported 14.7% CA-SDRi improvement is promising, but methodology relies on components with limited transparency regarding exact parameter values and manual curation processes.

## Next Checks

1. Perform ablation studies on each auxiliary feature (roll-off, chroma) to quantify their individual contributions to CA-SDRi.
2. Sweep the agent-based correction threshold to identify optimal precision-recall tradeoffs and verify false positive reduction.
3. Compare performance on the original vs. refined dataset to measure the true impact of data curation and targeted augmentation.
