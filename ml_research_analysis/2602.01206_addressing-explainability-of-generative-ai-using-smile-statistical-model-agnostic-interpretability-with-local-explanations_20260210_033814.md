- Introduces gSMILE, a unified framework for explaining generative AI models through statistical model-agnostic interpretability

## Executive Summary
This thesis introduces gSMILE, a unified framework for explaining generative AI models through statistical model-agnostic interpretability. By extending SMILE with Wasserstein distance metrics and weighted surrogate modeling, gSMILE provides fine-grained, token-level attributions for both text generation and instruction-based image editing models. The framework operates without internal model access, making it suitable for black-box systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that gSMILE produces robust, human-aligned explanations with strong stability (Jaccard index ~0.85), fidelity (R² up to 0.94), and consistency across diverse generative architectures.

## Method Summary
gSMILE extends the SMILE framework by incorporating Wasserstein distance metrics and weighted surrogate modeling to provide interpretable explanations for generative AI systems. The approach uses local perturbations around input samples to construct surrogate models that approximate the behavior of black-box generative models. By employing Wasserstein distances, gSMILE captures distributional differences between generated outputs more effectively than traditional distance metrics. The weighted surrogate modeling allows for fine-grained, token-level attributions in both text generation and instruction-based image editing tasks, providing explanations without requiring access to internal model parameters or gradients.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates strong stability with Jaccard index scores around 0.85 across multiple generative tasks
- Achieves high fidelity with R² correlation scores up to 0.94 between surrogate and target models
- Provides robust, human-aligned explanations that work across different generative architectures including text generators and diffusion-based image editors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
gSMILE works by leveraging local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) principles but extends them with Wasserstein distance metrics to better capture the distributional properties of generative outputs. The framework creates perturbed samples around input instances and trains lightweight surrogate models to approximate the behavior of complex generative models. The Wasserstein distance component is particularly effective because it measures the distance between probability distributions, which is crucial for evaluating generated text or images against their intended distributions. The weighted approach assigns importance scores to different input features, enabling fine-grained token-level attributions that help users understand which input elements most influence the generative model's outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Wasserstein Distance**: A metric that measures the distance between probability distributions, essential for evaluating generative model outputs against target distributions. Why needed: Traditional distance metrics fail to capture the nuanced distributional differences in generated text or images. Quick check: Verify that Wasserstein distance properly captures perceptual differences between generated and reference images.
- **Surrogate Modeling**: Creating interpretable approximation models to explain black-box systems. Why needed: Direct interpretation of complex generative models is often impossible due to their opaque nature. Quick check: Ensure surrogate model predictions correlate strongly with actual model outputs.
- **Local Perturbation Analysis**: Systematically modifying input features to observe changes in model behavior. Why needed: Understanding model behavior requires examining how small input changes affect outputs. Quick check: Confirm that perturbations maintain semantic coherence while revealing model sensitivities.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input -> Perturbation Generator -> Surrogate Model Trainer -> Attribution Generator -> Explanation Output
**Critical Path**: The perturbation generation and surrogate model training stages are most critical, as they directly determine explanation quality and computational efficiency.
**Design Tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. computational cost (more perturbations improve fidelity but increase runtime), model complexity vs. interpretability (complex surrogates may better fit but reduce transparency), and local vs. global explanations (focusing on local regions may miss broader patterns).
**Failure Signatures**: Poor explanation quality when input perturbations don't adequately explore the decision boundary, computational bottlenecks when handling high-dimensional inputs, and instability when surrogate models overfit to specific perturbations.
**Three First Experiments**: 1) Test explanation quality on simple text generation tasks with known ground truth attributions, 2) Evaluate stability across different random seeds for perturbation generation, 3) Benchmark runtime performance against alternative black-box explanation methods on a small image editing task.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation covers only two model families (text generators and diffusion-based image editors), limiting generalizability claims
- Absence of ablation studies for the weighted Wasserstein distance component leaves uncertainty about the source of performance improvements
- Computational efficiency assertions lack rigorous benchmarking against alternative black-box explanation methods

## Confidence
High confidence in: the technical soundness of the Wasserstein-based surrogate framework and its implementation for black-box access scenarios. The mathematical formulation appears rigorous, and the demonstrated stability metrics are reproducible within the tested conditions.

Medium confidence in: the framework's robustness across diverse generative architectures and real-world applications. While the method shows promise on two model types, scaling to larger or more complex generative systems remains unproven.

Low confidence in: claims about computational efficiency and practical usability for end-users. Without concrete runtime benchmarks or usability studies, these assertions remain speculative.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of the weighted Wasserstein distance versus standard Wasserstein distance to quantify the specific performance gains.
2. Extend validation to at least three additional generative model families (e.g., GANs, autoregressive image models, multimodal transformers) to test architectural generalization.
3. Perform user studies with domain experts to evaluate whether the token-level attributions meaningfully improve human understanding and trust in generative model decisions.
