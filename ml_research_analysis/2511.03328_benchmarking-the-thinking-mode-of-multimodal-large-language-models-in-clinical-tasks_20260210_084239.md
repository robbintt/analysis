# Benchmarking the Thinking Mode of Multimodal Large Language Models in Clinical Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.03328
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03328
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Key outcome:** Thinking mode improves accuracy marginally in medical image tasks but reduces consistency, with current models needing domain-specific data and better multimodal integration for reliable clinical use

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates how the thinking mode of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) affects their performance on medical image tasks. Using two leading models, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, the authors tested close-ended and open-ended visual question answering, concept detection, and caption prediction on VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Results showed that while thinking mode generally improved accuracy, the gains were marginal and task-dependent, with larger benefits only on more complex tasks. Performance on highly complex medical tasks remained suboptimal. Additionally, thinking mode reduced output consistency, especially in Gemini-2.5-Flash. These findings suggest that while reasoning capabilities help, current MLLMs still need domain-specific medical data and improved multimodal integration for reliable clinical use.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated two MLLMs (Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash) across four task types: close-ended and open-ended visual question answering, concept detection, and caption prediction. The models were tested on two medical image datasets: VQA-RAD (radiology-focused) and ROCOv2 (pathology-focused). Both models were assessed with and without thinking mode enabled to compare accuracy and consistency metrics. The experiments measured performance on simpler versus more complex medical tasks to determine when thinking mode provides benefits.

## Key Results
- Thinking mode provided only marginal accuracy improvements on simpler medical tasks, with benefits limited to more complex tasks
- Current MLLMs still perform suboptimally on highly complex medical tasks even with thinking mode enabled
- Thinking mode reduced output consistency, particularly in Gemini-2.5-Flash, raising reliability concerns for clinical applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: Thinking mode likely activates additional reasoning pathways in the model architecture, enabling step-by-step processing of visual and textual information. This mechanism appears to help with complex decision-making but may introduce variability in output generation due to the iterative nature of reasoning processes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs):** AI systems that process both text and visual inputs, essential for medical imaging tasks where visual context is critical
- **Thinking Mode:** An activation setting that enables step-by-step reasoning, needed to improve complex decision-making in medical contexts
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA):** Task requiring models to answer questions about images, critical for clinical diagnostics from medical scans
- **Domain-specific medical data:** Specialized training data from healthcare settings, needed because general MLLMs lack medical knowledge for accurate diagnosis
- **Output consistency:** Reliability measure of model responses, crucial for clinical trust where inconsistent answers could harm patient care

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Medical Image -> MLLM (with/without thinking mode) -> Text Response
**Critical Path:** Input Processing -> Multimodal Fusion -> Reasoning/Thinking Mode -> Response Generation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Thinking mode increases accuracy but reduces consistency and likely increases computational cost
**Failure Signatures:** Inconsistent outputs across similar inputs, particularly when thinking mode is enabled
**First 3 Experiments:** 1) Test thinking mode on 5 additional MLLM models, 2) Evaluate on histopathology and surgical video datasets, 3) Measure computational overhead and latency of thinking mode

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does thinking mode affect computational efficiency and clinical workflow integration?
- What specific architectural improvements could enhance multimodal reasoning without sacrificing consistency?
- Can domain-specific fine-tuning bridge the gap between general MLLMs and clinical requirements?

## Limitations
- Limited to only two MLLM models, potentially missing broader patterns across different architectures
- Evaluation on specific datasets (VQA-RAD, ROCOv2) may not generalize to all clinical scenarios
- No assessment of computational cost or latency implications of thinking mode for clinical deployment
- Reduced output consistency with thinking mode raises reliability concerns for clinical use

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Marginal accuracy improvements on simpler tasks and suboptimal performance on complex tasks are well-supported
- **Medium Confidence:** Need for domain-specific medical data and improved multimodal integration is reasonable but based on indirect evidence
- **Low Confidence:** Consistency reduction claims need validation with larger samples and additional metrics

## Next Checks
1. Test the thinking mode hypothesis across 5-7 additional MLLM models to determine if observed patterns hold
2. Conduct experiments using histopathology, radiology, and real-time surgical video datasets to assess generalizability
3. Measure computational overhead and latency introduced by thinking mode in clinical workflows
