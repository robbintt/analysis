# Bruno: Backpropagation Running Undersampled for Novel device Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17791
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17791
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: BRUNO achieves 74.73% accuracy on Braille recognition with 3-bit quantized FeLIF neurons, reducing memory usage by 97-99% and training time by 50-60% compared to BPTT.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BRUNO, a training method for spiking neural networks that uses dual timescales—fine-grained (1 µs) for forward simulation and coarse (1 ms) for backpropagation—to reduce training time and memory usage while maintaining accuracy. The method is validated on a music prediction task (JSB chorales) and a Braille letter recognition task using RRAM-based quantized synapses. FeLIF neurons trained with BRUNO achieve comparable or better performance than LIF neurons, especially with low-bit quantization, while significantly reducing computational resources required for training.

## Method Summary
BRUNO trains spiking neural networks with hardware-specific neuron models like FeLIF by using different time resolutions for forward and backward passes. The forward pass simulates at 1 µs resolution for physical accuracy, while the backward pass computes gradients at 1 ms resolution, reducing the computational graph size by approximately 1000×. The method uses the state difference between fine and coarse resolutions, `s_t = s_ms + detach(s_µs - s_ms)`, to maintain accurate forward simulation while enabling efficient gradient computation. This approach is combined with quantization-aware training and surrogate gradient learning to handle the non-differentiable aspects of spiking neuron models.

## Key Results
- FeLIF neurons achieve 74.73% ± 1.37% accuracy on Braille recognition with 3-bit quantization, outperforming LIF neurons (74.26% ± 1.24%) and feedforward LIF (40.48% ± 27.84%)
- BRUNO reduces memory usage by 97-99% and training time by 50-60% compared to standard BPTT
- FeLIF networks match or exceed the performance of more complex recurrent architectures without requiring explicit recurrent connections
- The method successfully handles quantized synapses with as few as 3 bits while maintaining high accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Timescale Gradient Approximation
- Claim: Undersampling the backward pass reduces memory and time costs while preserving gradient quality.
- Mechanism: Forward pass at 1 µs resolution preserves physical accuracy while backward pass at 1 ms resolution reduces computational graph size by ~1000×. The gradient from coarse state serves as surrogate for fine-grained state via `detach(s_µs - s_ms)`.
- Core assumption: Gradient computed at millisecond resolution approximates true gradient well enough for convergence.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "achieves this by using different time resolutions for forward and backward passes"; section 3.1 explains "reduces the size of the unrolled computational graph during backpropagation by reducing the total number of time steps in the backward pass."

### Mechanism 2: FeLIF Two-State Integration for Temporal Memory
- Claim: FeLIF neuron's ferroelectric polarization provides extended temporal memory without explicit recurrence.
- Mechanism: FeCap accumulates ferroelectric polarization P only when V_mem exceeds coercive voltage V_c, creating thresholded leaky integrator in parallel with standard dielectric integration.
- Core assumption: Ferroelectric polarization dynamics provide sufficiently smooth, differentiable pathways for gradient flow through surrogate gradients.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "FeLIF networks to match or exceed the performance of more complex recurrent architectures"; section 2.1 describes "resulting in a neuron capable of tracking significant inputs over long time frames."

### Mechanism 3: Quantization-Aware Training with Stochastic Rounding
- Claim: FeLIF neurons maintain accuracy under aggressive weight quantization where standard LIF networks collapse.
- Mechanism: QAT applies stochastic rounding during weight quantization while using straight-through estimator for gradients.
- Core assumption: Surrogate gradient for spike threshold combined with stochastic rounding provides sufficient gradient signal despite non-differentiable quantization.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "particular effectiveness for quantized synapses"; section 3.2.2 describes "quantisation is required to define a limited number of discrete, non-overlapping conductance levels."

## Foundational Learning

- **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**
  - Why needed here: BRUNO is positioned as alternative to BPTT for high-resolution temporal models. Understanding how BPTT stores states at every timestep explains why memory scales linearly with sequence length × temporal resolution.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why BPTT memory consumption scales as O(T × τ) where T is sequence length and τ is temporal resolution?

- **Surrogate Gradient Learning**
  - Why needed here: Spike threshold function is non-differentiable. BRUNO uses surrogate gradients (sg operator in Algorithm 1) for both spike threshold and quantization operations.
  - Quick check question: What happens to gradient flow if you use true derivative of Heaviside step function instead of surrogate?

- **Compact Device Modeling**
  - Why needed here: FeLIF and RRAM models are derived from physics-based compact models, not abstract computational primitives. Understanding parameter extraction from SPICE simulations is critical for hardware deployment.
  - Quick check question: Why would 1 ms simulation timestep cause instability in ferroelectric capacitor model with sub-microsecond polarization dynamics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input spikes → [Encoding Layer] → [256 LIF Hidden Layer] → [FeLIF Output Layer] → Classification

- **Critical path**: Forward pass accuracy depends on faithful FeLIF model implementation matching SPICE behavior. Backward pass depends on correct detach operation to route gradients through coarse timescale. Weight update requires stochastic rounding for quantization compatibility.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Memory vs. gradient fidelity: BRUNO trades gradient precision for 97-99% memory reduction
  - Complexity vs. recurrence: FeLIF neurons add computational overhead vs. LIF but eliminate need for explicit recurrent weights
  - Quantization level vs. accuracy: 3-bit quantization works for FeLIF but not standard LIF (Table 5: 40.48% ± 27.84 vs. 74.73% ± 1.37)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Training instability at coarse timesteps: If forward pass diverges from backward pass state, check that `detach(s_µs - s_ms)` is correctly implemented
  - High variance across seeds: Indicates quantization noise overwhelming learning—reduce learning rate or increase bit precision
  - SPICE/model mismatch: Polarization transient differences >5% suggest parameter extraction errors

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate BRUNO vs. BPTT on simple task: Train identical LIF network with both methods on JSB dataset, plot loss curves side-by-side to verify convergence parity
  2. Characterize timescale sensitivity: Sweep backward pass timestep (0.5 ms, 1 ms, 2 ms) and measure memory/accuracy tradeoff curve
  3. Stress-test quantization: Train FeLIF vs. LIF networks at 8/4/3/2-bit quantization levels, plot accuracy degradation rates to validate FeLIF robustness claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Does BRUNO approximation lead to convergence failures or performance degradation on tasks requiring precise, high-frequency temporal credit assignment?
  - Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge that "gradient calculation with BRUNO can differ from BPTT" and validate it only on slower spatio-temporal datasets (music/Braille). It is unclear if the 1 ms backward sampling rate misses critical microsecond-scale causal relationships in faster dynamic systems.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only validates the method on specific tasks where the temporal dependencies align with the coarse backward pass, leaving the theoretical limits of the undersampling approximation unexplored.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking BRUNO on tasks strictly requiring microsecond-level precision (e.g., high-frequency signal processing or fast control loops) where BPTT succeeds but BRUNO fails.

- **Open Question 2**: Can BRUNO scale to deep network architectures without losing the memory and time efficiency advantages demonstrated on shallow networks?
  - Basis in paper: The benchmark comparisons utilize networks with single hidden layers (128–512 neurons) or specific feedforward architectures. It is uncertain if the surrogate gradient detach/attach mechanism introduces vanishing gradients in deeper stacks.
  - Why unresolved: The experiments restrict the scope to shallow topologies to prove feasibility, while modern neuromorphic solutions often require depth.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful training of multi-layer (deeper) spiking networks on complex datasets (e.g., DVS Gesture) with performance matching BPTT.

- **Open Question 3**: How effectively do weights trained via BRUNO transfer to physical FeCap/RRAM hardware given the "simulation-to-reality" gap?
  - Basis in paper: The paper states that networks "need to take into account the specifics of the hardware" and uses compact models to simulate this, but relies on Python models verified against SPICE rather than physical ASICs.
  - Why unresolved: While the algorithm handles simulated stochasticity and variability, physical devices often exhibit non-idealities and drifts not fully captured by compact models.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Deployment of BRUNO-trained weights onto a physical ferroelectric/RRAM chip with minimal accuracy drop compared to the simulated results.

## Limitations

- BRUNO's dual-timescale approach may miss critical high-frequency temporal dependencies that occur below the 1 ms backward sampling rate, potentially limiting performance on tasks requiring precise microsecond-level temporal credit assignment.
- The method has only been validated on relatively simple temporal tasks (music prediction, Braille recognition) with shallow network architectures, leaving uncertainty about performance on more complex spatio-temporal pattern recognition problems.
- While FeLIF neurons show promise for hardware deployment, the results are based on compact model simulations rather than actual ferroelectric device measurements, raising questions about real-world transfer to physical hardware.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Memory and training time reduction claims (97-99% and 50-60% vs BPTT) - These follow directly from reduced computational graph size and are algorithmically deterministic.
- **Medium Confidence**: FeLIF performance advantage over LIF with quantization - Results are robust across seeds for FeLIF but show high variance for quantized LIF, suggesting some benefit but unclear if universal.
- **Low Confidence**: Hardware deployment feasibility - While FeLIF is motivated by ferroelectric devices, no physical device measurements or variability analysis is presented to validate the model assumptions.

## Next Checks

1. **Gradient Fidelity Analysis**: Compare gradients computed by BRUNO vs full BPTT on a synthetic task with known gradient landscape. Plot gradient angle and magnitude differences across training epochs.

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Apply BRUNO-trained FeLIF networks to additional temporal datasets (e.g., speech recognition, gesture recognition) to test whether FeLIF advantage extends beyond current tasks.

3. **Hardware Variability Stress Test**: Introduce parametric noise in FeLIF ferroelectric parameters (±10% variation) and measure performance degradation. Compare against LIF network robustness to synaptic weight variability.
