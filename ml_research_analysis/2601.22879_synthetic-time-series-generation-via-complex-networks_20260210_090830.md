# Synthetic Time Series Generation via Complex Networks
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.22879
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22879
- **Reference count**: 26
- **Key outcome**: Proposed Quantile Graph (QG) and inverse mapping (InvQG) method generates synthetic time series preserving short-term dependencies and statistical properties, outperforming GAN-based approaches on multiple benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to synthetic time series generation using complex network theory. The method transforms time series into quantile-based graphs (QG) and reconstructs synthetic data through inverse mapping (InvQG) using Markov transition probabilities. Evaluated on 11 simulated models and 22 real-world smart meter datasets, the approach demonstrates superior performance in preserving temporal dependencies and statistical properties compared to GAN-based methods. The technique offers a transparent, parameter-efficient alternative to black-box generative models while maintaining high fidelity in synthetic data generation.

## Method Summary
The proposed method consists of two main components: Quantile Graph (QG) construction and inverse mapping (InvQG). QG transforms time series into complex networks by discretizing values into quantiles and establishing edges based on temporal transitions. Each quantile represents a node, while transitions between consecutive time points form directed edges with associated probabilities. The inverse mapping then generates synthetic time series by traversing the network using these transition probabilities. This approach leverages the topological properties of complex networks to capture temporal dependencies while maintaining interpretability through Markovian assumptions.

## Key Results
- InvQG preserves short-term temporal dependencies and statistical properties with near-zero mean differences in paired samples
- Outperforms TimeGAN and DoppelGANger in fidelity and diversity metrics, as confirmed by t-SNE visualizations
- Achieves higher Adjusted Rand Index and Normalized Mutual Information in clustering tasks while maintaining topological network features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits the inherent structure of time series by representing temporal transitions as network edges. By discretizing continuous values into quantiles, it creates a finite state space where transitions follow Markovian properties. This discretization captures the essential dynamics while reducing complexity. The quantile-based approach naturally handles non-linear relationships and distributional characteristics without requiring explicit parametric assumptions. The inverse mapping leverages these learned transition probabilities to generate realistic synthetic sequences that maintain the original temporal structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **Complex Networks**: Why needed - Represent temporal relationships as graph structures; Quick check - Verify network connectivity and degree distribution match expectations
- **Quantile Discretization**: Why needed - Convert continuous values to finite states for Markov modeling; Quick check - Ensure quantile boundaries capture meaningful value ranges
- **Markov Transition Probabilities**: Why needed - Model temporal dependencies between states; Quick check - Verify transition matrix rows sum to 1
- **Inverse Mapping**: Why needed - Generate synthetic sequences from learned network structure; Quick check - Confirm generated sequences respect transition probabilities
- **Topological Network Analysis**: Why needed - Evaluate structural preservation in synthetic networks; Quick check - Compare original and synthetic network metrics (clustering coefficient, path length)
- **Statistical Similarity Metrics**: Why needed - Quantify fidelity between original and synthetic data; Quick check - Validate paired sample tests show no significant differences

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Time Series → Quantile Binning → Quantile Graph (QG) → Transition Matrix → Inverse Mapping (InvQG) → Synthetic Time Series

**Critical Path**: The core workflow flows from original time series through quantile discretization to QG construction, then uses the learned transition probabilities for inverse mapping to generate synthetic data.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method prioritizes interpretability and parameter efficiency over capturing extremely long-range dependencies. Quantile discretization simplifies the state space but may lose fine-grained information. Markovian assumptions limit the ability to model complex temporal patterns beyond first-order dependencies.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on highly persistent time series, loss of long-range dependencies, failure to capture structural breaks or seasonality patterns, synthetic data showing unrealistic transitions between extreme values.

**First Experiments**: 1) Apply QG construction to simple synthetic series (sinusoidal, random walk) and visualize resulting networks; 2) Test inverse mapping on small synthetic networks to verify basic functionality; 3) Compare generated vs. original statistics on benchmark datasets to establish baseline performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reduced effectiveness for time series with long-range dependencies and persistent trends
- May not fully capture complex seasonal patterns and structural breaks common in real-world data
- Heavy reliance on synthetic benchmark datasets limits real-world validation scope

## Confidence
- **High**: Preservation of short-term temporal dependencies and basic statistical properties
- **Medium**: Superiority claims relative to GAN-based methods, clustering performance metrics
- **Medium**: Topological feature preservation in synthetic networks

## Next Checks
1. Test InvQG on diverse real-world datasets with varying temporal characteristics (e.g., financial, medical, environmental data)
2. Evaluate long-range dependency preservation using established benchmarks like spectral analysis or long-term correlation metrics
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of Quantile Graph construction parameters on generation quality across different time series types
