# Transformation of audio embeddings into interpretable, concept-based representations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.14076
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14076
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Sparse, concept-based audio representations match or outperform dense CLAP embeddings on classification and retrieval tasks while providing interpretability.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to transform dense audio embeddings from the CLAP model into sparse, interpretable concept-based representations. By decomposing audio embeddings into non-negative linear combinations of semantic concepts drawn from FSD50K tags, the approach maintains or improves task performance while enabling understanding of what concepts drive predictions. The method uses Lasso regression with sparsity constraints and supports optional fine-tuning for task-specific alignment.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a concept vocabulary from FSD50K audio tags, computes text embeddings for these concepts using CLAP, then decomposes audio embeddings via Lasso regression with non-negativity constraints. The decomposition solves min ||Cw - z||² + λ||w||₁ where C is the concept vocabulary matrix, z is the audio embedding, and w is the sparse weight vector. The resulting concept-based representation uses only the non-zero weighted concepts. An optional fine-tuning step adds a linear projection layer to align audio embeddings with class label text embeddings before decomposition.

## Key Results
- Concept-based representations achieve competitive or superior zero-shot classification accuracy on UrbanSound8K (0.828), DCASE2017 (0.470), and Vocalsound (0.821) compared to original CLAP embeddings
- Using only 20-40 non-zero concepts achieves similar performance to dense representations
- Fine-tuning with a linear projection layer further improves accuracy, reaching 0.9 on UrbanSound8K
- Retrieval tasks show improvements in R@1 and mAP@10 metrics on some datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Dense audio embeddings can be approximated as sparse, non-negative linear combinations of semantic concepts without significant loss of task performance. The method solves a Lasso regression problem to decompose a dense audio embedding into a sparse weight vector over a fixed concept vocabulary matrix. The L1 penalty enforces sparsity while non-negativity ensures interpretability. Core assumption: semantic concepts span the subspace of the CLAP embedding such that the reconstruction preserves sufficient information for downstream tasks.

### Mechanism 2
Enforcing sparsity via the L1 penalty acts as a filter that removes redundant or noisy dimensions, maintaining or improving performance with ~20-40 active concepts. Increasing the L1 penalty forces the optimization to discard low-magnitude contributions from concepts. Core assumption: the signal necessary for classification/retrieval is concentrated in a few high-magnitude semantic dimensions rather than distributed densely.

### Mechanism 3
Fine-tuning the CLAP audio encoder with a linear projection layer aligns audio embeddings closer to task-specific text embeddings before decomposition. A linear layer is trained to maximize cosine similarity between the projected audio embedding and the text embedding of the ground truth class label. Core assumption: the original CLAP embedding space, while general, is not optimally aligned for all specific downstream class boundaries.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP)**
Why needed: The entire method relies on CLAP's ability to map audio and text into a shared latent space where semantic similarity corresponds to geometric proximity.
Quick check: How does the cosine similarity between a "dog barking" audio clip and the text "dog barking" compare to the text "car engine" in a trained CLAP model?

**Concept: Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**
Why needed: This is the mathematical engine driving the sparsity. Understanding the trade-off between the reconstruction term and the penalty term is required to tune the number of concepts.
Quick check: If you increase λ in the Lasso objective, what happens to the number of non-zero weights in the solution vector w?

**Concept: Zero-Shot Classification**
Why needed: This is the primary evaluation benchmark. One must understand that zero-shot classification here works by comparing the decomposed audio representation directly against class label embeddings without training a classifier head.
Quick check: In this framework, how is the predicted class label determined for an input audio file during zero-shot inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** CLAP Encoders -> Concept Vocabulary (C) -> Decomposition Solver -> Concept-Based Representation

**Critical path:**
1. Constructing the Concept Vocabulary (C) is the most critical offline step; the paper uses FSD50K tags
2. Setting the L1 penalty (λ) controls the sparsity/performance trade-off
3. If fine-tuning, training the projection layer H is the bottleneck requiring GPU resources

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Baseline vs. Pruned vs. Clustered Vocabularies: Baseline is easiest to build; Pruned/Clustered require more processing but may offer better coverage per concept
- Sparsity (λ) vs. Fidelity: High λ yields highly interpretable (few concepts) but lower-fidelity reconstructions; Low λ preserves information but loses interpretability

**Failure signatures:**
- Concept Bleeding: The solver assigns high weights to unrelated concepts if the vocabulary is noisy or the embedding is ambiguous
- Vocabulary Mismatch: If an audio input contains a sound not represented in the 2,000-word vocabulary, the solver forces a reconstruction using incorrect "closest" concepts

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Reproduce Zero-Shot Baseline: Load MS-CLAP, compute embeddings for UrbanSound8K, and verify baseline accuracy (approx 0.823) without decomposition
2. Sparsity Sweep: Implement the Lasso decomposition with the Baseline vocabulary on UrbanSound8K. Sweep λ from 0.01 to 0.5 and plot accuracy vs. number of non-zero concepts to find the "knee" of the curve
3. Qualitative Inspection: Pass 5 random audio samples from Clotho through the decomposer (with λ=0.15) and manually verify if the top-3 concepts align with the ground truth captions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Why does downstream classification performance fail to improve, or sometimes decrease, as the number of non-zero concepts increases on large-vocabulary datasets like ESC-50 and AudioSet? The authors observe this non-intuitive trend and state "further research is required to better understand this trend," hypothesizing that additional concepts may not contribute meaningfully to representations for granular classes spanning multiple sound categories.

**Open Question 2:** Can the learned concept-based representations be effectively inverted or utilized to control audio editing and generation? The conclusion states that the representations "enable future work in concept-based audio editing or generation," but the current work focuses solely on interpretability and discriminative performance, not generative capabilities.

**Open Question 3:** Can replacing the single linear projection layer with a more complex model improve the performance of fine-tuned concept decomposition, particularly for datasets like Vocalsound? The authors note a performance gap on Vocalsound and suggest "room for improvement in the use of supervision... such as the use of more complex models."

## Limitations

- The method's performance is highly dependent on the quality and coverage of the concept vocabulary derived from FSD50K tags
- The choice of L1 penalty λ is critical but not thoroughly explored across all datasets
- The fine-tuning procedure introduces additional complexity and potential overfitting, especially for smaller datasets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of using Lasso regression with non-negativity constraints to create sparse, interpretable decompositions is mathematically sound and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** The zero-shot classification results showing competitive performance with dense CLAP embeddings are well-supported, but the exact conditions that yield optimal results across all datasets require further validation
- **Medium Confidence:** The retrieval task improvements are promising but show mixed results, suggesting the decomposition may be more beneficial for certain types of semantic relationships than others

## Next Checks

1. **Vocabulary Coverage Analysis:** Systematically evaluate how many ground truth labels from each test dataset are present (or semantically close) to the 2,000-concept vocabulary, and measure the impact on classification accuracy
2. **Ablation on Sparsity Levels:** For each dataset, conduct a comprehensive sweep of λ values and plot accuracy vs. number of active concepts to identify the optimal sparsity-performance trade-off
3. **Generalization to Novel Sounds:** Test the decomposition on audio samples containing sounds not present in FSD50K to assess whether the method can still produce meaningful, interpretable concepts for out-of-vocabulary sound events
