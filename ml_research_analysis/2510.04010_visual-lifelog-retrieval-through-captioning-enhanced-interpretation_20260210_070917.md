core_contribution: This paper introduces a Captioning-Integrated Visual Lifelog (CIVIL)
  Retrieval System for retrieving specific images from a user's visual lifelog based
  on textual queries. Unlike traditional embedding-based methods, the system generates
  captions for visual lifelogs and uses a text embedding model to project both captions
  and user queries into a shared vector space.

# Visual Lifelog Retrieval through Captioning-Enhanced Interpretation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.04010
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04010
- **Reference count**: 30
- **Primary result**: Caption-based retrieval achieves P@10 of 0.73, outperforming direct image embedding baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CIVIL (Captioning-Integrated Visual Lifelog) Retrieval System, which converts first-person lifelog images into textual captions before retrieval rather than embedding images directly. The system generates captions using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and embeds both captions and user queries into a shared vector space using text embedding models. Three captioning methods—single caption, collective caption, and merged caption—are proposed to interpret lifeloggers' experiences. Experimental results on the NTCIR-14 Lifelog-3 dataset show that this approach effectively describes first-person visual content, achieving a precision@10 of 0.73 when combining single and collective captions with the GTE-large text embedding model. The authors also release a textual dataset converting visual lifelogs into captions for future research.

## Method Summary
The CIVIL system addresses visual lifelog retrieval by first generating textual captions for lifelog images using instruction-following LVLMs, then projecting both captions and user queries into a shared vector space via text embedding models. Unlike traditional methods that directly embed images, this two-stage approach leverages VLMs' semantic understanding to bridge the visual-textual gap. The system implements three captioning strategies: single captions for individual frames, collective captions for sequences of 8 consecutive frames to capture temporal context, and merged captions combining fine and coarse descriptions for visually similar frames. Retrieval is performed by computing cosine similarity between query and caption embeddings, with optional score combination from multiple captioning methods.

## Key Results
- CIVIL achieves precision@10 of 0.73 when combining single and collective captions with GTE-large embeddings
- Five of nine captioning methods surpass the CLIP-based baseline (P@10 of 0.58) when using GTE-large
- The combined approach of InternLM-XComposer2-VL-7B and Video-LLaVA achieves the highest performance
- The system effectively describes first-person visual images where traditional methods struggle

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Converting images to text captions before embedding improves retrieval over direct image embedding
- Mechanism: Large Vision-Language Models generate textual descriptions that leverage semantic understanding capabilities to bridge visual-textual gaps that direct embedding models struggle with in first-person lifelog contexts
- Core assumption: LVLMs can accurately interpret first-person visual content and generate captions that capture the lifelogger's activities, not just scene descriptions
- Evidence anchors: System achieves P@10 of 0.73 vs baseline CLIP models at 0.58; five of nine caption methods surpassed baseline with GTE-large embeddings

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining similarity scores from single-frame and collective captions improves retrieval
- Mechanism: Single captions provide fine-grained specificity while collective captions (from 8 consecutive frames) provide temporal context; averaging their similarity scores leverages both strengths
- Core assumption: Temporal sequences contain disambiguating context that single frames lack, and averaging scores doesn't introduce harmful noise
- Evidence anchors: Highest P@10 of 0.73 achieved by combining InternLM-XComposer2-VL-7B and Video-LLaVA under GTE-large embeddings

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: First-person viewpoint interpretation requires explicit prompting to focus on lifelogger activities
- Mechanism: The system uses instruction-following LVLMs with prompts designed to "reconstruct personal experiences" rather than describe scenes, including metadata and asking models to infer activities from visual cues
- Core assumption: LVLMs can be guided via prompts to attribute visible objects and actions to the camera-wearer rather than people in the scene
- Evidence anchors: Documents "first-person viewpoint errors" where background actions are mistakenly attributed to the lifelogger

## Foundational Learning

- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs/LVLMs)**: Why needed here: These models generate the captions that replace direct image embeddings; understanding their instruction-following capabilities and hallucination risks is critical. Quick check: Can you explain why an LVLM might struggle with first-person images compared to third-person images?

- **Text Embedding Models and Vector Similarity**: Why needed here: After caption generation, models like GTE-large embed both captions and queries into a shared vector space; retrieval depends on cosine similarity in this space. Quick check: What is the difference between using a text embedding model on captions versus using a multimodal embedding model directly on images?

- **Temporal Context in Lifelogs**: Why needed here: Activities like "driving to the beach" require inference across sequential frames; the collective caption method explicitly addresses this by treating frame sequences as video. Quick check: Why might a single image of a steering wheel be insufficient to identify "driving" as the activity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input: Lifelog frames + Metadata → Three parallel captioning paths (Single, Collective, Merged) → Text Embedding → Query embedding → Cosine similarity → Top-K retrieval → Optional score combination

- **Critical path**: Caption generation quality → Text embedding model selection → Score combination strategy

- **Design tradeoffs**: Single vs. Collective captions (specificity vs. temporal context); GPT-4-turbo-vision vs. open-source LVLMs (quality vs. cost); Combination vs. single method (performance vs. computational overhead)

- **Failure signatures**: Contextual image errors (retrieving wrong images based on collective context); Text embedding retrieval errors (BGE-M3 ranking issues); Error propagation (collective caption errors spreading to 8 frames); Over-interpretation (speculative associations without visual evidence)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Run CLIP models on NTCIR-14 Lifelog-3 User 1 data to establish P@10 baseline (~0.58)
  2. Single caption ablation: Test InternLM-XComposer2-VL-7B with GTE-large embeddings, expect P@10 ~0.66
  3. Combination validation: Average similarity scores from InternLM-XComposer2-VL-7B (single) and Video-LLaVA (collective) with GTE-large; target P@10 ≥ 0.70

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Cross-dataset generalization remains untested; performance on independent lifelog datasets is unknown
- Hallucination risk from LVLMs is not quantified; no systematic evaluation of hallucination frequency or severity
- Caption generation cost and scalability are underspecified; runtime measurements and economic considerations are not discussed

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core retrieval mechanism: Two-stage process demonstrably outperforms direct image embedding with strong theoretical grounding
- **Medium confidence** in the combined caption approach: While combination improves precision, error analysis shows both positive and negative replacement effects
- **Low confidence** in first-person viewpoint accuracy: Paper documents viewpoint attribution errors but provides no systematic evaluation of how often captions correctly identify the lifelogger's actions

## Next Checks
1. Cross-dataset validation: Test the CIVIL system on at least two independent lifelog datasets to establish whether P@10 ≥ 0.70 performance generalizes beyond the original User 1 dataset

2. Hallucination quantification: Implement automated hallucination detection by comparing caption-object pairs against image segmentation masks, measuring the frequency of unsupported inferences across 1,000 randomly sampled frames

3. Cost-performance scaling analysis: Measure end-to-end inference time and GPU memory usage for single, collective, and combined approaches across varying dataset sizes (10K, 100K, 500K images) to establish practical deployment thresholds where performance gains justify computational costs
