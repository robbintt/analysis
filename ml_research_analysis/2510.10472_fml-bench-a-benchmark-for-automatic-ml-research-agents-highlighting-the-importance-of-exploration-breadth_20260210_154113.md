# FML-bench: A Benchmark for Automatic ML Research Agents Highlighting the Importance of Exploration Breadth

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.10472
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10472
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Agents with broader exploration strategies outperform those with narrow but deep exploration in ML research tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FML-bench, a benchmark for evaluating automatic machine learning research agents on 8 fundamental ML problems using real-world codebases. The benchmark includes tasks such as generalization, data efficiency, representation learning, continual learning, causality, robustness, privacy, and fairness. It provides a unified evaluation framework with five metrics: utility, diversity, academic contribution rate, cost, and step success rate. Experiments with three state-of-the-art agents (TheAIScientist, AIDE, and Claude Code) reveal that agents employing broader exploration strategies outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration, highlighting the importance of exploration breadth in achieving effective research outcomes.

## Method Summary
FML-bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 fundamental ML problems using real-world codebases. The benchmark provides a unified evaluation framework with five metrics: utility, diversity, academic contribution rate, cost, and step success rate. Three state-of-the-art agents (TheAIScientist, AIDE, and Claude Code) were evaluated on tasks including generalization, data efficiency, representation learning, continual learning, causality, robustness, privacy, and fairness. The benchmark aims to assess both the quality and breadth of exploration strategies employed by these agents in complex research environments.

## Key Results
- Agents employing broader exploration strategies outperformed those with narrow but deep exploration approaches
- AIDE failed to improve baselines in Generalization and Data Efficiency tasks, potentially due to single-file modification constraints
- Code modification diversity showed mixed correlations with performance across different ML tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its use of real-world codebases that span multiple files, requiring agents to navigate complex research environments. The five-metric evaluation framework captures both research quality (utility, academic contribution) and research process characteristics (diversity, cost, completion rate). By evaluating agents across diverse ML research domains, FML-bench reveals how different exploration strategies perform in varied research contexts.

## Foundational Learning
1. Tree-search vs. CLI agent architectures: Understanding the fundamental differences between agents that iteratively modify single files versus those that can explore broader codebases is crucial for interpreting performance differences.
2. Multi-metric research evaluation: The five metrics (utility, diversity, academic contribution rate, cost, step success rate) provide a comprehensive framework for assessing research agents beyond simple accuracy measures.
3. Exploration breadth vs. depth tradeoff: The paper demonstrates that in research contexts, exploring a wider solution space often yields better outcomes than deeply optimizing a single hypothesis.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Research Agent -> FML-bench Environment -> Evaluation Metrics (Utility, Diversity, Academic Contribution, Cost, Step Success Rate)
- Critical Path: Agent receives task → Explores solution space → Modifies codebase → Evaluation via 5 metrics
- Design Tradeoffs: Single-file vs. multi-file editing capabilities; exploration breadth vs. depth; metric comprehensiveness vs. simplicity
- Failure Signatures: Premature termination (low step completion rate), lack of cross-file modifications, negative correlation between diversity and utility
- First Experiments: 1) Compare single-file vs. multi-file editing on generalization task, 2) Test diversity correlation in robustness vs. fairness tasks, 3) Measure impact of exploration breadth on academic contribution rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the single-file modification constraint inherent in tree-search agents (like AIDE) create a fundamental performance ceiling when applied to complex, multi-file research codebases?
- Basis: [explicit] The authors note that AIDE failed to improve baselines in Generalization and Data Efficiency tasks, and speculate this failure stems from the fact that AIDE "only supports iterative modifications on a single file," whereas real-world repos span multiple files.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates agents as-is and does not ablate the effect of multi-file editing capabilities on the tree-search strategy's success rate.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of an augmented version of AIDE capable of cross-file modifications on the same benchmark tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why does code modification diversity negatively correlate with performance in certain fundamental ML tasks (2 out of 8) while positively correlating in others?
- Basis: [explicit] Section 5.3.2 reports that while diversity is generally positive, the correlation analysis showed "2 negative correlations" among the 8 tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper reports the correlation coefficients but does not provide a causal explanation for why higher diversity degrades results in specific research contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A qualitative error analysis of the "diverse" hypotheses that failed in the negatively correlated tasks to identify common failure modes (e.g., lack of convergence or coherent logic).

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can general-purpose CLI agents be architected to prevent "premature termination" where the model decides to stop before the iteration budget is exhausted?
- Basis: [explicit] The authors observe that Claude Code exhibits a Step Completion Rate of only 0.07, often triggering "early stopping... by the model's internal reasoning" even when further actions are possible.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this behavioral limitation but does not propose or test mechanisms to enforce continuous execution loops in general-purpose models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating a prompting strategy or feedback loop that maintains the agent's "will" to continue until a hard iteration limit is reached.

## Limitations
- The benchmark's reliance on specific real-world codebases may limit generalizability to other research contexts
- The evaluation focuses primarily on synthetic and established problems, potentially missing novel research challenges
- The five metrics may not fully capture the complexity of research quality and impact
- Limited diversity in tested agents (only three agents evaluated)

## Confidence
- High: The technical framework of FML-bench and its evaluation methodology
- Medium: The experimental results comparing exploration strategies
- Medium: The generalizability of findings to other ML research domains

## Next Checks
1. Test FML-bench with additional agents from different ML research domains to assess generalizability
2. Validate benchmark results on newly emerging ML research problems not included in the current setup
3. Conduct user studies with human researchers to compare agent performance against human benchmarks
