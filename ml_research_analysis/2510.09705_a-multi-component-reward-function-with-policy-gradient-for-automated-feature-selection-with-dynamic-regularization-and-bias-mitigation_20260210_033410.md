# A Multi-Component Reward Function with Policy Gradient for Automated Feature Selection with Dynamic Regularization and Bias Mitigation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09705
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09705

- Key outcome: A reinforcement learning framework for automated feature selection that integrates fairness-aware bias mitigation through a multi-component reward function balancing predictive accuracy, sparsity, and fairness.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for automated feature selection that integrates fairness-aware bias mitigation. The core innovation is a multi-component reward function that balances predictive accuracy, sparsity, and fairness through direct and indirect penalties for biased features. The approach uses a policy gradient method (REINFORCE) to navigate feature selection decisions while maintaining equitable treatment across demographic groups. Tested on credit default risk data, the model outperformed baseline methods (logistic regression and random forest) in both accuracy (AUC) and bias mitigation. The proposed framework achieved stable policy convergence and demonstrated that fairness and predictive performance can be jointly optimized without trade-offs. This work addresses limitations in traditional feature selection approaches by dynamically preventing bias reintroduction through correlated features rather than relying on static pre-processing or post-hoc corrections.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a reinforcement learning approach where the agent selects features sequentially, guided by a multi-component reward function. The reward function comprises three main components: accuracy-based reward (measuring predictive performance), sparsity-based reward (encouraging feature selection parsimony), and fairness-based reward (penalizing biased features through statistical parity difference metrics). The policy gradient method (REINFORCE) optimizes the selection policy by maximizing the expected cumulative reward. The bias mitigation component operates through both direct penalties on biased features and indirect penalties on correlated features, preventing bias reintroduction. The model was trained on credit default risk data and evaluated against traditional feature selection methods, demonstrating superior performance in balancing accuracy and fairness metrics.

## Key Results
- Outperformed baseline methods (logistic regression and random forest) in both accuracy (AUC) and bias mitigation on credit default risk data
- Achieved stable policy convergence while jointly optimizing fairness and predictive performance without trade-offs
- Demonstrated that fairness and predictive performance can be optimized simultaneously through the multi-component reward function design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by transforming feature selection into a sequential decision-making problem where each selection step affects both immediate predictive performance and downstream fairness properties. The multi-component reward function creates a balanced optimization landscape where accuracy, sparsity, and fairness are simultaneously considered. The policy gradient approach allows the model to learn complex feature selection patterns that traditional methods cannot capture, while the dynamic regularization prevents bias reintroduction through correlated features. This integrated approach addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional feature selection methods that treat fairness as a post-processing concern rather than an inherent selection criterion.

## Foundational Learning

**Policy Gradient Methods**: Why needed - to optimize feature selection policies in a continuous action space; Quick check - verify gradient estimates are unbiased and variance is manageable

**Multi-Component Reward Design**: Why needed - to balance competing objectives of accuracy, sparsity, and fairness; Quick check - ensure reward components are appropriately scaled and normalized

**Statistical Parity Difference**: Why needed - to quantify fairness across demographic groups; Quick check - verify metric sensitivity to feature selection changes

**Feature Correlation Analysis**: Why needed - to prevent bias reintroduction through correlated features; Quick check - confirm correlation threshold selection is data-appropriate

**Reinforcement Learning Convergence**: Why needed - to ensure stable policy optimization; Quick check - monitor learning curves for plateaus or divergence

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: State Representation -> Policy Network -> Action Selection -> Reward Calculation -> Policy Update

Critical Path: State (current features, demographic info) → Policy Network (neural network) → Action (feature selection decision) → Environment Response (reward calculation) → Policy Update (gradient step)

Design Tradeoffs: The multi-component reward function increases computational complexity but provides more balanced optimization; direct fairness penalties are interpretable but may be too restrictive compared to indirect correlation-based penalties

Failure Signatures: Unstable policy convergence when reward weights are poorly tuned; bias mitigation failure when correlation thresholds are set too high; performance degradation when sparsity penalty is too strong

First Experiments: 1) Test reward function components in isolation to understand individual contributions, 2) Conduct sensitivity analysis on reward weight hyperparameters, 3) Validate convergence stability across different random seeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited validation scope - experiments conducted on a single credit default risk dataset, raising generalizability concerns across domains
- Computational overhead uncertainty - no analysis of runtime and memory requirements compared to baseline methods
- Scalability questions - unclear how the approach performs with high-dimensional feature spaces beyond tested scenarios

## Confidence
- Multi-component reward function effectiveness: High confidence based on clear mathematical formulation and empirical validation
- Policy gradient convergence stability: Medium confidence - results show stability but limited to specific experimental conditions
- Fairness-accuracy trade-off elimination: Low confidence - while results are promising, broader testing is needed to confirm this claim across diverse datasets

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework across at least three additional domains (e.g., healthcare, hiring, criminal justice) with varying feature characteristics and demographic distributions
2. Conduct computational complexity analysis comparing runtime and memory requirements against baseline feature selection methods
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each reward component and determine optimal weight configurations for different application contexts
