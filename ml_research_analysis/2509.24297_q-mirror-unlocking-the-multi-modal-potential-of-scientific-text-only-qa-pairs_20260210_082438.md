# Q-Mirror: Unlocking the Multi-Modal Potential of Scientific Text-Only QA Pairs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24297
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24297
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Q-Mirror improves MMQA quality scores from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72% to 95%

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Q-Mirror, a systematic framework for transforming abundant text-only scientific QA pairs (TQAs) into high-quality multi-modal QA pairs (MMQAs). The authors first develop a comprehensive rubric evaluating MMQAs across three principles: information consistency, cross-modal integration, and standalone quality. They then construct two benchmarks—one for MMQA generation and another for MMQA quality evaluation—testing state-of-the-art models. Leveraging these benchmarks, they design Q-Mirror, an agentic system that iteratively refines TQAs into MMQAs by integrating generation and evaluation in a closed loop. Experiments show that while current models can generate MMQAs, they struggle with factual accuracy and scientific plausibility. Q-Mirror improves average quality scores from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72% to 95%, demonstrating its effectiveness in scaling up multi-modal scientific data for advanced AI model training and evaluation.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a comprehensive rubric to evaluate multi-modal QA pairs across three dimensions: information consistency, cross-modal integration, and standalone quality. Using this rubric, they construct two benchmarks—one for MMQA generation and another for quality evaluation. Q-Mirror, their agentic framework, iteratively refines text-only QA pairs into multi-modal ones by integrating generation and evaluation in a closed loop. The system leverages the benchmarks to guide and assess each refinement step, systematically improving quality metrics. Experiments demonstrate that while current models can generate MMQAs, they face challenges with factual accuracy and scientific plausibility, which Q-Mirror addresses through iterative refinement.

## Key Results
- Q-Mirror improves average MMQA quality scores from 78.90 to 85.22
- Pass rates increase from 72% to 95% after iterative refinement
- Current models struggle with factual accuracy and scientific plausibility in generated MMQAs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Q-Mirror works by creating a closed-loop system where generation and evaluation models iteratively refine text-only QA pairs into multi-modal ones. The framework leverages two benchmarks: one for generating candidate MMQAs and another for evaluating their quality. This iterative process allows the system to progressively correct errors and improve cross-modal integration, addressing the limitations of standalone generation models. By grounding the refinement process in a comprehensive rubric, Q-Mirror ensures that generated MMQAs meet standards for information consistency, cross-modal integration, and standalone quality.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-modal QA generation**: Converting text-only QA pairs into multi-modal formats by adding relevant images, diagrams, or other media to enhance comprehension and integration.
*Why needed*: Scientific texts often contain complex visual information that can significantly improve understanding when properly integrated with text.
*Quick check*: Can the system identify which scientific concepts would benefit most from visual representation?

**Closed-loop refinement**: Using evaluation feedback to iteratively improve generated outputs rather than relying on single-pass generation.
*Why needed*: Initial MMQA generation often produces errors that require multiple refinement cycles to correct.
*Quick check*: Does each iteration demonstrably improve quality metrics?

**Quality rubrics for multi-modal content**: Establishing systematic criteria for evaluating information consistency, cross-modal integration, and standalone quality in MMQAs.
*Why needed*: Without standardized evaluation criteria, it's difficult to measure and compare the effectiveness of MMQA generation approaches.
*Quick check*: Do human evaluators consistently apply the rubric across different MMQAs?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Text QA pairs -> Generation Model -> MMQA Candidates -> Evaluation Model -> Quality Scores -> Iterative Refinement -> Final MMQAs

**Critical path**: The closed-loop between generation and evaluation models is critical—each refinement iteration depends on accurate quality assessment to guide improvements.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes quality over speed, accepting the computational cost of multiple iterations to achieve higher accuracy and consistency. This tradeoff is justified by the need for high-quality training data in scientific applications.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Poor cross-modal integration: Generated images don't complement the text or answer the question
- Information inconsistency: Visual elements contradict or misrepresent textual information
- Standalone quality issues: MMQAs that work only when text and image are viewed together, not independently

**3 first experiments**:
1. Generate MMQAs from a small set of scientific TQAs using baseline models without refinement
2. Apply Q-Mirror's iterative refinement to the same set and measure quality improvements
3. Test whether Q-Mirror-generated MMQAs improve performance on downstream scientific QA tasks compared to text-only data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations

- Human evaluation scores lack reported inter-rater reliability metrics, raising questions about consistency
- Benchmarks may be subject to overfitting, as pre-registration status is not disclosed
- Generalizability to non-scientific domains remains untested

## Confidence

- **High**: Current models struggle with factual accuracy and scientific plausibility in MMQA generation
- **Medium**: Q-Mirror improves quality metrics from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72% to 95%
- **Medium**: Q-Mirror effectively scales multi-modal scientific data for AI training without downstream performance validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct inter-rater reliability analysis for human evaluation scores and report Cohen's kappa or similar metrics
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each refinement iteration in Q-Mirror
3. Test Q-Mirror-generated MMQAs on a held-out set of scientific QA tasks to measure actual performance improvements in downstream models
