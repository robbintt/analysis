- Human-annotated benchmark revealing Arabic LLMs excel at surface fluency but struggle with deep grammatical and syntactic reasoning

## Executive Summary
AraLingBench is a fully human-annotated benchmark designed to evaluate Arabic large language models on core linguistic competencies including grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax. It contains 150 expert-designed multiple-choice questions, evenly distributed across the five categories. Evaluation of 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs revealed that models demonstrate strong surface-level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. Even top-performing models showed significant variance across categories, with syntax consistently proving the most difficult. The benchmark highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension.

## Method Summary
The benchmark spans five linguistic categories (grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, syntax) with 30 questions each, totaling 150 expert-designed multiple-choice questions. Questions were constructed through a four-phase process: generation, difficulty filtering, expert quality control, and difficulty annotation. The evaluation uses zero-shot prompting with Arabic-only questions and A–D multiple-choice options, extracting single-letter responses for accuracy computation. Models range from 350M to 70B parameters and are evaluated across Open Arabic LLM Leaderboard variants.

## Key Results
- Spelling and Reading Comprehension are easiest (median ~58–60% accuracy)
- Syntax proves most challenging (median ~48% accuracy) across all models
- Grammar and morphology show high correlation (r=0.83), suggesting coupled development
- Synthetic-trained models achieve high knowledge benchmark scores but underperform linguistically
- Retrieval-augmented evaluation negatively correlates with linguistic competence (r=−0.539)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Skill Isolation Through Linguistic Category Design
Partitioning evaluation into distinct categories exposes differential competence that aggregated benchmarks miss. Each category targets specific linguistic phenomena requiring different representational substrates, from orthographic patterns in spelling to hierarchical compositional reasoning in syntax.

### Mechanism 2: Correlation Structure Reveals Representational Clustering
High correlation between grammar and morphology (r=0.83) suggests shared dependence on word-internal structure, while weak syntax correlations (r≈0.13–0.40) indicate sentence-level processing requires distinct mechanisms beyond surface patterns.

### Mechanism 3: Training Regime Divergence Between Knowledge and Linguistic Benchmarks
Models tuned on synthetic instruction data achieve high knowledge-benchmark scores but underperform on linguistic evaluation, indicating memorization shortcuts rather than genuine competence. Negative correlation with retrieval-augmented evaluation reveals external retrieval substitutes for internalized linguistic understanding.

## Foundational Learning

- **Morphological Richness and Templatic Structure**: Arabic morphology involves root-and-pattern derivation (e.g., k-t-b → kataba, kitāb, kātib). Models treating words as atomic tokens cannot capture these regularities. *Quick check*: Can you explain why "correct spelling often depends on syntactic case or agreement" in Arabic?

- **Surface Fluency vs. Structural Competence**: The paper's central claim is that fluent output does not imply grammatical understanding. This distinction underlies the benchmark's diagnostic purpose. *Quick check*: Why might a model correctly spell "ازدحام" yet fail to parse its grammatical function in a sentence?

- **Evaluation Construct Validity**: The paper argues existing benchmarks (ArabicMMLU, EXAMS) test factual recall rather than linguistic competence. Understanding this distinction is prerequisite to interpreting AraLingBench results. *Quick check*: What would it mean for a benchmark to have high face validity but low construct validity for linguistic competence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: 150 questions → 5 categories (30 each) → Grammar, Morphology, Spelling, Reading Comprehension, Syntax → 4-phase construction → 50 Easy, 74 Medium, 26 Hard → 3-4 option MCQs → Zero-shot evaluation

- **Critical path**: Zero-shot prompt construction → Model inference → Single-letter extraction → Accuracy computation → Cross-benchmark correlation analysis

- **Design tradeoffs**: 150 questions enables expert-quality annotation but limits statistical power; medium-difficulty skew maximizes discriminative power but may ceiling-effect top performers; zero-shot evaluation prevents contamination but may underestimate capability

- **Failure signatures**: Non-monotonic difficulty scaling indicates human-model difficulty misalignment; syntax consistently lowest suggests structural reasoning bottleneck; synthetic-trained models showing high ArabicMMLU / low AraLingBench divergence

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce Table 3 on your model to identify category-specific weaknesses; 2) Compute per-category correlation matrix to verify skill clustering matches r=0.83 grammar-morphology pattern; 3) Compare zero-shot vs. 5-shot performance to test whether prompting alone closes the syntax gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. What inductive biases or architectural modifications could enable models to acquire genuine syntactic competence in Arabic, given that syntax shows weak correlation with other linguistic skills and remains hardest even for top performers?

2. How should benchmark difficulty be calibrated to align human-annotated difficulty with actual model challenge, given observed non-monotonic scaling where models sometimes perform better on "Hard" than "Medium" questions?

3. What training data characteristics or instruction-tuning strategies specifically improve genuine linguistic competence versus surface-level pattern recognition?

## Limitations

- Benchmark covers Modern Standard Arabic but may not generalize to dialectal variations
- Human difficulty ratings may not align with model-perceived difficulty due to pattern frequency effects
- Zero-shot evaluation methodology may underestimate true model capabilities with appropriate prompting

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Arabic LLMs show strong performance on spelling and reading comprehension but struggle with syntax (median 48% vs 58-60%)
- **Medium confidence**: Grammar and morphology form coupled subsystem distinct from syntax based on correlation patterns
- **Low confidence**: Synthetic instruction data specifically causes memorization rather than genuine linguistic understanding

## Next Checks

1. Apply the same five-category framework to morphologically rich languages like Hebrew or Turkish to test whether grammar-morphology coupling and syntax dissociation generalizes beyond Arabic

2. Systematically vary proportion of synthetic vs. natural Arabic text in model training while controlling for model size, then measure impacts on AraLingBench performance

3. Have professional Arabic linguists independently review stratified sample of 20 questions from each category to assess whether questions truly measure intended linguistic phenomena
