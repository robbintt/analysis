# FutureX-Pro: Extending Future Prediction to High-Value Vertical Domains

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.12259
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12259
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Less than 50% accuracy in finance; retrieval insufficiencies drive high refusal rates across domains

## Executive Summary
FutureX-Pro extends the contamination-free, live-evaluation pipeline of FutureX to benchmark agentic LLMs on future prediction tasks across four high-value verticals: Finance, Retail, Public Health, and Natural Disaster. By requiring models to make verifiable predictions on events that have not yet occurred, the framework ensures evaluation reflects genuine reasoning rather than memorization. Results reveal significant performance gaps—top models achieve under 50% accuracy in finance, and domain-specific data retrieval remains challenging, especially for government and proprietary sources. The framework introduces probabilistic prediction tasks and distinguishes between retrieval failures and safety-based refusals.

## Method Summary
FutureX-Pro adapts the contamination-free, live-evaluation pipeline from FutureX to benchmark agentic LLMs on future prediction tasks across four verticals. Inputs include 150 equities (US/China), 240 retail products, 70 weekly public health templates, and 92 natural disaster templates sourced from authoritative feeds. Scoring uses domain-specific metrics: strict 5% tolerance for finance, probabilistic expected scores for retail, and relative error scoring for public health and disaster. The framework also includes FutureX-Search, converting historical prediction tasks into multi-hop retrieval challenges. Evaluation proceeds via agent tool-augmented retrieval, prediction output, post-event ground truth collection, domain-specific scoring, and leaderboard aggregation.

## Key Results
- Even top models score under 50% in finance due to strict 5% tolerance
- Retrieval insufficiencies cause high refusal rates—DeepSeek 46%, Qwen 28%, Gemini 24% in natural disaster tasks
- Probabilistic tasks reveal superior calibration for most models compared to deterministic point estimates
- Level 3 (implicit entity resolution) tasks show a ~28-point drop from Level 1 performance, indicating unsolved reasoning challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Live evaluation on future events prevents training-data contamination from inflating benchmark scores.
- Mechanism: By querying verifiable events that have not yet occurred, the pipeline ensures models cannot retrieve memorized answers and must instead perform genuine synthesis of heterogeneous signals.
- Core assumption: The prediction target has zero probability of appearing in pre-training or fine-tuning corpora before evaluation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "adapts the contamination-free, live-evaluation pipeline of FutureX"
  - [Section 1]: "FutureX-Pro leverages the 'contamination-impossible by design' architecture of FutureX"
  - [corpus]: FutureX (arxiv 2508.11987) established this live-benchmark foundation.
- Break condition: If future-event templates leak into training data, or if the model gains real-time access to ground truth during inference.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Probabilistic output formats reveal superior uncertainty calibration compared to brittle point estimates.
- Mechanism: Scoring computes the expected value over the model's predicted distribution, rewarding assignments of higher probability to values near ground truth—capturing "high-probability neighborhoods" rather than single-shot accuracy.
- Core assumption: Well-calibrated uncertainty is actionable for downstream decision-making (e.g., inventory risk buffers).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.3]: "final score is the Expected Score under the agent's predicted distribution"
  - [Section 3.4]: "Probabilistic Advantage" — most models score higher on Task 2b/3b than Task 1b
  - [corpus]: Weak — no direct corpus support for this specific scoring mechanism.
- Break condition: If models output poorly calibrated probabilities or if the scoring function fails to distinguish calibration from random guessing.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Observed refusals in high-stakes domains primarily reflect retrieval failures, not safety alignment.
- Mechanism: When ground truth is provably accessible (one model retrieves it), other models' "data not available" responses indicate False Negative Retrieval rather than policy-driven abstention.
- Core assumption: If any model succeeds, the information exists publicly and is retrievable with sufficient search capability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "distinguishes between retrieval failures and safety-based refusals"
  - [Section 5.3, Insight 3]: "Search Insufficiency is a primary driver" — "False Negative in Retrieval"
  - [corpus]: Weak — no direct corpus support for this decomposition.
- Break condition: If data is actually gated, proprietary, or policy-blocked in ways the successful model bypasses illegitimately.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Relative Error Scoring with Strict Tolerance
  - Why needed here: High-value domains penalize small errors heavily; Finance uses a 5% tolerance window where larger errors score zero.
  - Quick check question: Given ground truth y=100 and prediction ŷ=97, what is the score using S = max(0, 1 − |ŷ−y|/(y×ε)) with ε=0.05?

- Concept: Expected Score Under Predicted Distribution
  - Why needed here: Retail probabilistic tasks weight each candidate by its assigned probability, requiring understanding of expectation over discrete distributions.
  - Quick check question: If a model outputs distribution {50: 0.7, 60: 0.3} and ground truth is 50 with S(50,50)=1, S(60,50)=0.5, what is the final score?

- Concept: Multi-hop Entity Resolution
  - Why needed here: FutureX-Search Level 3 masks entities (e.g., "currency of country X"), requiring implicit identification before retrieval.
  - Quick check question: Given "the currency used in the land of the rising sun" as a mask, what is the implied entity and what search query would you issue?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: FutureX-Finance -> FutureX-Retail -> FutureX-PublicHealth -> FutureX-NaturalDisaster -> FutureX-Search
- Critical path: Question instantiation → Agent tool-augmented retrieval → Prediction output → Ground-truth collection (post-event) → Domain-specific scoring → Leaderboard aggregation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Strict tolerance (5%) yields lower absolute scores but better differentiation; relaxing it inflates all scores uniformly.
  - Probabilistic formats increase evaluation complexity but surface calibration quality invisible to point estimates.
  - Aggressive retrieval (low refusal) maximizes coverage but may surface low-confidence outputs; conservative thresholds improve precision at coverage cost.
- Failure signatures:
  - High refusal rate (>20%) with accessible ground truth → Search pipeline insufficiency
  - Large gap between probabilistic and deterministic task scores → Poor calibration
  - Level 1 >> Level 3 performance gap (>25 points) → Weak implicit entity resolution
  - Consistent ~50% ceiling across SOTA models → Benchmark may be at or beyond current capability frontier
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run 2–3 baseline models on FutureX-Finance Task 1 only to calibrate scoring sensitivity and confirm the 5% threshold produces meaningful score separation.
  2. Compare Retail Task 1a vs. 1b across models to quantify the delta from historical context and validate that trend-extrapolation signal is being captured.
  3. Analyze NaturalDisaster refusal responses, cross-referencing with GPT-5-High's successful retrievals, to classify failures as retrieval-capability vs. policy-safety.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What mechanisms enable agents to perform implicit entity resolution from vague descriptions without explicit instruction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "Implicit Entity Resolution—the ability to identify a search target from a vague description without explicit instruction—remains an unsolved challenge" with a "glass ceiling" at approximately 54% on Level 3 FutureX-Search tasks.
- Why unresolved: Current SOTA models show a ~28-point drop from direct retrieval to implicit multi-hop retrieval, indicating fundamental architectural limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of agents achieving 70%+ accuracy on Level 3 tasks, or architectural analysis identifying which components enable vs. hinder implicit resolution.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can evaluation frameworks systematically distinguish between capability-based refusals (search failure) and policy-based refusals (safety alignment)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion calls for "disentangling Capability from Safety" and notes that "alignment strategies must distinguish between avoiding harm (Policy-Based Refusal) and failing to find data (Capability-Based Refusal)."
- Why unresolved: Current error analysis relies on qualitative inspection of refusal responses; no automated classification method exists.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validated taxonomy and automated classifier for refusal types, demonstrated through controlled experiments where ground truth data availability is known.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does Grok-4 maintain stable performance across retrieval complexity levels while other models show steep degradation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes Grok-4's "invariance" as "a remarkable anomaly"—scoring 53.8% across both Level 1 and Level 3—and hypothesizes its architecture "prioritizes deep semantic alignment over raw knowledge indexing."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the phenomenon but does not conduct architectural ablation or comparative analysis to explain it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying Grok-4's components, or comparative analysis against models with known architectural differences on controlled query complexity.

## Limitations

- Domain Coverage Gaps: Sample sizes are uneven across verticals, making cross-domain comparisons non-trivial.
- Scoring Sensitivity: The 5% tolerance in Finance may overstate model weaknesses in domains where such precision is less critical.
- Search Pipeline Opacity: Full transparency into search tool configurations and rate limits is lacking, complicating validation of refusal decompositions.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Contamination-free evaluation design and identification of retrieval insufficiencies are well-supported.
- Medium Confidence: Model performance rankings are reproducible, but absolute score interpretations depend on domain-specific tolerances.
- Low Confidence: The minimal safety-based refusals claim relies on indirect evidence and assumptions about equal data access.

## Next Checks

1. Validate Refusal Decomposition: Run a controlled experiment where the same queries are issued to models with identical search tools and rate limits to confirm that refusal differences are due to retrieval capability rather than policy or tool access.

2. Stress Test Scoring Sensitivity: Modify the Finance tolerance threshold (e.g., 5% → 10%) and re-score baseline models to quantify how much performance is due to calibration vs. precision constraints.

3. Audit Data Source Stability: Replicate the HTML extraction pipeline for Temu snapshots and verify that the "sold recently" and review-growth signals are consistently retrievable over time, or replace with a more stable data source if needed.
