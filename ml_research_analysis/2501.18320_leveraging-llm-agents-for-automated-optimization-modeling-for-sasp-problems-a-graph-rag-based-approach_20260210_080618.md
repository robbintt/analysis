# Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.18320
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18320
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Proposed MAG-RAG approach achieves better completeness and correctness metrics on ten classical SASP problems compared to existing AOM benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of automated optimization modeling (AOM) for sensor array signal processing (SASP) problems, where traditional prompt-based techniques fail due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge. The proposed approach, MAG-RAG, combines a multi-agent (MA) structure with a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-RAG) process to enhance modeling results. The MA structure decomposes the problem-solving process into manageable sub-tasks, while Graph-RAG retrieves relevant domain-specific knowledge to improve the optimization modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that MAG-RAG outperforms several AOM benchmarks, achieving better completeness and correctness metrics.

## Method Summary
The MAG-RAG approach integrates a multi-agent structure with graph-based retrieval-augmented generation to address automated optimization modeling for SASP problems. The method decomposes complex SASP problems into manageable sub-tasks through a multi-agent framework, while simultaneously leveraging a graph-based retrieval system to access domain-specific knowledge. This combination allows the system to overcome the limitations of traditional prompt-based approaches that struggle with domain knowledge gaps. The graph-based retrieval component specifically targets relevant SASP domain knowledge, which is then used to inform and enhance the optimization modeling process across ten classical SASP problem instances.

## Key Results
- MAG-RAG outperforms several AOM benchmarks on ten classical SASP problems
- The approach achieves better completeness metrics compared to traditional methods
- MAG-RAG demonstrates improved correctness in optimization modeling results
- The framework effectively integrates domain-specific knowledge into the modeling process

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by combining two complementary mechanisms: multi-agent decomposition and graph-based knowledge retrieval. The multi-agent structure breaks down complex SASP problems into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks that can be handled by specialized agents, reducing the cognitive load on any single component. Simultaneously, the graph-based retrieval system provides access to relevant domain-specific knowledge that traditional prompting approaches lack. This combination allows the system to leverage both structured problem decomposition and contextual knowledge, resulting in more accurate and complete optimization models.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-agent systems: Why needed - to decompose complex problems into manageable sub-tasks; Quick check - verify agent coordination and task allocation work correctly
- Graph-based retrieval: Why needed - to access domain-specific knowledge beyond standard prompting; Quick check - ensure retrieval accuracy and relevance
- Retrieval-augmented generation: Why needed - to enhance model outputs with external knowledge; Quick check - validate knowledge integration quality
- Domain-specific knowledge graphs: Why needed - to capture SASP domain expertise; Quick check - verify graph coverage and accuracy
- Automated optimization modeling: Why needed - to reduce manual effort in creating optimization models; Quick check - compare against manual modeling quality
- Sensor array signal processing: Why needed - the target application domain; Quick check - validate problem formulation accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Problem Input -> Multi-Agent Decomposition -> Graph-Based Retrieval -> Knowledge Integration -> Optimization Model Output

Critical path: The most critical path is from problem decomposition through knowledge retrieval to model generation. If any agent fails to properly decompose the problem, or if the graph retrieval fails to find relevant knowledge, the final optimization model quality will degrade significantly.

Design tradeoffs: The approach trades computational complexity (multiple agents, graph retrieval) for improved accuracy and completeness. This is justified for SASP problems where accuracy is critical, but may be excessive for simpler optimization problems.

Failure signatures: 
- Poor problem decomposition leading to incomplete or incorrect sub-tasks
- Irrelevant knowledge retrieval resulting in model noise
- Agent coordination failures causing inconsistent sub-task results
- Graph construction issues leading to missing critical domain knowledge

First experiments:
1. Test individual agent performance on simple SASP sub-tasks
2. Validate graph retrieval accuracy on known SASP domain concepts
3. Evaluate end-to-end performance on a single SASP problem before scaling to all ten

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability beyond SASP problems without validation
- Missing detailed performance comparison data against specific benchmarks
- Insufficient implementation details for reproducing the approach
- Focus on classical SASP problems may not reflect real-world complexity

## Confidence
- Core claims about MAG-RAG's superiority: Medium
- Generalizability of the approach: Low
- Technical implementation details: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component (multi-agent structure vs. Graph-RAG retrieval) to the overall performance improvement.

2. Test the approach on non-SASP optimization problems to evaluate generalizability and identify any domain-specific limitations.

3. Implement the same ten SASP problems using competing frameworks from the neighbor corpus (LinearizeLLM, OPT-BENCH, etc.) for direct performance comparison under identical conditions.
