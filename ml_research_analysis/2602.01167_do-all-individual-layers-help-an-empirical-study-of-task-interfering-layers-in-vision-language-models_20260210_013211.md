# Do All Individual Layers Help? An Empirical Study of Task-Interfering Layers in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.01167
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01167
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Zeroing specific layers in vision-language models can improve task performance by bypassing interfering representations

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates the phenomenon of task-interfering layers in pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where zeroing a single layer's parameters can improve performance on certain tasks. The authors introduce the Task-Layer Interaction Vector to quantify each task's sensitivity to layer interventions and find that tasks requiring similar cognitive abilities exhibit highly correlated response patterns. Building on these findings, they propose TaLo (Task-Adaptive Layer Knockout), a training-free, test-time adaptation method that dynamically identifies and bypasses the most interfering layer for a given task. TaLo improves performance across multiple models and datasets, achieving up to a 16.6% accuracy gain on Qwen-VL for the Maps task in ScienceQA.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted systematic ablation studies by zeroing individual layers in pretrained VLMs and measuring performance changes across various tasks. They introduced the Task-Layer Interaction Vector to quantify how each task responds to layer interventions. Based on the observation that tasks with similar cognitive requirements show correlated layer sensitivity patterns, they developed TaLo - a test-time adaptation method that identifies and bypasses the most interfering layer for each task. The approach is training-free and operates by analyzing layer-wise contributions at inference time to dynamically select optimal layer configurations for different task types.

## Key Results
- Task-interfering layers are systematically observed across multiple VLMs, where zeroing specific layers improves performance on certain tasks
- Tasks requiring similar cognitive abilities exhibit highly correlated layer sensitivity patterns, as quantified by the Task-Layer Interaction Vector
- TaLo method achieves up to 16.6% accuracy improvement on Qwen-VL for the Maps task in ScienceQA
- Improvements are consistent across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating practical utility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper does not provide a theoretical mechanism for why task-interfering layers exist. The findings are empirical observations showing that certain layers in VLMs can degrade performance on specific tasks, and bypassing these layers through zeroing or dynamic selection improves outcomes. The Task-Layer Interaction Vector captures quantitative patterns in how different tasks respond to layer interventions, but the underlying reasons for these interference effects remain unexplained.

## Foundational Learning
- **Task-Layer Interaction Vector:** A quantitative measure of how each task responds to zeroing individual layers; needed to identify interfering layers systematically and to guide test-time adaptation
- **Vision-Language Model architecture:** Understanding the layered structure and cross-modal integration in VLMs; needed to identify which layers to intervene on and to interpret interference patterns
- **Zero-shot vs few-shot learning:** Different evaluation paradigms that affect how layer interventions impact performance; needed to understand the generalizability of findings
- **Cognitive task similarity:** How tasks requiring similar abilities show correlated layer sensitivity patterns; needed to group tasks and predict interfering layers
- **Test-time adaptation:** Methods that modify model behavior at inference without retraining; needed to implement the TaLo approach
- **Layer-wise ablation analysis:** Systematic evaluation of individual layer contributions; needed to identify interfering layers and validate the Task-Layer Interaction Vector

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Vision encoder -> Cross-attention layers -> Language decoder -> Output layer

**Critical path:** Input images and text are encoded separately, then combined through cross-attention mechanisms across multiple layers, with final outputs generated through the language decoder

**Design tradeoffs:** The study focuses on pretrained VLMs with fixed architectures, examining whether all layers contribute positively to all tasks, revealing that some layers may introduce interference rather than help

**Failure signatures:** Performance degradation on specific tasks when all layers are active, with improvement when interfering layers are bypassed or zeroed

**First experiments:**
1. Zero individual layers in a pretrained VLM and measure performance changes across multiple tasks
2. Compute Task-Layer Interaction Vectors for different task types to identify similarity patterns
3. Implement TaLo method to dynamically select optimal layer configurations at test time

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Empirical findings lack theoretical grounding for why task-interfering layers exist
- Focus on zero-shot or few-shot settings may not generalize to fine-tuned scenarios
- Study primarily examines specific VLM architectural designs, potentially limiting broader applicability
- Improvement effectiveness varies significantly across tasks and models, suggesting context-dependent utility

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Empirical observations of task-interfering layers | High |
| TaLo method's practical utility | Medium |
| Theoretical implications and explanations | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test TaLo's effectiveness when vision-language models are fine-tuned on downstream tasks rather than used in zero-shot or few-shot settings
2. Evaluate whether the Task-Layer Interaction Vector patterns hold for vision-language models with different architectural designs (e.g., different vision encoders or cross-attention mechanisms)
3. Investigate the relationship between task-interfering layers and specific model components (attention heads, feed-forward networks) to understand which submodules contribute most to interference effects
