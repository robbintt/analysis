# Generation, Evaluation, and Explanation of Novelists' Styles with Single-Token Prompts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.20459
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20459
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Novelists' style generation and evaluation using single-token prompts with 82% agreement rate

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a framework for generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists using large language models. The approach uses single-token prompts to condition generation and employs a DeBERTa classifier for evaluation. Full fine-tuning of GPT-Neo 1.3B achieved 82% agreement with expected author labels when evaluated by high-confidence predictions from the classifier. Attention enrichment and integrated gradients analyses confirmed that author tags are actively referenced and influence token generation. Syntactic comparisons showed that generated sentences closely mirror the structural patterns of authentic texts. LoRA provided an efficient alternative but with lower stylistic fidelity.

## Method Summary
The framework conditions generation on author identity through single-token prompts and evaluates output using a DeBERTa-based classifier. Full fine-tuning of GPT-Neo 1.3B achieves 82% agreement with expected author labels. The approach employs attention enrichment and integrated gradients to verify that author conditioning influences generation. Syntactic pattern matching confirms structural fidelity to source texts. The method enables unsupervised stylometric analysis without requiring paired training data.

## Key Results
- Full fine-tuning of GPT-Neo 1.3B achieved 82% agreement with expected author labels
- Attention enrichment and integrated gradients confirmed author tags actively influence token generation
- Generated sentences closely mirror syntactic patterns of authentic 19th-century texts
- LoRA provided efficient alternative with lower stylistic fidelity than full fine-tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by conditioning generation on single-token author prompts, which the language model uses to reference learned stylistic patterns. The DeBERTa classifier evaluates generated text by comparing it against learned author-specific features. Attention enrichment reveals which input tokens most influence generation decisions, while integrated gradients quantify the contribution of each token to the final output. This combination allows the system to generate text that captures author-specific syntactic and stylistic patterns without requiring paired training examples.

## Foundational Learning
- **Single-token prompting**: Using a single word to condition generation on author identity
  - Why needed: Enables precise stylistic control without lengthy prompts
  - Quick check: Verify the model generates appropriate style from minimal input
- **DeBERTa classifier**: Bidirectional encoder representations for evaluation
  - Why needed: Provides accurate author attribution for generated text
  - Quick check: Test classifier accuracy on held-out author texts
- **Attention enrichment**: Analyzing which tokens influence generation decisions
  - Why needed: Verifies conditioning signals are properly utilized
  - Quick check: Compare attention patterns with and without author tags
- **Integrated gradients**: Quantifying token contributions to model outputs
  - Why needed: Provides interpretable explanations of stylistic influences
  - Quick check: Measure gradient changes when removing author conditioning
- **Syntactic pattern matching**: Comparing structural features between generated and authentic text
  - Why needed: Validates preservation of author-specific writing patterns
  - Quick check: Measure similarity of sentence structures across corpora
- **LoRA fine-tuning**: Parameter-efficient adaptation using low-rank matrices
  - Why needed: Provides efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning
  - Quick check: Compare performance and parameter efficiency against full fine-tuning

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Author token -> GPT-Neo 1.3B (fine-tuned) -> Generated text -> DeBERTa classifier -> Style evaluation -> Attention/IG analysis

### Critical Path
Single-token author prompt → conditioned generation → classifier evaluation → interpretability analysis

### Design Tradeoffs
- Full fine-tuning vs. LoRA: Higher fidelity vs. parameter efficiency
- Classifier-based vs. human evaluation: Scalability vs. qualitative assessment
- Single-token vs. multi-token prompts: Precision vs. expressiveness

### Failure Signatures
- Low classifier confidence across all authors indicates poor conditioning
- Attention enrichment showing uniform patterns suggests conditioning signals ignored
- Integrated gradients revealing minimal author token contributions indicates ineffective fine-tuning

### First 3 Experiments
1. Test generation from single-token prompts for each author to verify conditioning
2. Evaluate classifier accuracy on authentic texts before testing generated outputs
3. Compare attention patterns with and without author conditioning to verify signal utilization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Classifier-based evaluation creates potential circularity in training and validation
- Lacks human evaluation to validate deeper authorial qualities beyond surface patterns
- 1.3B parameter model size limits scalability to more complex generation tasks
- Focus on 19th-century English novelists constrains generalizability

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Model performance metrics (82% agreement rate, syntactic similarity results)
**Medium confidence**: Interpretability findings (attention enrichment, integrated gradients), classifier-based evaluation framework
**Low confidence**: Claims about capturing authorial style qualities without human validation, generalizability beyond tested authors

## Next Checks
1. Conduct blind human evaluation comparing generated sentences against authentic author texts to validate classifier-based stylistic assessments
2. Test the framework on multiple literary periods and non-English corpora to evaluate cross-cultural and temporal generalizability
3. Implement ablation studies removing the author conditioning to quantify the specific contribution of single-token prompts to stylistic generation quality
