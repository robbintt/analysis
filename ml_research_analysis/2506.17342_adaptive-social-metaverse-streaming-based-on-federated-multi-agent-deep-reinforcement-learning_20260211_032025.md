# Adaptive Social Metaverse Streaming based on Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.17342
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17342
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions.

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces ASMS, an adaptive social metaverse streaming system that combines federated learning with multi-agent reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust streaming bitrates while preserving user privacy. The system addresses the challenge of providing high-quality, low-latency streaming in social metaverse environments where multiple users share network resources. By distributing training across local XR headsets and aggregating model updates at an edge server, ASMS learns a generalized adaptive streaming policy without centralizing sensitive user data. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in user experience compared to traditional streaming methods.

## Method Summary
ASMS integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to create a privacy-preserving adaptive streaming system. The approach models multiple users as cooperative agents in a Dec-POMDP, with each local agent (on XR headsets) training on network state data and sending only gradient updates to a global aggregator. The system uses Federated Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO) with Local Differential Privacy (LDP) protection. Key components include a 2-layer MLP architecture (128 neurons), actor-critic networks, and a custom QoE reward function that penalizes motion-to-photon latency, jitter, and packet loss. Training occurs over 330 episodes with 12,000 total time steps, using FedAvg aggregation every 4 iterations.

## Key Results
- ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions
- The system successfully learns cooperative bitrate allocation strategies that prevent network congestion while maintaining quality
- Federated learning enables privacy preservation without sacrificing streaming performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Distributing training via Federated Learning allows learning a generalized adaptive streaming policy across users without centralizing sensitive biometric or behavioral data.
- **Mechanism:** Local agents train on local data samples (network states, jitter, latency) and send only gradient updates to a global aggregator, which averages them using FedAvg to update a global model.
- **Core assumption:** The distribution of data across devices is sufficiently similar such that averaging local gradients results in a useful global policy.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)... while preserving user privacy."
  - [section III.C] "Step 4: Model Aggregation... central server then updates and trains the new global model... using the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) method."
  - [corpus] *Metaverse Security and Privacy Research: A Systematic Review* highlights the general vulnerability of user data in metaverse systems.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Treating multiple users as a cooperative Multi-Agent system allows the network to optimize global Quality of Experience (QoE) rather than greedily maximizing individual bandwidth.
- **Mechanism:** The system is modeled as a Dec-POMDP where agents receive a global reward (average QoE of all users), forcing them to learn cooperative behaviors.
- **Core assumption:** The defined QoE equation accurately reflects human perception and that "motion-to-photon" latency penalties are linear or exponential as modeled.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section III.A] "After applying the joint bit rate adjustment... the environment returns a global reward... average the QoE values to obtain the global reward."
  - [section I] "In social metaverse streaming, multiple users usually share a bottleneck network... how to allocate network resources... is important."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Injecting noise into model updates via Local Differential Privacy creates mathematical guarantees against inference attacks while maintaining streaming policy integrity.
- **Mechanism:** Agents perturb their model gradients using the Laplacian mechanism before sending updates to the server.
- **Core assumption:** The selected privacy budget and sensitivity effectively mask individual data points without destroying the model's ability to converge.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section III.C] "Step 3: LDP Protection... perturbs its local model gradients using the Laplacian mechanism."
  - [section I] "ASMS integrates local differential privacy (LDP) to protect user data during training."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - **Why needed here:** PPO drives the bitrate decisions and uses a clipped objective to prevent the policy from changing too drastically in a single update.
  - **Quick check question:** What prevents the PPO agent from jumping to a terrible bitrate policy during a bad network spike? (Answer: The clipping function limits the update step size).

- **Concept:** **Motion-to-Photon (MTP) Latency**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the primary physical constraint in VR/Metaverse systems, representing time between head movement and screen update.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is MTP latency prioritized over simple packet loss in the reward function? (Answer: Because latency directly induces physical sickness in users, whereas packet loss might only cause visual artifacts).

- **Concept:** **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**
  - **Why needed here:** GAE calculates how "good" an action was, balancing bias vs. variance when estimating future rewards.
  - **Quick check question:** If λ=1, the estimator has high variance; if λ=0, high bias. What does the paper set λ to? (Answer: 0.95).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - XR Headsets (Quest 2/HoloLens) -> Local Agent (Inference + Training) -> Edge Server (Aggregator + Rendering Server) -> Network (Wireless Router + Socket.IO)

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Sensing:** Client measures network state (Jitter, Loss, Latency)
  2. **Decision:** Local Agent runs inference on state to output bitrate action
  3. **Execution:** Rendering Server receives action, encodes frame at target bitrate, streams via WebRTC
  4. **Learning (FL Loop):** Client computes gradient updates locally → Adds LDP noise → Sends to Global Agent → Global Agent aggregates → Broadcasts new model

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Communication vs. Computation:** Offloads rendering to edge (saving local battery) but introduces network dependency
  - **LDP vs. Accuracy:** Higher privacy (lower ε) implies noisier gradients, requiring more training rounds to converge

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Cybersickness Spike:** Indicates QoE penalty for latency is set too low, or agent prioritizes high bitrate over low latency
  - **Model Divergence:** Local agents stop improving, likely caused by non-IID data disrupting FedAvg convergence
  - **Stall/Rebuffering:** Agent selects a bitrate higher than available bandwidth estimation suggests

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Static Policy vs. F-MAPPO):** Run with fixed bitrate (50Mbps) vs. trained agent in "Network Congestion" (S5) scenario to verify agent reduces bitrate when network shrinks
  2. **Privacy Budget Sweep:** Train three versions with ε = {0.1, 1.0, 10.0}, plot convergence speed vs. final QoE score to quantify "cost of privacy"
  3. **Multi-User Contention:** Connect max supported devices (3 headsets), force bandwidth bottleneck (30Mbps), observe if agents share bandwidth fairly or if one "starves" others

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the F-MAPPO framework be optimized to accelerate model convergence and maintain real-time adaptability when scaling to large numbers of concurrent users?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The conclusion states future work will focus on "accelerating model convergence to improve training efficiency and real-time adaptability to support large-scale users."
- **Why unresolved:** Current setup limited to 6 devices; unclear if current aggregation frequency and architecture can handle the "curse of dimensionality" or communication bottlenecks in large-scale, dense user environments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Scalability analysis demonstrating convergence speed and communication overhead with significantly more simulated agents (>50 users) in high-density scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How robust are the penalty coefficients of the proposed QoE model across a diverse demographic population compared to the limited pool of 8 participants?
- **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] Section IV-B notes grid search optimization conducted with only 8 participants.
- **Why unresolved:** Individual susceptibility to VR sickness varies significantly between users; a model tuned on small sample size risks overfitting to specific preferences.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Follow-up study with statistically significant sample size (N > 30) to validate coefficients remain stable across different age groups and VR experience levels.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What is the specific trade-off between the privacy budget (ε) in the Local Differential Privacy mechanism and the convergence speed of the global model?
- **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] Section III-C introduces LDP but Section IV-E presents training curves without isolating privacy noise intensity.
- **Why unresolved:** While system proves feasible, adding Laplacian noise theoretically slows convergence or lowers maximum achievable reward; extent of privacy degradation on 14% performance gain is not quantified.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation study plotting cumulative reward against training episodes for different ε values (high privacy vs. no privacy) to visualize cost of privacy on learning efficiency.

## Limitations

- **Underspecified privacy parameters:** Local Differential Privacy mechanism's parameters (privacy budget ε and sensitivity Δθ) are not explicitly defined
- **Incomplete architecture details:** Dynamic weighting scheme for FedAvg aggregation is referenced but not mathematically specified
- **Missing integration specifics:** Precise Unreal Engine integration details and WebRTC streaming pipeline are insufficiently described for exact reproduction

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Core algorithmic framework (F-MAPPO architecture, QoE reward formulation, FedAvg aggregation logic) is clearly specified and internally consistent
- **Medium confidence:** Privacy protection mechanism via LDP is conceptually sound but actual privacy guarantees remain uncertain without explicit parameter values
- **Medium confidence:** Experimental methodology is detailed enough for replication, though exact content and rendering pipeline are missing

## Next Checks

1. **Sanity Check (Static Policy vs. F-MAPPO):** Run with fixed bitrate (50Mbps) versus trained agent in "Network Congestion" (S5) scenario to verify agent reduces bitrate when network shrinks

2. **Privacy Budget Sweep:** Train three versions with ε = {0.1, 1.0, 10.0} and plot convergence speed versus final QoE score to quantify "cost of privacy"

3. **Multi-User Contention:** Connect maximum supported devices (3 headsets), force bandwidth bottleneck (30Mbps), observe if agents share bandwidth fairly or if one "starves" others
