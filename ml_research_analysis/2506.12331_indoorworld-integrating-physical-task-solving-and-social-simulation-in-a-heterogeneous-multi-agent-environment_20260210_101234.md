# IndoorWorld: Integrating Physical Task Solving and Social Simulation in A Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Environment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12331
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12331
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Heterogeneous multi-agent environment with 38 actions integrating physical tasks and social simulation

## Executive Summary
IndoorWorld addresses critical limitations in existing multi-agent environments by creating a platform that tightly integrates physical task solving with social simulation. The environment models agents with distinct roles, capabilities, and knowledge levels, enabling realistic interactions within indoor spaces. Unlike environments that either oversimplify agent individuality or lack physical grounding of social behaviors, IndoorWorld provides a unified framework for studying both collaborative physical tasks and social dynamics. The platform demonstrates that task prioritization significantly improves LLM agent performance in collaborative office tasks while providing architects with tools to evaluate resource allocation and spatial layout design.

## Method Summary
The platform employs a heterogeneous multi-agent architecture where agents possess different roles, capabilities, and knowledge levels within indoor environments. Physical task solving is grounded in realistic spatial constraints and agent capabilities, while social simulation incorporates role-based interactions and knowledge sharing. The environment supports 38 distinct actions ranging from physical movements to social interactions. LLM-based agents are integrated with task prioritization mechanisms to improve collaborative performance. Social scenarios include resource allocation and spatial layout evaluation, with feedback collected from architectural professionals to validate real-world relevance.

## Key Results
- Task prioritization improves LLM agent performance in collaborative office tasks
- Environment supports 38 distinct actions for physical and social interactions
- Architects found the tool relevant for understanding occupant behavior and spatial planning, though agent behavior realism needs improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration succeeds by maintaining consistency between physical capabilities and social behaviors through role-based agent design. Physical task solving provides the necessary grounding for social interactions, preventing the abstraction that occurs in purely social simulations. Task prioritization enables agents to balance competing demands effectively, mirroring human decision-making processes. The heterogeneous agent design ensures that interactions reflect realistic power dynamics, knowledge asymmetries, and capability differences found in real indoor environments.

## Foundational Learning
- Heterogeneous agent design: Why needed - captures real-world diversity in capabilities and roles; Quick check - verify agents have distinct action sets and knowledge bases
- Physical-social integration: Why needed - prevents unrealistic social behaviors disconnected from physical constraints; Quick check - ensure social actions respect spatial relationships and physical limitations
- Task prioritization mechanisms: Why needed - enables effective resource allocation under competing demands; Quick check - validate that agents consistently choose higher-priority tasks when conflicts arise

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: LLM Agent -> Task Prioritization -> Physical Action Engine -> Social Interaction Manager -> Environment State
- Critical path: Task assignment → prioritization decision → action selection → environment update → social consequence propagation
- Design tradeoffs: Realism vs. computational efficiency, agent complexity vs. scalability, physical accuracy vs. simulation speed
- Failure signatures: Agents getting stuck in local minima, unrealistic social interactions, task starvation, spatial conflicts
- First experiments: 1) Single agent completing sequential physical tasks, 2) Two agents collaborating on shared goal with competing priorities, 3) Social interaction evaluation in resource-constrained environment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- LLM-based evaluation may not fully capture human behavioral complexity
- Small architectural survey sample size (n=6) limits generalizability
- Agent behavior realism needs improvement according to domain experts
- Scalability with larger agent populations and complex spatial configurations untested

## Confidence
- High confidence: Physical task solving capabilities and 38-action implementation validated experimentally
- Medium confidence: Social simulation accuracy and architectural relevance (expert feedback but limited sample)
- Medium confidence: Task prioritization improvements (experimentally demonstrated but task-type dependent)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale architectural surveys (target n=30+) to validate professional relevance across different building types and cultural contexts
2. Implement stress testing with 50+ agents to evaluate performance bottlenecks and emergent behaviors in complex social scenarios
3. Develop ground-truth datasets of human office interactions to benchmark agent behavior realism against actual human performance
