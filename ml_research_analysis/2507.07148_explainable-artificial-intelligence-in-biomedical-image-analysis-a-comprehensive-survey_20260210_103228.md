# Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Image Analysis: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07148
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07148
- Reference count: 40
- This survey provides a comprehensive overview of explainable AI (XAI) techniques for biomedical image analysis, addressing the critical need for interpretability in clinical AI systems.

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive survey systematically explores explainable AI techniques in biomedical image analysis, addressing the critical need for interpretability in clinical AI systems. The authors categorize visualization-based, non-visualization-based, and latent-based XAI methods, proposing a modality-centered taxonomy that aligns techniques with specific imaging types and their unique interpretability challenges. The survey extends to multimodal learning and vision-language models, highlighting their growing importance in complex biomedical tasks.

The work serves as a foundational reference for advancing trustworthy, clinically meaningful AI systems in biomedical imaging by summarizing widely used evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks. Key challenges identified include modality-specific design gaps, semantic misalignment, and lack of standardized benchmarks. This systematic approach enables researchers and practitioners to understand the current landscape of XAI methods and their applications in biomedical imaging.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review approach, examining recent research on explainable AI techniques specifically applied to biomedical image analysis. The authors categorize XAI methods into visualization-based, non-visualization-based, and latent-based approaches, then further organize them using a modality-centered taxonomy. They extend their analysis to include multimodal learning and vision-language models, which are becoming increasingly important in complex biomedical tasks. The survey also summarizes commonly used evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks to facilitate reproducible research and practical implementation.

## Key Results
- Systematic categorization of visualization-based, non-visualization-based, and latent-based XAI methods
- Introduction of a modality-centered taxonomy aligning techniques with specific imaging types and their unique interpretability challenges
- Extension to multimodal learning and vision-language models, highlighting their growing importance in complex biomedical tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by providing a structured framework for understanding and implementing XAI techniques in biomedical image analysis. The modality-centered taxonomy addresses the unique challenges of different imaging types (such as X-ray, MRI, CT, and ultrasound), enabling researchers to select appropriate explainability methods based on specific imaging characteristics. By categorizing methods and providing evaluation metrics, the survey creates a foundation for systematic development and assessment of XAI techniques in clinical settings.

## Foundational Learning

**Biomedical Imaging Modalities**: Understanding different imaging types (X-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound) and their characteristics
*Why needed*: Different modalities have unique interpretability challenges requiring modality-specific XAI approaches
*Quick check*: Can you identify the key characteristics that distinguish CT from MRI imaging?

**Visualization-based XAI Methods**: Techniques that generate visual explanations for model decisions
*Why needed*: Provides intuitive, interpretable explanations that clinicians can easily understand
*Quick check*: How do saliency maps differ from attention heatmaps in visualization-based explanations?

**Evaluation Metrics for XAI**: Quantitative measures to assess the quality and effectiveness of explanations
*Why needed*: Enables systematic comparison and validation of different XAI techniques
*Quick check*: What metrics would you use to evaluate the faithfulness of an explanation?

**Multimodal Learning in Biomedical Imaging**: Integrating multiple data types (images, text, clinical data) for comprehensive analysis
*Why needed*: Real-world clinical applications often require combining different data sources
*Quick check*: How does multimodal learning enhance the interpretability of biomedical AI systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Biomedical imaging data -> Preprocessing pipeline -> AI model (CNN, transformer, etc.) -> XAI method (visualization/latent-based) -> Clinical interpretation -> Evaluation metrics
Critical path: Data preprocessing → Model training → XAI method application → Clinical validation
Design tradeoffs: Real-time interpretability vs. computational cost, local vs. global explanations, modality-specific vs. generic approaches
Failure signatures: Poor alignment between visual explanations and clinical features, lack of reproducibility, inability to generalize across modalities
First experiments: 1) Compare saliency map methods across different imaging modalities, 2) Evaluate visualization-based vs. latent-based methods for specific clinical tasks, 3) Test multimodal XAI approaches on integrated imaging and clinical data
