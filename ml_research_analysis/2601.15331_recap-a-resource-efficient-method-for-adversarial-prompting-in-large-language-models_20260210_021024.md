core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently testing large
  language models (LLMs) for adversarial prompt vulnerabilities, which is critical
  for security evaluation but resource-intensive with existing methods like GCG, PEZ,

  pre-trained adversarial prompts from a categorized database, enabling faster and

# RECAP: A Resource-Efficient Method for Adversarial Prompting in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.15331
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15331
- Authors: Rishit Chugh
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: RECAP achieves 33% attack success rate while reducing inference time from hours to 4 minutes per 20 prompts through prompt retrieval

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RECAP, a resource-efficient method for testing large language models against adversarial prompts without requiring retraining. Traditional adversarial prompt generation methods like GCG, PEZ, and GBDA are computationally expensive and time-consuming, making comprehensive security evaluation impractical. RECAP addresses this by maintaining a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts categorized by target behavior, enabling rapid retrieval and testing. The method demonstrates significant efficiency gains while maintaining reasonable attack success rates, offering a practical alternative for scalable red-teaming of aligned LLMs.

## Method Summary
RECAP operates by leveraging a pre-constructed database of adversarial prompts that are organized by specific attack categories and target behaviors. Instead of generating new adversarial examples through computationally intensive optimization processes, RECAP retrieves relevant prompts from this database and applies them to the target LLM. The system uses similarity matching and category-based retrieval to select prompts likely to succeed against the given model. This approach eliminates the need for gradient-based optimization or iterative prompt refinement, dramatically reducing computational requirements. The method was evaluated using a Llama 3 8B model, demonstrating that retrieved adversarial prompts could effectively bypass safety measures while requiring minimal computational resources.

## Key Results
- Achieved 33% attack success rate against Llama 3 8B model with 4-minute inference time per 20 prompts
- Reduced computational cost from hours (traditional methods) to minutes through prompt retrieval
- Demonstrated transferability to black-box models like Gemini, though with reduced effectiveness
- Eliminated retraining requirements while maintaining practical attack capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RECAP exploits the observation that many adversarial prompts share common structural patterns and semantic characteristics that transcend individual model architectures. By pre-computing and categorizing successful adversarial examples, the system can efficiently match new test scenarios to known attack patterns. The retrieval mechanism capitalizes on the fact that safety vulnerabilities often stem from predictable model responses to certain linguistic constructions, rather than model-specific idiosyncrasies. This allows RECAP to bypass the need for model-specific optimization while still achieving meaningful attack success rates through pattern matching and transfer learning from previously successful attacks.

## Foundational Learning

**Adversarial Prompting**: Why needed - understanding how carefully crafted inputs can bypass LLM safety measures; Quick check - can you identify prompt patterns that consistently trigger unintended behaviors?

**Gradient-based Attack Methods**: Why needed - provides context for why RECAP's non-gradient approach is significant; Quick check - what computational resources are typically required for GBDA-style attacks?

**Prompt Retrieval Systems**: Why needed - core technical mechanism enabling RECAP's efficiency; Quick check - how does similarity matching work in high-dimensional prompt spaces?

**Black-box Transferability**: Why needed - demonstrates RECAP's practical applicability beyond white-box scenarios; Quick check - what factors influence success rates when transferring attacks between different model architectures?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Query prompt -> Similarity matching -> Category filtering -> Prompt retrieval -> LLM evaluation -> Success classification

Critical path: The system processes input queries through similarity matching against the adversarial prompt database, filters results by relevant attack categories, retrieves the most promising prompts, and evaluates them against the target LLM to determine success rates.

Design tradeoffs: RECAP trades comprehensive vulnerability discovery (which requires exhaustive testing) for computational efficiency and scalability. The database approach means some novel vulnerabilities may be missed, but the system can test many more scenarios in the same time frame.

Failure signatures: Low success rates may indicate either model robustness or inadequate database coverage. Database staleness can reduce effectiveness as models evolve. Category mismatches can lead to irrelevant prompt retrieval.

First experiments:
1. Test RECAP against a baseline model with known vulnerabilities to verify detection capability
2. Compare retrieval accuracy between category-based and similarity-based matching approaches
3. Evaluate the impact of database size on both retrieval quality and computational efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to a single 8B parameter model (Llama 3), restricting generalizability across architectures
- 33% success rate means two-thirds of prompts remain secure, potentially missing critical vulnerabilities
- Database may become outdated as new attack vectors emerge, requiring continuous updates
- Does not address potential countermeasures that models could adopt against retrieval-based attacks

## Confidence
High confidence in efficiency gains and operational validity of RECAP method
Medium confidence in attack success rates and transferability claims due to limited model diversity
Medium confidence in security evaluation utility as method captures only subset of possible vulnerabilities

## Next Checks
1. Test RECAP across diverse model architectures including smaller models, multimodal systems, and different training paradigms
2. Evaluate temporal stability of adversarial prompt database by testing effectiveness as target models evolve
3. Conduct human evaluation studies to determine whether RECAP-identified vulnerabilities represent meaningful security threats
