# Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA): A Lifecycle Supervision Framework for Robustly Aligned AI Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.06716
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06716
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Reduces IPI attack success rate from 11.99% to 0.34% on AgentDojo benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the critical security vulnerability of LLM agents to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious data confuses agents into deviating from their intended goals. The proposed Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA) introduces a dual-layer defense system that combines proactive intent modeling with reactive adjudication. By leveraging an Intent Graph to pre-define legitimate execution paths and a Tiered Adjudicator for real-time anomaly detection, CCA significantly improves security while maintaining high task completion rates and operational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA) implements a lifecycle supervision framework that addresses LLM agent vulnerabilities to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks. The approach centers on a dual-layer defense system: a proactive Intent Graph that pre-generates legitimate execution plans to enforce control-flow and data-flow integrity, and a reactive Tiered Adjudicator that performs deep causal reasoning through a multi-dimensional Intent Alignment Score when deviations are detected. This architecture enables agents to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted data, preventing unauthorized tool invocations while maintaining task completion capabilities. The system was evaluated on the AgentDojo benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements in security metrics while reducing token usage by 3.3x compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

## Key Results
- Reduces IPI Attack Success Rate (ASR) from 11.99% to 0.34% on AgentDojo benchmark
- Maintains high task completion utility with UA of 86.43%
- Achieves 3.3x reduction in token usage compared to baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CCA works by creating a structured framework for agent decision-making that separates legitimate execution paths from potential attack vectors. The Intent Graph serves as a blueprint of allowed operations, while the Tiered Adjudicator provides real-time validation through causal reasoning. This dual approach addresses both the proactive identification of safe execution patterns and the reactive detection of deviations, creating a comprehensive defense against IPI attacks that exploit the inherent ambiguity in LLM agent decision-making.

## Foundational Learning

**Intent Graph** - A pre-generated map of legitimate execution paths that defines control-flow and data-flow integrity for agent operations. Needed to establish a reference framework for distinguishing between authorized and unauthorized actions. Quick check: Verify the graph comprehensively covers all legitimate task scenarios.

**Tiered Adjudicator** - A reactive system that performs deep causal reasoning when deviations from the Intent Graph are detected. Needed to provide real-time validation and prevent malicious tool invocations. Quick check: Test adjudicator response time and accuracy across various deviation scenarios.

**Intent Alignment Score** - A multi-dimensional scoring mechanism that quantifies the alignment between current agent behavior and legitimate execution paths. Needed to provide objective criteria for decision-making during adjudication. Quick check: Validate score sensitivity across different types of IPI attacks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** User Input -> Intent Graph Generator -> Agent Execution -> Tiered Adjudicator -> Tool Invocation

**Critical path:** User Input → Intent Graph Generator → Agent Execution → Tool Invocation

**Design tradeoffs:** The architecture balances security (through strict intent enforcement) against flexibility (by allowing legitimate deviations). The dual-layer approach adds computational overhead but provides comprehensive protection. The pre-generation of Intent Graphs assumes task predictability, which may limit adaptability to novel scenarios.

**Failure signatures:** False positives in adjudication may block legitimate tool invocations, while false negatives could allow malicious payloads to execute. Incomplete Intent Graphs may create blind spots in attack detection. Latency in the adjudication process could impact real-time performance.

**First experiments:** 
1. Baseline measurement of IPI attack success rates without CCA protection
2. Validation of Intent Graph coverage across diverse task scenarios
3. Performance benchmarking of Tiered Adjudicator response times

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on synthetic benchmarks that may not capture real-world attack complexity
- Latency introduced during adjudication not thoroughly quantified for time-sensitive applications
- Reliance on pre-generated Intent Graphs assumes all legitimate execution paths can be anticipated

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Technical novelty of CCA architecture and experimental results showing substantial ASR reduction on benchmark tasks

**Medium confidence:** Generalizability to production environments due to synthetic nature of test cases and limited adversarial red-teaming

**Low confidence:** Claimed efficiency gains without additional runtime profiling under varied workload conditions

## Next Checks

1. Conduct robustness evaluation using broader set of real-world IPI attack scenarios, including obfuscated or context-aware payloads

2. Perform ablation studies to isolate contributions of Intent Graph versus Tiered Adjudicator to overall security performance

3. Measure end-to-end latency and computational overhead of CCA under realistic multi-turn, multi-tool-use workloads
