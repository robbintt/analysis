# Watch and Listen: Understanding Audio-Visual-Speech Moments with Multimodal LLM

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.18110
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18110
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces TriSense, a triple-modality large language model with Query-Based Connector for adaptive audio-visual-speech integration, achieving strong performance on segment captioning and moment retrieval across diverse modality settings

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of integrating visual, audio, and speech modalities for comprehensive video temporal understanding. The authors introduce TriSense, a triple-modality large language model that uses a Query-Based Connector to dynamically adjust the contributions of each modality based on the input query, enabling robust performance even with missing or incomplete modalities. To support this, they construct TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples covering diverse modality combinations and long-form videos. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that TriSense achieves strong performance on both segment captioning and moment retrieval tasks across all modality settings, significantly outperforming existing models in multimodal scenarios. The model also demonstrates competitive results in general video understanding tasks, validating its flexibility and effectiveness in real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The authors present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed to integrate visual, audio, and speech inputs for comprehensive video temporal understanding. The core innovation is the Query-Based Connector, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each modality based on the input query. The model is trained on TriSense-2M, a curated dataset of over 2 million samples spanning diverse modality combinations and long-form videos. The approach emphasizes adaptability, allowing robust performance even when certain modalities are missing or incomplete.

## Key Results
- TriSense achieves strong performance on segment captioning and moment retrieval tasks across all modality settings
- Significantly outperforms existing models in multimodal scenarios, particularly when handling incomplete or missing modalities
- Demonstrates competitive results in general video understanding tasks, validating its flexibility and effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Query-Based Connector dynamically adjusts the contribution of each modality based on the input query, enabling the model to prioritize relevant information streams and maintain performance even with missing modalities. This adaptive fusion mechanism allows the model to focus on the most informative modalities for each specific task, improving robustness and generalization across diverse scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal fusion**: Combining information from multiple sensory streams to create a unified understanding - needed to handle the complexity of real-world videos with audio, visual, and speech components
- **Query-based adaptation**: Dynamically adjusting model behavior based on input queries - needed to prioritize relevant information for specific tasks
- **Temporal understanding**: Processing video sequences over time to capture context and relationships - needed for moment retrieval and segment captioning tasks
- **Robustness to missing modalities**: Maintaining performance when some input streams are unavailable - needed for real-world deployment where sensor failures or incomplete data are common
- **Large-scale pretraining**: Training on massive datasets to learn general patterns - needed to develop strong representations that transfer to downstream tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Query -> Query-Based Connector -> TriModal Encoder -> LLM Decoder

**Critical Path**: The Query-Based Connector serves as the critical path, dynamically routing and weighting information from visual, audio, and speech encoders before passing to the language model decoder.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Adaptive fusion (Query-Based Connector) vs. fixed fusion weights
- Complexity of adaptive mechanism vs. computational efficiency
- Dataset scale (2M samples) vs. annotation quality control

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Performance degradation when queries are ambiguous or poorly formulated
- Computational overhead from adaptive fusion mechanism
- Potential overfitting to specific modality combinations in training data

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate performance with single-modality inputs to establish baseline capabilities
2. Test performance with various combinations of missing modalities to validate robustness claims
3. Compare computational efficiency against baseline models across different video lengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational efficiency trade-offs of the Query-Based Connector mechanism are not thoroughly examined, particularly regarding inference time and memory usage with longer videos
- Dataset construction methodology lacks detailed discussion of annotation quality control procedures and inter-rater reliability measures
- Ablation studies do not fully explore the impact of different query formulations or the model's sensitivity to query quality

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Performance claims on standard benchmarks where the model shows consistent improvements across different modality settings
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about robustness to missing modalities, given the controlled evaluation conditions may not fully represent real-world scenarios
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability claims to real-world applications, as the evaluation focuses on curated benchmarks rather than field deployment

## Next Checks
1. Conduct computational efficiency benchmarking comparing TriSense against baseline models, measuring inference time, memory usage, and performance trade-offs across different video lengths
2. Implement a cross-dataset validation study using TriSense-2M trained models on independently collected multimodal video datasets to assess true generalization
3. Perform extensive ablation studies varying query complexity and quality to determine the sensitivity and robustness of the Query-Based Connector mechanism under realistic conditions
