# Controlling Language Difficulty in Dialogues with Linguistic Features

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14545
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14545

- Primary result: Proposed framework controls language difficulty in LLM-generated dialogues using linguistic features, achieving PCC = 0.950 with expert judgments

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of controlling language difficulty in LLM-generated dialogue responses for language learners. The authors propose a framework that leverages three categories of linguistic features—readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), syntactic (e.g., tree depth), and lexical (e.g., simple word ratio)—to quantify and regulate text complexity. They introduce Dilaprix, a novel metric integrating these features, which shows strong correlation with expert judgments of language difficulty. Training LLMs on linguistically annotated dialogue data enables precise modulation of language proficiency, outperforming prompt-based methods.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a framework for controlling language difficulty in LLM-generated dialogue responses by leveraging three categories of linguistic features: readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), syntactic (e.g., tree depth), and lexical (e.g., simple word ratio). They introduce Dilaprix, a novel metric that integrates these features to quantify text complexity. The framework trains LLMs on linguistically annotated dialogue data, enabling precise modulation of language proficiency. This approach outperforms prompt-based methods, achieving a broader range of difficulty control (Dilaprix range: 0.073 to 0.883) and enhanced stability (lower standard deviation: 0.084) while maintaining high dialogue quality, as measured by Response Success Rate.

## Key Results
- Dilaprix metric shows strong correlation with expert judgments of language difficulty (PCC = 0.950)
- Framework achieves broader difficulty control range (0.073 to 0.883) compared to baseline methods
- Enhanced stability with lower standard deviation (0.084) while maintaining high dialogue quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages linguistic features to quantify and control language complexity in LLM-generated dialogue responses. By integrating readability, syntactic, and lexical features into the Dilaprix metric, the system can precisely modulate language proficiency. Training LLMs on linguistically annotated data enables the model to understand and generate responses at targeted difficulty levels, outperforming prompt-based approaches in both control range and stability.

## Foundational Learning
1. Linguistic Feature Extraction (why needed: To quantify text complexity for difficulty control)
   - Quick check: Verify feature extraction tools work across diverse dialogue contexts

2. Dilaprix Metric Design (why needed: To provide a unified measure of language difficulty)
   - Quick check: Validate correlation between Dilaprix scores and expert difficulty judgments

3. LLM Fine-tuning with Linguistic Annotations (why needed: To enable precise difficulty modulation)
   - Quick check: Test model's ability to generate responses at targeted difficulty levels

4. Response Quality Assessment (why needed: To ensure difficulty control doesn't compromise dialogue effectiveness)
   - Quick check: Measure Response Success Rate across difficulty levels

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Linguistic Feature Extraction -> Dilaprix Calculation -> LLM Fine-tuning -> Response Generation -> Quality Assessment

Critical path: Feature extraction and Dilaprix calculation provide the foundation for training data annotation, which enables the fine-tuned LLM to generate controlled-difficulty responses that are then evaluated for quality.

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes precise difficulty control over raw model performance, accepting potential limitations in generalizability for the benefit of pedagogical effectiveness.

Failure signatures: If difficulty control fails, expect: 1) Dilaprix scores not correlating with expert judgments, 2) Limited range of difficulty levels achieved, 3) High standard deviation in generated response difficulty

3 first experiments:
1. Test Dilaprix correlation with expert judgments across diverse dialogue samples
2. Measure difficulty control range and stability of fine-tuned model vs. baseline
3. Evaluate Response Success Rate at different difficulty levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance relies heavily on Dilaprix metric quality and representativeness
- Evaluation focuses primarily on Response Success Rate, lacking comprehensive pedagogical effectiveness assessment
- Dilaprix range represents performance on specific dataset, may not generalize to other dialogue domains or language pairs

## Confidence
High confidence: Core methodology of using linguistic features for difficulty control is well-established; framework achieves measurable control (Dilaprix range and standard deviation) with clear advantages over prompt-based methods.

Medium confidence: Dilaprix metric effectiveness relies on specific feature combination and weighting; performance across different learner populations needs further validation; pedagogical implications are assumed rather than empirically demonstrated.

Low confidence: Long-term stability of controlled difficulty across extended interactions is unaddressed; effectiveness with non-English languages or specialized domains remains untested; impact on base model's general capabilities is unexplored.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal study with actual language learners to measure learning outcomes, engagement, and satisfaction over extended periods, comparing against traditional materials and uncontrolled LLM outputs.

2. Test framework generalization across multiple language pairs (e.g., English-Spanish, English-Chinese) and diverse dialogue domains (academic tutoring, casual conversation, professional training) to assess robustness.

3. Perform ablation studies on Dilaprix metric components to determine relative contribution of readability, syntactic, and lexical features, validating alternative feature combinations for specific learner populations.
