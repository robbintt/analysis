# Language-TPP: Integrating Temporal Point Processes with Language Models for Event Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.07139
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07139
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Primary result:** Language-TPP achieves state-of-the-art performance on TPP tasks with up to 18.1 RMSE improvement and enables high-quality event description generation

## Executive Summary
Language-TPP presents a novel framework that bridges temporal point processes (TPPs) with large language models (LLMs) to jointly model event sequences with both temporal dynamics and rich textual descriptions. The key innovation is converting continuous event timestamps into specialized byte-tokens, enabling seamless integration with standard LLM architectures while maintaining temporal precision. Through comprehensive experiments across five real-world datasets, Language-TPP achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional TPP tasks including event time prediction, type prediction, and intensity estimation, while also enabling high-quality event description generation.

The framework addresses a critical gap in existing approaches by unifying the modeling of event timing and textual context in a single architecture. Traditional TPP methods excel at temporal modeling but struggle with text integration, while LLM-based approaches can handle text but lack temporal precision. Language-TPP's byte-token representation and staged training strategy overcome these limitations, demonstrating that temporal information can be effectively encoded as learnable tokens within the LLM framework.

## Method Summary
Language-TPP introduces a unified framework that integrates temporal point processes with large language models by converting event timestamps into specialized byte-tokens. The approach uses a transformer-based decoder to process both event type embeddings and byte-tokenized temporal information simultaneously. The framework employs a staged training strategy: first pre-training on synthetic event sequence pairs to learn basic temporal patterns, then fine-tuning on target datasets for specific tasks. The byte-token representation preserves temporal precision while enabling seamless integration with standard LLM architectures, and the model jointly optimizes for temporal prediction accuracy and text generation quality.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on event time prediction with up to 18.1 RMSE improvement over baselines
- Outperforms existing models on event type prediction with up to 59.7% accuracy
- Generates high-quality event descriptions with ROUGE-L score of 24.78 on Amazon Review dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Language-TPP works by converting continuous event timestamps into discrete byte-tokens that can be processed by standard transformer architectures. This representation allows the model to leverage the powerful pattern recognition capabilities of LLMs while preserving the precise temporal information needed for accurate TPP modeling. The staged training strategy enables the model to first learn general temporal patterns from synthetic data before adapting to specific domain characteristics. By jointly optimizing for both temporal predictions and text generation, the framework learns representations that capture the complex relationships between event timing and textual context.

## Foundational Learning
**Temporal Point Processes (TPPs):** Stochastic models for modeling sequences of discrete events over continuous time
- *Why needed:* Provides mathematical foundation for modeling event timing and dependencies
- *Quick check:* Can the model accurately predict next event times and types?

**Transformer Architecture:** Self-attention-based neural networks for sequence modeling
- *Why needed:* Enables parallel processing and captures long-range dependencies in event sequences
- *Quick check:* Does the model maintain performance with varying sequence lengths?

**Byte-Token Representation:** Converting continuous values to discrete tokens using byte-level encoding
- *Why needed:* Bridges the gap between continuous temporal values and discrete LLM processing
- *Quick check:* Is temporal precision maintained after byte-token conversion?

**Staged Training:** Progressive learning approach starting with synthetic data then fine-tuning on real data
- *Why needed:* Helps the model learn general temporal patterns before domain-specific adaptation
- *Quick check:* Does pre-training on synthetic data improve downstream performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Byte-Token Encoder -> Transformer Decoder -> Prediction Heads (Time, Type, Text)

**Critical Path:** Input Event Sequence → Byte-Token Conversion → Transformer Processing → Joint Prediction (Temporal + Textual)

**Design Tradeoffs:** The byte-token representation sacrifices some temporal granularity for compatibility with LLM architectures, but maintains sufficient precision for practical applications. The staged training approach adds complexity but enables better generalization across domains.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on datasets with very long or irregular time intervals, degradation in text generation quality when event descriptions are extremely short or lack sufficient context.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate byte-token conversion accuracy by comparing reconstructed timestamps with original values
2. Test model performance on synthetic data with known temporal patterns before real-world evaluation
3. Conduct ablation study comparing byte-token approach with direct continuous value input

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily compared against baseline models rather than recent neural TPP approaches like T-LGS and HT-HGPT
- Text generation evaluation relies on automated metrics without qualitative human assessment of coherence and utility
- Datasets used may not fully represent complexity of real-world event sequences with rich textual context

## Confidence
**High confidence:** Technical implementation of byte-token conversion and staged training strategy
**Medium confidence:** Claimed performance improvements on specific metrics and datasets
**Low confidence:** Practical utility of text generation capability without human evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct head-to-head comparisons with recent specialized neural TPP models (T-LGS, HT-HGPT) on the same datasets
2. Implement human evaluation studies for generated event descriptions focusing on coherence, relevance, and practical utility
3. Test model robustness on datasets with varying text lengths and complexities, particularly examining byte-token conversion effectiveness for extreme cases
