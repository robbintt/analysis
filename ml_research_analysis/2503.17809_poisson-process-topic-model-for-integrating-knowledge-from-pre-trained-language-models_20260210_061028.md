# Poisson-Process Topic Model for Integrating Knowledge from Pre-trained Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.17809
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17809
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes a novel topic modeling framework that integrates contextualized word embeddings from large language models with traditional topic modeling methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for topic modeling that integrates contextualized word embeddings from pre-trained language models with traditional topic modeling approaches. The authors model each document as a sequence of word embeddings using a Poisson point process, where topic distributions are expressed as intensity measures in the embedded space. The framework addresses the challenge of incorporating rich semantic information from modern language models into probabilistic topic models while maintaining theoretical guarantees and computational feasibility.

## Method Summary
The proposed method consists of three main steps: (1) partitioning the embedding space into "hyperwords" via k-means clustering, (2) applying traditional topic modeling (such as Topic-SCORE) to the resulting hyperword count matrix, and (3) using kernel smoothing to estimate topic densities. The mathematical foundation connects Poisson point processes with topic modeling, representing each document as a realization of a Poisson process with intensity measures corresponding to topic distributions. This allows the framework to capture context-dependent word-topic relationships while maintaining the interpretability of traditional topic models.

## Key Results
- The method achieves convergence rates matching minimax lower bounds for smooth topic densities
- Experiments on two real datasets demonstrate improved topic coherence and ability to capture nuanced topics
- The framework successfully uncovers context-dependent word-topic relationships that traditional bag-of-words models miss

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the semantic richness of pre-trained language model embeddings while maintaining the probabilistic structure of topic models. By modeling documents as Poisson processes in the embedding space, it captures the continuous semantic relationships between words while allowing for tractable inference. The hyperword construction bridges the gap between high-dimensional embeddings and traditional discrete topic models, enabling the use of established algorithms while incorporating contextual information.

## Foundational Learning

**Poisson Point Processes**: Why needed - Provides the mathematical framework for modeling documents as sequences of embeddings; Quick check - Verify the document representation satisfies the intensity measure properties

**Kernel Density Estimation**: Why needed - Enables smooth estimation of topic densities in the embedding space; Quick check - Confirm bandwidth selection doesn't cause over/under-smoothing

**k-means Clustering**: Why needed - Creates the discrete hyperword representation needed for traditional topic modeling; Quick check - Test clustering stability across multiple initializations

**Minimax Theory**: Why needed - Establishes theoretical optimality guarantees for the proposed estimator; Quick check - Verify assumptions about smoothness parameters hold in practice

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Document Embeddings -> Hyperword Construction (k-means) -> Traditional Topic Modeling -> Kernel Smoothing -> Topic Density Estimation

**Critical Path**: The most sensitive sequence is embedding space partitioning → topic model fitting → density estimation, as errors compound at each stage

**Design Tradeoffs**: Word-level vs. sentence-level embeddings (semantic richness vs. computational efficiency); number of clusters k (model granularity vs. statistical stability)

**Failure Signatures**: Poor clustering quality manifests as incoherent topics; inadequate kernel bandwidth produces either overly smooth or noisy density estimates

**First Experiments**:
1. Vary k-means cluster count and measure impact on topic coherence
2. Test different kernel bandwidths for density estimation
3. Compare performance with and without embedding pre-processing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can the PPTM framework be effectively extended to use sentence embeddings ("hyper-sentences") instead of word embeddings to improve computational efficiency?

Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion section explicitly suggests this as a "potential solution" to the high computational cost of processing word-level embeddings.

Why unresolved: The current implementation relies on word embeddings, which are computationally demanding for long documents; the sentence-level adaptation has not been implemented or tested.

What evidence would resolve it: An adaptation of the TRACE algorithm operating on sentence-level embeddings that demonstrates a reduction in processing time while maintaining topic coherence comparable to the word-level model.

**Open Question 2**: How can the PPTM framework be combined with network data analysis to jointly model text and network structures?

Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion section proposes extending the framework to joint analysis, specifically citing networks where node communities and topic weights are correlated (e.g., co-authorship networks).

Why unresolved: The paper currently treats documents as independent entities; it does not model the dependency between a document's topic weights and the node's community membership in a network.

What evidence would resolve it: A joint generative model integrating PPTM with a network model (e.g., Stochastic Block Model) and empirical results showing improved performance in community detection or topic extraction on networked text data.

**Open Question 3**: Is it possible to close the theoretical gap between the upper and lower bounds for estimating topic densities when the smoothness parameter $\beta > 1$?

Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.2 notes that the proposed method matches the minimax lower bound (up to a log factor) only when $\beta \le 1$, leaving the optimality for $\beta > 1$ unverified.

Why unresolved: The bias-variance trade-off analysis in the proof yields a convergence rate that diverges from the lower bound for smoother functions, suggesting the current estimator or analysis may be suboptimal in that regime.

What evidence would resolve it: A refined theoretical analysis or a modified estimator that achieves the rate $(N n)^{-\frac{\beta}{2\beta+d}}$ for all $\beta > 1$.

## Limitations
- The theoretical analysis assumes idealized conditions that may not hold with noisy real-world data
- Dependence on k-means clustering introduces sensitivity to initialization and parameter selection
- Evaluation scope is limited to two datasets and English language corpora

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The mathematical framework connecting Poisson point processes to topic modeling is rigorously developed and internally consistent

**Medium confidence**: The three-step algorithm implementation appears sound, though empirical robustness across diverse datasets needs validation

**Medium confidence**: Theoretical convergence rates matching minimax bounds, though practical implications depend on real-world data characteristics

## Next Checks

1. Test algorithm sensitivity to k-means initialization and number of clusters (k) across multiple runs on each dataset

2. Evaluate performance on specialized corpora (medical, legal, or non-English documents) to assess generalizability

3. Compare against additional baselines including neural topic models and embedding-based clustering approaches on standardized topic coherence benchmarks
