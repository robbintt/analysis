# Cross-Domain Offshore Wind Power Forecasting: Transfer Learning Through Meteorological Clusters

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.19674
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19674
- **Authors**: Dominic Weisser; Chloé Hashimoto-Cullen; Benjamin Guedj
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 14.7% improvement in MAE (3.52% vs 4.13% baseline) using under five months of local data

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of accurate offshore wind power forecasting for newly commissioned wind farms that lack sufficient site-specific historical data. The authors propose a transfer learning framework that clusters meteorological conditions using a variational autoencoder and trains expert Gaussian Process models for each weather pattern. By fine-tuning pre-trained models with minimal local data, the approach achieves accurate cross-domain forecasting without requiring a full year of site-specific measurements. Experiments across eight target wind farms demonstrate a 14.7% improvement in mean absolute error (3.52% vs 4.13% baseline) using under five months of local data, outperforming models trained from scratch even with a full year of data.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a two-stage approach: first, source farm data is processed through a VAE to extract latent weather patterns, which are clustered into K distinct regimes. Expert Gaussian Process models are trained for each cluster. For target farms, the VAE extracts latent representations from local meteorological data, matches them to the nearest source cluster, and fine-tunes the corresponding pre-trained GP with minimal local data. This approach leverages transferable climate-dependent dynamics while adapting to site-specific characteristics.

## Key Results
- 14.7% improvement in mean absolute error (3.52% vs 4.13% baseline) across eight target wind farms
- Achieved using under five months of local data versus full year required by baseline methods
- Outperformed models trained from scratch even with a full year of target site data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing the forecasting problem into weather-specific expert models allows for more efficient transfer learning than using a single general-purpose model.
- Mechanism: By clustering meteorological data into distinct regimes and training separate Gaussian Process experts for each, the system reduces the complexity each model must learn. When transferring to a new site, the framework matches local conditions to the closest pre-trained expert, requiring fewer local samples to fine-tune the specific input-output relationship for that weather type.
- Core assumption: Weather patterns are consistent across different geographical locations, meaning a "storm" pattern at a source farm shares structural power generation dynamics with a "storm" at a target farm.
- Evidence anchors: "...forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster... adapt efficiently to new sites." [abstract]; "To ensure the forecasting models are trained on the most distinct weather patterns... partitioned into K distinct weather clusters." [section 2.3]
- Break condition: Fails if the target site exhibits a meteorological regime not present in the source data, or if clustering resolution is too coarse.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Variational Autoencoders create a normalized latent space that enables accurate cross-domain alignment of weather patterns without requiring location-specific calibration.
- Mechanism: The VAE compresses high-dimensional meteorological time-series into lower-dimensional latent vectors. By L2-normalizing these vectors, the model prioritizes the "shape" or direction of the weather pattern over its magnitude, allowing recognition of structurally similar patterns across different sites.
- Core assumption: Directional similarity in the latent space correlates with similar power generation dynamics, regardless of absolute wind speed values.
- Evidence anchors: "...clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features... captures transferable, climate-dependent dynamics." [abstract]; "...L2-normalised to prioritise directional similarity over magnitude..." [section 2.3]
- Break condition: Fails if reconstruction loss is too high or if magnitude is actually the primary driver of error.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Transferring covariance hyperparameters provides a stronger prior for target models than random initialization, accelerating convergence in low-data regimes.
- Mechanism: Gaussian Processes rely on kernel hyperparameters to define the smoothness and behavior of the forecasting function. Initializing the target farm's GP with source farm's corresponding weather cluster hyperparameters provides a valid approximation of the power curve's temporal structure.
- Core assumption: The temporal smoothness and noise characteristics of power generation are similar within a specific weather cluster across different farms.
- Evidence anchors: "By fine-tuning pre-trained models with minimal local data..." [abstract]; "This initialisation provides a strong prior on the temporal covariance structure..." [section 2.6]
- Break condition: Fails if source hyperparameters are highly suboptimal for the target, forcing the optimizer into a local minimum.

## Foundational Learning

- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) & Latent Variables**
  - Why needed here: To reduce dimensionality and denoise raw meteorological data, enabling clustering of "weather patterns" based on deep features rather than simple surface statistics.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the reparameterization trick allows backpropagation through the stochastic sampling process?

- **Gaussian Process (GP) Regression & Kernels**
  - Why needed here: To model the non-linear power curve and provide uncertainty estimates. The choice of kernel defines assumptions about function smoothness.
  - Quick check question: Why is a Matérn kernel often preferred over a standard RBF kernel for modeling turbulent or high-frequency atmospheric data?

- **Inductive Transfer Learning**
  - Why needed here: To leverage knowledge from data-rich source domains to solve problems in data-scarce target domains.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between feature-representation transfer (used here for clustering) and parameter transfer (used here for GP initialization)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw Meteorological Data -> VAE Encoder -> Latent Space -> Agglomerative Clustering -> K Clusters -> K Expert GP Trainers (Source); Target Meteorological Data -> Fixed VAE Encoder -> Latent Projection -> Nearest Centroid Lookup -> Select Expert GP -> Fine-tune on Local Data (Target)
- **Critical path**: The Composite Quality Score ($Q$) optimization (Section 2.4). If time-period length ($p$) and cluster count ($K$) are misconfigured, expert models will be trained on mixed or ambiguous weather signals.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Cluster Granularity: Fewer clusters simplify training but mix distinct weather patterns; more clusters improve specialization but risk data fragmentation.
  - VAE Architecture: Bidirectional LSTM captures temporal context but increases inference cost compared to convolutional layers.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Negative Transfer: Target MAE > Baseline MAE, likely caused by domain shift where target site's weather has no analogue in source clusters.
  - Posterior Collapse: VAE latent variables become uninformative, detected if KL divergence term dominates loss early in training.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline Calibration: Train standard GP and Random Forest on target site with 0% transfer to establish lower bound for 10%-50% data capacity.
  2. Ablation on Clustering: Compare "Clustered Transfer" approach against "Global Transfer" (one single GP model transferred) to quantify value of meteorological specialization.
  3. Sensitivity Analysis: Vary fine-tuning dataset size (10% to 50%) for highest and lowest performing clusters to identify which weather regimes require more local data investment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends critically on assumption that meteorological clusters are domain-agnostic, which breaks down for rare or site-specific weather patterns.
- 14.7% improvement is primarily driven by clusters with broad climatic signatures; extreme event clusters showed minimal transfer benefit.
- Reported improvements achieved with specific configuration (K=7 clusters, 4-month fine-tuning window) that may not generalize to all offshore environments.

## Confidence
- **High**: Clustering methodology demonstrates consistent performance across multiple source farms.
- **Medium**: GP fine-tuning process shows variable sensitivity to initialization quality.
- **Low**: Performance on extreme weather scenarios with no source analogues.

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Shift Analysis**: Systematically quantify distributional differences between source and target meteorological data for each cluster. Measure how prediction accuracy degrades as KL divergence between source and target cluster distributions increases.

2. **Rare Event Transferability**: Evaluate framework's performance on extreme weather clusters by testing with synthetic target data containing these events but no source analogues.

3. **Transfer Learning Threshold**: Conduct experiments to identify minimum source data requirement for effective transfer. Train source models with decreasing amounts of historical data (6 months, 3 months, 1 month) and measure degradation in target site performance.
