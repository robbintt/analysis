# Ensemble Elastic DQN: A novel multi-step ensemble approach to address overestimation in deep value-based reinforcement learning

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05716

- Ensemble Elastic DQN combines ensemble learning with elastic multi-step returns to address overestimation bias in deep reinforcement learning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm that addresses overestimation bias and improves sample efficiency by combining ensemble learning with elastic multi-step returns. EEDQN dynamically adjusts the bootstrap horizon based on state similarity and uses different aggregation strategies for single-step (mean) and multi-step (minimum) experiences to mitigate overestimation while maintaining exploration. The algorithm was evaluated against standard and ensemble DQN variants on the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments emphasizing behavioral learning with reduced representational complexity.

## Method Summary
EEDQN extends standard DQN by incorporating an ensemble of Q-networks with elastic multi-step returns. The algorithm maintains multiple Q-networks that learn from different subsets of experiences, with each network predicting Q-values for the same state-action pairs. For multi-step returns, EEDQN uses a minimum aggregation strategy across ensemble members to mitigate overestimation bias, while single-step returns use mean aggregation. The elastic component dynamically adjusts the bootstrap horizon based on state similarity, allowing the algorithm to adapt its temporal credit assignment to the specific characteristics of each state. This combination of ensemble learning and elastic multi-step returns aims to improve both the accuracy of value estimates and the efficiency of learning.

## Key Results
- EEDQN achieved consistently robust performance across all tested MinAtar environments, outperforming baseline DQN methods
- The algorithm matched or exceeded state-of-the-art ensemble DQNs in final returns on most MinAtar environments
- EEDQN was the only algorithm that successfully predicted well below the theoretical maximum Q-value across all environments, demonstrating effective overestimation mitigation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EEDQN addresses the overestimation bias inherent in Q-learning by using ensemble methods with minimum aggregation for multi-step returns. When multiple Q-networks are trained on different experience subsets, taking the minimum value across ensemble members provides a conservative estimate that counteracts the positive bias that accumulates in standard Q-learning. The elastic multi-step component further improves learning efficiency by adapting the temporal horizon based on state similarity, allowing the algorithm to capture longer-term dependencies when beneficial while maintaining stability. This systematic combination of overestimation mitigation through ensemble minimum aggregation and improved sample efficiency through adaptive temporal credit assignment results in superior performance compared to using either technique alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Q-learning overestimation bias**: Standard Q-learning tends to overestimate action values due to the max operator, leading to suboptimal policies. Quick check: Compare Q-values from Q-learning vs Double Q-learning on a simple MDP.
- **Ensemble learning in RL**: Using multiple learning agents can reduce variance and improve robustness by averaging or taking conservative estimates across ensemble members. Quick check: Train single vs ensemble DQN on a simple task and compare value estimates.
- **Multi-step returns**: Instead of using only immediate rewards, multi-step returns incorporate rewards over multiple time steps before bootstrapping, potentially improving sample efficiency. Quick check: Compare single-step vs n-step returns on a delayed reward task.
- **State similarity for temporal adaptation**: The ability to adjust learning parameters based on similarity between states can improve generalization and adaptation to different temporal scales. Quick check: Measure state similarity metrics in a simple environment with varying time scales.
- **Minimum vs mean aggregation**: Different aggregation strategies (minimum vs mean) can have different effects on bias-variance tradeoff in ensemble methods. Quick check: Compare minimum and mean aggregation on a noisy value estimation task.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
EEDQN -> Ensemble of Q-networks -> Multi-step return calculation -> Minimum aggregation (multi-step) / Mean aggregation (single-step) -> State similarity module -> Elastic bootstrap horizon adjustment

**Critical Path:**
State observation -> Ensemble Q-network forward pass -> Multi-step return calculation with elastic horizon -> Minimum aggregation across ensemble members -> Loss computation -> Backpropagation -> Parameter update

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational overhead of maintaining multiple ensemble networks vs improved performance and overestimation mitigation
- Complexity of elastic horizon adjustment vs potential gains in sample efficiency
- Conservative minimum aggregation may slow learning in some scenarios vs consistent overestimation reduction

**Failure Signatures:**
- Performance degradation if ensemble diversity is insufficient (all networks converge to similar solutions)
- Instability from poorly tuned elastic horizon adjustment leading to inappropriate temporal credit assignment
- Computational bottlenecks from maintaining multiple large networks simultaneously

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Ablation study comparing EEDQN with and without ensemble component on MinAtar environments
2. Comparison of different aggregation strategies (minimum, mean, max) within the ensemble framework
3. Analysis of elastic horizon adjustment effectiveness by comparing fixed vs adaptive bootstrap lengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to MinAtar benchmark suite with simplified environments, may not generalize to full-scale Atari or complex domains
- No statistical significance testing provided for performance differences between algorithms
- Computational overhead characterization is incomplete, lacking detailed analysis of wall-clock time and memory usage

## Confidence
- High confidence: Algorithm design and implementation details are clearly described and internally consistent
- Medium confidence: Performance improvements relative to baseline DQN variants on MinAtar
- Low confidence: Generalization claims to more complex environments and real-world applications

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments on the full Atari 2600 benchmark suite to assess scalability and performance maintenance with increased visual complexity
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of ensemble learning versus elastic multi-step returns to the overall performance gains
3. Measure and report computational overhead (wall-clock time, memory usage) compared to standard DQN implementations across different ensemble sizes
