# PosterGen: Aesthetic-Aware Paper-to-Poster Generation via Multi-Agent LLMs
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.17188
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17188
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Multi-agent LLM framework for automated academic poster generation with strong design and content fidelity.

## Executive Summary
PosterGen is a multi-agent LLM framework that automates academic poster generation by mirroring professional designer workflows. It employs four specialized agents—Parser/Curator, Layout, Stylist, and Renderer—to transform research papers into presentation-ready posters. The framework integrates core design principles such as narrative ABT structure, visual hierarchy, layout balance, color harmony, and typography. Evaluated using VLM-as-Judge metrics, PosterGen achieves content fidelity comparable to human design and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PosterAgent on aesthetic metrics, producing posters with minimal manual refinement.

## Method Summary
PosterGen automates academic poster generation through a multi-agent LLM framework that mirrors professional design workflows. The system uses four specialized agents: Parser/Curator extracts and organizes content into narrative structure, Layout creates spatially balanced three-column grids, Stylist applies theme-based color schemes and hierarchical typography, and Renderer produces PPTX/PDF outputs. The framework integrates core design principles including narrative ABT structure, visual hierarchy, layout balance, color harmony, and typography. Evaluation via VLM-as-Judge shows PosterGen achieves comparable content fidelity to human design and significantly outperforms PosterAgent on aesthetic metrics (4.44 vs 4.26 average design score).

## Key Results
- PosterGen achieves content fidelity comparable to human design using VLM-as-Judge evaluation
- Significantly outperforms PosterAgent on aesthetic metrics (average design score 4.44 vs 4.26)
- Produces presentation-ready posters with minimal manual refinement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PosterGen works by decomposing poster generation into specialized, interdependent tasks handled by dedicated LLM agents. The Parser/Curator agent transforms dense academic content into structured narrative (ABT: And, But, Therefore) ensuring logical flow. The Layout agent creates balanced three-column grids that optimize spatial relationships. The Stylist agent applies color harmony and hierarchical typography to establish visual emphasis. The Renderer agent generates PPTX/PDF outputs with precise element placement. This division of labor allows each agent to specialize in its domain while maintaining coherence through iterative refinement, effectively replicating professional design workflows within a single automated pipeline.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent LLM systems**: Why needed - enables specialization and modularity in complex generation tasks. Quick check - each agent has distinct prompt templates and output schemas.
- **ABT narrative structure**: Why needed - creates compelling scientific storytelling. Quick check - "And" establishes context, "But" presents problem, "Therefore" delivers contribution.
- **Visual hierarchy**: Why needed - guides viewer attention through typography and spacing. Quick check - title > section headers > body text size progression.
- **Layout balance**: Why needed - ensures aesthetic appeal and information accessibility. Quick check - three-column grid with proportional whitespace.
- **VLM-as-Judge evaluation**: Why needed - objective, scalable assessment of design quality. Quick check - automated scoring using vision-language models trained on design criteria.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Parser/Curator -> Layout -> Stylist -> Renderer
**Critical Path**: Paper input → Content parsing → Narrative structuring → Layout design → Visual styling → Output generation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Modular agent specialization vs. coordination overhead; aesthetic optimization vs. content fidelity; automation vs. human refinement needs
**Failure Signatures**: Content loss or misrepresentation; unbalanced layouts; poor color contrast or typography hierarchy; rendering errors in output format
**First Experiments**: 1) Single-agent end-to-end generation (lower quality, higher latency); 2) Ablation study removing Stylist (reduced aesthetic scores); 3) Cross-domain validation on non-CV papers (maintained performance with prompt adaptation)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on VLM-as-Judge metrics, which may not fully capture nuanced human perception of design quality
- Claim of "presentation-ready" posters lacks systematic usability testing across diverse user groups
- Evaluation corpus of 72 papers is modest and may not represent full diversity of academic disciplines

## Confidence
- **Content fidelity claims**: High - supported by structured VLM-as-Judge evaluation and clear metric improvements
- **Aesthetic quality claims**: High - significant improvement over baseline with objective scoring
- **Usability claims**: Medium - qualitative user feedback but limited systematic testing
- **Generalizability claims**: Medium - moderate corpus size and discipline diversity

## Next Checks
1. Conduct large-scale user study with diverse poster designers to assess real-world usability and refinement needs
2. Evaluate PosterGen's performance across broader range of academic disciplines and poster formats to test generalizability
3. Compare PosterGen's output quality against other LLM-based design tools using blind human evaluations to validate VLM-as-Judge results
