- Introduces hierarchical approach addressing AVSR performance degradation in noisy environments

## Executive Summary
This dissertation presents a systematic, three-level framework for scalable audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) systems that maintain performance in challenging real-world conditions. The research addresses the critical challenge of significant performance degradation when audio and visual inputs are corrupted by noise or interference. Through a hierarchical approach spanning representation, architecture, and system levels, the work introduces novel frameworks that enable robust multimodal fusion without requiring noise-specific modules or sacrificing scalability.

The proposed solutions include CAV2vec for robust audio-visual feature learning, MoHAVE for adaptive architecture-level scaling, and DualHyp for intelligent system-level composition. These frameworks collectively provide a comprehensive methodology for building AVSR systems capable of reliable deployment across diverse real-world applications where traditional unimodal or simple multimodal approaches fail.

## Method Summary
The dissertation introduces a systematic hierarchical approach to scalable AVSR, addressing performance degradation in noisy and visually interfered environments. At the representation level, CAV2vec employs corrupted prediction tasks within a self-distillation framework to learn robust audio-visual features inherently resistant to diverse real-world corruptions. The architecture-level solution, MoHAVE, utilizes a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture with hierarchical gating to dynamically allocate computational resources based on input characteristics. At the system level, DualHyp employs dual modality-specific hypotheses from separate ASR and VSR models, presented to an LLM for intelligent composition to maximize final recognition accuracy in challenging conditions.

## Key Results
- CAV2vec learns robust audio-visual features inherently resistant to diverse real-world corruptions without specialized noise-specific modules
- MoHAVE enables efficient scaling of model capacity through sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture with hierarchical gating
- DualHyp framework maximizes final recognition accuracy by leveraging LLM reasoning capabilities for intelligent composition of dual modality-specific hypotheses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The frameworks work by addressing AVSR challenges at multiple levels of abstraction. CAV2vec's corrupted prediction tasks within self-distillation create representations that are inherently robust to various types of corruption, eliminating the need for separate noise-handling modules. MoHAVE's hierarchical gating mechanism allows the system to dynamically allocate computational resources based on input characteristics, ensuring efficient scaling while maintaining performance. DualHyp leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to intelligently combine modality-specific hypotheses, maximizing accuracy by exploiting the complementary strengths of audio and visual inputs even in challenging conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- Self-supervised learning: Why needed - enables feature learning without labeled data; Quick check - verify feature quality through downstream task performance
- Mixture-of-Experts architecture: Why needed - provides scalable, adaptive computation; Quick check - measure computational efficiency vs baseline
- Modality-specific hypothesis generation: Why needed - preserves modality strengths before fusion; Quick check - validate individual modality performance
- Cross-modal alignment: Why needed - ensures reliable multimodal fusion; Quick check - assess alignment quality through correlation metrics
- Hierarchical gating: Why needed - enables dynamic resource allocation; Quick check - verify gating decisions match input characteristics
- LLM-based reasoning: Why needed - provides intelligent composition of hypotheses; Quick check - measure reasoning accuracy vs simple fusion

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Audio Input -> CAV2vec Feature Extractor -> MoHAVE Expert Selection -> DualHyp Hypothesis Generation -> LLM Composition -> Final Output

**Critical Path:** Input processing through CAV2vec, MoHAVE gating and expert selection, dual hypothesis generation, LLM composition

**Design Tradeoffs:** The hierarchical approach balances computational efficiency with robustness, but introduces complexity through multiple specialized components. CAV2vec's self-supervised learning reduces labeling requirements but may require extensive pre-training. MoHAVE's sparse MoE architecture provides scalability but adds gating complexity. DualHyp's LLM dependency enables intelligent composition but introduces potential computational bottlenecks.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation occurs when audio-visual alignment fails, gating mechanism makes incorrect resource allocation decisions, or LLM reasoning cannot effectively compose hypotheses. Resource constraints may limit real-time performance, particularly for DualHyp's LLM component.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate CAV2vec feature robustness across diverse acoustic environments with varying noise levels
2. Test MoHAVE's hierarchical gating decisions on inputs with known characteristics
3. Benchmark DualHyp's LLM composition accuracy against baseline fusion methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- CAV2vec's corrupted prediction tasks require further validation across diverse acoustic environments and speaker characteristics
- MoHAVE's hierarchical gating mechanism introduces complexity that could impact real-time performance in latency-sensitive applications
- DualHyp's dependence on LLM reasoning capabilities raises concerns about computational overhead and potential bottlenecks in production systems

- Systematic methodology and architectural innovations: High
- Empirical validation across diverse real-world conditions: Medium
- Long-term scalability and deployment considerations in resource-constrained environments: Low

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark CAV2vec's performance across diverse acoustic environments (industrial, outdoor, reverberant spaces) with varying speaker characteristics and accents
2. Conduct ablation studies on MoHAVE's hierarchical gating mechanism to quantify the trade-off between adaptive resource allocation and computational overhead
3. Evaluate DualHyp's real-time performance and reliability when integrated with different LLM architectures across varying hardware configurations and latency requirements
