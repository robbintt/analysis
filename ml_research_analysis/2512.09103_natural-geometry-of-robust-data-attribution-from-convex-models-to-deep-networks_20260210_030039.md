# Natural Geometry of Robust Data Attribution: From Convex Models to Deep Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.09103
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09103
- Reference count: 15
- One-line primary result: Introduces Natural Wasserstein metric for certified robust attribution, achieving 68.7% certification on CIFAR-10 vs 0% for Euclidean baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental fragility of data attribution methods in deep learning, where small training data perturbations can drastically alter influence rankings. The authors develop a unified framework that extends certified robust attribution from convex models to deep neural networks. The key innovation is the Natural Wasserstein metric, which measures perturbations in the geometry induced by the model's own feature covariance, eliminating spectral amplification that renders Euclidean certification vacuous for deep networks.

The framework introduces Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions for convex models with provable coverage guarantees and proves that Self-Influence (leverage scores) equals the Lipschitz constant governing attribution stability under the Natural metric for deep networks. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, the proposed W-TRAK method certifies 68.7% of ranking pairs compared to 0% for Euclidean baselines - representing the first non-vacuous certified bounds for neural network attribution.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a unified framework for certified robust data attribution by introducing the Natural Wasserstein metric, which measures perturbations in the feature space geometry defined by the model's covariance. For convex models, they derive Wasserstein-Robuous Influence Functions (W-RIF) with provable coverage guarantees. For deep networks, they prove that Self-Influence equals the Lipschitz constant governing attribution stability under the Natural metric. The core insight is that traditional Euclidean metrics suffer from spectral amplification - ill-conditioned deep representations can inflate Lipschitz bounds by over 10,000x, making certification vacuous. The Natural metric eliminates this issue by aligning the perturbation space with the model's learned geometry.

## Key Results
- W-TRAK certifies 68.7% of ranking pairs on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, compared to 0% for Euclidean baselines
- Self-Influence achieves 0.970 AUROC for label noise detection, identifying 94.1% of corrupted labels by examining only the top 20% of training data
- Proves that Self-Influence equals the Lipschitz constant for attribution stability under the Natural metric in deep networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Natural Wasserstein metric works by measuring perturbations in the geometry induced by the model's own feature covariance rather than using Euclidean distance in the input space. This eliminates spectral amplification - a phenomenon where ill-conditioned deep representations inflate Lipschitz bounds by over 10,000x when using Euclidean metrics. By aligning the perturbation space with the model's learned feature geometry, the method provides meaningful, non-vacuous certification bounds for attribution stability in deep networks.

## Foundational Learning

**Spectral Amplification**: The phenomenon where ill-conditioned deep representations inflate Lipschitz bounds by over 10,000x under Euclidean metrics. Why needed: Understanding this explains why traditional certification methods fail for deep networks. Quick check: Compare Lipschitz bounds computed using Euclidean vs. Natural metrics on a trained network.

**Influence Functions**: A classical technique for estimating the effect of training data points on model predictions. Why needed: Forms the foundation for data attribution methods that this work aims to robustify. Quick check: Verify influence function calculations on a simple logistic regression model.

**Wasserstein Distance**: A metric measuring distance between probability distributions based on optimal transport. Why needed: Provides the mathematical foundation for measuring perturbations in feature space geometry. Quick check: Compute Wasserstein distance between simple Gaussian distributions.

**Leverage Scores/Self-Influence**: Classical statistical measures of data point influence based on the diagonal of the hat matrix. Why needed: The paper proves this equals the Lipschitz constant under the Natural metric for deep networks. Quick check: Calculate leverage scores for a small linear regression dataset.

**Covariance-Induced Geometry**: Using the model's feature covariance to define a meaningful distance metric in representation space. Why needed: This is the core innovation that eliminates spectral amplification. Quick check: Visualize feature space using PCA vs. covariance-weighted metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data points -> Feature extractor -> Covariance matrix -> Natural Wasserstein metric -> Influence function computation -> Attribution stability certification

**Critical Path**: Training data -> Model training -> Feature extraction -> Covariance estimation -> W-TRAK certification computation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Natural metric provides non-vacuous bounds but requires covariance computation; Euclidean metric is simpler but yields vacuous bounds for deep networks

**Failure Signatures**: Vacuous certification bounds (>1) indicate spectral amplification; poor label noise detection performance suggests model representations lack discriminative geometry

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify spectral amplification on a simple CNN by comparing Euclidean vs. Natural Lipschitz bounds
2. Test W-TRAK certification rates on a smaller dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 subset) before full-scale experiments
3. Validate Self-Influence label noise detection on a dataset with known contamination patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Methodology not validated on ImageNet-scale datasets or vision transformer architectures
- 68.7% certification rate leaves significant uncertainty about fragile attributions under Natural metric
- Self-Influence label noise detection relies on oracle threshold and may not generalize to different contamination patterns

## Confidence

**High**: Theoretical foundation connecting Natural Wasserstein distance to influence function stability; empirical observation of spectral amplification in Euclidean metrics

**Medium**: Practical effectiveness of W-TRAK on CIFAR-10; AUROC performance of Self-Influence for label noise detection

**Low**: Scalability to larger datasets and architectures; behavior under distribution shift and adversarial training scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test W-TRAK certification rates on ImageNet with ResNet-50 and vision transformer architectures to assess scalability
2. Evaluate Self-Influence label noise detection on datasets with varying contamination rates (5%, 25%, 50%) and noise types (symmetric vs. instance-dependent)
3. Measure the impact of adversarial training on Natural Wasserstein certification bounds to understand robustness trade-offs
