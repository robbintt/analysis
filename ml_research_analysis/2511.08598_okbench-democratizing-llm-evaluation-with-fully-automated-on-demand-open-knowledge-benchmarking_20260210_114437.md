- Fully automated LLM evaluation framework generating high-quality dynamic knowledge benchmarks from daily news

## Executive Summary
OKBench presents a fully automated framework for generating dynamic knowledge benchmarks from daily news articles, addressing the challenge of evaluating large language models on evolving, non-memorized information. The system automatically creates multiple-choice and open-ended question-answer pairs using LLM-based agents for generation and validation, achieving 92% question clarity and 88% correctness rates in human validation studies. Experiments demonstrate that while models struggle on fresh knowledge without context (31-60% accuracy), retrieval-augmented methods significantly improve performance, with BM25 retrieval showing the highest effectiveness due to strong lexical cues in news content.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a four-step agentic pipeline: (1) RSS feed extraction from 25+ news sources to collect recent articles, (2) QA generation using GPT-4.1 to create 5 MCQs per article with specific formatting rules, (3) LLM-based validation agent that filters ambiguous or article-referencing questions using explicit rule-checking prompts, and (4) dataset versioning with unique MD5 signatures for reproducibility. The system costs approximately $4.21 per daily benchmark and generates 2,000-2,350 MCQs per run. Evaluation occurs under three settings: No-Context (testing knowledge recall), Oracle-Context (testing reading comprehension), and Retrieval-augmented (testing retrieval effectiveness with BM25, DPR, and ColBERT v2).

## Key Results
- Human validation confirms high quality: 92% accuracy on question clarity and 88% on correctness
- BM25 retrieval outperforms dense methods (DPR, ColBERT v2) on fresh news due to strong lexical cues
- Model size threshold identified: ~3-4B parameters required for reliable reading comprehension on fresh context
- Retrieval-augmented methods narrow performance gap between small and large models significantly

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Agentic QA Generation with Validation Loop
- Claim: Automated question generation from news produces high-quality benchmarks when paired with a validation agent that filters ambiguous or article-referencing questions.
- Mechanism: A two-stage LLM pipeline where (1) a generation agent creates MCQs from news articles targeting recent facts unlikely in pretraining data, and (2) a validation agent checks for article self-references, date clarity, explicit entity identifiers, and ambiguity—discarding failures automatically.
- Core assumption: LLM-based validators can reliably catch their own generation flaws via explicit rule-checking prompts (assumption: rule-based validation approximates human judgment).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Human validation studies confirm high quality of generated questions, with 92% accuracy on clarity and 88% on correctness."
  - [section] "Specifically, it checks whether the question: (1) avoids direct references to the source article, (2) includes accurate and clear date references, (3) uses explicit identifiers for entities..."
  - [corpus] YourBench (arXiv:2504.01833) similarly automates custom evaluation sets, suggesting this approach generalizes, but corpus lacks direct comparative quality metrics.
- Break condition: If source articles contain contradictory information or are themselves low-quality, the pipeline propagates errors downstream.

### Mechanism 2: Lexical Retrieval Outperforms Dense Methods on Fresh News
- Claim: BM25 retrieval achieves higher accuracy than dense retrievers (DPR, ColBERT v2) for time-sensitive news QA due to strong lexical cues (named entities, dates, event-specific phrasing).
- Mechanism: Fresh news questions target specific entities and dates; exact term matching in BM25 aligns with these lexical anchors better than semantic embeddings trained on older corpora (MS MARCO, Natural Questions) that lack domain adaptation.
- Core assumption: News QA questions contain distinctive lexical signatures that survive exact matching (assumption: entities and dates are not heavily paraphrased in questions).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Overall, BM25 achieves the highest top-k accuracy in most settings, outperforming both DPR and ColBERT v2."
  - [section] "The strong lexical cues (e.g., named entities, event-specific phrasing) may favor exact term matching."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison on news-domain retrieval; this appears understudied in neighbors.
- Break condition: If questions require heavy paraphrasing or synonyms not present in source articles, BM25 advantage degrades.

### Mechanism 3: Model Size Threshold for Reading Comprehension on Fresh Context
- Claim: Models below ~3-4B parameters exhibit a sharp performance ceiling even with oracle context, while larger models reach 90-95% accuracy.
- Mechanism: Very small models lack representational capacity to parse passage-level context and extract answers, independent of knowledge freshness—suggesting a floor on reading comprehension ability.
- Core assumption: The Oracle-Context setting isolates reading comprehension from knowledge recall (assumption: providing the ground-truth article removes all knowledge requirements).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Yet very small LLMs (e.g., ≤ 1 B parameters) achieve only around 55–60% even with the ground-truth article."
  - [section] "Models around or above roughly 3–4 B parameters can read and understand the article sufficiently to push their Oracle accuracy to 90–95%."
  - [corpus] No corpus papers directly address this threshold; appears to be a novel finding here.
- Break condition: If oracle context is extremely long or complex, even larger models may show degraded performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: OKBench explicitly evaluates RAG pipelines; understanding retrieval methods (BM25, dense encoders) and their integration with LLMs is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why BM25 would outperform a dense retriever on queries containing specific named entities not in the dense model's training distribution?

- **Benchmark Contamination**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core motivation is avoiding data contamination where static benchmarks leak into pretraining; understanding this problem clarifies why dynamic benchmarks matter.
  - Quick check question: If a model was trained on Wikipedia dumps from 2023, why would evaluating it on Natural Questions (sourced from Wikipedia) inflate performance estimates?

- **Agentic LLM Systems**
  - Why needed here: OKBench uses specialized agents (generation, validation) that collaborate; understanding agent roles and prompt engineering is essential for reproducing or extending the pipeline.
  - Quick check question: What failure modes would you expect if the validation agent's prompt lacked explicit rules about date references?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** News Extraction Layer -> QA Generation Agent -> Validation Agent -> Versioning Module -> Evaluation Harness
- **Critical path:** News extraction → QA generation → validation → signature assignment. Validation is the gatekeeper; high discard rates here signal prompt tuning needs.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Full automation vs. quality: The paper accepts ~8% question clarity failure rate (92% pass) to maintain scalability.
  - Cost vs. freshness: $4.21/day is affordable; proprietary LLM dependency (GPT-4.1) creates reproducibility risk if API changes.
  - Domain scope: English-only news excludes multilingual/multimedia sources—trade breadth for feasibility.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High discard rate in validation (>30%): Indicates generation prompt needs refinement or source articles are low-quality.
  - Dense retrievers outperforming BM25: Signal that questions may be overly paraphrased or source articles lack distinctive lexical markers.
  - Oracle accuracy <80% for 7B+ models: Indicates potential bug in context injection or model instruction following.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce retrieval comparison on 1-day corpus**: Run BM25 vs. DPR vs. ColBERT v2 with top-k∈{1,3,5,10}; verify BM25 dominance holds.
  2. **Ablate validation agent**: Generate questions with and without validation; measure human-rated quality delta to quantify validator contribution.
  3. **Test model size threshold**: Evaluate 1B, 3B, 7B models under Oracle-Context on held-out snapshot; confirm ~3-4B reading comprehension cutoff.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can domain-adapted dense retrievers match or exceed BM25 performance on dynamic news corpora, or is lexical matching inherently superior for rapidly evolving content?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "dense retrievers like DPR and ColBERT v2 often excel on standard benchmarks" but "BM25 proves more robust for this dynamic news scenario," suggesting "domain shift can hurt dense matching unless the models are further adapted."
- Why unresolved: The paper tests off-the-shelf retrievers trained on MS MARCO and Natural Questions but does not experiment with domain-adapted variants on fresh news.
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-tune DPR and ColBERT v2 on a news-domain corpus, then compare top-k retrieval accuracy and end-to-end QA performance against BM25 on OKBench-generated benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the minimum model scale required for reliable reading comprehension of fresh news articles, and can architectural innovations lower this threshold?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe a "sharp performance cutoff": "Models around or above roughly 3–4 B parameters can read and understand the article sufficiently to push their Oracle accuracy to 90–95%. Yet very small LLMs (e.g., ≤ 1 B parameters) achieve only around 55–60% even with the ground-truth article."
- Why unresolved: The paper characterizes the threshold empirically but does not investigate whether fine-tuning, architectural changes, or chain-of-thought prompting could help sub-3B models close the gap.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments on small models (≤2B) with techniques like instruction tuning on news comprehension tasks, measuring Oracle-Context accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can automated benchmark pipelines detect and mitigate propagation of misinformation from upstream news sources?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Automated harvesting also risks propagating misinformation if upstream outlets publish retracted or false content. Addressing these limitations remains important future work."
- Why unresolved: OKBench validates question clarity and answer correctness but does not verify the factual accuracy of source articles themselves.
- What evidence would resolve it: Incorporate fact-checking modules (e.g., cross-referencing multiple outlets, using fact-verification models) into the pipeline and measure the reduction in benchmark questions based on subsequently retracted claims.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can OKBench's pipeline be effectively extended to multilingual or domain-specific corpora (e.g., biomedical literature) with comparable quality and automation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The limitations section states: "We currently target English-language online news. This excludes non-English, local, pay-walled, or multimedia sources... Extending the pipeline to multilingual or domain-specific corpora (e.g., biomedical literature) will require tailored scraping, prompting, and validation strategies."
- Why unresolved: The current pipeline is optimized for English news; multilingual and specialized domains may require different entity extraction, question phrasing norms, and validation criteria.
- What evidence would resolve it: Apply OKBench to multilingual news feeds and a biomedical corpus (e.g., PubMed daily updates), then conduct human validation studies to compare question clarity and answer correctness rates against the English news baseline.

## Limitations

- Proprietary LLM dependency (GPT-4.1) creates reproducibility barriers and ongoing cost (~$4.21/day)
- English-only news scope excludes multilingual, local, pay-walled, and multimedia sources
- No mechanism to verify factual accuracy of source articles, risking propagation of misinformation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Retrieval-augmented methods narrow the performance gap between small and large models; BM25 outperforms dense retrievers on fresh news due to lexical matching advantages.
- **Medium Confidence**: Model size threshold (~3-4B parameters) for effective reading comprehension with oracle context; 92% question clarity and 88% correctness rates from human validation.
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization of validation agent performance across diverse news sources and quality levels; scalability of the framework to multilingual or multimedia content.

## Next Checks

1. **Retrieval Method Generalization**: Test BM25 vs. DPR/ColBERT v2 on news articles from different domains (financial, political, technology) to verify lexical matching advantage persists across varied content types.

2. **Validation Agent Robustness**: Generate questions using the validation agent on intentionally low-quality or contradictory news articles to measure false acceptance rates and identify prompt weaknesses.

3. **Model Size Threshold Replication**: Evaluate models at 1B, 3B, 7B, and 13B parameter scales under Oracle-Context conditions on multiple held-out news snapshots to confirm the ~3-4B parameter reading comprehension threshold.
