# Translution: Unifying Self-attention and Convolution for Adaptive and Relative Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.10060
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10060
- Authors: Hehe Fan; Yi Yang; Mohan Kankanhalli; Fei Wu
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Translution achieves 52.41% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, improving from 46.28% with self-attention alone

## Executive Summary
Translution introduces a novel operation that unifies the adaptive identification capability of self-attention with the relative encoding advantage of convolution. While self-attention can adaptively identify relevant elements but relies on absolute positional embeddings, convolution encodes elements relatively but uses a fixed receptive field. Translution addresses both limitations by employing separate parameters for each direction and distance when computing query, key, and value. To address the significant parameter increase this causes, the authors also propose α-Translution, a lightweight variant that reduces parameters while maintaining performance. Experiments demonstrate superior accuracy on both computer vision (ImageNet-1K) and natural language processing (OpenWebText) tasks compared to standard self-attention.

## Method Summary
Translution operates by computing query, key, and value vectors using separate parameters for each direction and distance, effectively combining the adaptive identification of self-attention with the relative encoding of convolution. This unified operation allows the model to capture both absolute and relative positional relationships without relying solely on positional embeddings. The α-Translution variant introduces parameter sharing strategies to reduce the computational overhead while preserving the core benefits. Both operations are integrated into transformer architectures through standard self-attention mechanisms, replacing or augmenting existing attention layers.

## Key Results
- Translution achieves 52.41% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, compared to 46.28% with standard self-attention
- α-Translution improves top-1 accuracy to 48.36% on ImageNet-1K with minimal parameter increase
- Both methods demonstrate superior performance on OpenWebText language modeling tasks
- Dynamic MNIST experiments show Translution maintains high accuracy when digit positions vary, demonstrating better modeling of relative structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Translution works by explicitly parameterizing directional and distance-based relationships between elements. Traditional self-attention computes interactions based on content similarity but struggles with relative positioning, often requiring separate positional embeddings. Convolution naturally encodes relative positions through its receptive field but cannot adaptively identify which elements are most relevant. By using separate parameters for each direction and distance when computing query, key, and value vectors, Translution learns to weigh both the content similarity and positional relationships simultaneously. This unified approach allows the model to adaptively identify relevant elements while maintaining awareness of their relative positions, addressing the fundamental limitations of both self-attention and convolution.

## Foundational Learning

**Self-attention**: A mechanism where each element attends to all others based on learned similarity scores, allowing adaptive identification of relevant information. Why needed: Forms the basis for adaptive element interaction in Translution. Quick check: Can you explain how query-key-value computations work in standard self-attention?

**Convolution**: A local operation that applies filters to neighboring elements, naturally encoding relative positions through its receptive field. Why needed: Provides the relative encoding capability that self-attention lacks. Quick check: How does convolution's fixed receptive field limit its ability to capture long-range dependencies?

**Positional Embeddings**: Additional vectors added to element representations to encode their positions in the sequence. Why needed: Standard self-attention requires these to incorporate positional information. Quick check: What are the limitations of using absolute positional embeddings versus relative encodings?

**Parameter Sharing**: Techniques to reduce model complexity by reusing parameters across different contexts. Why needed: Critical for managing the increased parameter count in Translution. Quick check: How does α-Translution achieve parameter efficiency while preserving performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input sequence -> Query/Key/Value computation (Translution) -> Attention weights -> Weighted sum -> Output sequence

**Critical Path**: The Translution operation sits between the linear projections of query, key, and value vectors and the final attention-weighted output. It modifies how these vectors are computed by incorporating direction- and distance-specific parameters.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Translution offers superior modeling of relative structures at the cost of increased parameters. α-Translution addresses this by introducing parameter sharing, trading some representational power for efficiency. The choice between them depends on whether the task prioritizes accuracy or computational constraints.

**Failure Signatures**: If Translution underperforms, potential causes include: insufficient training data to learn direction-specific parameters, overly aggressive parameter sharing in α-Translution, or architectural mismatches where the task doesn't benefit from relative encoding.

**First Experiments**:
1. Replace standard self-attention with Translution in a simple transformer encoder layer and evaluate on a toy relative position task
2. Compare Translution versus α-Translution on a small-scale classification benchmark to assess parameter efficiency tradeoff
3. Visualize attention patterns from Translution versus standard self-attention on dynamic MNIST to verify improved relative structure modeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The fundamental parameter increase from using separate parameters for each direction and distance creates efficiency challenges
- Experimental validation covers a limited set of tasks and model architectures, requiring broader generalization testing
- Claims about "superior accuracy" are supported by specific benchmarks but lack comprehensive external validation across diverse domains

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The mathematical formulation of Translution and its distinction from standard self-attention and convolution operations is well-established and theoretically sound

**Medium confidence**: The experimental results on ImageNet-1K and OpenWebText are internally consistent and demonstrate measurable improvements, though external validation is needed

**Medium confidence**: The claim about better modeling of relative structures in dynamic MNIST experiments is supported by the specific case shown but requires testing on more varied spatial relationship tasks

## Next Checks
1. Test Translution and α-Translution on additional computer vision benchmarks (e.g., COCO detection, semantic segmentation) to assess generalizability beyond ImageNet classification
2. Evaluate performance across different model scales (small, medium, large) to understand parameter efficiency tradeoffs more comprehensively
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of direction-specific parameters versus distance-specific parameters to better understand the source of performance gains
