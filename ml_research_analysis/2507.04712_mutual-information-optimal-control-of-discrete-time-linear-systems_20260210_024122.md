# Mutual Information Optimal Control of Discrete-Time Linear Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.04712
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04712
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Primary result**: Solves mutual information optimal control problem for discrete-time linear systems by optimizing both policy and prior under Gaussian distributions

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) for discrete-time linear systems by extending maximum entropy optimal control to simultaneously optimize both the policy and prior distributions. Under Gaussian distribution assumptions for both policy and prior classes, the authors derive closed-form solutions for optimal policy and prior when the other is fixed. They propose an alternating minimization algorithm that demonstrates monotonic decrease in the objective function, converging after approximately a dozen iterations. The state process behavior aligns with theoretical predictions, spreading along eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues greater than 1 of the system matrix as the mutual information regularization coefficient increases.

## Method Summary
The authors formulate the MIOCP by maximizing mutual information between states and actions while optimizing both the control policy and prior distribution. They restrict the policy and prior classes to Gaussian distributions, enabling derivation of closed-form optimal solutions for each when the other is fixed. The alternating minimization algorithm iteratively updates the policy and prior, with each step solving a convex optimization problem. Numerical experiments on a discrete-time linear system demonstrate convergence behavior, showing monotonic decrease in the objective function and stabilization after approximately 12 iterations. The algorithm's performance is evaluated through state process analysis, revealing characteristic spreading patterns consistent with theoretical expectations about system eigenvalues.

## Key Results
- Alternating minimization algorithm converges monotonically, with objective function stabilizing after approximately 12 iterations
- State process spreads along eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues greater than 1 of the system matrix as mutual information regularization increases
- Closed-form solutions derived for optimal policy and prior under Gaussian distribution assumptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the mathematical properties of Gaussian distributions and mutual information. When the prior is fixed, the optimal policy maximizes the conditional entropy of actions given states while satisfying the mutual information constraint, which simplifies to a convex optimization problem with closed-form solution. Similarly, when the policy is fixed, the optimal prior minimizes the KL divergence to the marginal distribution of states under the current policy, also yielding a closed-form Gaussian solution. The alternating minimization exploits this structure, with each subproblem being analytically tractable, enabling efficient computation of local optima.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: System dynamics -> Prior distribution -> Policy distribution -> State-action mutual information

**Critical Path**: System matrix A -> State distribution (under current policy) -> Optimal policy update -> Prior update -> Mutual information evaluation -> Convergence check

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Gaussian assumption enables closed-form solutions but limits applicability to non-Gaussian scenarios
- Alternating minimization provides computational efficiency but only guarantees local optima
- Mutual information regularization balances exploration and exploitation but requires careful tuning

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Non-convergence after many iterations suggests poor initialization or ill-conditioned system dynamics
- Oscillatory behavior between iterations indicates potential saddle points or need for damping
- Degenerate state distributions suggest overly restrictive prior assumptions

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify closed-form solutions by substituting back into optimization objectives
2. Test convergence sensitivity across multiple random initializations
3. Compare state distribution evolution against theoretical eigenvalue predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Gaussian distribution assumption may not capture complex nonlinear or non-Gaussian system behaviors
- Convergence guarantees for alternating minimization lack rigorous theoretical proof beyond empirical demonstration
- Numerical experiments limited to single example without exploring robustness across diverse system dynamics

## Confidence
- Closed-form solutions for optimal policy/prior under Gaussian assumptions: **High**
- Convergence of alternating minimization algorithm: **Medium** (empirical evidence only)
- Generalization to broader system classes: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Test algorithm convergence across multiple random initializations and system configurations
2. Verify theoretical predictions about state distribution behavior on systems with mixed stability properties
3. Compare performance against maximum entropy optimal control baseline on benchmark control problems
