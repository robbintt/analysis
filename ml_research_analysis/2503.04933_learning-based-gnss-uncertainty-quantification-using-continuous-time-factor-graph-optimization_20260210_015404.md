# Learning-based GNSS Uncertainty Quantification using Continuous-Time Factor Graph Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.04933
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04933
- Authors: Haoming Zhang
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: Two learning-based approaches for GNSS uncertainty quantification achieving 40% better performance than M-estimators and 11% better than naive GMM implementations

## Executive Summary
This paper presents two learning-based approaches for GNSS uncertainty quantification targeting outlier detection and noise distribution approximation. The first method employs a transformer-enhanced LSTM network for offline outlier prediction, leveraging temporal and spatial information from satellite observations. The second method uses online variational Bayesian inference to train a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that approximates pseudorange noise distribution. A novel continuous-time factor graph optimization framework is developed for multisensor fusion, enabling robust trajectory estimation independent of any specific reference sensor. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in state estimation accuracy, particularly in challenging urban environments.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces two complementary learning-based approaches for GNSS uncertainty quantification. The first approach uses a transformer-enhanced LSTM network for offline outlier prediction, which processes temporal and spatial information from satellite observations to detect NLOS signals and predict pseudorange errors. The second approach employs online variational Bayesian inference to train a GMM that approximates the pseudorange noise distribution using past residual samples. To validate these approaches, a continuous-time factor graph optimization framework is developed for multisensor fusion, enabling robust trajectory estimation without dependence on specific reference sensors. The framework integrates learned uncertainties into the optimization process, improving state estimation accuracy in urban environments where GNSS signals are often degraded by multipath and NLOS conditions.

## Key Results
- GMM approach achieves 40% better performance than M-estimators for pseudorange noise modeling
- Transformer-enhanced LSTM network demonstrates superior generalization for NLOS classification
- Continuous-time factor graph optimization framework enables robust trajectory estimation independent of reference sensors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The learning-based approaches work by capturing complex, environment-dependent patterns in GNSS measurement errors that traditional statistical models cannot adequately represent. The transformer-enhanced LSTM network learns temporal and spatial correlations in satellite observations, enabling it to distinguish between LOS and NLOS conditions based on historical patterns. The GMM approach captures the multimodal nature of pseudorange noise distributions in urban environments by learning from actual residual samples rather than assuming Gaussian distributions. The continuous-time factor graph optimization framework provides a flexible and robust way to integrate these learned uncertainties into state estimation, allowing for adaptive weighting of measurements based on their estimated reliability.

## Foundational Learning
- **GNSS Fundamentals**: Understanding pseudorange measurements, NLOS/LOS conditions, and urban signal degradation is essential for contextualizing the problem. Quick check: Verify understanding of how urban environments affect GNSS signal quality.
- **Factor Graph Optimization**: The continuous-time factor graph framework forms the backbone of state estimation. Quick check: Confirm ability to represent multisensor fusion problems as factor graphs.
- **Transformer Networks**: Used for capturing long-range temporal dependencies in satellite observation sequences. Quick check: Understand attention mechanisms and sequence modeling capabilities.
- **Variational Bayesian Inference**: Enables online learning of GMM parameters from residual samples. Quick check: Verify understanding of Bayesian parameter estimation and mixture models.
- **M-estimators**: Traditional robust estimation methods that the GMM approach outperforms. Quick check: Compare M-estimator performance with learned approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Transformer-Enhanced LSTM -> Outlier Detection -> Factor Graph Input
GMM Parameter Learning -> Noise Distribution -> Factor Graph Input
Continuous-Time Factor Graph -> State Estimation -> Trajectory Output

Critical Path:
Satellite observations -> Transformer-Enhanced LSTM network -> NLOS classification -> Measurement weighting in factor graph -> State estimation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Offline vs online learning: The LSTM approach requires offline training but provides fast inference, while the GMM approach learns online but may need time to converge
- Model complexity vs generalization: More complex models may overfit to specific urban environments
- Computational cost vs accuracy: More sophisticated uncertainty quantification improves accuracy but increases computational requirements

Failure Signatures:
- Poor generalization of LSTM network to new urban environments
- GMM convergence issues with insufficient residual samples
- Factor graph optimization divergence with extreme uncertainty estimates

First 3 Experiments:
1. Test LSTM outlier detection performance on held-out urban scenarios with varying building densities
2. Evaluate GMM noise distribution approximation with synthetic pseudorange residuals
3. Validate continuous-time factor graph optimization with simulated multisensor fusion data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several areas for future research, including improving sample efficiency for both learning approaches, extending the federated system to integrate both learning paradigms more effectively, and validating the methods across diverse urban environments beyond the tested scenarios. Additional questions include how to handle extreme cases where GNSS measurements are completely unavailable and how to adapt the approaches for different vehicle dynamics and sensor configurations.

## Limitations
- Transformer-enhanced LSTM network effectiveness requires further validation across diverse urban environments
- GMM approach performance depends heavily on quality and representativeness of past residual samples
- Continuous-time factor graph optimization framework effectiveness across various urban scenarios needs extensive testing

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Transformer-enhanced LSTM network demonstrates superior NLOS classification performance compared to baseline methods, particularly in handling out-of-distribution data

Medium confidence:
- GMM approach achieves 40% better performance than M-estimators, though this improvement may vary with different urban environments and sensor configurations
- Continuous-time factor graph optimization framework enables robust trajectory estimation independent of specific reference sensors, though its effectiveness across various urban scenarios needs further validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the learning-based methods across diverse urban environments with varying building densities and satellite visibility conditions to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate the sample efficiency of both learning approaches by systematically varying the amount of training data and measuring performance degradation
3. Implement and validate a federated system integrating both the transformer-enhanced LSTM and GMM approaches to assess their complementary benefits in real-world scenarios
