# SoS1: O1 and R1-Like Reasoning LLMs are Sum-of-Square Solvers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.20545
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20545
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 7B model outperforms 671B model on SoS detection with structured reasoning

## Executive Summary
This work demonstrates that large language models can be guided to solve the NP-hard problem of determining whether a multivariate polynomial is a sum of squares (SoS). The authors introduce SoS-1K, a dataset of approximately 1,000 polynomials with expert-designed reasoning instructions. Without structured guidance, state-of-the-art LLMs achieve only ~60% accuracy, just above random guessing. However, with high-quality reasoning instructions, performance improves significantly to 81% accuracy. The authors' 7B model, SoS-7B, fine-tuned on SoS-1K for just 4 hours, outperforms much larger models (671B DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o-mini) in accuracy while requiring only 1.8% and 5% of their computation time.

## Method Summary
The authors construct SoS-1K, a dataset of ~1,000 polynomials representing five progressively challenging criteria for SoS detection. They employ a systematic approach where LLMs are guided through step-by-step reasoning instructions designed by experts. The baseline LLMs achieve ~60% accuracy without guidance, but with structured reasoning instructions, accuracy improves to 81%. The SoS-7B model is fine-tuned on this dataset for only 4 hours. The evaluation compares performance against much larger models (671B DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o-mini) using wall-clock time measurements, demonstrating that the smaller fine-tuned model outperforms larger models in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- LLMs without structured reasoning instructions achieve only ~60% accuracy on SoS detection
- High-quality reasoning instructions improve performance to 81% accuracy
- 7B SoS-7B model outperforms 671B DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o-mini in accuracy
- SoS-7B requires only 1.8% and 5% of the computation time of larger models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that structured reasoning instructions can guide LLMs to solve complex mathematical problems by breaking them down into manageable steps. The SoS detection problem benefits from step-by-step verification procedures that help the model avoid common pitfalls and systematically evaluate polynomial properties.

## Foundational Learning
- Sum of Squares (SoS) Polynomials: Polynomials expressible as sums of squared polynomials, fundamental to Hilbert's Seventeenth Problem
- NP-hard Complexity: SoS detection is computationally intractable for large problems, requiring heuristic approaches
- Multivariate Polynomial Properties: Understanding polynomial structure, degree, and coefficient relationships for SoS verification
- Reasoning Instruction Design: Expert-crafted step-by-step procedures that guide model reasoning through complex mathematical problems
- Dataset Construction for Mathematical Reasoning: Creating balanced, representative datasets that capture problem difficulty gradients
- Cross-Model Comparison: Evaluating performance across different model sizes while accounting for computational constraints

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Polynomial Input -> Reasoning Instructions -> Step-by-Step Processing -> SoS Classification -> Validation
**Critical Path**: The reasoning instruction pipeline is critical, where structured guidance transforms the LLM's approach from pattern matching to systematic verification
**Design Tradeoffs**: Small model with fine-tuning vs. large model without training - the 7B model achieves better accuracy with significantly less computation
**Failure Signatures**: Without reasoning instructions, models default to guessing (~60% accuracy); with poor instructions, performance plateaus below 70%
**First Experiments**: 1) Test baseline LLMs on SoS-1K without instructions, 2) Apply different reasoning instruction variants, 3) Compare computational efficiency across model sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset contains only ~1,000 examples, which is relatively small for training and validation
- Expert-designed reasoning instructions are not transparently described, raising concerns about bias and overfitting
- Comparison to random guessing assumes balanced dataset without verification
- Evaluation focuses only on binary classification without assessing quality of SoS decompositions

## Confidence
- Core claim on structured reasoning improvement: Medium
- Comparison between 7B and 671B models: Low
- Dataset representativeness and generalizability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce results with expanded dataset and cross-validation across multiple train/test splits and independent polynomial distributions
2. Conduct ablation studies on reasoning instructions to identify critical components and test generalization to other mathematical tasks
3. Implement computational cost normalization to properly compare wall-clock time accounting for hardware differences and token counts
