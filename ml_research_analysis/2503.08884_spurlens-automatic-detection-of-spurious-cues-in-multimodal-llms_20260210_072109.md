# SpurLens: Automatic Detection of Spurious Cues in Multimodal LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.08884
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08884
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Automatic detection of spurious visual cues in MLLMs reveals biases that reduce accuracy by up to 20.4% and increase hallucinations by over 10x

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SpurLens, a method to automatically detect spurious visual cues that cause object recognition and hallucination failures in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The core idea is to use GPT-4 to propose potential spurious cues for objects and OWLv2 to rank images based on their presence, allowing computation of Spurious Gaps in model performance. Experiments show that removing spurious cues reduces accuracy by up to 20.4% and increases hallucination rates by over 10x. The study finds spurious bias is a fundamental issue, not easily mitigated by prompt engineering or reasoning-based strategies. The method requires no human supervision, works across datasets, and reveals that both MLLM language and vision encoders exhibit spurious biases.

## Method Summary
SpurLens automatically detects spurious visual cues in MLLMs by leveraging GPT-4 to generate potential spurious cues for given objects, then using OWLv2 to rank images based on the presence of these cues. The method computes Spurious Gaps by measuring performance differences when cues are present versus absent. The approach is fully automatic, requiring no human supervision, and can be applied across different datasets and MLLM architectures. By systematically identifying and quantifying spurious correlations, SpurLens provides insights into model failures and potential areas for improvement.

## Key Results
- Spurious cues reduce MLLM accuracy by up to 20.4% when absent
- Removing spurious cues increases hallucination rates by over 10x
- Simple prompt-based mitigation strategies (Ensemble, CoT) fail to eliminate spurious gaps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SpurLens works by exploiting the multimodal nature of MLLMs, where both language and vision components can develop spurious correlations. The method leverages GPT-4's ability to generate potential spurious cues and OWLv2's ranking capabilities to quantify the impact of these cues on model performance. By systematically measuring performance differences with and without spurious cues, the approach reveals fundamental biases in how MLLMs process visual information and make predictions.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal LLMs combine language and vision processing for integrated understanding
  - Why needed: Understanding the hybrid nature of MLLMs is crucial for identifying where spurious biases can emerge
  - Quick check: Review MLLM architecture diagrams showing language and vision encoder integration
- Spurious correlations are associations between irrelevant features and correct predictions
  - Why needed: Recognizing that models can exploit irrelevant visual cues is key to understanding the problem
  - Quick check: Examine examples where models correctly identify objects based on background context rather than the object itself
- OWLv2 is a vision-language model that can rank images based on textual descriptions
  - Why needed: Understanding how OWLv2 ranks images is essential for the automatic cue detection methodology
  - Quick check: Review OWLv2 documentation on image ranking capabilities
- Prompt engineering strategies like Chain-of-Thought and Ensemble prompting
  - Why needed: These are common mitigation approaches tested against spurious biases
  - Quick check: Review examples of CoT and Ensemble prompting applied to multimodal tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Image Input -> Vision Encoder -> Multimodal Fusion -> LLM Output

### Critical Path
The critical path for spurious cue detection flows from image input through the vision encoder, where spurious correlations are first identified, through multimodal fusion where these correlations are reinforced, to the LLM output where they influence predictions.

### Design Tradeoffs
The automatic detection approach trades potential accuracy for scalability and reproducibility, eliminating the need for human annotation while potentially missing nuanced spurious cues that humans might identify.

### Failure Signatures
Models exhibit characteristic failures when spurious cues are removed: accuracy drops of up to 20.4% and hallucination rates increase by over 10x, indicating heavy reliance on these spurious correlations for correct predictions.

### First Experiments
1. Test SpurLens on a simple binary classification task to verify basic functionality
2. Compare automatic cue detection against human-annotated spurious cues on a small dataset
3. Evaluate the impact of different GPT-4 prompting strategies on cue generation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a robust mitigation strategy be developed that effectively reduces spurious bias without degrading general performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors ask "can they be mitigated?" and state in the conclusion that SpurLens "does not identify... a robust mitigation strategy."
- Why unresolved: The paper tested prompt-based mitigation strategies (Ensemble, CoT) but found that the "Spurious Gap persists in all strategies," proving simple prompting is insufficient.
- What evidence would resolve it: A training intervention or architectural modification that significantly lowers the Spurious Gap (PA/HR) on the identified datasets while maintaining baseline accuracy on standard benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: From where do spurious biases originate in the multimodal architecture?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The introduction explicitly asks "from where do these biases originate," and the conclusion notes the method "does not identify their root causes."
- Why unresolved: While ablations show the vision encoder exhibits bias, the diagnostic tool cannot disentangle whether the bias stems primarily from the vision embeddings, the language model, or the multimodal fusion layers.
- What evidence would resolve it: A component-wise disentanglement study that successfully attributes specific spurious correlations to the vision encoder versus the LLM fusion mechanism.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do spurious correlations impact open-ended generation tasks compared to the binary perception tasks evaluated in this study?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge they use binary-resemblance prompts for evaluation ease, though they note biases manifest in open-ended generation (Appendices C, D, R).
- Why unresolved: The quantitative analysis relies on binary Yes/No metrics (PA/HR), leaving the systematic impact of spurious cues on complex reasoning or long-form descriptions unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified evaluation framework that quantifies hallucination rates and factual consistency in long-form model outputs when spurious cues are present versus absent.

## Limitations
- The study focuses on object recognition tasks, limiting generalizability to other multimodal capabilities
- Results are specific to tested MLLM architectures and may not generalize to all models
- Reliance on GPT-4 for cue generation introduces potential circularity concerns

## Confidence
- Presence of spurious biases: High
- Impact on model performance: High
- Automatic detection method effectiveness: Medium
- Fundamental difficulty of mitigation: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with a broader range of MLLM architectures and datasets to test generalizability
2. Validate the GPT-4 generated spurious cues against human-annotated cues to assess the quality and potential biases in the automatic detection method
3. Test additional mitigation strategies, including fine-tuning approaches and novel prompting techniques, to better understand the potential for addressing spurious biases
