# Unsupervised Video Continual Learning via Non-Parametric Deep Embedded Clustering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.21773
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21773
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** Proposes uVCL-KDE-RBF achieving 93.45% cluster accuracy on UCF101 in unsupervised video continual learning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses unsupervised video continual learning without task or class boundaries by introducing a non-parametric deep embedded clustering method using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and mean-shift clustering. The approach dynamically creates and expands clusters based on a novelty detection criterion, using memory buffers to store exemplars for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Two variants are proposed: uVCL-KDE (mean-shift clustering) and uVCL-KDE-RBF (with a linear classifier). Experiments on UCF101, HMDB51, and SSv2 show that uVCL-KDE-RBF achieves high cluster accuracy while maintaining performance over tasks, outperforming baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

## Method Summary
The method uses a frozen pre-trained VideoMAE V2 transformer to extract 1024-dim features from unlabeled videos. KDE with Gaussian kernel models the data distribution, and mean-shift clustering finds peaks (modes) to form dynamic clusters. A novelty detection criterion determines when new clusters should be created. Memory buffers store 20 feature exemplars per cluster using FIFO replacement. For uVCL-KDE-RBF, a linear layer is trained on pseudo-labels from cluster assignments using Focal Loss. The system learns sequentially from mixed-category tasks without labels, evaluating performance using Cluster Accuracy and Average Cluster Accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- uVCL-KDE-RBF achieves 93.45% cluster accuracy on UCF101
- Maintains good performance across tasks without catastrophic forgetting
- Outperforms baselines in both accuracy and efficiency with fewer parameters and less training time
- Successfully learns from mixed-category, unlabeled video data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A non-parametric density-based approach using KDE and mean-shift clustering enables dynamic discovery of new clusters from video features without needing labels or predefined cluster counts. A frozen pre-trained video transformer extracts features, and mean-shift algorithm finds peaks in the KDE distribution. A novelty detection criterion determines if incoming data represents a new cluster.

Core assumption: The feature space from the unsupervised video transformer preserves semantic similarity, causing semantically similar videos to form distinct, separable peaks in the density distribution.

Evidence anchors:
- [abstract] "...dynamically creating and managing clusters using mean-shift clustering, with a novelty detection criterion to identify when new clusters should be formed."
- [section 4.4] "New clusters are defined when the new data... indicates completely different information from that already known by the uVCL-KDE..."

Break condition: Fails if the feature extractor produces a space where semantic classes overlap and do not form distinct density peaks, or if the novelty threshold is misset.

### Mechanism 2
Storing a small number of feature exemplars per cluster in a memory buffer and replaying them during subsequent tasks mitigates catastrophic forgetting. After a task is learned, a subset of video features for each discovered cluster is stored, and these stored exemplars are combined with new data for the next round of clustering.

Core assumption: A small, fixed set of exemplars (e.g., 20 videos per cluster) is sufficient to approximate a cluster's feature distribution and preserve it against interference from new tasks.

Evidence anchors:
- [abstract] "...while maintaining good performance across tasks without catastrophic forgetting."
- [section 6] "The key to sustaining the performance is to use memory buffers..."

Break condition: Fails if the memory buffer is too small to capture intra-cluster variance, if FIFO replacement discards critical examples, or if new tasks overwhelm the replay process.

### Mechanism 3
Adding a linear trainable layer on top of the discovered clusters, similar to RBF networks, refines the cluster assignments and improves classification performance. Once cluster centers are found via mean-shift, they are used as the basis for a linear layer trained using pseudo-labels with Focal Loss-modulated cross-entropy loss.

Core assumption: The initial cluster centers from mean-shift provide good initialization, and a linear decision boundary can effectively separate the clusters in the feature space.

Evidence anchors:
- [abstract] "They extend this with a linear mapping on top of clusters, similar to RBF networks (uVCL-KDE-RBF)."
- [section 4.3] "The cluster assignments... are used as targets within a linear classifier..."

Break condition: Fails if clusters are not linearly separable or if initial pseudo-labels are too noisy for the linear layer to learn effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**
  - Why needed here: Core non-parametric method for modeling data distribution, allowing system to find dense regions without assuming specific parametric shape.
  - Quick check question: How does choice of kernel bandwidth `h` influence smoothness of density estimate and resulting number of clusters?

- **Concept: Mean-Shift Clustering**
  - Why needed here: Iterative algorithm that locates modes (peaks) of KDE, which become dynamic cluster centers.
  - Quick check question: Explain what a "mode" is in context of probability density function and how mean-shift converges to it.

- **Concept: Catastrophic Forgetting**
  - Why needed here: Central problem in continual learning that memory replay mechanism is designed to solve.
  - Quick check question: Why does fine-tuning neural network sequentially on new tasks typically lead to loss of performance on previously learned tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Video -> VideoMAE V2 -> Feature Vector -> (Concatenate with Memory Buffer) -> KDE/Mean-Shift -> Cluster Assignment & New Cluster Creation -> (Optional) RBF Linear Layer Training. Store new exemplars in memory.
- **Critical path:** Raw Video -> VideoMAE V2 -> Feature Vector -> (Concatenate with Memory Buffer) -> KDE/Mean-Shift -> Cluster Assignment & New Cluster Creation -> (Optional) RBF Linear Layer Training. Store new exemplars in memory.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Bandwidth `h` (Mean-Shift): Controls cluster granularity. Small `h` → many fine-grained clusters; Large `h` → fewer, broader clusters.
  - Novelty Threshold (`Θ`): Balances plasticity vs. stability. Low threshold → easier to create new clusters (high plasticity); High threshold → force data into existing clusters (high stability).
  - Memory Buffer Size: More exemplars improve recall of past tasks but increase memory footprint.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Over-clustering: Sudden spike in cluster count (`L_k`), indicating `h` is too small or `Θ` is too low.
  - Catastrophic Forgetting: Steep drop in Backward/Forward Forgetting metrics, suggesting memory buffer is too small or replay is ineffective.
  - Feature Collapse: t-SNE plots of memory buffer show no distinct cluster separation, indicating failure in feature extractor or clustering parameters.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check: Implement `uVCL-KDE` (no RBF layer) on single task from UCF101. Tune mean-shift bandwidth `h` to recover number of clusters close to ground-truth number of classes.
  2. Novelty Threshold Calibration: On sequence of 3-5 tasks, vary novelty threshold `Θ` and plot impact on final number of clusters and Cluster Accuracy (CAcc).
  3. Memory Ablation: Run full continual learning sequence with different memory buffer sizes (e.g., 5, 20, 30 exemplars per cluster) and report ACAcc and Backward/Forward Forgetting to quantify role of replay.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can a dynamic novelty detection criterion be developed to replace fixed thresholds ($\Theta_1, \Theta_2$) for automatic cluster creation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "In future work, we will employ a dynamic novelty detector criterion for deciding when to learn new information and define new clusters."
- Why unresolved: Current method relies on estimating thresholds from first task or fixed values, which may not generalize optimally to varying data distributions in long sequences of tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Mechanism that adapts thresholds online based on streaming data statistics, demonstrating robust performance without requiring manual tuning for specific datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does freezing video transformer backbone ($g(\cdot)$) limit model's ability to adapt to novel spatio-temporal patterns in new tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Method ensures "consistent feature space" by using feature extractor that is "not retrained," assuming pre-trained representation is sufficient for all future tasks.
- Why unresolved: While freezing features ensures stability, it prevents plasticity of representation layer, potentially yielding suboptimal features for tasks significantly different from pre-training data (Kinetics-700).
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis evaluating trade-offs in cluster accuracy between current frozen-backbone approach and alternative where feature extractor is fine-tuned with regularization.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can clustering mechanism be enhanced to achieve meaningful separation for complex, fine-grained action datasets like Something-Something V2?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Visualization (Fig. 4) and low accuracy (8.07%) indicate that for complex SSv2 dataset, "clusters are not well separated."
- Why unresolved: Current non-parametric KDE approach struggles to distinguish subtle temporal motions, leading to poor class separation in latent space for high-complexity video data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified architecture or distance metric that significantly increases Cluster Accuracy (CAcc) on SSv2 while maintaining continual learning constraints.

## Limitations

- The method relies on frozen pre-trained features and cannot adapt the representation to new tasks
- Critical hyperparameters (bandwidth h, novelty thresholds) are set empirically without systematic sensitivity analysis
- Memory buffer size of 20 exemplars per cluster may be insufficient for large datasets with high intra-class variation
- Evaluation assumes number of discovered clusters roughly matches number of true classes, which is not guaranteed in unsupervised settings

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of using KDE and mean-shift for dynamic cluster discovery is well-established and implementation details are sufficiently specified for reproduction. The memory replay approach for mitigating catastrophic forgetting is a standard technique in continual learning.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that uVCL-KDE-RBF achieves 93.45% cluster accuracy on UCF101 is based on reported results, but exact preprocessing details (frame sampling, center-cropping) are not fully specified, which could affect reproducibility.
- **Low Confidence:** The paper does not provide comprehensive ablation studies on hyperparameter sensitivity (particularly for bandwidth h and novelty thresholds), making it difficult to assess robustness of the approach to these critical settings.

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary mean-shift bandwidth h and novelty threshold Θ2 across plausible ranges, plotting resulting cluster count and Cluster Accuracy on UCF101 to identify stable operating regions and failure modes.

2. **Memory Buffer Ablation:** Run full continual learning sequence on UCF101 with memory buffer sizes of 5, 20 (as reported), and 40 exemplars per cluster, measuring ACAcc and Forward/Backward Forgetting to quantify exact impact of replay capacity.

3. **Feature Quality Assessment:** Apply fixed VideoMAE V2 to extract features from held-out validation set, then perform K-means clustering with K=101 (ground truth classes) and compute adjusted Rand index to independently verify that feature space preserves semantic structure before any clustering is applied.
