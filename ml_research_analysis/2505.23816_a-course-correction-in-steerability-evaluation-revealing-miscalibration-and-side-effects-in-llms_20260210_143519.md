# A Course Correction in Steerability Evaluation: Revealing Miscalibration and Side Effects in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.23816
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23816
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Current LLMs exhibit severe side effects when steered toward multi-dimensional goals, with median orthogonality of 0.718 even in strong models like Llama3.3-70B

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel steerability evaluation framework that reveals fundamental limitations in how well current LLMs can follow diverse, multi-dimensional user goals. The authors construct a multi-dimensional goal-space using rule-based text attributes (reading difficulty, formality, textual diversity, length) and design a steerability probe with uniformly sampled goals to measure model behavior. Their empirical results demonstrate that steerability remains a significant challenge for LLM alignment, with models exhibiting severe side effects even when attempting to follow seemingly simple, anti-correlated requests.

The study finds that while reinforcement learning fine-tuning can improve steerability metrics and reduce goal entanglement, side effects persist as a fundamental limitation that cannot be resolved through inference-time techniques alone. The research suggests that achieving reliable steerability requires deeper changes to model behavior rather than surface-level prompt engineering or sampling strategies.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a steerability evaluation framework that measures LLM performance across multi-dimensional goal-spaces. They create a steerability probe with uniformly sampled goals from a goal-space defined by four rule-based text attributes: reading difficulty, formality, textual diversity, and length. The framework evaluates models using three key metrics: steering error (deviation from target goals), goal entanglement (correlation between goals in generated outputs), and side effects (undesired changes in non-targeted attributes). The evaluation includes base models like Llama3.3-70B and examines the effects of prompt engineering, best-of-N sampling, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning on Llama3.1-8B.

## Key Results
- Current LLMs exhibit severe side effects when steered toward multi-dimensional goals, with Llama3.3-70B showing median orthogonality of 0.718
- Prompt engineering shows minimal effect on improving steerability across models
- Best-of-N sampling can improve steerability but requires 128 generations per prompt, raising scalability concerns
- Reinforcement learning fine-tuning on Llama3.1-8B reduces steering error from 0.300 to 0.119 and decreases goal entanglement, though side effects persist

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The steerability evaluation framework works by creating a controlled environment where models must navigate multi-dimensional goal-spaces with specific, measurable attributes. The uniform sampling of goals ensures comprehensive coverage of the space, while the rule-based attribute definitions provide objective ground truth for evaluation. The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to isolate and measure three distinct failure modes: steering error (inability to reach target goals), goal entanglement (unintended correlations between attributes), and side effects (unwanted changes in non-targeted dimensions).

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-dimensional goal-space construction**: Creating a space of possible user goals using rule-based text attributes is essential for systematic steerability evaluation. Quick check: Verify that attribute rules produce distinct, measurable outputs across the full range of possible values.

**Steerability metrics**: Understanding steering error, goal entanglement, and side effects as separate but related measures is crucial for diagnosing model limitations. Quick check: Confirm that metric calculations align with intuitive expectations of model behavior.

**Orthogonality measurement**: Using cosine similarity to quantify side effects provides an objective measure of semantic drift. Quick check: Validate that orthogonality scores correlate with human judgments of output similarity.

**Sampling strategies**: Best-of-N sampling represents a brute-force approach to improving steerability at computational cost. Quick check: Determine the minimum N value that provides meaningful improvements without excessive resource consumption.

**RL fine-tuning impact**: Understanding how reinforcement learning affects multi-dimensional goal following requires tracking changes across all evaluation metrics. Quick check: Monitor whether improvements in one metric come at the expense of others.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Evaluation framework -> Multi-dimensional goal-space -> Steerability probe -> Model generation -> Metric computation -> Analysis pipeline

**Critical path**: Goal-space definition → Probe generation → Model inference → Metric calculation → Result aggregation

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes comprehensive coverage through uniform sampling versus computational efficiency, rule-based attributes versus natural language complexity, and automated metrics versus human evaluation.

**Failure signatures**: High steering error indicates inability to reach target goals, high goal entanglement suggests fundamental attribute coupling, and high orthogonality reveals severe side effects even when goals are partially met.

**First experiments**: 1) Test single-attribute steering to establish baseline performance, 2) Evaluate correlated vs anti-correlated goal pairs to identify entanglement patterns, 3) Compare base vs instruction-tuned models to assess pretraining impact.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation methodology relies on rule-based text attributes that may not capture the full complexity of real-world steering tasks
- Results are based on base models without instruction tuning, limiting generalizability to commonly used instruction-tuned models
- Side effect measurements using cosine similarity may not capture all forms of semantic drift or contextual appropriateness issues
- The framework's dependence on large numbers of generations for best-of-N sampling raises practical scalability concerns

## Confidence

High confidence: Current LLMs exhibit significant side effects when steered toward multi-dimensional goals
Medium confidence: Prompt engineering has limited effect on improving steerability
Medium confidence: RL fine-tuning improves steerability metrics but doesn't eliminate side effects
Low confidence: Generalizability of results to instruction-tuned models and broader goal spaces

## Next Checks

1. Test the steerability framework on instruction-tuned versions of the same models to assess whether fine-tuning affects side effect patterns
2. Expand the multi-dimensional goal-space to include additional attributes like emotional tone, specificity, and creativity to evaluate broader steerability challenges
3. Implement and evaluate alternative side effect measurement methods beyond cosine similarity, such as semantic drift detection or human evaluation protocols
