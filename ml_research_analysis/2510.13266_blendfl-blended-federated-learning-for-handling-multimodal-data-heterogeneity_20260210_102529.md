## Executive Summary
This paper presents BlendFL, a federated learning framework that seamlessly integrates horizontal and vertical federated learning to address multimodal data heterogeneity in collaborative learning scenarios. BlendFL enables clients with varying data fragmentation—paired, fragmented, or partial—to participate without restrictions, overcoming limitations of traditional FL frameworks. The framework introduces BlendAvg, a weighted model aggregation strategy that prioritizes updates based on local model performance rather than data volume, and supports decentralized inference for reduced latency and server dependency.

Evaluated on large-scale real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR) and a multimodal benchmark (S-MNIST), BlendFL consistently outperformed seven state-of-the-art baselines across three classification tasks. The framework demonstrates superior performance in both multimodal and unimodal settings, with ablation studies showing faster convergence compared to traditional approaches. This positions BlendFL as a promising solution for privacy-preserving collaborative learning in domains like healthcare and finance.

## Method Summary
BlendFL introduces a novel approach to federated learning by integrating horizontal and vertical federated learning mechanisms to handle multimodal data heterogeneity. The framework features BlendAvg, a weighted model aggregation strategy that calculates performance scores on a private validation dataset to prioritize client updates based on model performance rather than data volume. This allows clients with partial or fragmented data to participate effectively in the learning process. The framework supports decentralized inference to reduce latency and server dependency, and was evaluated on clinical datasets (MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR) and a multimodal benchmark (S-MNIST), consistently outperforming seven state-of-the-art baselines.

## Key Results
- Outperformed seven state-of-the-art baselines across three classification tasks on MIMIC and S-MNIST datasets
- Achieved superior performance in both multimodal and unimodal settings
- Demonstrated faster convergence through ablation studies compared to traditional FL approaches
- Successfully handled clients with varying data fragmentation patterns (paired, fragmented, or partial)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BlendFL works by integrating horizontal and vertical federated learning approaches, allowing clients with different types of data fragmentation to participate in collaborative learning. The key innovation is BlendAvg, which uses performance-based weighting rather than data volume for aggregation. This enables clients with limited or partial data to contribute meaningfully. The framework's ability to handle multimodal data heterogeneity without requiring all clients to have complete datasets addresses a fundamental limitation in traditional FL approaches. The decentralized inference capability further enhances practical deployment by reducing server dependency and latency.

## Foundational Learning
- **Horizontal vs Vertical Federated Learning**: Why needed - Different data partitioning scenarios require different approaches; quick check - Identify whether data is split by samples or features
- **Data Heterogeneity in FL**: Why needed - Real-world data is rarely uniform across clients; quick check - Assess distribution differences across client datasets
- **Model Aggregation Strategies**: Why needed - Critical for combining updates from multiple clients; quick check - Evaluate how different weighting schemes affect convergence
- **Privacy-Preserving Computation**: Why needed - Core requirement for FL in sensitive domains; quick check - Verify no raw data exchange occurs during training
- **Performance-based Weighting**: Why needed - Enables fair contribution from clients with varying data volumes; quick check - Measure how validation performance correlates with update impact

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Clients (with heterogeneous data) -> BlendFL Framework (BlendAvg aggregation) -> Server (validation and aggregation) -> Global Model

**Critical Path**: Client model training → Performance evaluation on validation set → BlendAvg weighted aggregation → Global model update → Decentralized inference deployment

**Design Tradeoffs**: BlendAvg prioritizes performance over data volume, which may exclude high-data-volume but low-performance clients; decentralized inference reduces server load but increases complexity in synchronization

**Failure Signatures**: Poor convergence if validation set is non-representative; degraded performance if clients have highly skewed data distributions; communication bottlenecks in large-scale deployments

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate BlendFL against FedAvg on homogeneous data distribution
2. Fragmentation impact: Test performance degradation as data fragmentation increases
3. Validation sensitivity: Measure BlendFL performance when server validation set distribution changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the integration of formal privacy mechanisms, such as differential privacy, impact the convergence rate and predictive performance of BlendFL?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly state in the Discussion: "Despite BlendFL's superior performance over all FL baselines, it is not immune to privacy threats. Future work should focus on integrating additional privacy measures into BlendFL, such as differential privacy..."
- Why unresolved: The current framework focuses on data privacy through federation but does not implement or evaluate defenses against inference attacks on the shared model updates or features.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of BlendFL's accuracy and communication efficiency when differential privacy noise is added to the gradients or model updates during the training process.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the BlendFL framework generalize to scenarios involving more than two data modalities?
- Basis in paper: In the Methodology section, the authors define the problem setting: "For simplicity, we assume that each patient $u_i$ has either one or two data modalities... i.e., $x^A_i$ and/or $x^B_i$."
- Why unresolved: The framework was validated only on bimodal tasks (EHR+CXR and Audio+Image). It is unclear if the BlendAvg aggregation strategy or the vertical synchronization mechanism scales effectively or becomes unstable when feature spaces are fragmented across three or more modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results from a multimodal benchmark with >2 modalities (e.g., video + audio + text), analyzing performance and convergence behavior compared to the bimodal case.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the BlendAvg aggregation strategy if the server-side validation dataset is non-representative or biased?
- Basis in paper: The Methodology section describing BlendAvg states that $A_i$ (performance score) "is calculated at the aggregation server using a private representative validation dataset that is randomly sampled from the collaborating clients."
- Why unresolved: BlendAvg relies on validation performance to weigh client updates. If the validation set does not accurately reflect the global distribution, the aggregation might incorrectly down-weight crucial updates, leading to model degradation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies measuring BlendFL performance when the server's validation set has a skewed distribution compared to the true global data distribution.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability beyond healthcare and synthetic datasets, with evaluation focused primarily on MIMIC and S-MNIST
- Scalability and communication overhead not quantified, particularly for large-scale deployments with heterogeneous data fragmentation
- Lack of robustness analysis under realistic conditions of client availability fluctuations, device churn, or varying computational capabilities

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Architectural novelty of integrating horizontal and vertical FL approaches, and theoretical justification for BlendAvg's performance-based weighting strategy
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about convergence speed improvements relative to traditional approaches, based on ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance claims on MIMIC and S-MNIST datasets, though generalizability remains uncertain
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about reduced latency and server dependency in decentralized inference without quantitative evidence

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Performance Validation**: Evaluate BlendFL on at least two non-healthcare datasets (e.g., financial transactions, IoT sensor data) with different characteristics to assess generalizability beyond the current evaluation scope.

2. **Communication Cost Analysis**: Conduct a detailed analysis measuring the communication overhead during both training and inference phases, comparing BlendFL against traditional FL approaches across varying numbers of clients and data fragmentation patterns.

3. **Robustness Under Client Churn**: Design experiments simulating realistic federated learning conditions with intermittent client availability, device heterogeneity, and varying participation rates to assess BlendFL's stability and performance under these conditions.
