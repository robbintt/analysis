core_contribution: This study investigates conservative bias in large language models
  (LLMs) during relation extraction tasks, where models default to "NoRelation" labels
  when no perfect option exists, potentially losing valuable information. Using REFinD
  and TACRED datasets, the authors evaluate GPT-4, Llama3.1, and Mistral models across
  constrained, semi-constrained, and open-ended prompts.

# Conservative Bias in Large Language Models: Measuring Relation Predictions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.08120
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08120
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Primary result**: Conservative bias in LLMs occurs twice as often as hallucination during relation extraction, with models defaulting to "No_Relation" labels when no perfect option exists.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates conservative bias in large language models during relation extraction tasks, where models default to "No_Relation" labels when no perfect option exists, potentially losing valuable information. Using REFinD and TACRED datasets, the authors evaluate GPT-4, Llama3.1, and Mistral models across constrained, semi-constrained, and open-ended prompts. Results show conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination, with GPT-4 exhibiting 1-1.33% conservative bias rate versus 0.02-0.04% hallucination rate in constrained prompts. Semantic similarity analysis confirms conservative bias labels align with outputs from less constrained prompts in 57-62% of cases, validating their use to improve relation extraction.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluated three large language models (GPT-4, Llama3.1, and Mistral) using REFinD and TACRED datasets across three prompt types: constrained (specific relations), semi-constrained (relation types with example values), and open-ended (unstructured). They measured conservative bias by counting "No_Relation" responses and hallucination by identifying invalid relations. A semantic similarity analysis compared conservative bias labels with outputs from less constrained prompts to validate their use in relation extraction tasks.

## Key Results
- Conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination in relation extraction tasks
- GPT-4 shows 1-1.33% conservative bias rate versus 0.02-0.04% hallucination rate in constrained prompts
- Conservative bias labels align with less constrained outputs in 57-62% of cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None provided

## Foundational Learning
- **Relation extraction**: Task of identifying relationships between entities in text; needed to understand the domain where conservative bias manifests
- **Conservative bias**: Tendency to default to "No_Relation" when uncertain; quick check: occurs when models lack perfect relation match
- **Hallucination**: Generation of factually incorrect or fabricated information; quick check: invalid relations outside predefined categories
- **Semantic similarity analysis**: Method to compare meaning between text outputs; quick check: cosine similarity scores between embeddings
- **Prompt engineering**: Crafting inputs to elicit desired model responses; quick check: varying constraint levels affects bias rates

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLMs (GPT-4, Llama3.1, Mistral) -> Relation Extraction -> Conservative Bias Detection -> Semantic Similarity Analysis -> Validation

**Critical Path**: Input Text → Relation Extraction → Bias/Hallucination Detection → Similarity Analysis → Interpretation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study balances between preventing hallucinations (accuracy) and capturing all valid relations (completeness). Constrained prompts reduce hallucination but increase conservative bias, while open-ended prompts do the opposite.

**Failure Signatures**: Conservative bias manifests as excessive "No_Relation" responses when valid but imperfect relations exist. Hallucination appears as relations outside predefined categories. The failure mode depends on prompt constraint level.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test conservative bias across different temperature settings to see if higher temperatures reduce bias
2. Evaluate whether few-shot prompting reduces conservative bias rates
3. Compare conservative bias across different relation extraction datasets beyond REFinD and TACRED

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to relation extraction tasks, may not generalize to other NLP domains
- Conservative bias measurement relies on predefined relation categories, potentially missing nuanced cases
- Results depend on specific model versions and prompt formats, may vary with updates

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Conservative bias occurs more frequently than hallucination (1-1.33% vs 0.02-0.04% rates in constrained prompts)

**Medium confidence**: Semantic similarity analysis showing 57-62% alignment between conservative bias labels and less constrained outputs

**Medium confidence**: Generalizability of trade-off between hallucination resistance and information loss to other NLP tasks

## Next Checks

1. Test conservative bias across diverse NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, question answering) to assess generalizability

2. Evaluate whether conservative bias patterns persist across different versions of the same models and emerging LLMs

3. Systematically vary prompt structures, temperature settings, and instruction formulations to determine if conservative bias can be mitigated through prompt design
