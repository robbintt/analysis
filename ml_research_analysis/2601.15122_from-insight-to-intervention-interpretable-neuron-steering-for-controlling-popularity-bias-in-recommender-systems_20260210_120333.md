# From Insight to Intervention: Interpretable Neuron Steering for Controlling Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.15122
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15122
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: PopSteer introduces interpretable neuron steering that significantly improves item coverage and reduces Gini Index for fairness while maintaining high nDCG accuracy on three public datasets.

## Executive Summary
PopSteer addresses popularity bias in recommender systems through an interpretable neuron steering approach that combines Sparse Autoencoders with synthetic contrastive attribution. The method identifies neurons encoding popularity signals through their activation patterns on extreme synthetic user profiles, then adjusts these neurons to reduce bias while maintaining recommendation quality. Experiments on ML-1M, BeerAdvocate, and Yelp datasets with SASRec demonstrate superior debiasing performance compared to existing methods, with the added benefit of transparency in identifying which neurons drive popularity bias. The approach achieves training time under one hour and fast inference suitable for production deployment.

## Method Summary
PopSteer uses a Sparse Autoencoder trained on user embeddings from a frozen SASRec model to identify neurons encoding popularity bias. The SAE employs a Top-K activation function to force neurons to specialize in interpretable features. Synthetic user profiles interacting exclusively with either highly popular or unpopular items are used to measure neuron activation differences via Cohen's d effect size. Neurons with high absolute Cohen's d values are identified as popularity-related and their activations are scaled by their standard deviation during inference to reduce bias. The method maintains recommendation accuracy while significantly improving fairness metrics like item coverage and Gini Index.

## Key Results
- PopSteer achieves 1.9x higher item coverage and 25% lower Gini Index compared to baseline SASRec
- The method maintains high nDCG accuracy (within 2% of baseline) while debiasing
- PopSteer outperforms state-of-the-art methods like EAFL and PostTrainDebias on all three benchmark datasets
- The interpretable steering mechanism identifies specific neurons responsible for popularity bias, providing transparency absent in black-box alternatives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Monosemantic Feature Isolation via Sparsity
Imposing strict sparsity constraints on the autoencoder's hidden layer forces individual neurons to specialize in distinct, interpretable features (e.g., popularity) rather than distributing the concept across many neurons. The SAE uses a Top-K activation function that retains only the K highest activations and sets others to zero, forcing the model to represent the input embedding using a limited "budget" of neurons. This encourages polysemantic neurons to decompose into monosemantic units. The core assumption is that the popularity signal present in the base model's embeddings is linearly decodable and can be isolated by this bottleneck. Break condition: If the base model's embedding space is too entangled or if K is set too high, neurons may remain polysemantic, failing to isolate the popularity concept.

### Mechanism 2: Synthetic Contrastive Attribution
Extreme synthetic user profiles create a differential signal that allows precise identification of neurons encoding popularity bias without needing labeled real-world data. By generating synthetic users who interact only with the top 10% popular items (R_Pop) and others who interact only with the bottom 10% (R_Unpop), the system measures the activation difference for every neuron. Cohen's d effect size quantifies this alignment. The core assumption is that neurons that activate differently for these extreme synthetic profiles also drive popularity bias in real user profiles. Break condition: If the synthetic profiles fall outside the distribution learned by the base model (out-of-distribution), the SAE's activations may be nonsensical, leading to incorrect neuron attribution.

### Mechanism 3: Variance-Scaled Activation Steering
Adjusting neuron activations by a factor proportional to their standard deviation (σ) allows for effective bias reduction while maintaining the structural integrity of the user embedding. Rather than clamping or zeroing activations (which can distort representations), PopSteer subtracts or adds w_j · σ_j to the neuron's activation, where w_j is determined by the neuron's association strength (Cohen's d) with popularity. The core assumption is that the "direction" of popularity in the latent space corresponds to the activation vector of the identified neurons, and moving along this vector changes item exposure without destroying relevance. Break condition: If the steering weights (α_Pop, α_Unpop) are set too high, the embedding may shift into an incoherent region of the latent space, causing a sharp drop in nDCG.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sparse Autoencoders (SAE)**
  - Why needed here: The entire intervention relies on the SAE's ability to "translate" the black-box embeddings of the recommender into human-interpretable features. Without understanding sparsity (Top-K) and reconstruction loss, the steering logic is opaque.
  - Quick check question: How does the Top-K activation function differ from standard ReLU, and why does it promote monosemanticity?

- **Concept: Cohen's d (Effect Size)**
  - Why needed here: This is the metric used to quantify how much a specific neuron contributes to the popularity bias. Understanding the difference between statistical significance and effect size is crucial for tuning the threshold β.
  - Quick check question: Why might a neuron have a high Cohen's d value but a low absolute activation magnitude?

- **Concept: Sequential Recommendation (SASRec)**
  - Why needed here: PopSteer is tested on SASRec. Understanding that the input is a sequence of items and the output is a user embedding is necessary to grasp how synthetic sequences are constructed and processed.
  - Quick check question: In a self-attentive recommender, where is the "user embedding" typically extracted for the SAE to process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Base Model (Frozen SASRec) -> User Embeddings -> SAE Encoder -> Hidden Layer (Top-K Sparsity) -> SAE Decoder -> Reconstructed Embeddings
  Synthetic Generator -> Synthetic Profiles -> Base Model -> Activation Recording -> Cohen's d Calculation -> Neuron Identification
  Real User Request -> Base Model -> SAE Encoder -> Steering Module -> SAE Decoder -> Item Scoring

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Training:** Train SAE to reconstruct SASRec user embeddings (minimize ||x - x̂||²)
  2. **Analysis:** Pass synthetic profiles through pipeline → Record activations → Compute Cohen's d for all neurons → Identify biased neurons
  3. **Inference:** Real user request → Get embedding → Pass through SAE → Apply Steering (Eq. 4) → Decode to steered embedding → Score items

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Scale Factor (s):** Larger hidden dimension (N = s × d) increases granularity of features but increases training time and risk of dead neurons
  - **Sparsity (K):** Lower K improves interpretability (monosemanticity) but risks dropping necessary signal for reconstruction
  - **Threshold (β):** Higher β steers fewer neurons (safer for accuracy); lower β steers more neurons (aggressive debiasing)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Dead Neurons:** High percentage of neurons never activating (Check: Auxiliary loss L_aux effectiveness)
  - **Reconstruction Collapse:** Cosine similarity between x and x̂ drops significantly (Check: SAE learning rate or capacity)
  - **Accuracy Crash:** nDCG drops > 10% immediately (Check: Steering weights α are too aggressive)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reconstruction Sanity Check:** Train SAE and plot cosine similarity between original and reconstructed embeddings. Verify it exceeds 0.98 (per Table 3)
  2. **Neuron Validation:** Visualize the "Head share" (H) for the top-10 activating real users of the most positive/negative Cohen's d neurons. Confirm they align with expected user behavior (Figure 3)
  3. **Sensitivity Sweep:** Run inference varying α_Pop and α_Unpop independently to plot the fairness-accuracy Pareto frontier (Figure 6)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can more sophisticated synthetic user generation methods (e.g., GANs, probabilistic sampling from item popularity gradients) improve the identification of popularity-encoding neurons compared to the current extreme threshold-based approach? The authors state in Section 7 that "it could be refined using more sophisticated generation strategies" and suggest exploring "smarter" generation methods. The current synthetic profiles use only the top/bottom 10% of items, which intentionally creates extreme but potentially unrealistic user profiles that may miss nuanced popularity signals. Experiments comparing neuron identification quality and downstream debiasing performance using GAN-generated or gradient-sampled synthetic profiles versus the current threshold-based approach would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Can the PopSteer framework effectively mitigate other types of bias in recommender systems, such as gender bias or position bias, using similar synthetic profile identification and neuron steering techniques? The authors state in Section 7 that "applying this framework for addressing other biases can be an interesting future research" and suggest gender bias as an example. The approach may not transfer directly since different biases may be encoded in different neural patterns or layers. Application of PopSteer to other bias types with appropriately constructed synthetic profiles, measuring bias reduction using domain-specific fairness metrics, would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How does PopSteer perform across a broader range of recommendation architectures beyond SASRec, particularly for non-sequential models where synthetic profile construction is less straightforward? The paper primarily validates on SASRec, briefly mentioning LightGCN experiments relegated to the GitHub repository. The sequential backbone was chosen because "a synthetic profile is specified directly by an item sequence," suggesting challenges for other architectures. Different model architectures (graph neural networks, collaborative filtering, transformers) may encode popularity signals differently, affecting neuron identification and steering effectiveness. Systematic evaluation across diverse recommendation architectures with adapted synthetic profile generation strategies for each architecture type would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The method's effectiveness depends on popularity bias being a monosemantic feature that can be isolated by SAE sparsity, which may not hold if popularity is distributed across multiple entangled concepts
- The synthetic profile approach assumes that extreme popularity contrasts capture the same signal as real-world popularity bias, which may not hold if real user behavior is more nuanced
- The variance-scaled steering mechanism assumes linear separability of the popularity direction in latent space, but popularity bias may involve non-linear interactions that simple activation adjustment cannot address

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The SAE can reconstruct user embeddings with >0.98 cosine similarity; the steering mechanism works in controlled synthetic settings
- **Medium Confidence:** PopSteer improves fairness metrics (Item Coverage, Gini Index) while maintaining nDCG on benchmark datasets
- **Low Confidence:** The approach generalizes to industrial-scale recommenders with billions of parameters and users; the steering doesn't introduce new biases in production settings

## Next Checks

1. **Out-of-Distribution Test:** Generate synthetic profiles that mix popularity levels (not pure top/bottom 10%) and measure whether identified neurons still correlate with popularity bias

2. **Dynamic Bias Evolution:** Implement a temporal split where popularity distribution shifts between training and testing phases to verify PopSteer adapts to changing popularity patterns

3. **Cross-Domain Transfer:** Apply PopSteer-trained neurons from one domain (e.g., movies) to another (e.g., music) to test whether popularity bias neurons are domain-specific or transferable concepts
