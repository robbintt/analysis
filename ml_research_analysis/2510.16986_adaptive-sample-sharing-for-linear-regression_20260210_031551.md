core_contribution: This paper proposes a data-driven method for selective sample sharing
  in ridge regression, where auxiliary samples are added to a target training set
  only when they provably reduce prediction error. The method uses a conservative
  estimator of the transfer gain based on bias-variance decomposition and derives
  finite-sample guarantees to prevent negative transfer.

# Adaptive Sample Sharing for Linear Regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16986
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16986
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Conservative estimator of transfer gain using bias-variance decomposition with finite-sample guarantees

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a data-driven approach for selective sample sharing in ridge regression, where auxiliary samples are added to a target training set only when they provably reduce prediction error. The method uses a conservative estimator of the transfer gain based on bias-variance decomposition and derives finite-sample guarantees to prevent negative transfer. Under an isotropic Gaussian design, the authors show that transfer is beneficial when target noise is high, source and target tasks are well-aligned, and source noise is low.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a target-focused approach that requires only a small validation set and avoids joint source-target coupling. It uses a conservative estimator of the transfer gain based on bias-variance decomposition to determine when to share samples between source and target datasets. The method provides finite-sample guarantees to prevent negative transfer, making it a principled way to safely leverage auxiliary data in ridge regression settings.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates consistent gains over strong baselines (Chen et al., 2014; Obst et al., 2021) while avoiding degradation
- Shows transfer is beneficial when target noise is high, source and target tasks are well-aligned, and source noise is low
- Experiments on synthetic and real datasets (Email and Boston) validate theoretical findings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by carefully estimating the potential gain from transferring samples between source and target datasets. It uses a conservative estimator based on bias-variance decomposition to determine whether adding auxiliary samples will actually improve prediction error. By deriving finite-sample guarantees, the approach ensures that transfer only occurs when it can be proven beneficial, thus avoiding the common pitfall of negative transfer.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Target validation set -> Conservative transfer gain estimator -> Sample sharing decision -> Ridge regression model

Critical Path:
1. Receive target and source datasets
2. Select small validation set from target
3. Compute conservative transfer gain estimate
4. Decide whether to share samples
5. Perform ridge regression with or without shared samples

Design Tradeoffs:
- Conservative estimation vs. potential gains: The method prioritizes avoiding negative transfer over maximizing potential improvements
- Target-focused approach vs. joint optimization: Simplifies adaptation but may miss opportunities for beneficial source-target coupling
- Known noise assumptions vs. practical estimation: Theoretical guarantees assume known or estimable noise levels

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance when target validation set is small or unrepresentative
- Reduced effectiveness under non-isotropic feature designs
- Potential missed opportunities for beneficial transfer when source-target coupling is advantageous

First Experiments:
1. Verify the conservative estimator correctly identifies when transfer is beneficial on synthetic data with known properties
2. Test the method's performance with varying levels of target noise, source-target alignment, and source noise
3. Evaluate robustness when the target validation set size is systematically reduced

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges several open questions regarding the method's performance under non-isotropic designs and when the target validation set is small or unrepresentative. It also notes that practical estimation error in noise levels could weaken the theoretical protection against negative transfer.

## Limitations
- Performance under non-isotropic designs remains uncertain
- Small or unrepresentative target validation sets may compromise effectiveness
- Practical noise estimation error could weaken theoretical guarantees

## Confidence
- Theoretical guarantees and bias-variance analysis: High
- Empirical gains over baselines: Medium (limited to specific datasets)
- Generalization to non-isotropic or high-dimensional settings: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate robustness when target validation set is small (<50 samples) or contains outliers
2. Test performance under correlated (non-isotropic) feature designs and varying source-target misalignment
3. Compare against joint source-target optimization methods on synthetic data where coupling is beneficial
