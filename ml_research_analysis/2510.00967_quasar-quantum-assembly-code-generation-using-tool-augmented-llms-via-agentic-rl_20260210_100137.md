# QUASAR: Quantum Assembly Code Generation Using Tool-Augmented LLMs via Agentic RL

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00967
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00967
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 99.31% validity in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10 for quantum assembly code generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces QUASAR, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that leverages tool-augmented large language models to generate syntactically correct and semantically meaningful quantum assembly code. The approach addresses the significant challenge of generating valid quantum circuits given the complexity of parameterized gates and the limited quantum domain knowledge in LLMs. QUASAR employs an external quantum verification tool combined with a hierarchical reward mechanism to enforce syntactic correctness, distributional alignment, expectation value accuracy, and optimization efficiency.

Evaluated on a 4B parameter model, QUASAR demonstrates substantial performance improvements over leading industrial LLMs and various baselines. The framework achieves 99.31% validity in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10, successfully generating practical ansatz patterns and parameter initializations for quantum optimization algorithms. The results demonstrate that with appropriate tool augmentation and reinforcement learning, LLMs can become capable generators of quantum assembly code suitable for practical quantum computing applications.

## Method Summary
QUASAR employs an agentic reinforcement learning framework that integrates an external quantum verification tool with large language models to generate quantum assembly code. The system uses a hierarchical reward mechanism that evaluates generated circuits across multiple dimensions: syntactic correctness, distributional alignment with expected quantum circuit patterns, expectation value accuracy for parameterized gates, and optimization efficiency metrics. The tool-augmented approach provides structured feedback to the LLM, enabling it to learn quantum domain-specific knowledge through reinforcement learning rather than relying solely on pre-training data. The framework operates through iterative generation and verification cycles, where the quantum verification tool assesses circuit validity and provides rewards that guide the model toward generating increasingly accurate and efficient quantum assembly code.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.31% validity in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10 for syntactically correct quantum assembly code
- Outperforms leading industrial LLMs and various baselines in both syntax and semantic performance
- Successfully generates practical ansatz patterns and parameter initializations for quantum optimization algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
QUASAR's effectiveness stems from its hierarchical reward mechanism that provides structured, multi-dimensional feedback during the reinforcement learning process. The external quantum verification tool acts as an oracle that evaluates both syntactic correctness and semantic validity of generated circuits, enabling the LLM to learn quantum-specific patterns through direct feedback rather than relying solely on limited pre-training data. The agentic reinforcement learning approach allows the model to iteratively refine its generation strategy based on reward signals that capture the complex requirements of quantum assembly code, including proper gate parameterization, circuit connectivity, and optimization objectives. This tool-augmented approach bridges the knowledge gap between general-purpose LLMs and the specialized requirements of quantum circuit generation.

## Foundational Learning
- Quantum assembly language syntax - why needed: Essential for generating valid quantum circuits that can be executed on quantum hardware; quick check: Verify generated code compiles without syntax errors
- Parameterized gate operations - why needed: Critical for quantum optimization algorithms requiring tunable parameters; quick check: Confirm parameter ranges and constraints are respected
- Ansatz pattern recognition - why needed: Enables generation of standard quantum circuit templates for optimization; quick check: Match generated patterns against known effective ansatz structures
- Expectation value computation - why needed: Validates semantic correctness of quantum circuits for optimization tasks; quick check: Verify computed expectation values align with theoretical predictions
- Circuit optimization metrics - why needed: Ensures generated circuits are both correct and efficient; quick check: Compare gate counts and depth against baseline implementations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Quantum LLM -> Circuit Generator -> Quantum Verification Tool -> Reward Calculator -> Parameter Updater -> Quantum LLM

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows from the LLM through the circuit generator to the quantum verification tool, where validity assessment occurs, followed by reward calculation and parameter updates that feed back into the LLM for subsequent generations. This loop enables progressive improvement in circuit quality.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades computational overhead from iterative verification cycles against the benefit of structured feedback for the LLM. Using a hierarchical reward mechanism balances multiple optimization objectives but increases complexity compared to single-metric approaches. The reliance on an external verification tool introduces dependency on tool accuracy and availability.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Syntax generation failures indicate LLM lacks sufficient quantum assembly language patterns
- Semantic validation failures suggest reward signal misalignment or insufficient training data coverage
- Performance degradation on parameterized gates reveals gaps in handling quantum-specific gate operations
- Convergence issues in reinforcement learning point to reward function design problems or insufficient exploration

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Validate syntax generation on a basic quantum circuit suite to establish baseline correctness rates
2. Test parameterized gate generation on standard optimization problems to assess semantic performance
3. Evaluate scalability by running QUASAR on circuits of increasing depth and complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation conducted on a single 4B parameter model, limiting generalizability to larger architectures
- Quantum verification tool may not capture all semantic nuances of complex parameterized gate behavior
- Hierarchical reward metrics are benchmark-specific and may not translate to real-world quantum hardware constraints

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Syntax generation validity rates (99.31% Pass@1, 100% Pass@10) | High |
| Semantic performance improvements over baselines | Medium |
| Claims about generating "practical ansatz patterns and parameter initializations" | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate QUASAR on larger LLM architectures (8B-70B parameters) to assess scalability and performance trends
2. Test generated circuits on actual quantum hardware or high-fidelity simulators to validate semantic correctness and noise resilience
3. Benchmark QUASAR against domain-specific quantum circuit generators on problems requiring dynamic gate parameterization and adaptive circuit depth
