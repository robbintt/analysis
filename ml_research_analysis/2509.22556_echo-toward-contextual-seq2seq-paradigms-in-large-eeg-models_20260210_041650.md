# ECHO: Toward Contextual Seq2Seq Paradigms in Large EEG Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.22556
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22556
- **Authors:** Chenyu Liu; Yuqiu Deng; Tianyu Liu; Jinan Zhou; Xinliang Zhou; Ziyu Jia; Yi Ding
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line result:** ECHO achieves average improvements of +0.0602 BA, +0.0566 ROC-AUC, +0.0316 PR-AUC over state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task settings.

## Executive Summary
ECHO introduces a decoder-centric sequence-to-sequence paradigm for large EEG models, replacing traditional encoder-classifier pipelines with unified sequence space modeling. By jointly modeling signals, labels, and tasks through next-token prediction, it captures layered relationships while incorporating discrete support samples for in-context learning. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate consistent superiority over state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task settings, with strong zero-shot and cross-dataset generalization capabilities.

## Method Summary
ECHO reformulates EEG multi-task learning as sequence-to-sequence prediction, where raw EEG signals are tokenized and combined with support samples and task/label tokens into unified sequences. The model employs a DeepConvNet encoder and 6-layer Transformer decoder with hybrid positional encoding (token-level, sample-level, textual) to distinguish heterogeneous sequence components. Training proceeds in two phases: encoder warm-up with classifier, then contextual training with progressively diverse support samples (0-12) for in-context learning. The unified sequence space enables dynamic adaptation to heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates.

## Key Results
- ECHO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task settings, achieving average improvements of +0.0602 balanced accuracy, +0.0566 ROC AUC, and +0.0316 PR AUC.
- Strong zero-shot and cross-dataset generalization demonstrated, with significant performance gains over encoder-only baselines when no support samples are provided.
- Ablation studies confirm hybrid positional encoding is critical, with performance dropping to chance level when sample-level or textual positional encodings are removed.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Decoder-centric seq2seq formulation enables multi-task generalization by capturing layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within a unified sequence space.
- **Mechanism:** The model structures input as sequences containing target EEG samples, support EEG instances, and associated task/label tokens. Through next-token prediction, it learns to infer task tokens (e.g., `<|MI|>`, `<|EMO|>`) and then derive label tokens conditioned on both task and EEG representations.
- **Core assumption:** EEG signals, when properly serialized with task and label context, can be treated as a coherent symbolic sequence amenable to autoregressive modeling.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "ECHO captures layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space, while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues." [section 3.2] "Through this unified sequence, ECHO acquires both in-context and multi-task learning capabilities."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** In-context learning emerges from explicit multi-stage training with progressively diverse support samples, enabling zero-shot adaptation without parameter updates.
- **Mechanism:** Training proceeds in phases: (1) encoder warm-up with classifier; (2) contextual training with fixed then randomized support sample counts (0-12). This exposes the model to varied contexts, teaching it to infer task-label mappings from support examples at inference time.
- **Core assumption:** The decoder can generalize mapping patterns from support examples to unseen target samples through pattern-matching learned during training.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "This design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates." [section 3.3] "ECHO is trained with autoregressive next-token prediction under a multi-stage strategy... the decoder is trained with progressively larger and more diverse support sets."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Hybrid positional encoding is necessary to distinguish heterogeneous sequence components (EEG tokens, support samples, discrete symbols).
- **Mechanism:** Three-part encoding: (1) token-level PE for temporal structure within each EEG sample; (2) sample-level PE shared across tokens of the same EEG instance; (3) textual PE for task/label tokens. Ablation shows removing sample-level PE causes chance-level performance; removing textual PE causes structural collapse.
- **Core assumption:** The model needs explicit positional cues to prevent treating multiple EEG samples as continuous signals and to preserve symbolic coherence.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.2] "To prevent confusion among heterogeneous components, ECHO employs a three-part positional encoding strategy." [section 4.3] "Removing either encoding makes the model ineffective... performance to drop to chance level... complete structural collapse."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Learning**
  - **Why needed here:** ECHO reformulates all EEG tasks as seq2seq problems rather than classification; understanding encoder-decoder attention, autoregressive generation, and teacher forcing is prerequisite.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how cross-attention enables the decoder to condition on encoder outputs during generation?

- **Concept: In-Context Learning (ICL)**
  - **Why needed here:** ECHO's primary capability claim is ICL via support samples; requires understanding how models learn to use context examples without gradient updates.
  - **Quick check question:** How does providing labeled examples in the input sequence differ from fine-tuning on those examples?

- **Concept: Positional Encoding in Transformers**
  - **Why needed here:** ECHO's hybrid positional encoding is ablation-critical; must understand how positional signals enable sequence ordering and sample separation.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to a transformer's ability to distinguish token positions if positional encodings are removed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw EEG → Channel alignment → Sliding window segmentation → ConvNet + token-level PE → Tokenization → Concat with support tokens + sample-level PE → Decoder with cross-attention → Next-token prediction (task → label → EOT).

- **Critical path:** Raw EEG → Channel alignment → Sliding window segmentation → ConvNet + token-level PE → Tokenization → Concat with support tokens + sample-level PE → Decoder with cross-attention → Next-token prediction (task → label → EOT).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Using basic components (Deep ConvNet encoder, standard Transformer decoder) isolates paradigm contribution from architectural novelty but may underperform specialized encoders.
  - Randomizing support samples (0-12) improves ICL robustness but increases training variance.
  - 75-channel standardization improves cross-dataset compatibility but may lose dataset-specific spatial resolution.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Chance-level accuracy → Sample-level positional encoding missing or corrupted.
  - Disordered/jibberish output → Textual positional encoding missing.
  - Task confusion on overlapping label spaces → Insufficient support samples or paradigm ambiguity (SEED-IV vs SEED-V).
  - Slow convergence or poor representations → Encoder not properly warmed up before contextual training.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce ablation on positional encodings** to validate hybrid encoding necessity; confirm chance-level and collapse behaviors on a held-out dataset (e.g., SEED).
  2. **Sweep support sample counts (0, 4, 8, 12)** on a multi-task evaluation to measure ICL scaling; plot accuracy vs. support count.
  3. **Test zero-shot transfer to held-out dataset (BCIC 2020-T1)** to verify generalization claims; compare ECHO (no support) vs. ECHO (8 support) vs. encoder-only baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the performance of the ECHO paradigm be significantly enhanced by substituting the simplified DeepConvNet encoder with state-of-the-art encoder architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.1 states that the architecture utilizes "simple and established architectural components" specifically to avoid conflating the paradigm shift with architectural improvements, suggesting the current encoder is a baseline rather than an optimized solution.
- Why unresolved: The authors intentionally restricted the encoder to basic components to isolate the benefits of the decoder-centric seq2seq approach, leaving the interaction with more complex feature extractors untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study replacing the DeepConvNet with advanced encoders (e.g., CBraMod or LaBraM backbones) while maintaining the ECHO decoder framework to measure performance deltas.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the computational intractability of modeling long-range temporal dependencies in the seq2seq framework be resolved without truncating context?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix D.1 ("Long Sequence ECHO") details that while baselines use 10-minute contexts, ECHO could not utilize this due to "nearly 1-hour equivalent sequences" causing computational infeasibility, forcing a stricter 30-second evaluation setting.
- Why unresolved: The current seq2seq and ICL structure creates an overhead that scales poorly with time, creating a performance gap in long-sequence tasks like sleep staging where temporal history is critical.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of a sparse attention mechanism or hierarchical tokenization strategy that allows ECHO to process 10-minute EEG sequences (approx. 20 segments plus support tokens) with linear rather than quadratic complexity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the sequence formulation be refined to prevent performance degradation when different datasets share overlapping label spaces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix B.1 notes that on the SEED-IV dataset, the model exhibits "paradigm boundary confusion" due to heavy label overlap with SEED-V, causing it to misinterpret samples and degrade accuracy compared to single-task baselines.
- Why unresolved: The unified sequence space treats task tokens and labels as related but distinct symbolic elements, but the model struggles to disentangle the conditional probabilities when semantic labels (e.g., "Positive") appear across multiple tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modification to the input sequence format that enforces stricter disentanglement of task and label tokens, or the introduction of a task-discrimination auxiliary loss that maintains accuracy on datasets with high label overlap.

## Limitations

- **Missing implementation details:** The 75-channel template mapping sets are referenced but not enumerated, requiring manual reconstruction that may affect cross-dataset consistency.
- **Computational constraints:** The seq2seq and ICL structure creates computational overhead that prevents processing long EEG sequences (e.g., 10-minute sleep staging), forcing stricter 30-second evaluation settings.
- **Performance degradation on label overlap:** When different datasets share overlapping label spaces (SEED-IV vs SEED-V), the model exhibits paradigm confusion and performance degradation compared to single-task baselines.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The decoder-centric seq2seq reformulation and hybrid positional encoding mechanisms are well-supported by ablation studies showing clear failure modes when components are removed.
- **Medium Confidence:** The in-context learning claims are supported by training methodology and performance improvements, though the specific generalization mechanisms could benefit from more direct analysis.
- **Medium Confidence:** Cross-dataset generalization results are promising but limited to a single zero-shot transfer experiment in the appendix.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation validation:** Reproduce the positional encoding ablations on a held-out dataset (e.g., SEED) to confirm that removing sample-level PE causes chance-level performance and removing textual PE causes structural collapse.

2. **ICL scaling analysis:** Conduct a systematic sweep of support sample counts (0, 4, 8, 12) on multi-task evaluation to measure how in-context learning performance scales with context size, plotting accuracy vs. support count.

3. **Zero-shot transfer validation:** Test ECHO's generalization to a held-out dataset not used in training (e.g., BCIC 2020-T1) to verify cross-dataset claims, comparing ECHO with no support vs. ECHO with 8 support samples vs. encoder-only baseline.
