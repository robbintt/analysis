# "What are my options?": Explaining RL Agents with Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (Extended)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.09901
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09901
- Reference count: 39
- Introduces DNA method for explaining RL agents through diverse near-optimal trajectory options

## Executive Summary
This work introduces Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (DNA), a method for explaining reinforcement learning agents by generating diverse near-optimal trajectory options. DNA partitions the state space into corridors and trains local policies to navigate each corridor while optimizing for distinct behaviors. The method uses reward shaping in modified Q-learning problems to produce policies with guaranteed ϵ-optimality. In experiments on a gridworld task, DNA successfully generated qualitatively different policies from a starting state, with experimental success rates of 48.6% and 72.6% for two corridors compared to much lower performance from Quality Diversity methods.

## Method Summary
DNA partitions the state space into corridors centered on near-optimal trajectories from an initial state to a goal. For each corridor, the method constructs a modified Q-learning problem with shaped rewards that penalize states outside the corridor and adjust rewards to encourage distinct behaviors within the corridor. Local policies are trained for each corridor using these modified rewards, with ϵ-optimality guarantees maintained through careful reward shaping. The corridor boundaries are defined by expanding the set of states visited by near-optimal trajectories, creating a finite set of corridors that cover the relevant state space.

## Key Results
- Successfully generated qualitatively different policies from a starting state in gridworld tasks
- Achieved experimental success rates of 48.6% and 72.6% for two corridors
- Demonstrated superior performance compared to Quality Diversity methods in corridor-based policy generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DNA works by partitioning the state space into corridors and training local policies within each corridor using reward shaping. The method modifies the original reward function to create corridor-specific Q-learning problems that penalize deviation from the corridor while maintaining ϵ-optimality guarantees. By training multiple local policies with different reward structures within each corridor, DNA can generate diverse near-optimal behaviors that explore different regions of the state space while still achieving the task effectively.

## Foundational Learning
- **Corridor partitioning**: Why needed - to create distinct regions of state space for diverse policy generation; Quick check - verify corridor boundaries don't overlap excessively
- **Reward shaping**: Why needed - to modify original rewards while maintaining optimality guarantees; Quick check - ensure ϵ-optimality bounds are preserved
- **Local policy training**: Why needed - to generate diverse behaviors within corridor constraints; Quick check - verify policies achieve high success rates within their corridors
- **Trajectory success probability**: Why needed - to provide safety guarantees for corridor-based navigation; Quick check - validate probability bounds match empirical performance
- **ϵ-optimality guarantees**: Why needed - to ensure generated policies remain near-optimal; Quick check - confirm modified rewards maintain solution quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Initial State/Goal -> Corridor Construction -> Modified Q-Learning Problems -> Local Policy Training -> Diverse Near-Optimal Policies

**Critical Path:**
The critical path follows the flow from initial state/goal specification through corridor construction, modified Q-learning problem formulation, local policy training, and final policy generation. Each step must succeed for the overall method to produce useful diverse alternatives.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Corridor size vs. policy diversity: Larger corridors may reduce diversity while smaller corridors may limit policy effectiveness
- Reward shaping intensity vs. optimality preservation: Stronger shaping enables more diverse behaviors but may compromise optimality guarantees
- Number of corridors vs. computational efficiency: More corridors increase diversity but require more training time and resources

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor corridor construction leading to overlapping policies or inadequate coverage
- Reward shaping that violates ϵ-optimality guarantees
- Local policies that fail to navigate their assigned corridors effectively
- Insufficient diversity among generated policies

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Validate corridor construction on simple gridworld with known optimal trajectories
2. Test modified Q-learning with shaped rewards on single corridor
3. Evaluate policy diversity by comparing generated policies' state visitation patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to single gridworld domain
- Corridor construction methodology lacks detailed discussion of boundary effects
- Comparison with Quality Diversity methods needs clearer specification of evaluation conditions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical framework for corridor-based policy generation and ϵ-optimality guarantees
- **Medium confidence**: Experimental results showing successful policy generation in gridworld tasks
- **Low confidence**: Scalability claims and performance comparisons with alternative methods

## Next Checks
1. Test the DNA method on multiple complex environments (e.g., continuous control tasks, partially observable domains) to evaluate scalability and robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of corridor size, shape, and boundary conditions on policy diversity and performance
3. Implement and compare against additional diverse policy generation methods (e.g., MAP-Elites, PolicySketch) using standardized metrics and environments
