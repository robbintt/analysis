core_contribution: This study evaluated the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
  querying structured EHR data and extracting information from unstructured clinical
  text using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. A flexible evaluation

  using a subset of MIMIC-III data.

# Harnessing Large Language Models for Precision Querying and Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Extraction in Clinical Data Science

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20674
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20674
- Reference count: 0
- Large Language Models can effectively support structured querying and unstructured text extraction in clinical contexts, though accuracy varies by model and task.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for two critical clinical data science tasks: structured querying of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and information extraction from unstructured clinical text. The research implements a flexible evaluation framework using synthetic question-answer pairs generated from MIMIC-III data, employing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The study systematically evaluates multiple LLM models across both tasks, measuring performance through exact-match accuracy, code correctness, and semantic similarity metrics, with human annotations validating the results for unstructured data extraction.

## Method Summary
The research employs a comprehensive evaluation framework using MIMIC-III data to generate synthetic question-answer pairs for both structured querying and unstructured text extraction tasks. For structured querying, SQL query generation is evaluated using exact-match accuracy and code correctness metrics, while unstructured text extraction uses a RAG pipeline with semantic similarity and ROUGE metrics. Multiple LLM models are tested, including GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3-8B, and Flan-T5-Large, with human annotations providing ground truth validation for unstructured data tasks.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o-mini achieved 50% exact-match accuracy and 73% code correctness for structured SQL querying
- Llama 3-8B showed lower exact-match performance (3%) but better code generation (60%) for structured tasks
- For unstructured data extraction, both Flan-T5-Large and GPT-4o-mini achieved approximately 75-78% human-annotated correctness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLMs can process natural language queries and translate them into structured database operations or extract relevant information from unstructured text through pattern recognition and semantic understanding. The RAG pipeline enhances performance by retrieving relevant context before generation, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy in clinical information extraction tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Synthetic data generation**: Creating controlled evaluation scenarios; needed for systematic testing without compromising real patient data; quick check: verify synthetic queries cover diverse clinical scenarios
- **RAG pipeline architecture**: Context retrieval before generation; needed to reduce hallucinations in clinical contexts; quick check: measure retrieval relevance scores
- **Multi-metric evaluation**: Combining exact-match, semantic, and human judgment metrics; needed for comprehensive performance assessment; quick check: ensure metrics align with clinical use cases
- **Model-specific optimization**: Tailoring prompts and parameters per LLM; needed due to varying capabilities and failure modes; quick check: compare performance across different prompting strategies
- **Clinical domain adaptation**: Fine-tuning or prompting for medical terminology; needed for accurate EHR interpretation; quick check: validate with domain expert review

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Natural Language Query -> Query Generator/Extractor -> RAG Retriever (for unstructured) -> Answer Generator -> Evaluation Metrics
**Critical Path**: Query input → LLM processing → SQL generation or text extraction → Evaluation against ground truth
**Design Tradeoffs**: Synthetic vs. real clinical data (controlled testing vs. real-world complexity), exact-match vs. semantic accuracy (precision vs. practical utility), model size vs. performance (computational cost vs. accuracy)
**Failure Signatures**: SQL syntax errors in structured tasks, hallucination in unstructured extraction, metric misalignment between automated and human evaluation
**First Experiments**: 1) Test with real clinical queries from healthcare practitioners, 2) Evaluate cross-dataset generalization beyond MIMIC-III, 3) Conduct longitudinal performance assessment for tracking patient condition changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic evaluation framework may not fully capture real-world clinical query complexity
- Study focuses on a subset of MIMIC-III data, limiting generalizability
- Reliance on automated ROUGE scores alongside human annotations introduces uncertainty about metric robustness

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: LLMs can perform structured querying and unstructured text extraction in clinical contexts
- **Medium Confidence**: Comparative performance between different LLMs shows trade-offs between exact-match and code correctness
- **Medium Confidence**: RAG pipeline effectiveness demonstrated, but metric robustness in clinical contexts requires further validation

## Next Checks
1. **Real-World Clinical Query Testing**: Evaluate models using actual clinical questions from healthcare practitioners
2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Test evaluation framework and model performance on additional clinical datasets beyond MIMIC-III
3. **Longitudinal Performance Assessment**: Conduct extended testing to evaluate model performance consistency over time for tracking patient conditions
