## Executive Summary
ALIGN is a multimodal vision-language framework that significantly improves the accuracy of inferring road accident locations from unstructured news articles. By combining text extraction, map-based visual verification, and grid-based spatial scanning, ALIGN overcomes the limitations of traditional geoparsing methods. Tested on Bangla-language news data from Bangladesh, ALIGN achieved a mean error of 0.466 km, demonstrating high potential for real-time crash mapping and safety analytics in low-resource environments where accurate geospatial data is scarce.

## Method Summary
ALIGN is a four-stage pipeline that extracts location cues from unstructured Bangla news articles using a vision-language model (VLM), then verifies and refines these cues through map-based visual reasoning. The process involves: (1) Gemini 2.5 Flash extracts structured location data and generates search queries; (2) Selenium automates Google Maps searches and captures screenshots, which are pre-filtered via OCR and then verified by the VLM; (3) a 6km×6km grid search recursively refines location when direct geocoding fails; (4) fallback to district-level inference. The framework uses external road databases and linguistic augmentation to improve accuracy in low-resource settings.

## Key Results
- 0.466 km mean error, 94% improvement over baseline text-only approaches
- 82% success rate in Stage 2 direct search, with 16% resolved via grid search
- 2% fallback to district-level inference due to extreme vagueness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Visual-Semantic Grounding via VLM Loops
The system achieves high-accuracy geolocation (0.466 km mean error) by treating geocoding as a visual verification task rather than a text-retrieval task. The pipeline generates candidate map screenshots using Selenium, extracts on-screen text via EasyOCR, and feeds both the image and the article context to a Vision-Language Model (VLM). The VLM determines if the visual features (road labels, landmarks) align with the narrative, rejecting hallucinated or generic map locations.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Spatial Search (Grid-Based Refinement)
A recursive grid search enables location inference for "unindexed" or vernacular locations that fail standard API lookups. When Stage 2 (direct search) fails, the system identifies a "pivot" location (e.g., a broad administrative unit like a District). It then defines a 6km x 6km grid, generates search coordinates at set intervals, captures screenshots at each point, and scans them for the missing specific landmark (e.g., a village name appearing on a road sign in the map view).

### Mechanism 3: Query Expansion via Domain-Specific Augmentation
Accuracy is contingent on augmenting LLM extraction with external domain knowledge (road codes) and linguistic variations. An LLM extracts entities and generates multiple search string variations (transliterations, synonyms). Crucially, it fuzzy-matches extracted road names against a local JSON database (bd_roads.json) to inject official road codes (e.g., "N1"). This injected code forces the map search to focus on the correct road geometry, compensating for the VLM's potential lack of specific local road knowledge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Geoparsing vs. Geocoding**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand that the system isn't just converting an address to coordinates (Geocoding) but is extracting implicit spatial cues from unstructured narrative text (Geoparsing) and then verifying them.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the system assume the location is explicitly stated as an address, or does it infer the location from descriptive landmarks?

- **Concept: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as Verifiers**
  - **Why needed here:** The core innovation is using a VLM not to generate text, but to validate a visual hypothesis (the map screenshot) against a text premise (the article).
  - **Quick check question:** In the ALIGN architecture, is the VLM primarily used to generate the coordinates, or to approve/reject coordinates found via other means?

- **Concept: OCR Pre-filtering**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding why the authors use a separate OCR tool (EasyOCR) before the VLM, rather than letting the VLM read the map directly.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a specialized OCR engine be used to "pre-filter" screenshots before sending them to a multimodal LLM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Gemini Extractor (LLM): Parses article → Structured JSON + Search Strings
  2. Road DB Lookup: Fuzzy matches road names → Injects Road Codes
  3. Search Automator (Selenium): Queries Google Maps → Captures Screenshots
  4. OCR Agent (EasyOCR): Reads screenshot labels → Filters irrelevant images
  5. VLM Verifier (Gemini Flash): Multimodal check → Yes/No on location match
  6. Grid Search Controller: Manages Stage 3 recursive scanning if Stage 2 fails

- **Critical path:**
  The verification loop: *Search Query Generation → Screenshot Capture → OCR Text Extraction → VLM Verification*. If the OCR fails to find relevant text on the screenshot, the expensive VLM call is skipped, saving cost.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Accuracy vs. Latency:** The system achieves sub-500m error but takes ~13.4 minutes per article, making it suitable for offline database generation but unsuitable for real-time emergency dispatch.
  - **Cost vs. Autonomy:** Uses proprietary APIs (Gemini) rather than local models, accepting recurring costs to avoid GPU infrastructure and fine-tuning overhead.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Extremely Vague" Trigger: System returns "Lat/Long Not Available" if both landmark and road are missing (Section 3.1.1).
  - Grid Search Timeout: High computational cost or timeout if the "pivot" area is too large (e.g., a whole district) and the specific landmark is not visually labeled on the map.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Extraction Validation: Run 10 diverse articles through the Gemini Extractor to verify it correctly outputs the schema (road, landmark, etc.) and generates valid search strings.
  2. OCR Threshold Tuning: Test the OCR agent on sample map screenshots to confirm the 75% fuzzy matching threshold effectively filters noise without discarding valid misspellings.
  3. End-to-End Baseline: Compare a "Text-only" run (skip VLM/OCR, just geocode search strings) vs. the full pipeline on a small validation set to replicate the 7.95km vs 0.466km error delta.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the ALIGN framework be generalized to other low-resource linguistic regions (e.g., India, Myanmar) without requiring extensive manual curation of local alias databases and prompt schemas?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state future work will focus on a "more readily transferable system design to reduce the domain-specific tuning required for new regions."
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation relies heavily on a manually created "bd_roads.json" database and specific transliteration rules for Bangla, which may not exist or function effectively in other administrative contexts.
- **Evidence:** Deploying the current pipeline on a dataset of accident reports from a different region and measuring accuracy degradation without domain-specific modifications.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can the second-stage grid-scan logic be optimized to reduce the average 13.4-minute processing time without sacrificing the sub-kilometer localization accuracy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify "increasing processing efficiency, potentially by optimizing the grid-scan logic" as a key area for future development.
- **Why unresolved:** The current recursive grid search (6km $\to$ 1km steps) is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck for real-time applications.
- **Evidence:** Implementing adaptive search heuristics or constrained search areas based on road network density, then measuring the reduction in end-to-end processing time against the baseline error rate.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) be enhanced to match the complex reasoning capabilities of proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Flash) for this specific geolocation task?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors note that "open-source models struggled with the complex, context-heavy prompts," necessitating reliance on proprietary APIs, which introduces cost and scalability concerns.
- **Why unresolved:** The study utilized Gemini 2.5 Flash out-of-the-box and did not evaluate whether fine-tuning open-source models could bridge the performance gap.
- **Evidence:** Fine-tuning an open-source VLM (e.g., LLaVA or similar) on the Bangla accident dataset and comparing its extraction and verification success rates against the Gemini baseline.

## Limitations

- **Major reproducibility gap:** The absence of prompt text for the critical Gemini extraction and verification stages introduces substantial uncertainty in replicating the system's performance.
- **External dependencies:** The system's performance is contingent on the quality and completeness of the `bd_roads.json` database and the Bangla alias map, both of which are referenced but not detailed in the paper.
- **High computational latency:** The system exhibits high computational latency (~13.4 minutes per article), making it unsuitable for real-time applications like emergency dispatch.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The reported accuracy metrics (0.466 km mean error) and the 94% improvement over the text-only baseline are well-supported by the presented data.
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism of VLM-based visual verification is plausible and the architecture is logically coherent, but the lack of explicit prompt details and reliance on proprietary APIs make it difficult to independently verify the exact nature of the VLM's spatial reasoning.
- **Low Confidence:** The paper's claims about the system's adaptability to "low-resource environments" are not fully substantiated, as the system requires access to specific external databases, paid API services, and a complex Selenium-based automation setup.

## Next Checks

1. **Prompt Transparency Audit:** Obtain and test the exact text of Prompt 1 (extraction), Prompt 2 (verification), and Prompt 4 (reranking) to validate their influence on system performance and assess their generalizability to other domains or languages.
2. **Database Dependency Stress Test:** Evaluate the system's performance when the `bd_roads.json` database is intentionally degraded (e.g., by removing 20% of road entries or introducing errors) to quantify the system's reliance on this external knowledge base.
3. **Latency vs. Accuracy Trade-off Analysis:** Systematically vary the grid search parameters (e.g., initial step size, reduction factor) and measure the resulting impact on both computational time and geolocation accuracy to identify the optimal balance for different use-case requirements.
