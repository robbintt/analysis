# Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24234
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24234
- Authors: Ludovic Schwartz; Hamish Flynn; Gergely Neu
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SOIDS achieves optimal worst-case regret in both data-rich (√sdT) and data-poor ((sT)^(2/3)) regimes simultaneously

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS), an algorithm that extends the Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (OIDS) framework to sparse linear bandits. SOIDS uniquely achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the data-rich regime (scaling as √sdT) and the data-poor regime (scaling as (sT)^(2/3)), where s is sparsity, d is dimension, and T is time horizon. The key innovation is a novel analysis allowing time-dependent and data-dependent learning rates in the optimistic posterior update, enabling the algorithm to adapt to both regimes. Theoretical guarantees demonstrate that SOIDS matches the performance of specialized algorithms in each regime simultaneously, a first in the frequentist setting. Empirical evaluation validates the theoretical findings, showing SOIDS performs well across regimes compared to state-of-the-art baselines like OTCS (data-rich) and ESTC (data-poor).

## Method Summary
SOIDS builds upon the Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (OIDS) framework by incorporating sparse linear bandit structure. The algorithm uses a novel analysis that allows time-dependent and data-dependent learning rates in the optimistic posterior update. This enables the algorithm to adapt its exploration-exploitation tradeoff based on available data and current sparsity estimates. The method maintains an optimistic posterior distribution over the sparse linear model parameters, using this to balance information gain against immediate reward. By carefully tuning the learning rate and incorporating sparsity-aware regularization, SOIDS can simultaneously achieve optimal performance in both data-rich and data-poor regimes. The theoretical analysis leverages concentration inequalities and covering number arguments to establish the regret bounds, while the empirical evaluation compares SOIDS against specialized algorithms for each regime.

## Key Results
- SOIDS achieves optimal worst-case regret of √sdT in the data-rich regime
- SOIDS achieves optimal worst-case regret of (sT)^(2/3) in the data-poor regime
- Empirical results show SOIDS outperforms or matches specialized algorithms (OTCS, ESTC) across different regimes
- Theoretical analysis proves SOIDS is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve optimal regret in both regimes in the frequentist setting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SOIDS works by adapting its exploration-exploitation tradeoff through time-dependent and data-dependent learning rates in the optimistic posterior update. In the data-rich regime, the algorithm focuses on exploiting the accumulated information to minimize regret, achieving the √sdT scaling. In the data-poor regime, SOIDS prioritizes exploration and information gathering, leading to the (sT)^(2/3) scaling. The key mechanism is the ability to balance optimism in the face of uncertainty with sparsity-aware regularization, allowing the algorithm to automatically transition between regimes based on available data. This adaptive behavior is enabled by the novel analysis of the posterior update, which carefully controls the trade-off between bias and variance in the parameter estimates. By maintaining an optimistic view of the sparse linear model while being responsive to new data, SOIDS can efficiently navigate both regimes without prior knowledge of which regime it's in.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Sparse Linear Model -> Optimistic Posterior -> Learning Rate Controller -> Action Selection -> Reward Observation -> Posterior Update

### Critical Path
1. Observe current context
2. Sample from optimistic posterior
3. Compute learning rate based on data availability
4. Select action balancing exploration and exploitation
5. Observe reward and update posterior
6. Iterate

### Design Tradeoffs
- Optimism vs. conservatism in posterior updates
- Exploration intensity vs. exploitation in action selection
- Computational complexity of exact vs. approximate posterior sampling
- Sparsity assumptions vs. model flexibility

### Failure Signatures
- High regret in data-rich regime: Learning rate too aggressive, leading to insufficient exploitation
- Poor performance in data-poor regime: Learning rate too conservative, leading to insufficient exploration
- Computational inefficiency: Exact posterior sampling becomes intractable for large d

### First Experiments
1. Compare SOIDS against OTCS and ESTC in synthetic data with varying sparsity levels
2. Test SOIDS in a regime transition scenario (from data-poor to data-rich)
3. Evaluate the impact of approximate vs. exact posterior sampling on performance
