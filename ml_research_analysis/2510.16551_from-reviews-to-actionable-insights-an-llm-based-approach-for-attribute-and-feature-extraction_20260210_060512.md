# From Reviews to Actionable Insights: An LLM-Based Approach for Attribute and Feature Extraction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.16551
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16551
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LLM approach extracts product/service attributes, features, and sentiments from reviews with high agreement (Krippendorff's α = 0.75 for attributes, 0.66 for features) and strong predictive validity (R² = 0.74 for attributes, 0.68 for features)

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a systematic large language model (LLM) approach to extract product and service attributes, features, and sentiments from customer reviews. The method distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features and processes reviews sentence-by-sentence using guided prompts, achieving high agreement with human annotations while operating at significantly greater speed. Tested on 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores, the approach demonstrates strong predictive validity for customer ratings and reveals that customer service and coffee/beverage attributes dominate review mentions.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach uses a structured LLM-based pipeline to process customer reviews systematically. The method employs guided prompts to analyze reviews sentence-by-sentence, assigning each to predefined attributes and features while evaluating sentiment. The framework distinguishes between perceptual attributes (general characteristics) and actionable features (specific elements that can be modified). The LLM processes each review in under two seconds, compared to the median six minutes required by human coders. The system was evaluated on 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores, demonstrating high inter-annotator agreement and strong predictive validity for customer ratings.

## Key Results
- Achieved Krippendorff's α = 0.75 for attribute extraction and 0.66 for feature extraction when compared to human annotations
- Demonstrated strong predictive validity for customer ratings with R² = 0.74 for attributes and 0.68 for features
- Customer service and coffee/beverage attributes dominated review mentions, with sentiment closely tied to overall ratings
- Simulations indicated potential 1-2% average revenue gains per store from improving sentiment on key service features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding capabilities to systematically parse and categorize review content. By using guided prompts and processing reviews sentence-by-sentence, the method ensures consistent attribute and feature assignment while maintaining contextual understanding. The distinction between perceptual attributes and actionable features enables businesses to identify which elements of their offering can be directly modified based on customer feedback. The sentence-level processing allows for granular sentiment analysis tied to specific attributes, providing more actionable insights than document-level sentiment scoring.

## Foundational Learning
- **Attribute vs. Feature Distinction:** Why needed: To separate general characteristics from modifiable elements; Quick check: Verify that each extracted item can be mapped to either category
- **Sentence-Level Processing:** Why needed: Enables granular sentiment attribution; Quick check: Ensure each sentence is assigned to exactly one attribute-feature pair
- **Guided Prompt Engineering:** Why needed: Maintains consistency across LLM processing; Quick check: Test prompts with sample reviews to verify expected outputs
- **Krippendorff's Alpha:** Why needed: Measures inter-annotator agreement for reliability; Quick check: Calculate agreement scores for validation sets
- **Predictive Validity Assessment:** Why needed: Validates that extracted features correlate with business outcomes; Quick check: Test correlation between features and ratings across different datasets

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Reviews -> Sentence Tokenizer -> LLM Prompt Engine -> Attribute/Feature Classifier -> Sentiment Evaluator -> Structured Output
**Critical Path:** Review ingestion → sentence segmentation → guided prompt generation → LLM inference → attribute/feature mapping → sentiment scoring → structured data storage
**Design Tradeoffs:** Predefined attribute lists ensure consistency but limit discovery of novel attributes; sentence-level processing increases accuracy but requires more LLM calls
**Failure Signatures:** Inconsistent attribute assignment across similar sentences; sentiment scores not correlating with overall review ratings; LLM confusion on ambiguous feature descriptions
**3 First Experiments:** 1) Test sentence segmentation accuracy on reviews with complex structure; 2) Validate attribute assignment consistency across different prompt formulations; 3) Compare sentiment scoring between sentence-level and review-level approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Relies on predefined attribute and feature lists, potentially missing novel attributes
- Limited to Starbucks coffee shops, raising generalizability concerns to other business types
- Revenue impact simulations are correlational rather than causally validated

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** LLM's technical capability to process reviews systematically, computational efficiency gains (seconds vs. minutes per review)
- **Medium confidence:** Predictive validity for customer ratings, quality of sentiment extraction
- **Low confidence:** Revenue impact simulations, generalizability to other business contexts

## Next Checks
1. Test the attribute and feature extraction framework on reviews from different business types (e.g., restaurants, retail, healthcare) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct A/B testing or controlled experiments to validate whether improving sentiment on identified features actually leads to revenue increases, rather than relying on correlational simulations.
3. Implement a dynamic attribute discovery mechanism that can identify emerging attributes without requiring predefined lists, and validate against human annotators.
