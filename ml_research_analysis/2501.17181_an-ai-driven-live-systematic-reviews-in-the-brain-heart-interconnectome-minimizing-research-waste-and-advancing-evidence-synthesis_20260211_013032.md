# An AI-Driven Live Systematic Reviews in the Brain-Heart Interconnectome: Minimizing Research Waste and Advancing Evidence Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.17181
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17181
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: An AI-driven system for Brain-Heart Interconnectome systematic reviews achieves 87% PICOS compliance accuracy, 95.7% study design classification accuracy, and uses RAG-GPT-3.5 to outperform GPT-4 on relationship-centric queries.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces an AI-driven system to improve systematic reviews in the Brain-Heart Interconnectome (BHI) by reducing research waste and enhancing evidence synthesis. The system employs automated PICOS compliance detection, semantic search with vector embeddings, graph-based querying, and topic modeling to identify redundancies and underexplored areas. Key components include a Bi-LSTM model achieving 87% accuracy for PICOS compliance and a study design classifier with 95.7% accuracy. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with GPT-3.5 outperformed GPT-4 for specialized BHI queries, offering real-time updates through a living database. The system provides an interactive interface with dashboards and conversational AI, addressing challenges in systematic reviews and research waste while maintaining flexibility for broader biomedical applications.

## Method Summary
The system combines multiple AI components: a Bi-LSTM classifier for PICOS compliance (87% accuracy), a study design classifier (95.7% accuracy), BERTopic for thematic clustering, and RAG with GPT-3.5 for query answering. The architecture uses PostgreSQL with pgVector for embeddings, Neo4j for graph relationships, and LangChain/LangGraph for query orchestration. Documents are processed through embedding generation, PICOS classification, study design labeling, graph population, topic clustering, and finally RAG query answering. The system is deployed via Chainlit interface with Power BI dashboards and LiteralAI logging.

## Key Results
- Bi-LSTM PICOS compliance classifier achieved 87% accuracy
- Study design classifier reached 95.7% accuracy with 91.4% precision and 100% recall
- RAG with GPT-3.5 outperformed standalone GPT-4 on 75% of specialized BHI queries
- BERTopic clustering identified research redundancies and underexplored areas

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RAG with GPT-3.5 outperforms standalone GPT-4 for domain-specific, relationship-centric queries in the BHI domain.
- Mechanism: Retrieval-Augmented Generation grounds model outputs in curated vector embeddings and graph-structured data (Neo4j), reducing hallucination while leveraging domain-specific context that general-purpose models may lack.
- Core assumption: The vector embeddings and graph relationships accurately capture the semantic structure of BHI literature; retrieval quality determines answer quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with GPT-3.5 outperformed GPT-4 for specialized BHI queries"
  - [section] "75% of RAG-augmented responses met or exceeded expert expectations... 25% where RAG-based GPT-3.5 excelled, especially for relationship-centric queries leveraging Neo4j"
  - [corpus] Related work (e.g., "Compiling Prompts, Not Crafting Them") highlights brittleness of manually crafted prompts; RAG offers a more grounded alternative. Limited direct corpus comparison of GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 in biomedical domains.
- Break condition: If vector embeddings are poorly aligned to domain terminology, or if graph relationships contain noisy/incomplete edges, retrieval quality degrades and RAG may underperform pure generation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bi-LSTM-based PICOS compliance detection reduces early-stage screening workload by filtering methodologically incomplete studies.
- Mechanism: A bidirectional LSTM processes abstract text to classify compliance with PICOS elements, flagging studies that lack required methodological components before human review.
- Core assumption: PICOS compliance in abstracts correlates with overall study methodological quality; training data (PubMed-PICO) generalizes to BHI-specific literature.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Bi-LSTM model achieving 87% accuracy for PICOS compliance"
  - [section] "The Bi-LSTM model recorded an accuracy of 87% in identifying PICOS-compliant abstracts"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus validation—neighbor papers focus on LLM-based approaches rather than Bi-LSTM specifically for PICOS. No direct external benchmark found.
- Break condition: If BHI abstracts diverge linguistically from PubMed-PICO training distribution, or if important methodological details appear in full-text rather than abstracts, classification accuracy drops.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Topic modeling with BERTopic identifies research redundancies and underexplored domains, potentially redirecting research allocation.
- Mechanism: BERTopic clusters documents thematically using transformer embeddings and class-based TF-IDF; high-density clusters suggest redundancy, sparse clusters indicate gaps.
- Core assumption: Topic coherence from BERTopic aligns with expert-defined research themes; publication density correlates with research value/redundancy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "topic modeling to identify redundancies and underexplored areas"
  - [section] "BERTopic-derived clusters helped researchers pinpoint areas with high publication density and detect thematic overlaps... Redundancy Alerts were triggered by repeated short-term cardiovascular outcome studies"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus validation—no neighbor papers directly evaluate BERTopic for redundancy detection in systematic reviews.
- Break condition: If clusters are too granular or too coarse, or if emerging topics lack sufficient documents to form clusters, gap identification becomes unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **PICOS Framework (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Study Design)**
  - Why needed here: The system's compliance detection and screening logic depends on understanding these evidence synthesis primitives.
  - Quick check question: Given an abstract stating "We enrolled 120 stroke patients, randomized to aerobic exercise vs. usual care, measuring cognitive scores at 6 months," can you map each PICOS element?

- Concept: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: The system's query answering relies on RAG to combine LLM generation with grounded retrieval from vector stores and graph databases.
  - Quick check question: If a user asks "What interventions improve both cardiac and cognitive outcomes?", which data stores would RAG query, and why might pure GPT-4 fail here?

- Concept: **Graph Databases (Neo4j) for Biomedical Relationships**
  - Why needed here: The system models complex BHI relationships (interventions, outcomes, comorbidities) as graphs, enabling Cypher queries that relational databases struggle with.
  - Quick check question: How would you represent a study testing two interventions (exercise + cognitive training) on three outcomes (heart rate, cognition, quality of life) in a property graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Document ingestion → Embedding generation → PICOS classification → Study design labeling → Graph population → Topic clustering → RAG query answering → User dashboard/chat response

- Critical path: Document ingestion → Embedding generation → PICOS classification → Study design labeling → Graph population → Topic clustering → RAG query answering → User dashboard/chat response

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Bi-LSTM vs. LLM for PICOS: Bi-LSTM is lighter and achieves 87% accuracy, but may not capture nuanced BHI terminology as well as fine-tuned LLMs.
  - RAG-GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4: GPT-3.5 + RAG excels at relationship queries (25% of cases), but GPT-4 alone performs better for broad thematic overviews (20% of cases).
  - Living database: Real-time updates improve currency but increase verification overhead.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low retrieval relevance scores on LangGraph relevance grading → embedding drift or query mismatch
  - High false negative rate in PICOS classifier → training data mismatch with BHI abstracts
  - Sparse or incoherent BERTopic clusters → insufficient documents or poor embedding quality

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **RAG retrieval calibration**: Run 50 BHI-specific queries through both RAG-GPT-3.5 and GPT-4; manually score relevance and accuracy. Identify failure modes (e.g., multi-hop queries, negation handling).
  2. **PICOS classifier stress test**: Sample 100 BHI abstracts with known PICOS status (expert-labeled). Measure precision, recall, and error patterns (e.g., missing comparator elements).
  3. **Topic cluster validation**: Have domain experts review BERTopic clusters for thematic coherence; adjust min_cluster_size and embedding model if >30% of clusters are deemed incoherent.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific usability barriers and adoption rates for this system among researchers and clinicians with varying levels of technical expertise?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that "The system’s utility ultimately depends on acceptance by researchers and clinicians" and that "Formal usability assessments and iterative improvements will be essential."
- Why unresolved: The current study focused on architectural performance and algorithmic accuracy rather than longitudinal user experience or integration into real-world clinical workflows.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from formal usability studies (e.g., SUS scores) and qualitative feedback from domain experts using the tool for live systematic reviews.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can a dynamic routing mechanism optimize performance by directing broad thematic queries to GPT-4 and relationship-centric queries to RAG-GPT-3.5?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Results section notes that RAG-GPT-3.5 outperformed GPT-4 on specific graph queries, while GPT-4 excelled at "large-scale thematic overviews," suggesting distinct, unexploited specializations.
- Why unresolved: The paper benchmarks the models against each other but does not propose or test a unified system that leverages the specific strengths of both models simultaneously.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of a hybrid router model against single-model approaches using a diverse set of BHI-specific prompt types.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can automated pipelines be developed to verify the trustworthiness of new studies in the "living" database without relying on extensive manual human oversight?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section highlights that "verifying the trustworthiness of new studies demands structured pipelines or human oversight," identifying verification overhead as a key constraint.
- Why unresolved: The "living" database feature implies high-velocity data ingestion, which creates a scalability bottleneck if verification remains a predominantly manual or semi-automated process.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and validation of automated quality control algorithms that can flag methodological flaws or data inconsistencies in real-time.

## Limitations

- The PICOS compliance classifier's 87% accuracy is achieved on PubMed-PICO data, which may not generalize to the specialized BHI literature without domain adaptation.
- The RAG evaluation relies on expert judgment rather than ground truth answers, and the comparative advantage of GPT-3.5 over GPT-4 is based on a limited sample of 75% expert satisfaction.
- The living database's real-time update mechanism raises questions about consistency and version control across multiple users.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The system architecture design (combining Bi-LSTM, RAG, Neo4j, BERTopic) is technically sound and well-documented. The 95.7% accuracy for study design classification is based on concrete evaluation metrics.
- **Medium Confidence**: The comparative performance of RAG-GPT-3.5 vs standalone GPT-4 is plausible but requires larger-scale validation. The 87% PICOS compliance accuracy is reasonable but may not hold for BHI-specific literature.
- **Low Confidence**: The claims about identifying research redundancies and underexplored areas through BERTopic clustering lack rigorous external validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain PICOS Validation**: Evaluate the Bi-LSTM PICOS classifier on a held-out set of 100 BHI-specific abstracts labeled by domain experts. Compare performance to PubMed-PICO baseline to quantify domain adaptation needs.

2. **RAG Query Benchmark**: Construct a standardized test suite of 100 BHI-specific queries (including multi-hop, negation, and relationship-centric questions). Measure precision@k, recall@k, and answer quality scores for both RAG-GPT-3.5 and standalone GPT-4 across 5 independent expert raters.

3. **Topic Coherence Validation**: Have 3 domain experts independently rate 50 BERTopic clusters for thematic coherence on a 1-5 scale. Calculate inter-rater reliability (Krippendorff's alpha) and identify threshold for acceptable cluster quality.
