# SECRET: Semi-supervised Clinical Trial Document Similarity Search

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.10780
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10780
- Reference count: 37
- Outperforms Trial2Vec with up to 78% improvement in recall@1 and 53% in precision@1

## Executive Summary
SECRET addresses the challenge of clinical trial similarity search by introducing a semi-supervised approach that represents trials as concise question-answer pairs and employs two-level contrastive learning. The method tackles the lack of labeled data, long document complexity, and local semantic context challenges that plague existing approaches. By combining local (Q/A-level) and global (trial-level) contrastive learning, SECRET improves context understanding and retrieval quality while requiring less than a quarter of the training data used by current methods.

## Method Summary
SECRET represents clinical trials as question-answer pairs to create concise, semantically rich representations that capture local context. The method employs a semi-supervised framework with two-level contrastive learning: local contrastive learning operates at the Q/A pair level to understand fine-grained semantic relationships, while global contrastive learning works at the trial level to capture broader document similarity. This dual approach addresses the challenges of long clinical trial documents and improves retrieval quality by focusing on both granular and holistic document understanding.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 78% improvement in recall@1 and 53% in precision@1 over Trial2Vec baselines
- Outperforms existing methods on complete trial similarity search, partial trial search, and zero-shot patient-trial matching
- Achieves superior performance using less than 25% of the training data required by current methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by breaking down complex clinical trial documents into manageable question-answer pairs that capture essential semantic content while reducing document length complexity. The two-level contrastive learning framework enables the model to learn both fine-grained semantic relationships (local level) and broader document similarity patterns (global level). The semi-supervised approach leverages unlabeled data effectively, reducing dependency on expensive labeled datasets while maintaining or improving performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive learning**: Needed to learn semantically meaningful representations by comparing similar and dissimilar examples; quick check: ensure positive and negative pairs are correctly sampled
- **Semi-supervised learning**: Required to reduce dependency on labeled data; quick check: verify unlabeled data quality and quantity
- **Document representation**: Essential for converting long clinical trials into manageable formats; quick check: confirm Q/A pairs capture key trial information
- **Similarity search**: Core task of finding relevant trials; quick check: validate retrieval metrics align with clinical use cases

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Clinical Trial Documents -> Q/A Pair Generation -> Local Contrastive Learning -> Global Contrastive Learning -> Embedding Space -> Similarity Search

Critical path: The flow from Q/A pair generation through local contrastive learning to global contrastive learning forms the core learning pipeline. Success depends on effective Q/A generation and balanced contrastive learning at both levels.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades document completeness for manageability by using Q/A pairs, which may miss some context. The semi-supervised approach reduces labeling costs but relies on unlabeled data quality. The two-level learning increases computational complexity but improves semantic understanding.

Failure signatures: Poor Q/A generation quality leads to loss of critical trial information. Imbalanced positive/negative pairs in contrastive learning cause suboptimal embeddings. Insufficient unlabeled data undermines the semi-supervised approach.

First experiments:
1. Test Q/A generation quality on a small sample of clinical trials
2. Validate local contrastive learning with synthetic positive/negative pairs
3. Measure embedding quality before and after global contrastive learning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation lacks statistical significance testing for reported performance improvements
- Testing limited to two benchmark datasets, potentially missing broader generalizability
- Semi-supervised approach quality depends heavily on Q/A pair generation accuracy

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core methodology and two-level contrastive learning framework are technically sound and well-described
- Medium confidence: Performance improvements on benchmark datasets appear substantial but lack statistical validation
- Medium confidence: Claims about data efficiency (using <25% training data) are supported by reported results but require independent verification

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing (t-tests or bootstrap confidence intervals) on all reported performance metrics to verify that improvements over baselines are meaningful
2. Evaluate SECRET on additional clinical trial datasets from different medical domains to test generalizability beyond the two benchmark datasets used
3. Perform ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of the semi-supervised component versus the Q/A representation format to understand which aspect drives the performance gains
