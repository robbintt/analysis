- Introduces black-box method for detecting memorized training data in LLMs using information-guided probes

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel black-box approach for identifying memorized training data in large language models without requiring access to model weights or token probabilities. The method uses information-guided probes that mask high-surprisal tokens identified via a reference model, then measures reconstruction success to detect memorization. Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to prefix probing and existing black-box methods, with Fβ=0.1 scores reaching 82.7% on fiction datasets. The technique works effectively on both proprietary models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) and open-weight models (Llama-2), offering practical tools for data transparency in LLMs.

## Method Summary
The approach identifies training data memorization through information-guided probes that mask high-surprisal tokens using a reference model. These tokens are predicted to be difficult to guess based on their information content. The method then measures the target model's ability to reconstruct the original text after masking these high-surprisal tokens. Success in reconstruction indicates potential memorization, as the model must have strong prior knowledge of the masked content. This black-box technique works without access to model weights or token probabilities, making it applicable to proprietary models. The method is evaluated across multiple datasets including Wikipedia, fiction, news articles, and scientific papers, comparing against prefix probing and existing black-box approaches.

## Key Results
- Information-guided probes achieve Fβ=0.1 scores up to 82.7% on fiction datasets, outperforming prefix probing and existing black-box methods
- The approach successfully identifies memorized copyrighted content and potential dataset contamination across multiple model types
- Works effectively on both proprietary models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) and open-weight models (Llama-2), demonstrating practical applicability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages the observation that memorized content often contains high-surprisal tokens - words or phrases that are difficult to predict from context. When a model has memorized specific passages, it can successfully reconstruct these high-surprisal tokens even when they're masked, whereas models relying solely on general knowledge would struggle. The reference model identifies which tokens are information-rich (high surprisal), and the target model's ability to fill these gaps indicates memorization rather than general language understanding. This approach circumvents the need for white-box access by using the reconstruction task as a probe for underlying memorization.

## Foundational Learning

**Language model memorization** - Why needed: Understanding how models store and reproduce training data is crucial for identifying memorized content. Quick check: Compare model outputs on seen vs unseen similar content to observe memorization patterns.

**Information theory and surprisal** - Why needed: Surprisal measures how predictable a token is given context, which is central to identifying memorization. Quick check: Calculate surprisal scores for tokens in both memorized and non-memorized passages to establish baseline differences.

**Black-box probing techniques** - Why needed: The method must work without model weight access, requiring alternative approaches to assess internal knowledge. Quick check: Test reconstruction success rates across different masking strategies to validate the probing approach.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Reference model -> Surprisal calculation -> Token masking -> Target model reconstruction -> Memorization detection

**Critical path**: The core workflow involves using the reference model to identify high-surprisal tokens, masking these tokens in the target text, and measuring the target model's reconstruction accuracy. The success rate of reconstruction directly indicates memorization strength.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method balances between sensitivity (detecting all memorized content) and specificity (avoiding false positives from general knowledge). Using high-surprisal tokens as probes prioritizes specificity but may miss some memorized content that's contextually predictable.

**Failure signatures**: The approach may produce false negatives when memorized content contains mostly low-surprisal tokens, or false positives when general knowledge allows accurate reconstruction of non-memorized high-surprisal content. Performance also degrades if the reference model's capabilities significantly mismatch the target model's.

**3 first experiments**: 1) Test reconstruction success on known memorized vs non-memorized passages from the same dataset to establish baseline performance. 2) Vary the proportion of masked tokens to find optimal masking ratio for detection. 3) Compare performance across different reference model architectures to assess sensitivity to reference model selection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method requires access to a reference model with similar capabilities, which may not always be available or representative
- Current evaluation focuses primarily on English text and fiction datasets, limiting generalizability to other languages and domains
- Validation is limited to a single open-weight model (Llama-2), raising questions about broader applicability across diverse architectures

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The technical feasibility of using information-guided probes for memorization detection is well-supported by experiments. The method outperforms baseline approaches on evaluated datasets.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that this approach enables practical data transparency for proprietary models is reasonable but needs validation across more diverse model families and real-world copyright scenarios.

**Medium confidence**: The assertion that high-surprisal tokens are reliable indicators of memorization holds for the tested cases but may not generalize to all memorization types or model training strategies.

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on non-English datasets and technical/scientific domains to evaluate cross-domain performance and robustness.
2. Validate across a broader range of open-weight models (e.g., Mistral, Claude, various model sizes) to assess generalizability beyond Llama-2.
3. Conduct experiments where reference model capabilities deliberately mismatch the target model to quantify sensitivity to reference model selection and establish practical bounds.
