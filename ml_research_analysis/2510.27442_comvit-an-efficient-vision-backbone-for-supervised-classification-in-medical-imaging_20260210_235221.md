# CoMViT: An Efficient Vision Backbone for Supervised Classification in Medical Imaging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.27442
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27442
- Authors: Aon Safdar; Mohamed Saadeldin
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: 84.5% average accuracy across 12 MedMNIST datasets with only 4.55M parameters

## Executive Summary
CoMViT is a compact Vision Transformer architecture specifically designed for efficient medical image classification in low-resource settings. It addresses the challenge of deploying deep learning models in clinical environments where computational resources and labeled data are limited. The model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs by incorporating several architectural innovations that reduce parameter count while maintaining strong performance across diverse medical imaging tasks.

The architecture demonstrates superior performance compared to larger models like ResNet-50 and MedViT-T while using 5-20x fewer parameters. This efficiency makes it particularly suitable for deployment on edge devices and in resource-constrained clinical settings where traditional deep learning models may be impractical. The method has been validated across all 12 MedMNIST datasets, showing consistent performance improvements and clinically relevant feature localization through Grad-CAM visualizations.

## Method Summary
CoMViT combines Vision Transformer principles with medical imaging requirements through several key architectural modifications. The model employs a convolutional tokenizer that reduces computational overhead while maintaining feature extraction quality, paired with diagonal masking to limit attention computation to clinically relevant regions. Learnable temperature scaling optimizes the softmax function for medical image classification, while sequence pooling reduces the computational burden of processing long token sequences. These modifications collectively enable efficient processing of 28x28 grayscale medical images while maintaining high accuracy across diverse classification tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 84.5% average accuracy across all 12 MedMNIST datasets
- Uses only 4.55M parameters, significantly smaller than comparable models
- Outperforms ResNet-50 and MedViT-T despite using 5-20x fewer parameters
- Demonstrates clinically relevant feature localization through Grad-CAM visualizations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CoMViT's efficiency gains stem from its strategic architectural choices that address the specific challenges of medical imaging. The convolutional tokenizer reduces the computational cost of generating token sequences while preserving spatial information critical for medical diagnosis. Diagonal masking focuses attention on relevant anatomical regions rather than processing entire images uniformly, which is particularly important for medical images where only specific areas contain diagnostic information. Learnable temperature scaling allows the model to adapt its confidence calibration to the specific characteristics of medical imaging data, improving classification accuracy. Sequence pooling reduces the computational burden of processing long token sequences without significant information loss, making the model more practical for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Image -> Convolutional Tokenizer -> Patch Embedding -> Diagonal Masking -> Transformer Blocks -> Sequence Pooling -> Classification Head

Critical Path: The core processing pipeline follows from image input through the convolutional tokenizer to patch embedding, where diagonal masking is applied to constrain attention computation. The transformed features then pass through standard transformer blocks, followed by sequence pooling to reduce dimensionality before final classification.

Design Tradeoffs: CoMViT prioritizes parameter efficiency over absolute accuracy, accepting minor performance compromises to achieve significant reductions in model size and computational requirements. The convolutional tokenizer trades some representational power for faster processing, while diagonal masking sacrifices some global context understanding for focused attention on clinically relevant regions. These tradeoffs are justified by the deployment requirements in medical settings where efficiency often outweighs marginal accuracy gains.

Failure Signatures: The model may struggle with complex multi-organ pathologies requiring global context understanding due to diagonal masking limitations. Very subtle abnormalities that span across masked regions might be missed. The reduced parameter count could also limit the model's ability to capture extremely fine-grained distinctions in certain medical imaging tasks. Performance may degrade on higher-resolution images where the 28x28 assumption no longer holds.

First Experiments:
1. Test on a single MedMNIST dataset to verify basic functionality and accuracy
2. Compare inference time and memory usage against baseline models on representative hardware
3. Generate Grad-CAM visualizations for sample predictions to verify clinically relevant feature localization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to 28x28 grayscale images, may not generalize to higher-resolution or color medical imaging
- Lacks extensive ablation studies on individual architectural components like diagonal masking and learnable temperature scaling

- High Confidence: Parameter efficiency claims and relative performance comparisons across MedMNIST datasets
- Medium Confidence: Generalization to real-world medical imaging tasks beyond MedMNIST
- Medium Confidence: Clinical relevance of Grad-CAM visualizations without radiologist validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CoMViT on higher-resolution medical imaging datasets (e.g., CheXpert or MIMIC-CXR) to assess real-world applicability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of diagonal masking and learnable temperature scaling on performance
3. Measure actual inference latency and memory consumption on edge devices representative of clinical deployment environments
