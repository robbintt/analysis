# Generative Large Language Models Trained for Detecting Errors in Radiology Reports

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.04336
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04336
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fine-tuned Llama-3-70B-Instruct model achieved highest F1 scores across all error types in radiology report error detection

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that generative large language models can be effectively fine-tuned for detecting errors in radiology reports. The researchers developed a synthetic error generation pipeline and trained multiple models on both synthetic data and real MIMIC-CXR reports. Using zero-shot prompting, the fine-tuned Llama-3-70B-Instruct model achieved the highest F1 scores across all error types: 0.769 for negation errors, 0.772 for left/right errors, 0.750 for interval change errors, and 0.828 for transcription errors, with an overall macro-F1 score of 0.780. Human validation by two radiologists confirmed the model's effectiveness, with 99 out of 200 reports containing detected errors.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed a comprehensive approach to radiology report error detection by first creating a synthetic error generation pipeline that introduced various error types into original reports. They fine-tuned multiple generative LLMs including Llama-3-70B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, and GPT-3.5-turbo using both synthetic data and MIMIC-CXR real reports. The models were evaluated using zero-shot prompting with chain-of-thought techniques. Performance was measured using F1 scores across different error types, and human validation was conducted by two radiologists who reviewed reports flagged as containing errors.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Llama-3-70B-Instruct achieved highest F1 scores: 0.769 (negation), 0.772 (left/right), 0.750 (interval change), 0.828 (transcription)
- Overall macro-F1 score of 0.780 for the best-performing model
- Human validation confirmed 99/200 reports contained errors (0.495 accuracy), with 163/200 confirmed by at least one radiologist (0.815 accuracy)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of these models stems from their ability to understand context and language patterns in radiology reports. Fine-tuning on both synthetic and real data enables the models to recognize common error patterns while maintaining awareness of clinical context. The zero-shot prompting approach allows the models to generalize their learned patterns to new reports without requiring additional training.

## Foundational Learning
- Synthetic error generation - Creates controlled datasets for training; verify by checking error diversity and realism
- Zero-shot prompting - Enables model inference without additional training; verify by testing on unseen data
- Chain-of-thought prompting - Improves reasoning by breaking down tasks; verify by comparing with direct prompting
- F1 score calculation - Balances precision and recall; verify by manual calculation on sample data
- Human validation protocols - Ensures clinical relevance; verify by checking inter-reader agreement

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Radiology Reports -> Error Detection Model -> Confidence Score -> Human Validation

**Critical Path:** Report Input → LLM Processing → Error Classification → Confidence Assessment → Output Flagging

**Design Tradeoffs:** Fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering - fine-tuning provides better accuracy but requires more resources; prompt engineering is faster but less precise

**Failure Signatures:** False positives in error detection, missing context-dependent errors, inability to detect subtle errors requiring domain expertise

**First Experiments:**
1. Baseline error detection on synthetic reports without fine-tuning
2. Human validation of model-detected errors across different error types
3. Comparison of zero-shot vs. few-shot prompting performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic error generation may not capture real-world error complexity and context-dependency
- Single institutional dataset (MIMIC-CXR) limits generalizability to other clinical settings
- Human validation involved only two radiologists, raising concerns about inter-reader variability

## Confidence

High: Overall finding that fine-tuned LLMs improve error detection accuracy
Medium: Comparative performance of different models and prompting strategies
Low: Clinical implementation and workflow integration of these models

## Next Checks
1. Validate error detection models across multiple institutions and diverse radiological reporting systems
2. Evaluate inter-reader agreement among multiple radiologists to understand human validation variability
3. Assess models' performance in detecting subtle or context-dependent errors
