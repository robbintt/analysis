# IDAP++: Advancing Divergence-Based Pruning via Filter-Level and Layer-Level Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20141
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20141
- Authors: Aleksei Samarin; Artem Nazarenko; Egor Kotenko; Valentin Malykh; Alexander Savelev; Aleksei Toropov

- Primary result: 67-90% parameter reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy across vision, detection, segmentation, generative, and language modeling tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IDAP++, a two-stage neural network compression framework that addresses redundancy at both filter and architectural levels. The method is based on information flow divergence, a metric quantifying signal transformation across network layers. In the first stage, iterative divergence-aware pruning removes redundant filters while preserving critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to layer-level optimization, eliminating entire layers with minimal impact on information propagation. The unified framework adapts to diverse architectures including CNNs, transformers, and hybrid models.

Experimental validation demonstrates substantial model compression (67-90% parameter reduction) while maintaining competitive accuracy across vision, detection, segmentation, generative, and language modeling tasks. The approach outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving 2-3× speedup in inference with minimal quality degradation, and offers practical benefits for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

## Method Summary
IDAP++ operates through a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware pruning to identify and remove redundant filters within each layer based on information flow divergence metrics. This stage preserves critical information pathways while eliminating filters that contribute minimally to signal transformation. The second stage extends this principle to layer-level optimization, where entire layers are evaluated and potentially removed based on their impact on overall information propagation through the network. The unified framework adapts to diverse architectures including CNNs, transformers, and hybrid models by applying the same divergence-based principles across different layer types and connectivity patterns.

## Key Results
- Achieves 67-90% parameter reduction across multiple task domains
- Maintains competitive accuracy while providing 2-3× inference speedup
- Outperforms state-of-the-art compression solutions on vision, detection, segmentation, generative, and language modeling tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by quantifying information flow divergence across network layers, which measures how much each component transforms and preserves signal information. By iteratively removing components with minimal divergence impact, the framework eliminates redundancy while maintaining essential information pathways. The two-stage approach first optimizes at the filter level to preserve fine-grained information flow, then at the layer level to achieve architectural efficiency. This hierarchical optimization ensures that both local and global redundancy are addressed systematically.

## Foundational Learning
- Information flow divergence: Quantifies signal transformation across layers; needed to identify redundant components; quick check: verify divergence values decrease monotonically through layers
- Filter-level pruning: Removes individual filters based on contribution scores; needed for fine-grained redundancy elimination; quick check: ensure pruned filters have minimal impact on accuracy
- Layer-level optimization: Eliminates entire layers while preserving network functionality; needed for architectural compression; quick check: validate remaining layers maintain critical information flow
- Iterative optimization: Repeated evaluation and pruning cycles; needed for progressive redundancy removal; quick check: confirm convergence after fixed iterations
- Architecture-agnostic adaptation: Framework works across CNNs, transformers, and hybrids; needed for broad applicability; quick check: test on multiple architecture types

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input -> Divergence Calculator -> Filter Pruning Stage -> Layer Pruning Stage -> Optimized Model

**Critical Path:**
Information flow divergence calculation → Filter pruning decisions → Layer pruning decisions → Final model architecture

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Granularity vs. efficiency: Filter-level offers precise pruning but higher computational cost; layer-level provides faster compression but less fine-grained control
- Accuracy preservation vs. compression ratio: Conservative pruning maintains accuracy but reduces compression; aggressive pruning maximizes compression but risks accuracy degradation
- Computational overhead vs. runtime benefits: Iterative optimization requires additional training time but yields better compression ratios

**Failure Signatures:**
- Accuracy collapse after excessive pruning
- Information bottleneck formation in critical layers
- Layer removal that disrupts skip connections or attention mechanisms
- Inconsistent divergence measurements across different initializations

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test on a small CNN (e.g., ResNet-18) to validate basic pruning functionality and accuracy preservation
2. Apply to a transformer backbone to verify cross-architecture compatibility
3. Conduct ablation study comparing filter-only vs. layer-level pruning on the same architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited experimental validation on diverse hybrid architectures beyond basic combinations
- Theoretical assumptions about optimal signal propagation may not hold for all architectures
- Performance claims are hardware-dependent and may not translate uniformly across different deployment scenarios

## Confidence

**Parameter reduction and accuracy claims:** Medium
**Cross-architecture generalization:** Low-Medium  
**Speedup measurements:** Medium
**Theoretical foundation of divergence metric:** High

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on more diverse hybrid architectures including Graph Neural Networks and specialized vision transformers
2. Conduct ablation studies examining the impact of random initialization on pruning stability and final performance
3. Validate compression and accuracy claims on edge devices with different computational constraints to verify practical deployment benefits
