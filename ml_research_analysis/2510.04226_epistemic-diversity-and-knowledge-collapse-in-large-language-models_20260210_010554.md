# Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04226
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces methodology for measuring epistemic diversity in LLM outputs using Hill-Shannon Diversity metric

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a methodology for measuring epistemic diversity in LLM outputs, defined as the variation in real-world claims generated across different topics and prompts. The approach involves decomposing LLM responses into atomic claims, clustering semantically equivalent claims, and measuring diversity using Hill-Shannon Diversity (HSD), a statistical measure grounded in ecology. Empirical results from 27 LLMs across 155 topics show that while newer models generate more diverse claims than older ones, all models remain less epistemically diverse than basic web search. Model size has a statistically significant negative impact on diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though benefits vary by cultural context.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves three main steps: (1) decomposing LLM responses into atomic claims using a specialized tokenizer, (2) clustering semantically equivalent claims using cosine similarity in embedding space, and (3) measuring diversity using Hill-Shannon Diversity (HSD), which quantifies the effective number of distinct claims. The study evaluated 27 LLMs across 155 topics, comparing diversity metrics against web search baselines. Cultural context analysis was performed by examining country-specific claims and their representation of local versus English language knowledge.

## Key Results
- Newer LLM models generate more diverse claims than older models, but all models remain less diverse than web search
- Model size has a statistically significant negative impact on epistemic diversity
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves diversity, though benefits vary across cultural contexts
- Country-specific claims reflect English language knowledge more than local language knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by breaking down complex responses into atomic units of information (claims), which can then be compared for semantic equivalence. By clustering similar claims and measuring the effective number of distinct claims using Hill-Shannon Diversity, the approach captures variation in the knowledge space that LLMs generate. The decomposition allows for granular analysis of epistemic content, while the diversity metric provides a quantitative measure of knowledge breadth that can be compared across models and contexts.

## Foundational Learning
- Hill-Shannon Diversity (HSD): A statistical measure from ecology that quantifies effective species diversity; needed to measure epistemic diversity in a statistically rigorous way. Quick check: Verify HSD calculations match standard ecological diversity indices.
- Claim decomposition: The process of breaking LLM responses into atomic factual statements; needed to enable granular analysis of epistemic content. Quick check: Validate that decomposed claims maintain semantic integrity.
- Semantic clustering: Grouping semantically equivalent claims using embedding similarity; needed to identify unique versus redundant knowledge claims. Quick check: Test clustering threshold sensitivity on known claim sets.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Tokenizer -> Claim Decomposition -> Embedding Generation -> Semantic Clustering -> Diversity Calculation

**Critical Path:** Input text → Tokenizer → Atomic claims → Embedding model → Similarity matrix → Clusters → HSD calculation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Smaller models provide better diversity but less coherence; RAG improves diversity but adds latency and complexity; semantic clustering balances precision against recall in claim identification.

**Failure Signatures:** Over-clustering indicates loss of epistemic nuance; under-clustering suggests redundancy; low diversity scores may indicate knowledge collapse or model bias.

**First 3 Experiments:** 1) Compare diversity scores across different tokenization schemes, 2) Test clustering sensitivity to embedding dimension and similarity thresholds, 3) Validate HSD calculations against manual diversity assessments.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions beyond those addressed in the limitations section.

## Limitations
- The semantic clustering approach may not capture nuanced variations in meaning or context
- Focus on English language knowledge may not reflect epistemic diversity across different linguistic and cultural contexts
- The sample size of 27 models and 155 topics may limit generalizability to the broader LLM landscape

## Confidence
- High confidence: Newer models generate more diverse claims than older ones
- Medium confidence: Model size has a statistically significant negative impact on diversity
- Low confidence: RAG has a positive impact on epistemic diversity across all cultural contexts

## Next Checks
1. Expand the study to include a larger and more diverse sample of LLMs and topics, to improve generalizability
2. Develop and validate alternative metrics for measuring epistemic diversity that better capture nuances of natural language generation
3. Conduct cross-linguistic and cross-cultural validation of findings to assess methodology applicability in different contexts
