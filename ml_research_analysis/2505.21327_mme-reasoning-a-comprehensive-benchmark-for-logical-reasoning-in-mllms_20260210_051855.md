# MME-Reasoning: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Logical Reasoning in MLLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.21327
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21327
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive benchmark revealing significant MLLM performance limitations across logical reasoning types

## Executive Summary
MME-Reasoning introduces a novel benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models' logical reasoning capabilities across inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning types. The benchmark contains 1,188 carefully curated questions that minimize reliance on perceptual skills or domain knowledge, spanning three difficulty levels and diverse question formats. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs, the benchmark reveals pronounced performance imbalances across reasoning types, with abductive reasoning identified as a critical bottleneck. The findings demonstrate that while extended reasoning chains can improve performance, the benefits diminish with chain length, highlighting fundamental limitations in current MLLM reasoning architectures.

## Method Summary
The MME-Reasoning benchmark was constructed through a rigorous process of question generation and validation to ensure comprehensive coverage of logical reasoning types while minimizing confounding factors. The dataset includes 1,188 questions spanning inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning, carefully designed to avoid reliance on perceptual skills or domain-specific knowledge. Questions are organized across three difficulty levels and multiple formats including multiple-choice, binary-choice, and open-ended questions. The evaluation methodology employs a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art MLLMs including GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro-Vision, Claude-3-Opus, and others, with performance measured across all reasoning types and difficulty levels using standardized metrics.

## Key Results
- MLLMs show significant performance limitations across all logical reasoning types, with average accuracy far below human-level performance
- Pronounced performance imbalance exists across reasoning types, with abductive reasoning being the most challenging for MLLMs
- Extended reasoning chains improve performance but with diminishing returns, suggesting fundamental limitations in current reasoning architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to isolating logical reasoning capabilities by carefully designing questions that minimize reliance on perceptual skills and domain knowledge. This allows for more accurate assessment of pure reasoning abilities across different reasoning paradigms. The structured evaluation methodology, which tests MLLMs across multiple reasoning types, difficulty levels, and question formats, provides comprehensive insights into model performance limitations and architectural constraints.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal Reasoning Architecture**: Understanding how MLLMs integrate visual and textual information for reasoning tasks. Why needed: Essential for interpreting how models process multimodal inputs. Quick check: Can identify input processing pathways and integration mechanisms.

**Logical Reasoning Types**: Knowledge of inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning paradigms. Why needed: Critical for understanding the benchmark's evaluation framework. Quick check: Can distinguish between the three reasoning types and their applications.

**Benchmark Design Principles**: Understanding of how to create effective evaluation benchmarks. Why needed: Important for interpreting the methodology and generalizability of findings. Quick check: Can identify key design considerations for multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Visual Encoder -> Multimodal Fusion -> Reasoning Module -> Output Generator
- Visual Encoder processes image inputs
- Multimodal Fusion integrates visual and textual information
- Reasoning Module performs logical inference
- Output Generator produces final answers

**Critical Path**: Input Processing → Feature Extraction → Reasoning Chain → Answer Generation
- Question understanding and context establishment
- Visual information extraction and interpretation
- Logical inference and reasoning steps
- Answer formulation and verification

**Design Tradeoffs**: Performance vs. computational efficiency, reasoning depth vs. accuracy, generalization vs. specialization
- Longer reasoning chains improve accuracy but increase computational cost
- Specialized models may perform better on specific reasoning types but lack generalization
- Balance between perceptual skills and pure logical reasoning

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Inability to handle open-ended reasoning scenarios
- Performance degradation with increased reasoning complexity
- Pronounced weaknesses in abductive reasoning tasks
- Limited improvement from extended reasoning chains

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate model performance on each reasoning type independently to quantify type-specific capabilities
2. Test performance variation with reasoning chain length to validate diminishing returns hypothesis
3. Compare performance across different difficulty levels to establish learning curve characteristics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding the fundamental limitations of current MLLM architectures in handling complex logical reasoning tasks. These include questions about whether the observed performance bottlenecks are inherent to the reasoning tasks themselves or specific to current architectural designs, and whether fine-tuning on benchmark data can effectively improve performance across all reasoning types.

## Limitations

- Benchmark may not fully capture real-world multimodal reasoning challenges where perceptual and domain knowledge skills are intertwined
- Performance gap between MLLMs and human-level reasoning suggests benchmark may test capabilities beyond current model design scope
- Relationship between reasoning chain length and performance may be highly model-dependent and task-specific

## Confidence

- **Medium**: Claims about overall MLLM performance limitations across logical reasoning types
- **Medium**: Identification of abductive reasoning as a critical bottleneck for MLLMs
- **Low**: Assertion that extended reasoning chains consistently improve performance with diminishing returns
- **High**: Findings about reasoning type imbalances across diverse question formats

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies testing individual contributions of visual perception, language understanding, and reasoning components to isolate limiting factors in MLLM performance on MME-Reasoning tasks.

2. Evaluate human performance on the same benchmark tasks to establish baseline human reasoning capabilities and determine if difficulty gap is inherent to problems or specific to current MLLM architectures.

3. Test whether fine-tuning MLLMs on MME-Reasoning data improves performance across all reasoning types proportionally, or if certain reasoning types benefit more than others, validating identified bottleneck claims.
