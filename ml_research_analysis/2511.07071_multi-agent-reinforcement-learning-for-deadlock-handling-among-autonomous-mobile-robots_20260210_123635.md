# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Deadlock Handling among Autonomous Mobile Robots

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07071
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07071
- Reference count: 40
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) outperforms rule-based deadlock handling in complex, congested intralogistics environments when using centralized training with decentralized execution.

## Executive Summary
This dissertation addresses deadlock handling in intralogistics systems by integrating multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) into both planning and operational control. Traditional methods often neglect deadlocks during planning and rely on rigid control rules that cannot adapt to dynamic conditions. The work introduces structured methodologies and reference models for deadlock-capable multi-agent pathfinding problems, enabling systematic evaluation of MARL strategies. Through comparative analysis using grid-based environments and simulation software, the research demonstrates that MARL-based solutions, particularly those using centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), outperform rule-based methods in complex, congested environments while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

## Method Summary
The research develops reference models for deadlock-capable multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems in grid-based environments. Agents receive local observations (5x5 grid centered on agent, own position, goal position) and operate in discrete action spaces. The methodology employs MARL using PPO and IMPALA algorithms with Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) implemented in Ray RLlib 2.35.0. Training focuses on maximizing cumulative reward through success rates and timesteps to goal achievement, with reward structures that penalize collisions and reward goal completion.

## Key Results
- MARL-based strategies, particularly with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), outperform rule-based methods in complex, congested environments
- In simpler environments or those with ample spatial freedom, rule-based methods remain competitive due to lower computational demands
- MARL provides a flexible and scalable solution for deadlock handling in dynamic intralogistics scenarios, but requires careful tailoring to operational context
- Performance drops and increased variance occur when scaling from two to four agents, indicating scalability limitations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MARL enables autonomous agents to learn adaptive behaviors for deadlock resolution through experience rather than relying on predefined rules. The centralized training allows the critic network to access global information for better policy evaluation, while decentralized execution enables each agent to make independent decisions based on local observations. This combination is particularly effective in congested environments where traditional rule-based approaches struggle to handle complex interaction patterns and dynamic conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF)**: Finding collision-free paths for multiple agents simultaneously - needed to understand the core problem being solved, quick check: verify agents reach goals without collisions
- **Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE)**: Training with global information but executing with local observations - needed for balancing global coordination with local decision-making, quick check: confirm critic has access to global state during training
- **Grid-based observation spaces**: Fixed-radius local observations (5x5 grid) - needed to limit computational complexity while maintaining situational awareness, quick check: verify observation encoding matches specification
- **Reward shaping for deadlock handling**: Specific rewards for goal completion and collision penalties - needed to guide learning toward desired behaviors, quick check: confirm reward values match paper specifications

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Gymnasium Env -> RLlib Trainer (PPO/IMPALA) -> LSTM-based Policy Network -> Ray Cluster

**Critical Path**: Environment simulation → Agent observation collection → Centralized critic evaluation → Decentralized action selection → State transition and reward calculation

**Design Tradeoffs**: CTDE provides superior performance in complex scenarios but requires more computational resources and careful implementation compared to purely decentralized approaches

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Convergence issues with CTE/DTE modes indicate need for CTDE
- High variance in multi-agent coordination suggests scalability limitations
- Deadlocks during evaluation reveal insufficient reward shaping or observation space limitations

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement custom MultiAgentEnv in Gymnasium with 5x5 local grid observation and Discrete(5) action space
2. Configure PPO with CTDE architecture (64-neuron FC layers, 64-cell LSTM) and train on Reference Model 2.1
3. Compare CTDE performance against rule-based baseline in congested grid environments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: How can MARL-based deadlock handling methodologies be scaled to effectively manage large agent populations (beyond four agents) without significant performance degradation or variance?
- **Open Question 2**: Can MARL policies trained in grid-based environments effectively generalize to continuous-space scenarios with complex movement dynamics like continuous speed and turning?
- **Open Question 3**: How can Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) be integrated to ensure system stability and prevent performance degradation during long-term continual learning?

## Limitations
- The study focuses exclusively on grid-based environments with fixed observation radii, limiting generalizability to real-world continuous spaces
- Collision resolution mechanics and action masking implementation are not fully specified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- Scalability remains limited, with performance dropping significantly when increasing agent counts beyond four

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: CTDE consistently outperforms rule-based methods in congested environments
- **Medium confidence**: Rule-based methods remain competitive in simpler environments
- **Medium confidence**: Scalability limitations are observed but not thoroughly explored for larger agent populations

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the action masking logic to ensure illegal moves are prevented rather than penalized, verifying consistency with the stated reward structure
2. Evaluate the model in a non-grid, continuous-space environment to assess generalizability to real-world logistics systems
3. Benchmark computational overhead of CTDE against rule-based methods in large-scale scenarios to validate scalability claims
