# Synchronizing Process Model and Event Abstraction for Grounded Process Intelligence (Extended Version)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.23536
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23536
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Formal framework and concrete method for synchronizing model and event abstraction, proving isomorphic rediscoverability under specific log restrictions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of synchronizing model abstraction (MA) and event abstraction (EA) in process intelligence projects. When discovering process models from event data and then abstracting them to reduce complexity, the underlying event logs are typically not abstracted accordingly, resulting in a loss of grounding in real-world behavior and restricting downstream analysis insights. The authors propose a formal framework for synchronized model and event abstraction, proving that abstracting a process model by MA and discovering a process model from an abstracted event log yields equivalent process models.

The core approach involves two steps: first, ea1_bpa constructs a preliminary abstracted event log by abstracting concrete events into abstract events and removing events in choice relations; second, ea2_bpa transposes events to ensure correct ordering relative to a reference minimal df-complete event log. The synchronization is proven correct under specific restrictions on event logs and model structures. This enables process intelligence tasks like simulation and prediction to be grounded in real-world behavior while operating on abstracted models, providing flexibility and maintaining important distributional properties of the original event data.

## Method Summary
The method establishes synchronized model and event abstraction by proving isomorphic rediscoverability between abstracted process trees and models discovered from correspondingly abstracted event logs. The approach uses behavioral profile abstraction (BPA) as a non-order-preserving MA technique, resulting in a novel EA technique called eabpa. The pipeline involves discovering a process tree M from a restricted event log L using the Inductive Miner, abstracting M to Ma via mabpa using behavioral profiles and modular decomposition, generating a reference minimal df-complete log La for Ma using ntl, and transforming L into an abstracted log Lr that preserves df-completeness through two-step EA (ea1_bpa and ea2_bpa). The synchronization theorem proves that pd_IM(La) is isomorphic to mabpa(pd_IM(L)) when L is restricted and mabpa is applicable to M.

## Key Results
- Proves that abstracting a process model by MA and discovering a process model from an abstracted event log yields equivalent process models
- Develops eabpa as a concrete synchronization method based on behavioral profile abstraction (BPA)
- Establishes that the abstracted process trees Ma are in class Ca (no duplicate activities, only self-loops) and are isomorphic rediscoverable by the Inductive Miner from df-complete logs
- Demonstrates that La ⊂ Lr = eabpa(L), ensuring df-completeness is preserved through the synchronization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Behavioral Profile-Based Model Abstraction (mabpa)
- Claim: Reduces process model complexity while preserving behavioral relations needed for downstream synchronization
- Mechanism: Computes behavioral profiles capturing strict order (ù), choice order (`), and parallel order (∥) relations between activities. Aggregates activities using a parameterized function agg: Aa → 2^A that maps abstract activities to sets of concrete activities. Synthesizes an abstracted process tree Ma via modular decomposition of the ordering relations graph, ensuring the abstracted profile maps to a valid tree structure
- Core assumption: The abstract behavioral profile's graph decomposes into non-primitive modules (AND-complete, XOR-complete, or linear), otherwise synthesis fails
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We prove the feasibility of our approach based on behavioral profile abstraction as non-order preserving MA technique, resulting in a novel EA technique."
  - [section 4.1]: Definition 3 specifies five conditions for mabpa applicability, including the modular decomposition tree containing no primitive modules (condition 2)
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus support—related work on process discovery and simulation exists but does not directly validate behavioral profile abstraction for synchronization
- Break condition: If the aggregation function agg creates conflicting ordering relations that yield primitive modules in the decomposition tree, mabpa returns ⊥ and synchronization is undefined

### Mechanism 2: Two-Step Event Abstraction (eabpa = ea1_bpa ∘ ea2_bpa)
- Claim: Transforms event logs to match abstracted model granularity while maintaining df-completeness required for isomorphic rediscovery
- Mechanism: **Step 1 (ea1_bpa)**: Iterates through each trace, substituting concrete events with their corresponding abstract events based on agg. Removes abstract events that are in choice relation with other activities in the same trace. Adds duplicate abstract events for self-loop patterns (∥x,x in profile). **Step 2 (ea2_bpa)**: Partitions both the preliminary abstracted log Ltmp and the reference minimal df-complete log La into equivalence classes modulo transposition (Kendall Tau Sequence Distance). Matches equivalence classes bijectively, splits traces evenly, and applies minimal transpositions to align ordering with reference traces
- Core assumption: The preliminary abstracted log Ltmp and reference log La have matching activity sets and compatible trace multiplicities; La is strictly smaller than Ltmp
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The core approach involves two steps: first, ea1_bpa constructs a preliminary abstracted event log... second, ea2_bpa transposes events to ensure correct ordering relative to a reference minimal df-complete event log."
  - [section 4.2, Lemma 8]: Proves existence of a matching between quotient sets Ltmp/∼ and La/∼, and that |Lclass_a| ≤ |Lclass_tmp| for matched equivalence classes
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus validation; related work on event abstraction exists but focuses on different goals (e.g., prediction accuracy rather than synchronization)
- Break condition: If the input log L is not restricted (Definition 5) or if mabpa is not applicable, the matching between quotient sets may fail or La may not be smaller than Ltmp, preventing well-defined abstraction

### Mechanism 3: Synchronization via Isomorphic Rediscoverability
- Claim: Abstracting a discovered model M via mabpa and discovering from the abstracted log La via eabpa yields isomorphic abstract models (pd_IM(La) ≅ mabpa(pd_IM(L)))
- Mechanism: Establishes that abstracted process trees Ma are in class Ca (no duplicate activities, only self-loops), and that process trees in Ca are isomorphic rediscoverable by the Inductive Miner from df-complete logs. The algorithm ntl generates minimal df-complete logs La for any Ma. Proves La ⊂ Lr = eabpa(L), ensuring df-completeness is preserved
- Core assumption: The process discovery algorithm is the Inductive Miner (IM) with specific fall-throughs (only "Strict Tau Loop" and "Empty Traces" allowed), and the input log L is restricted per Definition 5 (no loop cuts, specific model structure constraints)
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We prove that abstracting a process model by MA and discovering a process model from an abstracted event log yields equivalent process models."
  - [section 6.2, Theorem 1]: "If L is restricted and mabpa applicable to M = pd_IM(L), then pd_IM(La) discovered from La = eabpa(L, pd_IM, mabpa) is isomorphic to mabpa(pd(L))."
  - [corpus]: No corpus papers validate synchronization guarantees; related work focuses on discovery or abstraction independently
- Break condition: If the discovery algorithm uses loop cuts or fall-throughs other than "Strict Tau Loop," or if L contains structures violating Definition 5 (e.g., flower models, nested tau loops), rediscoverability fails and synchronization is undefined

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Behavioral Profiles and Ordering Relations**
  - Why needed here: Behavioral profiles abstract process behavior into strict order, choice order, and parallel order relations. These relations determine how activities can be aggregated and how abstracted models are synthesized
  - Quick check question: Given activities a, b, c with relations aùb, bùc, a∥c, what abstract structure emerges if agg(x) = {a, b, c}?

- Concept: **Directly-Follows Completeness and Isomorphic Rediscoverability**
  - Why needed here: The synchronization proof hinges on df-completeness ensuring the Inductive Miner can rediscover the original model structure from the abstracted log
  - Quick check question: If event log L and process tree M are df-complete, does L necessarily contain all traces in L(M)? Why or why not?

- Concept: **Process Tree Classes (Cc, Ca) and Restrictions**
  - Why needed here: The proof restricts process trees to classes without duplicate activities and with only self-loops (not general loops). Understanding these constraints is essential for assessing applicability
  - Quick check question: Why does a flower model (loop over all activities) violate the restrictions for synchronization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Process Discovery (pd_IM) -> Model Abstraction (mabpa) -> Minimal Log Generation (ntl) -> Event Abstraction Step 1 (ea1_bpa) -> Event Abstraction Step 2 (ea2_bpa)
- Critical path: **Ensure input log L is restricted** -> Verify mabpa applicability -> Run ea1_bpa -> Run ea2_bpa -> Verify La ⊆ Lr (df-completeness) -> Use Lr and Ma for downstream tasks
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Non-order-preserving abstraction (BPA) allows flexible aggregation but requires restrictive log conditions (Definition 5) for synchronization
  - Transposition-based correction preserves event counts and distributions but may invalidate original timestamps; interpolation or flagging is required
  - Attribute aggregation (e.g., "last attribute," "even time split") is not formally validated; flexibility is preserved via "concrete" event attribute storage
- Failure signatures:
  - mabpa returns ⊥ -> Primitive module in decomposition -> agg or wt parameters create conflicting ordering relations
  - ea2_bpa matching fails -> L not restricted or activity sets mismatch -> Check Definition 5 compliance
  - Rediscovered model not isomorphic to Ma -> df-completeness lost -> Verify La ⊆ Lr via trace comparison
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Validate ntl correctness**: Generate minimal df-complete logs for process trees in Ca; verify trace counts and sizes match ntl algorithm output using simple trees (e.g., Ñ(a, b, c), ^(a, b), ö(x, τ))
  2. **Test eabpa on restricted synthetic logs**: Create logs from process trees in Cc, apply mabpa with various agg functions and wt values, run eabpa, and check pd_IM(La) ≅ Ma for each configuration
  3. **Stress-test synchronization boundaries**: Construct logs violating specific Definition 5 conditions (e.g., including flower models, nested loops, or "Activity Once Per Trace" fall-through triggers), run the pipeline, and document where synchronization breaks to map applicability limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The synchronization guarantees critically depend on strict log restrictions (Definition 5) that exclude common real-world process structures like flower models, nested tau loops, and concurrent activities
- The proof assumes the Inductive Miner with specific fall-throughs; alternative discovery algorithms or different fall-through configurations may break the isomorphic rediscoverability property
- The attribute aggregation strategy for transposed events remains informal and could impact downstream analysis validity

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mathematical framework for behavioral profile abstraction and its modular decomposition properties is well-established in the cited literature
- **Medium Confidence**: The two-step event abstraction (ea1_bpa and ea2_bpa) procedures are formally defined, but their practical performance on diverse real-world logs remains untested
- **Medium Confidence**: The synchronization theorem (Theorem 1) follows logically from the restricted assumptions, but these assumptions significantly limit applicability to idealized process structures

## Next Checks

1. **Boundary Analysis**: Systematically construct event logs violating each condition in Definition 5 (restricted logs) to map exactly where and why the synchronization breaks, documenting failure modes for each violation type
2. **Alternative Discovery Algorithms**: Test the synchronization pipeline using different process discovery algorithms (e.g., Alpha Miner, Heuristics Miner) and alternative Inductive Miner fall-through configurations to identify the minimal requirements for maintaining isomorphic rediscoverability
3. **Attribute Preservation Strategy**: Implement and validate multiple attribute aggregation strategies for transposed events (mean, median, last attribute, concrete storage) on synthetic logs with timestamped events, measuring impact on simulation and prediction accuracy
