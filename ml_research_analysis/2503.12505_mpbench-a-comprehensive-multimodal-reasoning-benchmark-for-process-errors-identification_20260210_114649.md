# MPBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark for Process Errors Identification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.12505
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12505
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces first comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating process-level reward models (PRMs)

## Executive Summary
MPBench presents a novel benchmark for evaluating process-level reward models in multimodal reasoning tasks. The benchmark addresses the critical need for comprehensive evaluation of PRMs across three key reasoning scenarios: step correctness, answer aggregation, and reasoning process search. With 9,745 fine-grained instances spanning science, mathematics, and commonsense domains, MPBench provides a standardized framework for assessing model performance in identifying process errors during reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The benchmark was constructed through systematic collection and annotation of reasoning processes across three distinct scenarios. For step correctness evaluation, models assess whether individual reasoning steps are valid. Answer aggregation tasks require models to combine multiple answers into coherent conclusions. Reasoning process search involves identifying optimal reasoning paths among multiple alternatives. The dataset was carefully curated to ensure diversity across domains and difficulty levels, with particular attention to multimodal inputs that combine text and visual information.

## Key Results
- Current models struggle significantly with reasoning process search and mathematical domains
- Model performance generally scales with size across all reasoning scenarios
- Positive correlations exist between different reasoning abilities
- Existing PRMs show notable performance gaps in handling complex multimodal reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MPBench works by providing a structured framework that isolates specific reasoning capabilities needed for effective process evaluation. By decomposing reasoning into distinct scenarios and evaluating them separately, the benchmark reveals granular insights about model capabilities that would be obscured in holistic assessments. The multimodal nature of the tasks ensures that models must integrate multiple information sources, making the evaluation more representative of real-world reasoning challenges.

## Foundational Learning

**Process-level reward modeling**: Why needed - to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps rather than just final answers; Quick check - can the model identify logical flaws in a single reasoning step?

**Multimodal integration**: Why needed - real-world reasoning often combines text and visual information; Quick check - can the model correctly interpret diagrams while processing textual explanations?

**Step-wise evaluation**: Why needed - understanding reasoning processes requires granular assessment; Quick check - can the model distinguish between valid and invalid intermediate conclusions?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Processing -> Scenario Classification -> Step Evaluation -> Aggregation -> Final Scoring

Critical path: Input Processing → Scenario Classification → Step Evaluation → Final Scoring

Design tradeoffs: Granularity vs. comprehensiveness - more fine-grained evaluation provides better insights but increases complexity

Failure signatures: Models fail most often on mathematical reasoning and process search tasks, suggesting limitations in handling abstract relationships and combinatorial reasoning

First experiments:
1. Test model performance on step correctness vs. answer aggregation to identify specific weakness patterns
2. Evaluate cross-domain generalization by testing models trained on science tasks on mathematics problems
3. Assess multimodal vs. unimodal performance to quantify the impact of visual information integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

The benchmark may not fully capture the diversity of real-world reasoning scenarios despite its comprehensive design. The evaluation relies on 12 MLLMs without clear articulation of model selection criteria or potential biases. The reported performance struggles in specific domains may reflect either genuine PRM limitations or potential biases in the benchmark design itself.

## Confidence

High confidence: MPBench is the first comprehensive multimodal benchmark for PRMs, and current models demonstrably struggle with multimodal PRM tasks.

Medium confidence: Model performance scaling with size and positive correlations between reasoning abilities are observed patterns requiring further investigation.

Low confidence: The conclusion about needing more robust PRMs for complex reasoning tasks requires additional real-world validation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on benchmark subsets to distinguish between design biases and genuine PRM limitations in reasoning process search and mathematical domains.

2. Expand evaluation to include specialized PRMs and smaller models to better understand architecture-size-performance relationships.

3. Apply MPBench to real-world reasoning tasks and compare results with human expert evaluations to assess ecological validity.
