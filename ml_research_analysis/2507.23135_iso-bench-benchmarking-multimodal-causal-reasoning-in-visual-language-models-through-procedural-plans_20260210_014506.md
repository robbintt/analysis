# ISO-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Causal Reasoning in Visual-Language Models through Procedural Plans

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.23135
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23135
- **Reference count**: 24
- **Primary result**: Vision-language models show significant gaps in multimodal causal reasoning, with best F1 scores around 0.57 compared to human performance of 0.98

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ISO-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether vision-language models can understand causal relationships across visual and textual procedural steps. The benchmark presents models with images of task steps paired with text snippets from instructional plans, requiring them to determine temporal ordering (before/after). Testing 10 state-of-the-art multimodal models reveals performance significantly below human capability, with best results at F1=0.57 in zero-shot settings. Chain-of-thought prompting provides only marginal improvement, highlighting a substantial gap in multimodal causal reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
ISO-Bench tests causal reasoning by presenting models with one image and two text snippets per sample, asking whether the visual step occurs before or after the textual steps. The benchmark covers three task categories: cooking, repair, and science experiments, with human performance serving as the upper bound at F1=0.98. Models are evaluated in zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting settings, using precision, recall, and F1-score as metrics. The evaluation includes 10 state-of-the-art multimodal models, revealing consistent underperformance across all tested approaches.

## Key Results
- Best-performing model achieved F1 score of 0.57 in zero-shot setting
- Chain-of-thought prompting improved performance only marginally (F1=0.59)
- Human performance benchmark reached F1=0.98
- All tested models showed significant gaps in multimodal causal reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark effectively isolates multimodal causal reasoning by requiring models to integrate visual and textual information for temporal ordering. By using real-world procedural tasks with clear causal relationships, it creates a realistic test of practical reasoning capabilities. The binary classification format simplifies evaluation while still capturing essential causal understanding. The controlled comparison between visual and textual information reveals specific limitations in how models process multimodal information for temporal reasoning.

## Foundational Learning

**Causal reasoning in multimodal systems** - Understanding temporal relationships between visual and textual information is fundamental for real-world task planning and execution. Models must learn to extract relevant features from both modalities and integrate them for coherent reasoning.

**Zero-shot vs. chain-of-thought prompting** - Comparing these approaches reveals whether models can perform reasoning without explicit guidance or benefit from step-by-step breakdown of tasks. This distinction helps identify whether failures stem from reasoning capability or prompt structure.

**Task decomposition and temporal ordering** - Procedural tasks require understanding how individual steps relate chronologically. Models must learn to identify dependencies and sequence information correctly across different modalities.

**Multimodal feature integration** - Effective causal reasoning requires combining visual features (objects, actions, spatial relationships) with textual information (instructions, context) into unified representations.

**Evaluation metrics for reasoning tasks** - Precision, recall, and F1-score provide quantitative measures of model performance, while comparison to human benchmarks establishes realistic performance expectations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input (Image + Text) -> Multimodal Encoder -> Temporal Reasoning Module -> Binary Classification

**Critical path**: The temporal reasoning module is the core component, as it must integrate multimodal features to determine causal relationships. Failures in this component directly impact classification accuracy.

**Design tradeoffs**: The benchmark uses only two text snippets per image to maintain simplicity, but this may limit the complexity of reasoning required. Chain-of-thought prompting adds computational overhead with minimal performance gains.

**Failure signatures**: Models consistently misclassify temporal relationships, suggesting fundamental limitations in multimodal integration rather than specific architectural issues. Errors appear across all tested models and prompting strategies.

**First experiments**:
1. Test additional task categories to assess generalizability beyond cooking, repair, and science experiments
2. Implement fine-tuning on procedural planning data to determine if performance improves with task-specific training
3. Conduct error analysis to identify whether failures stem from visual understanding, textual comprehension, or temporal reasoning limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark covers only three task categories (cooking, repair, science experiments), limiting generalizability
- Evaluation focuses on zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting without exploring fine-tuning approaches
- Each test sample uses only two image-text pairs, potentially limiting complexity of causal reasoning required
- Human performance benchmark details about worker expertise and training are limited

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Current multimodal models perform significantly worse than humans on procedural causal reasoning tasks (F1: 0.57 vs 0.98)

**Medium confidence**: Chain-of-thought prompting provides minimal improvement, though results may vary with different prompting strategies

**Low confidence**: Broader claims about real-world applicability without testing on more diverse task domains

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on a wider range of procedural tasks beyond cooking, repair, and science experiments to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate whether fine-tuning or instruction-tuning on procedural planning data improves model performance
3. Analyze error patterns to determine if failures stem from visual understanding, textual comprehension, or temporal reasoning limitations
