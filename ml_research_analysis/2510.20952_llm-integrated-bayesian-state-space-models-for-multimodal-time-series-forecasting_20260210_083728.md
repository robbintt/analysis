# LLM-Integrated Bayesian State Space Models for Multimodal Time-Series Forecasting
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20952
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20952
- Reference count: 40
- Previous state-of-the-art improved by 13.20% on average

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LBS, a novel architecture for multimodal time-series forecasting that integrates a Bayesian state space model with a pretrained large language model (LLM). LBS addresses two key challenges: (1) using an LLM to encode textual observations into a compressed summary for posterior state estimation, and (2) using the same LLM to generate text conditioned on latent states. The framework enables joint numeric and textual forecasting with principled uncertainty quantification and flexible prediction horizons. Evaluated on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark, LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% on average and generates coherent, temporally-grounded textual forecasts.

## Method Summary
LBS is a Bayesian state space model that incorporates a pretrained LLM for multimodal time-series forecasting. The model uses an LLM as both an encoder (to compress textual observations into latent states) and a decoder (to generate text from latent states). The architecture consists of a linear Gaussian state transition, an observation model that combines numerical and textual observations, and an emission model for generating predictions. The model is trained end-to-end using variational inference with stochastic gradient descent, leveraging reparameterization tricks for the Gaussian components. This integration allows for joint forecasting of both numerical and textual modalities while maintaining uncertainty quantification through the probabilistic state space framework.

## Key Results
- Improves previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% on average across evaluation metrics
- Generates coherent and temporally-grounded textual forecasts that align with numerical predictions
- Demonstrates robustness to long forecasting horizons and interpretable latent dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of LLM capabilities with Bayesian state space models enables principled handling of multimodal time-series data. The LLM provides rich semantic understanding of textual observations, compressing them into informative latent representations that capture temporal dependencies. The Bayesian framework then propagates these representations through time while maintaining uncertainty quantification. The decoder LLM generates contextually appropriate text conditioned on the latent states, ensuring textual forecasts are temporally coherent with numerical predictions. This tight coupling allows the model to leverage both the pattern recognition capabilities of state space models and the semantic understanding of LLMs.

## Foundational Learning
- Bayesian State Space Models: Probabilistic models for sequential data that maintain distributions over latent states; needed for principled uncertainty quantification in forecasting
- Variational Inference: Optimization technique for approximating intractable posterior distributions; needed to train the model efficiently
- Reparameterization Trick: Method for backpropagating through stochastic nodes; needed to enable end-to-end training with Gaussian distributions
- Text Encoding/Decoding: LLM-based compression and generation of textual information; needed to bridge the semantic gap between numerical states and textual observations
- Multimodal Forecasting: Joint prediction of multiple data types; needed to handle real-world scenarios where text and numbers co-occur

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: LLM Encoder -> Bayesian SSM -> LLM Decoder
Critical path: Textual observations → LLM encoding → Posterior state estimation → Latent state transition → Emission → Numerical and textual predictions
Design tradeoffs: Tightly coupling LLM and SSM enables semantic understanding but creates computational overhead; separate training vs. end-to-end learning affects optimization stability
Failure signatures: Poor textual forecast quality suggests LLM encoding issues; degraded numerical accuracy indicates SSM parameter problems; high uncertainty indicates model confidence issues
First experiments:
1. Validate numerical forecasting accuracy on a single time series without textual components
2. Test LLM encoding quality by comparing reconstructed text to original observations
3. Evaluate joint forecasting performance with simplified state transitions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- LLM dependency and scaling behavior may limit future improvements due to diminishing returns
- Benchmark scope may not generalize to other multimodal time-series domains
- Computational overhead could create deployment challenges for real-time applications

## Confidence
- LLM dependency and scaling behavior: High confidence
- Benchmark scope and generalization: Medium confidence
- Computational overhead and practical deployment: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain robustness testing: Evaluate LBS on at least two additional multimodal time-series datasets from different domains (e.g., healthcare monitoring with clinical notes, IoT sensor data with technician reports) to assess generalization beyond TextTimeCorpus.

2. Ablation study on LLM components: Systematically remove or replace the LLM components with simpler text encoders (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings) and forecast-specific language models to quantify the exact contribution of the pretrained LLM to overall performance.

3. Scalability and efficiency analysis: Conduct experiments measuring inference time, memory usage, and throughput across different model scales and hardware configurations to establish practical deployment constraints and identify potential optimization opportunities.
