core_contribution: This paper introduces a cognitive load framework to move beyond
  simple accuracy scoring and diagnose the true capability boundaries of tool-use
  agents. The framework decomposes task difficulty into intrinsic load (inherent structural
  complexity of the solution path, formalized via a Tool Interaction Graph) and extraneous
  load (difficulty from ambiguous task presentation).

# Beyond Accuracy: A Cognitive Load Framework for Mapping the Capability Boundaries of Tool-use Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20412
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20412
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Introduces cognitive load framework to map capability boundaries of tool-use agents

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitation of accuracy-based evaluation for tool-use agents by introducing a cognitive load framework that decomposes task difficulty into intrinsic load (inherent structural complexity of the solution path) and extraneous load (difficulty from ambiguous task presentation). The framework enables precise diagnosis of an agent's capability boundaries rather than just overall performance scores. A parametrically-controlled benchmark, ToolLoad-Bench, was constructed to systematically probe model limits across varying cognitive loads. The framework's predictions were validated to be highly calibrated with empirical results, establishing a principled methodology for understanding agent limits.

## Method Summary
The framework introduces a cognitive load decomposition where intrinsic load is formalized via a Tool Interaction Graph representing the inherent structural complexity of the solution path, while extraneous load captures difficulty from ambiguous task presentation. The ToolLoad-Bench benchmark was parametrically controlled to vary both types of cognitive load independently, allowing systematic probing of model performance across different complexity dimensions. Leading models were evaluated on this benchmark to reveal distinct performance cliffs as cognitive load increases, enabling precise mapping of each agent's capability boundary. The xLAM2-32B model achieved the highest accuracy (78.8%) and best resilience to complexity, while GPT-4o scored 68.0%.

## Key Results
- Cognitive load framework successfully maps capability boundaries rather than just measuring accuracy
- xLAM2-32B achieved highest accuracy (78.8%) and best resilience to complexity
- GPT-4o scored 68.0% on the benchmark
- Framework predictions were highly calibrated with empirical results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing task difficulty into two independent components that affect agent performance differently. Intrinsic load represents the fundamental complexity of the solution path through the available tools, which can be formalized using a Tool Interaction Graph that captures the structural dependencies between tool calls. Extraneous load represents the cognitive burden imposed by ambiguous or unclear task descriptions that force agents to spend additional resources on understanding requirements rather than execution. By controlling these factors parametrically, the framework isolates the specific types of complexity that cause agent failures, revealing true capability boundaries rather than conflating different failure modes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Separates intrinsic load (task complexity) from extraneous load (presentation difficulty) to understand performance limits
  - Why needed: Accuracy alone cannot diagnose whether failures stem from task complexity or presentation issues
  - Quick check: Verify that performance drops correlate with increased load values rather than absolute task difficulty

- **Tool Interaction Graph**: Formalizes solution path complexity by modeling dependencies between tool calls
  - Why needed: Provides quantitative measure of intrinsic load that captures structural complexity
  - Quick check: Confirm graph metrics correlate with human judgments of task complexity

- **Parametric Benchmark Design**: Systematically varies cognitive load factors independently to isolate their effects
  - Why needed: Enables causal understanding of which complexity dimensions limit agent performance
  - Quick check: Ensure benchmark tasks cover sufficient diversity in both load dimensions

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Task → Tool Interaction Graph → Intrinsic Load Calculation → Extraneous Load Assessment → Benchmark Generation → Agent Evaluation → Performance Mapping
- **Critical path**: Tool Interaction Graph construction → Intrinsic load formalization → Extraneous load measurement → Benchmark parameterization → Agent capability boundary mapping
- **Design tradeoffs**: Manual Tool Interaction Graph construction enables precise control but introduces potential bias; parametric control enables systematic probing but may not capture all real-world complexities
- **Failure signatures**: Performance cliffs at specific load thresholds indicate capability boundaries; different failure patterns reveal whether intrinsic or extraneous load is the limiting factor
- **First experiments**:
  1. Apply framework to multi-step reasoning tasks outside tool-use domain
  2. Conduct ablation studies removing either intrinsic or extraneous load components
  3. Test with agents using different prompting strategies or tool interfaces

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond curated tool-use scenarios tested remains uncertain
- Assumes intrinsic and extraneous loads are independent and additive, which may not hold in all task structures
- Tool Interaction Graph formalism relies on manual construction which could introduce bias

## Confidence
- High confidence: Accuracy alone is insufficient for diagnosing agent capability boundaries
- Medium confidence: Specific cognitive load framework predictions and their alignment with empirical results within tested domain
- Low confidence: Universal applicability across different tool-use domains or to agents with different architectures

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to multi-step reasoning tasks outside the tool-use domain to test generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing either intrinsic or extraneous load components to verify their independent contributions
3. Test the framework with agents using different prompting strategies or tool interfaces to assess robustness to implementation variations
