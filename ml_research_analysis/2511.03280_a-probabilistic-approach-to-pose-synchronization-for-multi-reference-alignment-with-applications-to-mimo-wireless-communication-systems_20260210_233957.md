- Primary result: Novel probabilistic approach using relative poses for MIMO channel estimation that eliminates global symmetries and achieves lower reconstruction error than traditional methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the multi-reference alignment (MRA) problem in 5G NR MIMO systems by reformulating it using relative poses instead of absolute poses. The authors develop a probabilistic graphical model that models relative rotations between adjacent blocks in the time-frequency grid, eliminating global symmetry ambiguities that complicate traditional optimization approaches. The method incorporates cycle consistency constraints and introduces both direct estimation and iterative refinement algorithms that alternate between pose estimation and channel denoising.

## Method Summary
The core approach models relative rotations between adjacent PRG blocks as fundamental variables, using cycle consistency constraints to ensure valid absolute pose equivalence classes. The method employs a probabilistic graphical model where the joint distribution over channel matrices, precoding matrices (poses), and observations is factorized using relative rotations. The iterative refinement algorithm alternates between estimating relative rotations using current channel estimates and denoising the channel matrix using updated rotations. This bootstrapping process allows rotation estimates to become more accurate as the channel is denoised, and vice-versa.

## Key Results
- Iterative refinement algorithm achieves lowest MSE across experimental settings
- Method consistently outperforms pairwise alignment approaches
- Performance approaches that of ideal synchronization in 5G-like MIMO scenarios
- Significant computational savings through decentralized approach avoiding cubic scaling
- Lower reconstruction error across various SNRs and spatial correlation settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Reformulating multi-reference alignment using relative poses instead of absolute poses eliminates global symmetry ambiguities, enabling more direct optimization. The method models relative rotations $R_{ij} = P_i^{-1} P_j$ between adjacent PRG blocks as fundamental variables. Cycle consistency constraints ensure that relative pose assignments correspond to valid absolute pose equivalence classes, avoiding the need to arbitrarily fix a global reference frame which can cause convergence to local minima.

### Mechanism 2
Local synchronization on small subgraphs (triplets) can be combined to achieve global synchronization with lower computational cost than centralized methods. The time-frequency grid is divided into overlapping triplets of nodes. Local synchronization is performed within each triplet. The paper proves that if all 3-cycles in a planar mesh are cycle-consistent, the entire mesh is cycle-consistent, reducing complexity from $O(N^3)$ scaling.

### Mechanism 3
Iterative refinement alternating between relative pose estimation and signal denoising improves reconstruction accuracy over direct one-shot methods. The algorithm alternates between estimating relative rotations using current (denoised) channel estimates, then estimating the channel using updated rotations and noisy observations. This bootstrapping allows rotation estimates to become more accurate as the channel is denoised, and vice-versa.

## Foundational Learning

### Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs)
- Why needed here: The paper formulates the MRA problem using a structured PGM to define the joint probability distribution over channel matrices, precoding matrices (poses), and observations. Inference on this graph yields the algorithms.
- Quick check question: Can you explain how a factor graph represents conditional dependencies between random variables?

### Orthogonal Procrustes Problem
- Why needed here: A core step in the algorithm is finding an orthogonal matrix $R$ that maximizes $\langle R, X \rangle_F$, which is a direct application of the solution to the orthogonal Procrustes problem (via SVD).
- Quick check question: Given a matrix $X$, how do you find the orthogonal matrix $R$ that maximizes the Frobenius inner product $\langle R, X \rangle_F$?

### Matrix Normal Distribution
- Why needed here: The prior over channel matrices is modeled as a Matrix Normal distribution $MN(0, U, I)$, capturing spatial correlation across time-frequency blocks. The likelihood is also Gaussian.
- Quick check question: What are the sufficient statistics of a Matrix Normal distribution, and how does it differ from a multivariate Normal distribution over vectorized data?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
1. Data Input: Noisy observations $B_i$ from PRG blocks in a time-frequency grid
2. Triplet Decomposition: Grid partitioned into overlapping node triplets
3. Initial Rotation Estimator: Direct method using Frobenius inner products and SVD
4. Iterative Refinement Loop:
   - Channel Denoiser: Uses current rotations and observations to compute refined channel estimate
   - Rotation Refiner: Uses refined channel to update rotations via Orthogonal Procrustes
5. Aggregation: Estimates from overlapping triplets combined to form final global channel estimate

### Critical path:
The most critical path is the Iterative Refinement Loop. The quality of the final channel estimate depends heavily on the convergence of this alternating optimization. A poor initial rotation estimate can lead to suboptimal refinement.

### Design tradeoffs:
- Direct vs. Iterative: Direct method is faster but less accurate; iterative refinement is more accurate but has higher latency
- Triplet Size vs. Complexity: Larger subgraphs capture more global information but scale computation as $O(D^3)$ per subgraph
- Model Fidelity: Assumes rotation-invariant prior; deviation from modeled correlation structure may degrade performance

### Failure signatures:
- Non-convergence of Iterations: Reconstruction error does not decrease or oscillates
- Inconsistent Global Estimate: Different triplets provide conflicting local estimates
- High Latency: Iterative method runtime exceeds timing budgets for large grid sizes

### First 3 experiments:
1. Synthetic Data Reproduction: Implement direct estimation on small synthetic grid with known ground truth
2. Iterative Refinement Ablation: Run full iterative refinement and plot MSE after each iteration
3. Correlation Mismatch Test: Vary length_scale parameter of synthetic channel's spatial correlation and measure reconstruction error

## Next Checks
