core_contribution: This paper proposes a sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional
  positive-confidence (Pconf) classification, where only positive samples with confidence
  scores are available for training. The method incorporates convex (Lasso) and non-convex
  (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery in
  high-dimensional settings.

# Sparse classification with positive-confidence data in high dimensions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24443
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24443
- Authors: The Tien Mai; Mai Anh Nguyen; Trung Nghia Nguyen
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: Sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of sparse classification in high-dimensional settings where only positive samples with confidence scores are available for training. The authors develop a penalized estimation framework incorporating both convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to achieve sparse recovery while mitigating shrinkage bias. The method establishes theoretical bounds for estimation and prediction errors under restricted strong convexity conditions, demonstrating near minimax-optimal performance for sparse recovery.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach combines positive-confidence classification with sparse regularization techniques. The framework estimates model parameters by maximizing a modified likelihood function that incorporates confidence scores for positive samples while applying sparsity-inducing penalties. The method extends standard Pconf classification by integrating convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to improve feature selection and reduce shrinkage bias in high-dimensional settings. Theoretical analysis establishes error bounds for the L1-regularized estimator, while empirical evaluation demonstrates competitive performance against fully supervised methods in simulation studies.

## Key Results
- Establishes estimation and prediction error bounds for L1-regularized Pconf estimator under restricted strong convexity
- Demonstrates near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates for the proposed method
- Shows empirical performance comparable to fully supervised approaches in extensive simulations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the additional information provided by confidence scores for positive samples to improve estimation accuracy in high-dimensional settings. By incorporating sparsity-inducing penalties, the framework effectively identifies relevant features while maintaining computational tractability. The theoretical guarantees rely on restricted strong convexity conditions that ensure stable estimation despite the high-dimensional nature of the problem.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Positive-confidence classification** - Why needed: Enables learning from partially labeled data with confidence information; Quick check: Verify confidence scores are available only for positive samples
2. **Restricted strong convexity** - Why needed: Ensures stable estimation in high-dimensional settings; Quick check: Validate RSC conditions hold for the design matrix
3. **Non-convex penalties (SCAD, MCP)** - Why needed: Mitigate shrinkage bias compared to L1 penalty; Quick check: Compare feature selection performance across penalty types

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data preprocessing -> Penalized estimation -> Feature selection -> Prediction
Critical path: The estimation procedure follows the sequence of data preparation, parameter optimization with sparsity constraints, and model evaluation
Design tradeoffs: Convex penalties offer computational efficiency but may introduce shrinkage bias, while non-convex penalties reduce bias but increase computational complexity
Failure signatures: Poor performance when RSC conditions are violated, degraded accuracy with noisy confidence scores
First experiments:
1. Compare L1, SCAD, and MCP penalties on synthetic data with known sparsity patterns
2. Evaluate performance sensitivity to confidence score distribution
3. Test robustness to violations of RSC assumptions using correlated feature designs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes confidence scores available only for positive samples, limiting generalizability
- Relies on restricted strong convexity conditions that may be violated with highly correlated features
- Lacks validation on real-world Pconf datasets, relying solely on simulations

## Confidence
- Theoretical claims: High - Mathematical derivations follow established high-dimensional statistics frameworks
- Empirical performance claims: Medium - Comprehensive simulations but no real data validation
- Comparison with fully supervised methods: Medium - Simulation-based claims may not generalize to practical scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Apply the method to a real-world Pconf dataset (e.g., user engagement data with confidence scores) to assess practical performance
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on confidence score distribution and its impact on variable selection accuracy
3. Evaluate robustness to violations of restricted strong convexity assumption using highly correlated feature datasets
