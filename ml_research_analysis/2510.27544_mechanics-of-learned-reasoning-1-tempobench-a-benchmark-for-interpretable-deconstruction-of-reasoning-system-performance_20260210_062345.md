# Mechanics of Learned Reasoning 1: TempoBench, A Benchmark for Interpretable Deconstruction of Reasoning System Performance

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.27544
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27544
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** TempoBench reveals state-of-the-art LLMs achieve only 7.5% F1 on hard temporal causality tasks despite understanding HOA automata format.

## Executive Summary
TempoBench introduces the first formally grounded benchmark for evaluating temporal reasoning in large language models. By using reactive synthesis to generate complex systems specified in temporal logic, the benchmark isolates reasoning difficulty via controllable parameters like system size and transition density. Experiments reveal a stark performance gap between trace acceptance (TTE) and causal explanation (TCE) tasks, with models achieving only 7.5% F1 on the hardest TCE conditions. The work challenges assumptions about reasoning difficulty scaling and provides fine-grained insights into LLM reasoning limits through statistically rigorous analysis.

## Method Summary
TempoBench uses reactive synthesis to generate finite-state machines from LTL specifications, creating systems with controllable complexity parameters. Traces are generated through random walks, and causal ground truth is extracted using formal verification tools. Models are evaluated on two tasks: trace acceptance (TTE) requiring local transition simulation, and causal explanation (TCE) requiring counterfactual reasoning. Performance is measured via F1 scores at atomic proposition and timestep levels, with one-shot chain-of-thought prompting using JSON output format.

## Key Results
- Average F1 scores: 65.6% on normal TCE, only 7.5% on hard TCE
- TTE performance remains high (~60% F1 hard) while TCE degrades severely, suggesting gap between symbol mapping and causal reasoning
- Larger systems with more transitions can be easier due to denser state connections, challenging assumptions about reasoning difficulty scaling
- Converged precision/recall on TTE indicates models understand HOA format, implicating reasoning rather than parsing as the bottleneck

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Controllable synthesis parameters (system size, transition density, causal input count) correlate with reasoning difficulty.
- **Mechanism:** The benchmark generates finite-state machines from LTL specifications using reactive synthesis. By tuning synthesis parameters (e.g., HOA states, transition count), the pipeline controls automaton complexity. Higher complexity (more states, more transitions) generally increases reasoning difficulty, but more causal inputs can reduce it by providing denser causal structure.
- **Core assumption:** Difficulty can be meaningfully parametrized via structural features of the automaton and trace, and these features are independent enough to isolate effects.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "isolates reasoning difficulty via controllable parameters like system size and transition density"
  - [section 3.3] "TempoBench exposes five features that let us scale problem difficulty: effect depth... system states... transition count... causal inputs count... unique inputs in trace"
  - [section 5.2, SHAP analysis] "Features such as the number of states, transitions, and unique inputs emerge as key drivers of difficulty"
  - [corpus] Weak or missing. Corpus neighbors focus on physics/QA; none directly address LTL synthesis or causal feature parametrization for temporal reasoning.
- **Break condition:** If future work shows non-monotonic or highly interactive effects between features (e.g., transition density only matters at certain state sizes) that cannot be decoupled, the claimed isolation mechanism may not hold.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** TTE is easier than TCE, indicating a gap between symbol mapping and multi-step causal reasoning.
- **Mechanism:** TTE requires simulating the automaton and verifying trace acceptance (retrieval + local transition logic). TCE requires credit assignment: identifying the minimal set of past inputs necessary for a later effect (counterfactual reasoning over time). The performance gap (TCE hard F1 ~7.5% vs. TTE hard F1 ~61% TS) suggests models can handle local transition logic but struggle with longer-range dependencies and minimal-cause inference.
- **Core assumption:** The two tasks cleanly separate symbolic simulation from causal credit assignment.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "average F1 scores of 65.6% on normal TCE and only 7.5% on hard TCE"
  - [section 5.1, Table 1 & 3] TTE precision/recall ~60% (hard), TCE hard ~5–12%.
  - [section 5.1] "TCE-hard proves substantially more difficult than TCE-normal or either TTE variant"
  - [corpus] Weak or missing. No corpus paper explicitly contrasts trace simulation vs. causal explanation tasks.
- **Break condition:** If future analysis reveals that most TCE failures are due to misinterpretation of the effect specification rather than true causal reasoning failures, the claimed mechanism would be weakened.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** HOA format is well-understood by modern LLMs; poor TCE performance is not due to parsing issues.
- **Mechanism:** High precision and recall convergence on TTE indicates models correctly parse and apply state transitions in the HOA representation. If misunderstanding the format were the bottleneck, precision and recall would diverge (over- or under-prediction). Instead, performance is balanced, suggesting issues lie in reasoning, not representation.
- **Core assumption:** Converged precision/recall implies format comprehension rather than systematic bias.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5.1] "The high performance on TTE across both hard and normal conditions indicates that all of these models can understand the HOA format."
  - [section 5.2] "The convergence of precision and recall for the TTE task demonstrates that LLMs genuinely understand the HOA file format rather than struggling with parsing."
  - [corpus] Weak or missing. No corpus paper discusses HOA or automata-based prompting formats.
- **Break condition:** If future work shows that models succeed on TTE via memorized patterns rather than true automata simulation, or if TCE prompts require a more complex JSON structure than TTE, the "format is understood" claim may not fully explain the gap.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)**
  - **Why needed here:** TempoBench systems are generated from LTL specifications via reactive synthesis. Understanding operators like X (next), F (finally), G (always), and U (until) is necessary to interpret constraints and causal explanations.
  - **Quick check question:** Given the LTL formula G(p -> X q), what does it mean for a trace where p is true at time 0?

- **Concept: Finite-State Automata / Mealy Machines**
  - **Why needed here:** The core representation in TempoBench is a deterministic finite-state machine (HOA format) that maps inputs and current state to outputs and next state. Trace acceptance and causal reasoning both require following these transitions.
  - **Quick check question:** If an automaton is in state S and receives input I with transition S -[I]-> T, what is the next state?

- **Concept: Counterfactual Causality**
  - **Why needed here:** The TCE task asks for the minimal set of inputs such that, if removed or altered, the effect would not occur. This is counterfactual causal reasoning, not mere correlation.
  - **Quick check question:** If effect E occurs only when both A and B happen, but E also occurs when A happens alone (though B is present in the trace), which input is causally necessary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** TLSF specs (LTL) -> Reactive synthesis (ltlsynt from Spot) -> HOA automata -> Traces (HOAX) -> Causal ground truth (CORP) -> LLM API -> Predictions -> Evaluation harness
- **Critical path:**
  1. Synthesize HOA from TLSF within time budget (5 min limit in current setup)
  2. Generate valid traces via HOAX
  3. Compute causal ground truth via CORP for each effect in each trace
  4. Prompt LLM with automaton + trace; enforce JSON output
  5. Score predictions against ground truth
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Verifiability vs. realism: Formal synthesis ensures ground truth but may not capture all real-world messiness
  - Feature controllability vs. coverage: Focusing on five features enables clean analysis but may miss other difficulty factors (e.g., linguistic ambiguity)
  - One-shot prompting vs. fine-tuning: Current setup uses one-shot CoT; fine-tuning on TempoBench could improve performance but would reduce diagnostic clarity
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low F1(AP) with high variance: likely issues with understanding causal constraints
  - High F1(AP) but low F1(TS): partial credit on inputs but inability to resolve full temporal dependencies
  - Diverging precision/recall on TTE: likely parsing or format misunderstanding
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Feature ablation:** Vary one feature (e.g., transition count) while holding others constant to isolate its effect on F1 scores. Use SHAP or linear regression to quantify impact.
  2. **Prompt engineering for TCE:** Test multi-step chain-of-thought prompts that explicitly ask the model to generate counterfactual traces before identifying causes. Compare F1(TS) vs. baseline one-shot.
  3. **Cross-task transfer:** Train or fine-tune a smaller model on TTE data, then evaluate on TCE to see if symbol-mapping skills transfer to causal reasoning. This tests whether the observed gap is due to lack of transferable representations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can fine-tuning on TempoBench’s formally verified traces transfer to broader reasoning tasks requiring causal credit assignment?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "Future work would utilize TempoBench to generate training data for LLM reasoning agents, extending their temporal reasoning ability."
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper currently uses the benchmark solely for evaluation rather than training; the transferability of formal temporal logic training to general agentic workflows remains hypothetical.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A study demonstrating performance gains on non-temporal or real-world causal reasoning tasks after models are fine-tuned on TempoBench data.

- **Question:** Does optimization for multi-context tool coordination (MCP) degrade an LLM's ability to model large latent state spaces?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors hypothesize that Claude-3.5 outperforming Claude-4.5 on TCE tasks stems from newer models being "optimized for the multi-context protocol... prioritizing flexible tool and agent coordination over deep internal state modeling."
  - **Why unresolved:** This is a post-hoc hypothesis to explain the negative scaling observed in newer models; no ablation study isolates MCP training from reasoning capabilities.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis of model variants specifically ablated for tool-use training versus state-tracking performance on the TCE benchmark.

## Limitations
- Focus on formally specified systems may not capture real-world ambiguity and noise present in temporal reasoning tasks
- One-shot CoT prompting approach may not represent full potential of modern LLMs when fine-tuned or given more complex prompting strategies
- Controllable synthesis parameters, while enabling clean analysis, may not reflect all factors contributing to reasoning difficulty in practice

## Confidence
- **Mechanism 1 (Feature controllability):** Medium - correlation demonstrated but independence and monotonic effects need further validation
- **Mechanism 2 (TTE vs TCE gap):** High - substantial performance gap clearly demonstrated with supported interpretation
- **Mechanism 3 (HOA format understanding):** Medium - balanced precision/recall suggests comprehension but alternative explanations cannot be fully ruled out

## Next Checks
1. **Feature interaction analysis:** Conduct factorial experiment varying multiple synthesis parameters simultaneously to quantify interaction effects and test claimed isolation mechanism
2. **Prompt complexity scaling for TCE:** Systematically increase TCE prompt complexity to validate whether difficulty is due to reasoning complexity or prompt design limitations
3. **Transfer learning experiment:** Fine-tune model on TTE then evaluate on TCE to determine if symbol-mapping skills transfer to causal reasoning and quantify gap reduction
