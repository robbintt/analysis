core_contribution: Exchange-of-Perspective (EoP) is a novel prompting framework that
  enhances large language models' reasoning by exchanging perspectives across different

# Exchange of Perspective Prompting Enhances Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03573
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03573
- Authors: Lin Sun; Can Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: EoP framework achieves 3.6-7.7% accuracy improvements over PHP baseline across multiple benchmarks

## Executive Summary
Exchange-of-Perspective (EoP) is a novel prompting framework that enhances large language models' reasoning by exchanging perspectives across different definitions of a problem. Unlike traditional methods that rely on internal reasoning or iterative self-correction, EoP redefines the original question and dynamically incorporates external perspectives by iteratively exchanging answers for the same question presented with different definitions. This approach breaks the fixed mindset from any particular formulation of the question and leads to more robust and accurate results.

Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate EoP's effectiveness. The framework shows significant improvements across various LLMs and datasets, particularly excelling at complex reasoning tasks. EoP outperforms established baselines including CoT, PS, Least-to-Most, CP, and self-consistency methods, with the most substantial gains observed on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

## Method Summary
EoP operates by presenting the same problem through multiple different definitions or formulations, then iteratively exchanging answers between these perspectives. The framework takes a question, generates multiple alternative formulations of that question, solves each formulation separately, and then exchanges the solutions between different perspectives. This iterative process continues until convergence or a stopping criterion is met. The key innovation is that instead of relying on a single chain of thought or a fixed problem representation, EoP dynamically incorporates multiple viewpoints and synthesizes them to arrive at more robust solutions.

## Key Results
- With GPT-3.5-Turbo, EoP achieves a 3.6% improvement on AQuA (60.6% to 64.2%) over PHP baseline
- With GPT-4, EoP demonstrates a 7.7% overall accuracy enhancement on Math (53.9% to 61.6%)
- On OlympiadBench Maths with Qwen-2.5-72b, EoP shows a 3.5% improvement (43.5% to 47.0%)
- EoP particularly excels at complex reasoning tasks and shows greater improvements on more difficult challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The EoP framework works by breaking the fixed mindset that emerges when LLMs are presented with a single formulation of a problem. By exchanging perspectives, the model is forced to reconsider the problem from multiple angles, each potentially highlighting different aspects or requiring different reasoning approaches. This multi-perspective approach helps overcome the limitations of any single problem representation and allows the model to synthesize a more comprehensive understanding. The iterative exchange process enables the model to refine its understanding progressively, incorporating insights from different formulations to arrive at more robust solutions.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-perspective problem solving: Understanding how different formulations of the same problem can highlight different solution paths and reasoning strategies
- Iterative refinement in reasoning: The concept that solutions can be progressively improved by incorporating feedback from multiple attempts or viewpoints
- Chain-of-thought prompting limitations: Recognizing that single-perspective reasoning chains can become trapped in local optima or miss alternative solution approaches
- Why needed: Single-perspective approaches can miss alternative solution strategies and become trapped in suboptimal reasoning paths
- Quick check: Test whether EoP improves performance on problems where multiple solution strategies exist

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Question -> Multiple Formulations -> Individual Solutions -> Exchange Mechanism -> Synthesized Answer

Critical Path: The core workflow involves generating alternative problem formulations, solving each independently, exchanging answers between perspectives, and synthesizing a final answer through iterative refinement.

Design Tradeoffs: EoP trades increased computational cost (multiple prompt generations per problem) for improved accuracy and robustness. The framework must balance the number of perspectives to generate against diminishing returns and practical latency constraints.

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation may occur when perspective exchanges introduce conflicting information or when the synthesis mechanism fails to reconcile divergent answers. The method may also struggle when problem formulations are too dissimilar to enable meaningful exchange.

First Experiments:
1. Compare single exchange vs. multiple exchange iterations to determine optimal depth
2. Test different strategies for selecting which perspectives to exchange
3. Measure computational overhead vs. accuracy gains across different model sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational overhead from iterative perspective exchange process is substantial but not fully quantified
- Performance gains vary significantly across different model sizes and datasets
- Selection criteria for perspectives and stopping conditions are not fully specified
- Method's consistency across different reasoning domains shows variability

## Confidence
High Confidence: Core methodology is clearly described and reproducible with verifiable quantitative improvements
Medium Confidence: Claims about excelling at complex tasks supported by data but need more granular analysis
Low Confidence: Assertions about breaking "fixed mindset" and suitability for "deep understanding" are somewhat speculative

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies systematically removing components of the EoP framework to quantify contribution of each element
2. Measure and report computational overhead (token count and processing time) compared to baseline methods
3. Perform cross-dataset transfer experiments to evaluate generality of learned perspective-exchange capability
