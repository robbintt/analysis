# Implicit Updates for Average-Reward Temporal Difference Learning
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06149
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06149
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Average-reward TD(λ) is sensitive to step-size selection

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the step-size sensitivity problem in average-reward temporal difference learning by introducing implicit updates. The authors propose a method that automatically stabilizes learning across a wider range of step-sizes without increasing computational complexity. By using implicit fixed-point updates, the approach relaxes prior step-size conditions while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees under both constant and diminishing step-size schedules.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces average-reward implicit TD(λ), which replaces standard explicit updates with implicit fixed-point updates to solve for the next parameter estimate. This implicit formulation effectively regularizes the update direction, making it less sensitive to the choice of step-size. The method maintains O(d²) computational complexity while providing finite-time error bounds under more relaxed conditions than previous approaches. The key innovation lies in reformulating the update as a fixed-point equation that implicitly determines the learning direction.

## Key Results
- Implicit updates maintain low loss and stability across broad step-size ranges
- Outperforms standard average-reward TD(λ) in policy evaluation and control tasks
- Provides finite-time error bounds under both constant and diminishing step-size schedules
- Demonstrates effectiveness on MRP, Boyan chain, access-control queuing, and pendulum swing-up tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The implicit update mechanism works by solving a fixed-point equation at each iteration rather than directly applying the gradient estimate. This creates a self-regularizing effect where the update direction automatically adapts to the current parameter values and gradient magnitude. The fixed-point formulation effectively performs a form of natural gradient update without requiring explicit matrix inversions, which explains the computational efficiency claim.

## Foundational Learning
- Average-reward Markov decision processes: Why needed - provides the theoretical framework for the problem setting; Quick check - verify the policy evaluation objective matches standard formulations
- Temporal difference learning with eligibility traces: Why needed - forms the basis for the algorithm's update rule; Quick check - confirm λ ∈ [0,1] and trace decay behavior
- Implicit function theorem: Why needed - justifies the existence and uniqueness of implicit updates; Quick check - verify smoothness conditions on the TD update operator
- Stochastic approximation theory: Why needed - provides convergence guarantees; Quick check - confirm standard assumptions (boundedness, martingale differences) hold
- Markov chain mixing conditions: Why needed - ensures ergodicity for averaging; Quick check - verify mixing time assumptions are reasonable for target applications

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: State features -> Eligibility traces -> TD error -> Implicit fixed-point solver -> Parameter update -> Policy evaluation
Critical path: Feature extraction → Eligibility trace computation → TD error calculation → Implicit update solution → Parameter update
Design tradeoffs: The implicit formulation trades off computational complexity of solving fixed-point equations against improved stability across step-sizes
Failure signatures: Poor convergence with small step-sizes, numerical instability in fixed-point solver, violation of mixing assumptions
First experiments: 1) Verify implicit update reduces to standard TD when step-size → 0, 2) Test convergence speed vs standard TD across step-size grid, 3) Validate computational complexity remains O(d²) empirically

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Empirical evaluation relies on synthetic or simplified environments rather than complex real-world applications
- Computational complexity claims need verification in practical implementations due to potential hidden costs in numerical fixed-point solving
- Theoretical analysis assumes specific Markov chain mixing conditions that may not hold in all practical scenarios

## Confidence
High: Core stability claims supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results
Medium: Computational efficiency claims pending implementation validation
Medium: Applicability to high-dimensional real-world domains remains unproven

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on high-dimensional continuous control tasks from real-world applications
2. Benchmark actual wall-clock time and memory usage against standard methods across different problem sizes
3. Investigate sensitivity to the implicit update tolerance parameter ε and its impact on both convergence and computational cost
