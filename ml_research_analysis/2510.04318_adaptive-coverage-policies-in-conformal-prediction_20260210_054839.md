# Adaptive Coverage Policies in Conformal Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04318
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04318
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Achieves prediction sets with average size 1.30 vs 1.42 for fixed-α approaches on CIFAR-10 while maintaining valid marginal coverage

## Executive Summary
Traditional conformal prediction requires a fixed coverage level, leading to overly conservative or uninformative prediction sets. This paper proposes an adaptive approach using e-values and post-hoc conformal inference that allows data-dependent coverage levels while maintaining valid statistical guarantees. The method trains a neural network to predict sample-specific coverage levels that minimize prediction set size, demonstrated on CIFAR-10 classification where it achieves significant size reductions while preserving validity.

## Method Summary
The authors develop an adaptive conformal prediction framework where coverage level α varies per sample. They use e-values and post-hoc conformal inference to maintain valid marginal coverage guarantees. A coverage policy network is trained using leave-one-out cross-validation on a calibration set to predict optimal coverage levels that minimize prediction set size. The approach involves training an EfficientNet-B0 classifier, computing cross-entropy scores, and optimizing a coverage policy network with a combination of expected set size and coverage loss. The method is evaluated on CIFAR-10, showing prediction sets with average size 1.30 compared to 1.42 for fixed-α approaches.

## Key Results
- Prediction sets with average size 1.30 vs 1.42 for fixed-α approaches on CIFAR-10
- Maintains valid marginal coverage guarantees through e-value framework
- Leave-one-out average set size consistently estimates expected test-time size at rate 1/√n
- Significant improvement in set informativeness while preserving statistical validity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by allowing each sample to have its own coverage level α, which can be higher for difficult samples and lower for easy ones. This is enabled through the e-value framework, which provides a way to combine multiple coverage levels while maintaining overall validity. The leave-one-out training procedure ensures that the coverage policy generalizes well to new data by using the calibration set as both training data and evaluation data in a cross-validation manner.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal prediction basics**: Understanding how to construct valid prediction sets from score functions. Why needed: Core methodology being adapted. Quick check: Can implement basic fixed-α conformal prediction.
- **E-values and post-hoc inference**: Mathematical framework for combining multiple p-values or coverage levels. Why needed: Enables adaptive coverage while preserving validity. Quick check: Can derive valid coverage from e-value construction.
- **Leave-one-out cross-validation**: Training procedure that uses n-1 points for calibration and 1 for testing, repeated for all points. Why needed: Ensures coverage policy generalizes to new data. Quick check: Can implement leave-one-out conformal sets correctly.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
EfficientNet-B0 -> Score function S(x,y) -> Coverage policy network -> Prediction sets

**Critical Path:**
1. Train base classifier on full training set
2. Compute scores on calibration set
3. Train coverage policy via leave-one-out on calibration set
4. Apply policy to test set for final predictions

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Adaptive coverage provides smaller sets but requires additional training
- Leave-one-out ensures generalization but increases computational cost
- E-value framework enables validity but adds mathematical complexity

**Failure Signatures:**
- Degenerate α̃→1 causing zero coverage (monitor mean α̃ during training)
- Leave-one-out size not tracking test-time size (verify calibration set size sufficiency)
- Network not converging (check initialization and loss landscape)

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement basic fixed-α conformal prediction to verify baseline functionality
2. Train coverage policy network with simple synthetic data to verify learning capability
3. Apply method to CIFAR-10 with small calibration set to verify end-to-end pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Several implementation details unspecified (network initialization, convergence criteria, data splits)
- Computational overhead from leave-one-out training procedure
- Performance depends on quality of calibration set and base classifier

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties:**
- Network initialization scheme for coverage policy (High uncertainty)
- Convergence criteria for training loop (High uncertainty)
- Exact data splits and augmentation procedures (Medium uncertainty)

**Confidence Assessment:**
- High confidence: Theoretical validity of marginal coverage guarantee
- Medium confidence: Empirical improvements on CIFAR-10
- Low confidence: Leave-one-out size estimation accuracy without full implementation details

## Next Checks

1. Implement multiple random initializations of the coverage policy network to assess sensitivity to initialization schemes
2. Systematically vary λ in the training loss to map out the coverage-size tradeoff curve and verify the bracketing algorithm correctly identifies optimal λ for target set sizes
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing leave-one-out average set size to actual test-time performance across different calibration set sizes (n < 100) to quantify estimation error rates
