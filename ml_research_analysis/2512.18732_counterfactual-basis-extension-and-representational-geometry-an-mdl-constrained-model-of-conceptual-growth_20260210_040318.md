# Counterfactual Basis Extension and Representational Geometry: An MDL-Constrained Model of Conceptual Growth

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18732
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18732
- Reference count: 2
- Primary result: Conceptual growth occurs only through MDL-selected basis extensions aligned with structured residual error; orthogonal extensions are rejected.

## Executive Summary
This paper formalizes conceptual growth as admissible basis extension selected by a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion, where new conceptual dimensions arise only through resolution of structured residual error. The central result shows that under MDL selection, any accepted basis extension must introduce novelty directions lying entirely within the residual span of prior experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are rejected. Internally generated counterfactuals influence learning only by enlarging or amplifying residual structure, not by introducing arbitrary novelty. The framework thus characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process, clarifying both the role and limits of imagination in learning and theory change.

## Method Summary
The method formalizes conceptual growth as admissible basis extension selected by a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Given a finite-dimensional Euclidean space of experience vectors u ∈ H and a current conceptual subspace C ⊆ H, the model projects experience onto C and computes residuals r_C(u) = u − Π_C u. New basis vectors are proposed from the residual span and accepted only if the reduction in residual error exceeds the complexity penalty λ·dim(S). The MDL objective L(S; D) = Σ_{u∈D} ℓ(‖u − Π_S u‖²) + λ·dim(S) serves as the selection criterion, where ℓ is nondecreasing. The core theoretical result proves that accepted extensions must lie entirely within the residual span W, while orthogonal extensions strictly increase description length and are rejected.

## Key Results
- Any accepted basis extension must introduce novelty directions lying entirely within the residual span of prior experience.
- Extensions orthogonal to the residual span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.
- Internally generated counterfactuals influence learning only by enlarging or amplifying residual structure, not by introducing arbitrary novelty.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Residual-Supported Basis Extension
New conceptual dimensions are admitted only if they align with the structured error (residuals) of the current representational space. The model projects experience vectors u onto a current conceptual subspace C. The difference between the experience and the projection is the residual r_C(u). Under the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, a new basis vector is accepted only if the reduction in residual error exceeds the complexity cost of adding that dimension. Learning is fundamentally a compression problem where representational complexity must be penalized against data fit.

### Mechanism 2: The Dual Pathways of Imagination (Counterfactuals)
Internally generated simulations (imagination) strictly influence learning by either expanding the geometry of detectable errors or amplifying the signal of existing errors. The paper formalizes two distinct modes: Directional Enrichment, where simulated data reveals new residual directions orthogonal to current concepts, and Threshold Amplification, where repeated simulation increases the magnitude of existing residuals until they cross the MDL acceptance threshold. Internal simulation produces vectors that are geometrically valid inputs for the residual calculation, indistinguishable from external data in terms of structural constraints.

### Mechanism 3: Orthogonal Rejection
Proposed dimensions that are orthogonal to the space of experienced errors are mathematically guaranteed to be rejected. An extension orthogonal to the residual span W cannot reduce the residual error term of the MDL objective because the projection onto the new dimension yields zero for all data points. Consequently, it adds only a complexity penalty, strictly increasing the total description length. The MDL objective L(S; D) is a reliable arbiter of conceptual validity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Orthogonal Projection & Residuals**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire theory relies on decomposing an input vector into a component the model understands (projection) and a component it fails to understand (residual).
  - **Quick check question:** Given a vector v and a subspace spanned by x, how do you calculate the portion of v that is unexplained by x?

- **Concept: Minimum Description Length (MDL)**
  - **Why needed here:** This serves as the selection pressure for the system. Without it, there is no principled reason to reject arbitrary or infinite basis expansions.
  - **Quick check question:** In the context of model selection, what two opposing forces does MDL seek to balance?

- **Concept: Vector Space Basis**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper equates "concepts" with "basis vectors." Understanding linear independence is required to grasp what it means to "extend" a conceptual space.
  - **Quick check question:** If you add a new vector to a basis set that is a linear combination of existing vectors, have you extended the basis? (Answer: No).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data In -> Project onto C -> Calc Residual r_C(u) -> Check Threshold (Σ⟨r_C(u), v*⟩² > λ) -> (If Pass) Update Basis C*

- **Critical path:** The system accepts a new concept if and only if Sum(Residual_Error^2) > Complexity_Penalty. The implementation flow is: Data In -> Project -> Calc Residual -> Check Threshold -> (If Pass) Update Basis.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Sensitivity vs. Stability:** A low complexity penalty λ allows for rapid conceptual growth but risks overfitting to noise. A high λ ensures stability but may miss subtle, valid concepts.
  - **Linearity:** The paper assumes linear subspaces for mathematical tractability. Real-world implementation might require kernel methods or deep non-linear projections to capture complex conceptual boundaries.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Stagnation:** The model never updates its basis despite anomalous data (likely λ is too high).
  - **Concept Proliferation:** The basis expands wildly with low-value dimensions (likely λ is too low or residuals are not properly normalized).
  - **Orthogonal Hallucination:** The system accepts dimensions that explain no variance (indicates a bug in the MDL optimization logic).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Orthogonal Rejection):** Feed the system data perfectly predicted by the initial basis. Verify that proposed orthogonal extensions are strictly rejected (Description Length increases).
  2. **Threshold Verification:** Generate synthetic data with a strong, single-dimension anomaly. Slowly increase the magnitude of this anomaly to verify the exact moment the system accepts the new dimension matches the theoretical λ threshold.
  3. **Imagination Injection:** Run the system on a dataset where the signal is weak (below threshold). Inject simulated "imagined" data points that align with the weak signal (Directional Enrichment) to verify it pushes the system to learn the concept where external data alone failed.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The mathematical framework is internally consistent but the link to empirical learning systems remains largely theoretical.
- The assumption that residuals encode meaningful structure (rather than random noise) is a foundational limitation—if real experience produces irreducible noise, the entire extension mechanism would stall.
- The treatment of imagination as a computational augmentation is logically sound within the formalism, but the psychological plausibility and implementation details remain underspecified.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The orthogonal rejection theorem and the residual-support requirement for accepted extensions are mathematically proven.
- **Medium Confidence:** The dual mechanisms of imagination are logically coherent extensions of the core MDL framework, but their distinct behavioral signatures in actual learning systems are not empirically validated.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that conceptual growth is "fundamentally" an error-driven, geometry-constrained process may overstate the framework's generality.

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Residual Structure Test:** Apply the framework to a benchmark dataset and measure whether basis extensions align with actual residual structure rather than random directions.
2. **Imagination Mechanism Dissection:** Design a controlled experiment where simulated data either reveals new residual directions or amplifies weak existing signals to verify the two pathways.
3. **Non-Linear Extension Probe:** Implement a kernelized or neural network version of the MDL basis extension to test whether core geometric constraints survive under non-linear transformations.
