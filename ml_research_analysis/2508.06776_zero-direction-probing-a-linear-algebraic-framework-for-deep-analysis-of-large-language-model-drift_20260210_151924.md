# Zero-Direction Probing: A Linear-Algebraic Framework for Deep Analysis of Large-Language-Model Drift

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.06776
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06776
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** Presents Zero-Direction Probing (ZDP), a framework for detecting LLM drift using only null directions of transformer activations without task labels.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Zero-Direction Probing (ZDP), a novel framework for detecting model drift in large language models by monitoring the right and left null spaces of layer activations. The core insight is that energy appearing in directions that were silent (null) in the base model serves as a direct indicator of representational change. The framework provides several probes including NVL (Null-Variance Leak), FNC (Fisher Null-Conservation), SNL (Spectral Null-Leakage), and BINA (Bidirectional Null-Adversary), along with theoretical guarantees and calibration-free thresholds derived from random matrix theory.

## Method Summary
ZDP monitors the right and left null spaces of transformer activation matrices $H_\ell$ to detect drift. The method computes null bases $V_{0,\ell} = \ker(H_\ell)$ and $U_{0,\ell} = \ker(H_\ell^\top)$ from base model activations, then measures "null leakage" - energy that appears in these previously silent directions in perturbed models. The framework includes several probes: NVL measures null-space variance, FNC checks Fisher Information Matrix conservation, SNL provides spectral analysis with calibration-free thresholds, and BINA enables bidirectional adversarial testing. An online null-space tracker using Oja's rule enables streaming updates, while ONAL (Online Null-Aligned LoRA) constrains fine-tuning updates to prevent null leakage.

## Key Results
- Variance-Leak Theorem showing null-space energy lower-bounds the smallest eigenvalue of perturbation Gram matrices
- Fisher Null-Conservation proving second-order KL divergence arises only from components outside the base image space
- Non-asymptotic tail bounds for Spectral Null-Leakage under Gaussian null assumptions, providing a-priori thresholds for drift detection
- Logarithmic-regret guarantee for online null-space trackers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The Variance-Leak Theorem (Theorem 1) allows for the detection of representational drift by showing that energy observed in a base model's right-null space directly lower-bounds the strength of the perturbation.
- **Mechanism:** For a layer activation matrix $H_\ell$, the right-null space $V_{0,\ell} = \ker(H_\ell)$ represents directions that produce zero activation. A perturbed model $\hat{H}_\ell$ is evaluated by measuring the Frobenius norm of its activations projected onto this null space: $\|\hat{H}_\ell V_{0,\ell}\|_F^2$. By the definition of the null space, this simplifies to $\|\Delta H_\ell V_{0,\ell}\|_F^2$. This value is shown to be bounded by the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the perturbation's local Gram matrix, providing a direct link between null-space energy and the magnitude of representational change.
- **Core assumption:** An accurate estimation of the base model's null space $V_{0,\ell}$, which depends on a reliable SVD truncation threshold (Assumption A1).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] Mentions "Variance–Leak Theorem" and "monitoring right/left null spaces."
  - [section 4.1] "Theorem 1 (Variance–Leak)... bounds hold: $k_\ell \lambda_{\min}(G) \le \text{NVL}_\ell \le k_\ell \lambda_{\max}(G)$."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence. Related work on LoRA-Null discusses constraining updates to null spaces during training, which supports the premise but not the specific detection theorem.
- **Break condition:** The mechanism fails if the base model's null space is inaccurately estimated, if the perturbation is structured such that $\Delta H_\ell V_{0,\ell} \approx 0$ despite significant drift in the image space, or if numerical instability corrupts the projector $V_{0,\ell} V_{0,\ell}^\top$.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The Fisher Null-Conservation theorem (Theorem 3) provides a theoretical guarantee that a model's second-order Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be isolated from perturbations confined to the null space.
- **Mechanism:** The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) of the base model, $F(h)$, characterizes the local curvature of the KL divergence. The theorem proves that if the FIM is "silent" on the right-null space ($F(h)V_{0,\ell} = 0$), then any parameter perturbation $\Delta\theta$ lying entirely within $\ker(H_\ell)$ contributes zero to the second-order KL divergence term. The framework uses the FNC probe, $\|F(h)V_{0,\ell}\|_F^2$, to confirm this condition.
- **Core assumption:** The base model's Fisher Information Matrix is silent on its right-null space ($F(h)V_{0,\ell} = 0$).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] States "Fisher Null-Conservation proving that second-order KL divergence arises only from components outside the base image space."
  - [section 4.2] Proof details how "perturbations confined to ker($H_\ell$) are second-order KL-silent."
  - [corpus] Related work "Fisher Alignment" aligns FIM modes but does not prove this specific conservation law.
- **Break condition:** The assumption that $F(h)V_{0,\ell} = 0$ may not hold in practice for all models or layers. The result is also only valid up to the second order; large perturbations could violate the Taylor expansion approximation, introducing higher-order KL terms.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Calibration-free thresholds for drift alarms can be derived from random matrix theory (RMT), eliminating the need for task-specific data.
- **Mechanism:** The Spectral Null-Leakage (SNL) metric is modeled under a "Gaussian null" hypothesis, where perturbed activations are treated as random Gaussian noise. Lemma 2 applies the Laurent-Massart tail bound to derive a non-asymptotic probability distribution for the Frobenius energy in the projected null space. This provides a direct formula to set an alarm threshold for a chosen false-positive rate $\alpha$, based only on matrix dimensions.
- **Core assumption:** The "no-drift" condition can be modeled as the perturbed activations being an i.i.d. Gaussian matrix, and the null-space basis $V_{0,\ell}$ is fixed and independent of this noise.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] Mentions "a-priori thresholds for drift under a Gaussian null model."
  - [section 4.3, Lemma 2] Provides the explicit "Gaussian projected Frobenius tails" inequality: $\Pr(\|XV\|_F^2 > \dots) \le e^{-x}$.
  - [corpus] Weak. The corpus mentions Fisher information but not the specific application of RMT for calibration-free drift thresholds.
- **Break condition:** This mechanism relies on the Gaussian null model assumption. It may produce incorrect thresholds for activations with heavy-tailed distributions or strong internal correlations not captured by the model.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Null Space of a Matrix ($\ker(M)$)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the central object of analysis. Understanding that $\ker(H_\ell)$ is the set of all input vectors that produce a zero activation is fundamental to grasping why any energy appearing there is a definitive sign of model change.
  - **Quick check question:** If $v \in \ker(H)$, what is the value of $Hv$? (Answer: The zero vector).

- **Concept: Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)**
  - **Why needed here:** The FIM connects linear algebraic changes to changes in the model's output probability distribution. It is key to understanding Mechanism 2 and why null-space perturbations can be KL-silent.
  - **Quick check question:** The FIM is the Hessian of what function approximating the KL divergence? (Answer: The second-order Taylor expansion).

- **Concept: Oja's Rule / Online Principal Component Analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** This underpins the Online Null-Space Tracker (ONT) algorithm. The tracker is an Oja-style iteration that updates an estimate of the null space from streaming data.
  - **Quick check question:** In an online update rule $v_{t+1} = v_t + \eta_t G_t v_t$, what is the role of the Gram matrix $G_t$? (Answer: It pulls the vector $v_t$ toward the dominant eigenvector of $G_t$, or pushes it away depending on the sign).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Null-Space Estimator -> Probe Evaluators (NVL, FNC, SNL, BINA) -> Online Null-Space Tracker (ONT) -> Online Null-Aligned LoRA (ONAL)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Collect a representative activation matrix $H_{\ell, \text{base}}$ for each target layer
  2. Compute an accurate initial null basis $V_{0,\ell}$ using a conservative SVD threshold
  3. For each new batch of data, calculate the SNL probe using the base null basis and the new activations
  4. Compare the SNL score to the threshold derived from Lemma 2. An alarm is triggered if it is exceeded

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **SVD Threshold (conservative vs. aggressive):** A conservative (high) threshold may underestimate the dimension of the true null space ($k_\ell$), missing drift in those directions. An aggressive (low) threshold may include near-zero but non-zero dimensions, leading to a higher false-positive rate
  - **Probe choice (NVL/SNL vs. FNC):** NVL/SNL use covariance geometry and are easier to compute. FNC uses information geometry and requires computing the FIM, which is more expensive but provides a direct link to KL divergence

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **No alarms despite model failure:** This suggests the perturbation is confined to the image space of $H_\ell$ or that the FIM is not null-silent on the null space. The null-space estimator may also be inaccurate
  - **Constant high alarms:** This indicates the base null space was poorly estimated or the activations have a heavy-tailed distribution, violating the Gaussian null model for threshold derivation

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validation of SNL Thresholds:** Generate synthetic Gaussian data with known dimensions ($n, d, k$). Compute SNL scores and verify that the false-positive rate matches the probability $\alpha$ used in Corollary 1's threshold
  2. **Drift Sensitivity Test:** Apply a small, controlled perturbation $\Delta H$ to a base model. Measure the SNL score and verify it increases monotonically with the perturbation's Frobenius norm
  3. **LoRA Null Leakage:** Fine-tune a model using standard LoRA and the proposed ONAL method. Compare the final SNL scores. The standard LoRA run should show higher leakage, while ONAL should maintain SNL near zero

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Attention-aware null spaces that couple token positions:** The current framework treats activation matrices as static linear maps, ignoring the dynamic, token-dependent masking inherent to attention mechanisms. This requires extending the theoretical framework to account for attention masks or proving that standard null-space estimates remain sufficient under specific attention sparsity conditions.

- **Multi-layer interaction—propagation of leakage through residual paths:** The paper analyzes drift at a per-layer level ($H_\ell$) but does not model how energy leaking into the null space of layer $\ell$ affects the representational geometry of layer $\ell+1$ via residual streams. This requires a theorem bounding the final-layer leakage in terms of per-layer SNL scores and residual connection weights.

- **Non-Gaussian null models (sub-Weibull/heavy-tailed activations):** The calibration-free thresholds derived from Lemma 2 rely on Gaussian (or sub-exponential) assumptions. For real transformer activations with heavy-tailed or strongly correlated distributions, the framework needs derivation of non-asymptotic tail bounds under sub-Weibull assumptions or empirical validation of threshold robustness.

## Limitations

- The framework's practical effectiveness depends critically on the accuracy of null-space estimation from finite samples, with no explicit guidance provided for setting the SVD truncation threshold ε or handling noisy singular value spectra
- The Gaussian null assumption underlying the calibration-free thresholds may not hold for real transformer activations with non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed, or strongly correlated distributions
- The Fisher Null-Conservation mechanism assumes the base model's FIM is exactly silent on the null space, an unproven assumption that could break down in practice

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The mathematical derivations connecting null-space energy to perturbation strength (Variance-Leak Theorem) and the RMT-based threshold derivation are rigorously proven under stated assumptions
- **Medium Confidence:** The Fisher Null-Conservation theorem's practical applicability depends on the unproven assumption about FIM structure. The online null-space tracking algorithm has logarithmic-regret guarantees but requires careful tuning of step sizes
- **Low Confidence:** The Gaussian null model's applicability to real transformer activations and the BINA probe's implementation details lack empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Calibration Validation:** Generate synthetic activation data with controlled Gaussian noise, compute SNL scores, and empirically verify that false-positive rates match the theoretical α used in Corollary 1 thresholds across multiple trials

2. **Perturbation Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically apply rank-1 and low-rank perturbations of varying magnitudes to a base model, measuring how SNL scores scale with perturbation Frobenius norm to confirm the variance-leak relationship

3. **FIM Silence Verification:** For a trained transformer, empirically measure the FNC probe on both base and perturbed models to determine whether the FIM is indeed null-silent on the base model's right-null space as assumed
