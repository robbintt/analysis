core_contribution: AdaMARP addresses the lack of immersion and adaptability in LLM
  role-playing by introducing an environment-aware message format that interleaves
  thought, action, environment, and speech, paired with a discrete-action Scene Manager
  for dynamic multi-character orchestration. To train these capabilities, the authors
  construct AdaRPSet for the Actor Model and AdaSMSet for the Scene Manager, along
  with AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation.

# AdaMARP: An Adaptive Multi-Agent Interaction Framework for General Immersive Role-Playing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.11007
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11007
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AdaMARP enables an 8B actor to outperform several commercial LLMs in immersive role-playing through environment-aware message formatting and a discrete-action Scene Manager.

## Executive Summary
AdaMARP addresses key limitations in LLM-based role-playing by introducing an adaptive framework that interleaves thought, action, environment, and speech in a unified message format. The framework employs a discrete-action Scene Manager to orchestrate multi-character interactions dynamically, improving both immersion and adaptability. To train and evaluate these capabilities, the authors construct specialized datasets (AdaRPSet, AdaSMSet) and an evaluation benchmark (AdaptiveBench). Empirical results demonstrate that AdaMARP consistently enhances character consistency, environmental grounding, and narrative coherence, with an 8B actor model outperforming several commercial LLMs, and the Scene Manager enabling smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions.

## Method Summary
AdaMARP introduces an environment-aware message format that interleaves thought, action, environment, and speech, allowing characters to reason about their surroundings and plan actions more coherently. A discrete-action Scene Manager orchestrates multi-character interactions, enabling dynamic scene transitions and role introductions. The framework is trained on AdaRPSet (for the actor model) and AdaSMSet (for the Scene Manager), with performance evaluated on AdaptiveBench. This design allows for improved character consistency, environmental grounding, and narrative coherence compared to baseline approaches, even when using smaller model sizes.

## Key Results
- AdaRPSet enables an 8B actor model to consistently outperform several commercial LLMs in character consistency, environmental grounding, and narrative coherence.
- AdaSMSet, trained with a 14B LLM, surpasses Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scene transition smoothness and natural role introductions.
- The environment-aware message format and discrete-action Scene Manager together drive significant improvements in immersion and adaptability in multi-character role-playing scenarios.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AdaMARP's interleaved message format (thought, action, environment, speech) allows characters to reason about their surroundings and plan actions more coherently, improving immersion and adaptability. The discrete-action Scene Manager orchestrates multi-character interactions dynamically, enabling smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions. By training on specialized datasets (AdaRPSet, AdaSMSet), the framework learns to maintain character consistency and environmental grounding, leading to better narrative coherence compared to baseline approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Environment-aware message formatting**: Enables characters to reason about their surroundings and plan actions more coherently; quick check: compare narrative coherence with and without environment context.
- **Discrete-action Scene Manager**: Facilitates dynamic orchestration of multi-character interactions; quick check: measure scene transition smoothness and role introduction naturalness.
- **Specialized training datasets (AdaRPSet, AdaSMSet)**: Provide targeted supervision for character consistency and scene management; quick check: evaluate improvements in character grounding and scene coherence after training.
- **Trajectory-level evaluation (AdaptiveBench)**: Assesses long-term immersion and narrative quality; quick check: compare trajectory-level metrics with turn-level metrics to detect superficial coherence.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: AdaMARP -> (Actor Model, Scene Manager) -> (AdaRPSet, AdaSMSet) -> AdaptiveBench

**Critical Path**: User input -> Actor Model (environment-aware message formatting) -> Scene Manager (discrete-action orchestration) -> Character response -> AdaptiveBench evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: AdaMARP prioritizes immersion and adaptability over raw model size, enabling smaller LLMs (8B, 14B) to outperform larger commercial models. The interleaved message format increases reasoning complexity but improves narrative coherence. The discrete-action Scene Manager adds orchestration overhead but enables smoother multi-character interactions.

**Failure Signatures**: If the Scene Manager fails to orchestrate characters, scene transitions become abrupt and role introductions feel forced. If the environment context is missing or inconsistent, characters lose grounding and narrative coherence degrades. Over-reliance on synthetic training data may limit generalization to diverse interactive storytelling scenarios.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Ablation study: Compare performance with and without environment-aware message formatting to isolate its contribution to immersion.
2. Scalability test: Evaluate Scene Manager performance with increasing numbers of concurrent characters (>5) and complex branching narratives.
3. User study: Compare user preference and cognitive load between AdaMARP's interleaved format and traditional turn-based role-playing.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited comparison to larger frontier models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5) that may still outperform AdaMARP despite its architectural advantages.
- AdaptiveBench evaluation has not been externally validated, raising questions about its sensitivity to true improvements in immersion versus superficial coherence.
- Scalability of the discrete-action Scene Manager to larger ensembles (>5 characters) and complex branching narratives remains untested.

## Confidence

**High**: Actor model performance improvements over smaller LLMs; Scene Manager's effectiveness in controlled multi-character settings.

**Medium**: Superiority over commercial LLMs (given limited model size); validity of AdaptiveBench as a comprehensive evaluation tool.

**Low**: Generalizability to highly dynamic, user-driven narratives; long-term immersion retention beyond short trajectories.

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark AdaMARP against frontier models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5) in both objective metrics and subjective user studies to confirm relative performance gains.
2. Conduct stress tests with >5 concurrent characters and complex branching plots to evaluate Scene Manager scalability and robustness.
3. Perform ablation studies isolating the contribution of each component (thought/action/environment/speech interleaving) to determine which elements most strongly drive immersion and coherence.
