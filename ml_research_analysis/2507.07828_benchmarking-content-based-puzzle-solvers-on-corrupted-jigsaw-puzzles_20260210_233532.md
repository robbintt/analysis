# Benchmarking Content-Based Puzzle Solvers on Corrupted Jigsaw Puzzles

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.07828
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07828
- **Reference count**: 19
- **Primary result**: Deep learning models significantly outperform heuristics in corrupted jigsaw puzzles

## Executive Summary
This paper benchmarks content-based jigsaw puzzle solvers on corrupted puzzles to evaluate their robustness for real-world applications. Three types of corruptions are introduced: missing pieces, eroded edges, and eroded contents. Five state-of-the-art solvers are tested: three heuristics (Gallagher, Paikin and Tal, Yu et al.) and two deep learning models (Transformer and Positional Diffusion). Results show that heuristic solvers perform well on standard puzzles but rapidly decline with corruption. Deep learning models, particularly Positional Diffusion, significantly improve through fine-tuning with augmented data and outperform heuristics in most corruption scenarios. Fine-tuned deep learning models demonstrate strong adaptability, with Positional Diffusion achieving the highest robustness.

## Method Summary
The study introduces three corruption types to standard jigsaw puzzles: missing pieces, eroded edges, and eroded contents. Five solvers are evaluated: three heuristic-based (Gallagher, Paikin and Tal, Yu et al.) and two deep learning models (Transformer and Positional Diffusion). The evaluation measures solver performance across varying corruption levels. Deep learning models are fine-tuned on augmented datasets containing corrupted puzzle instances. Performance is compared between baseline and fine-tuned models to assess improvement. The study systematically tests solver robustness across different corruption types and severity levels.

## Key Results
- Heuristic solvers perform well on standard puzzles but rapidly decline with corruption
- Positional Diffusion achieves highest robustness after fine-tuning with augmented data
- Fine-tuned deep learning models outperform heuristics in most corruption scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Content-based solvers rely on visual features and learned representations to match puzzle pieces. Heuristic solvers use predefined matching criteria that work well for clean puzzles but fail when visual information is corrupted. Deep learning models can learn robust feature representations that generalize better to corrupted inputs. Fine-tuning on augmented data allows deep learning models to adapt to specific corruption types, improving their robustness. Positional Diffusion, which incorporates both content and spatial information, shows superior performance in handling corrupted puzzles.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Jigsaw Puzzle Solving**: Understanding how algorithms reconstruct fragmented images from pieces. Needed to grasp the fundamental problem being solved. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between edge-based and content-based approaches?

2. **Corruption Types**: Missing pieces, eroded edges, and eroded contents represent different degradation scenarios. Needed to understand the evaluation framework. Quick check: What visual information is lost in each corruption type?

3. **Deep Learning Fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models to new data distributions. Needed to understand how models improve with augmented training. Quick check: How does fine-tuning differ from training from scratch?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Puzzle -> Solver (Heuristic/Deep Learning) -> Solution Output -> Performance Metrics

**Critical Path**: Image Preprocessing -> Piece Representation Extraction -> Piece Matching/Placement -> Assembly Validation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Heuristic solvers are computationally efficient but less robust to corruption. Deep learning models require more resources but show better generalization. Fine-tuning improves robustness but requires additional training data.

**Failure Signatures**: Heuristic solvers fail with missing visual information due to reliance on precise matching criteria. Deep learning models may misalign pieces when corruption obscures key features. Both approaches struggle with severe corruption levels.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test solvers on clean puzzles to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate solvers on single corruption type (missing pieces) at varying severity
3. Compare performance of fine-tuned vs. baseline deep learning models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Corruption types tested represent only a subset of potential real-world degradation scenarios
- Evaluation focuses on quantitative metrics without extensive qualitative analysis of failure modes
- Results may not generalize to other corruption types like color fading or lighting variations

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The comparative performance analysis between heuristic and deep learning solvers under corruption is robust, supported by comprehensive testing across multiple corruption types and solver configurations.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that deep learning models outperform heuristics in most corruption scenarios is supported by the data, but specific rankings may vary with different puzzle characteristics.

**Low Confidence**: The suggestion that hybrid approaches combining content and shape-based methods would be most effective for real-world applications is speculative, as this was not directly tested.

## Next Checks

1. Test solver performance on additional corruption types including color distortion, lighting variations, and non-rectangular piece shapes to assess generalization.

2. Conduct qualitative analysis of solver failure modes through case studies to better understand decision-making processes under corruption.

3. Implement and evaluate hybrid approaches combining content-based and shape-based methods to validate the proposed solution for real-world applications.
