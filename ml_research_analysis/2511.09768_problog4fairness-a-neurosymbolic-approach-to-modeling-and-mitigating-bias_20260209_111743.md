# ProbLog4Fairness: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Modeling and Mitigating Bias

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.09768
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09768
- **Reference count**: 22
- **Primary result**: Neurosymbolic method using ProbLog templates achieves significantly better fairness and accuracy than baseline methods by flexibly modeling bias assumptions rather than enforcing fixed fairness constraints.

## Executive Summary
ProbLog4Fairness introduces a neurosymbolic approach to modeling and mitigating algorithmic bias in machine learning systems. The method uses ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language, to formalize bias assumptions as programs describing probabilistic causal relationships. DeepProbLog extensions allow these bias models to be integrated into neural network training through distant supervision. The authors propose templates for expressing label, measurement, and historical bias mechanisms, and demonstrate the approach's flexibility across synthetic tabular datasets and real-world image and tabular data. The method achieves significantly better fairness and accuracy than baseline methods by flexibly modeling relevant bias assumptions rather than enforcing fixed fairness constraints.

## Method Summary
ProbLog4Fairness combines neural networks with probabilistic logic programs to model bias mechanisms during training. The approach uses DeepProbLog to compile bias logic (Label, Measurement, or Historical) into differentiable circuits, allowing gradient backpropagation from observed biased labels to update the neural network. The neural network predicts unbiased labels while the ProbLog layer models how bias affects the observed labels. Training uses distant supervision where the logic program is supervised only through observed biased labels, with bias parameters fixed or pre-estimated rather than learned jointly with the classifier. The method employs specific templates for different bias types, using probabilistic facts to model how sensitive attributes affect observed labels.

## Key Results
- ProbLog4Fairness outperforms baselines due to flexible modeling of relevant bias assumptions rather than enforcing fixed fairness constraints
- The approach achieves significantly better fairness metrics while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to traditional fairness-aware methods
- Method demonstrates robustness to imperfect bias parameter estimation, maintaining performance across a range of assumed bias values

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Gradient Propagation via Distant Supervision
If bias is formalized as a probabilistic logic program, a neural network can be trained to predict unbiased labels using only biased observations. The system uses DeepProbLog to compile the logic program into a differentiable circuit. The neural network predicts the probability of the "true" label, while the logic program defines the probability of the observed "biased" label given the network's prediction and the bias rules. The loss is calculated on the observed biased label, and gradients are backpropagated through the logic circuit to update the neural network to predict the true label.

### Mechanism 2: Explicit Bayesian Factorization via Templates
Defining bias via logic templates allows the model to distinguish between signal and bias based on assumed causal structure. The templates explicitly define conditional probability tables linking sensitive attributes, unbiased data, and biased data. By hard-coding this structure, the model forces the neural network to capture the residual probability (the unbiased labels) rather than capturing the spurious correlation with sensitive attributes.

### Mechanism 3: Flexibility over Fixed Constraints
Modeling the data generation process explicitly allows for higher accuracy than methods that enforce fixed mathematical fairness constraints. Standard methods often enforce fairness by "crippling" the model (ignoring features or penalizing disparities), which can harm accuracy. ProbLog4Fairness attempts to "recover" the unbiased ground truth, naturally satisfying fairness criteria regarding the unbiased labels without sacrificing predictive power.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Probabilistic Logic Programming (ProbLog)**
  - Why needed: This is the engine of the solution. You must understand how logic programs represent probability distributions to debug the bias templates.
  - Quick check: In ProbLog, does a rule `0.1 :: bias(X)` mean the rule is true 10% of the time, or the consequence has 10% probability given the body? (Answer: It acts as a probabilistic fact/rule with that specific probability).

- **Concept: Distant Supervision**
  - Why needed: The model is not trained on the ground truth (unbiased labels). You must understand how supervision signals are propagated from observed nodes to latent nodes in a computational graph.
  - Quick check: If the logic program says `BiasedLabel :- TrueLabel, NoError`, and we observe `BiasedLabel=True`, does this guarantee `TrueLabel=True`? (Answer: No, it only increases the likelihood/probability of `TrueLabel`).

- **Concept: Causal Graphs / Bayesian Networks**
  - Why needed: The paper maps bias mechanisms to specific graph structures. You need to be able to read these graphs to select the right ProbLog template.
  - Quick check: In a "Measurement Bias" graph, is the arrow pointing from the Feature to the Observed Feature, or vice versa? (Answer: Feature → Observed Feature).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Neural Network (h(X)) → ProbLog Layer (bias rules) → Observed Label (ỹ)
- **Critical path**:
  1. Define Template: Select Label, Measurement, or Historical bias logic based on domain knowledge
  2. Parameter Estimation: Estimate bias probabilities (β) from a small "golden" subset or literature (do not backprop into these)
  3. Forward Pass: NN predicts P(Y|X) → ProbLog calculates P(ỹ|X)
  4. Loss: Compare P(ỹ|X) with actual observed label ỹ
  5. Backward: Update NN weights; bias parameters remain fixed

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Interpretability vs. Convenience: Requires manually defining the bias logic (high effort/high interpretability) vs. using a black-box fairness regularizer
  - Parameter Sensitivity: The method is robust to small errors in bias probability estimation but requires a priori knowledge of bias direction

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Wrong Template: Using Label Bias templates when data has Measurement Bias prevents fairness improvement
  - Over-correction: Estimated bias probabilities too high cause over-compensation, reversing bias direction
  - Syntax Errors: ProbLog requires specific syntax which can break circuit compilation

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Sanity Check (Synthetic): Generate data with known β_label=0.3. Configure ProbLog with exact β. Verify NN learns unbiased function (Accuracy ≈ Upper Baseline).
  2. Ablation (Wrong Model): Run same synthetic data but use Measurement Bias template instead of Label Bias. Verify performance degradation.
  3. Robustness Check: Vary assumed bias parameter β̂ from 0.0 to 0.8 while true β=0.3. Plot accuracy drop to establish margin of error.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the bias parameters be learned jointly with the classifier without causing unidentifiability issues?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that when parameters are learned jointly, the optimal classifier becomes unidentifiable and this setting is out of scope.
- Why unresolved: Jointly learning bias model and classifier leads to a loss landscape where multiple solutions minimize loss equally, making fair outcome indistinguishable from unfair ones without external supervision.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified objective function or structural constraint guaranteeing unique, fair solution during end-to-end training, demonstrated through convergence analysis on synthetic data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the framework perform when modeling multiple, interacting bias mechanisms simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that Student dataset results are not as close to upper baseline likely because other biases are present that are not being accounted for.
- Why unresolved: While the method allows combining templates, experiments primarily isolate specific bias types rather than validating complex causal graphs with multiple overlapping bias mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on synthetic datasets containing known combinations of both label and measurement bias, showing combined ProbLog template recovers unbiased labels better than single-bias models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed templates be effectively generalized to handle continuous features and labels?
- Basis in paper: The methodology relies on probabilistic facts to flip binary or categorical values but does not define mechanism for continuous distortions common in regression tasks.
- Why unresolved: The logic-based mechanism currently operates on discrete state changes; continuous variables would require integrating density estimation or distributional logic predicates, increasing computational complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extension of probabilistic facts to support continuous distributions successfully mitigating bias in regression dataset with continuous sensitive attributes.

## Limitations
- Method requires accurate domain knowledge to select appropriate bias templates - incorrect assumptions about bias type will degrade performance
- Approach assumes bias mechanisms are static and well-defined, which may not hold in complex real-world scenarios
- While paper claims robustness to parameter estimation errors, practical margin of error for real-world deployment remains unclear

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core neurosymbolic mechanism combining probabilistic logic with neural networks is well-established through DeepProbLog
- **Medium confidence**: The specific bias templates and their effectiveness across different domains, based on results from synthetic and two real-world datasets
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to complex, multi-modal real-world scenarios with multiple interacting bias types not explicitly modeled

## Next Checks
1. **Template sensitivity analysis**: Systematically test all three bias templates (Label, Measurement, Historical) on the same dataset to quantify performance degradation when using incorrect templates
2. **Parameter estimation robustness**: Extend Figure 4 analysis to include more bias types and datasets, testing sensitivity across wider ranges of parameter estimation errors
3. **Multi-bias interaction test**: Design synthetic datasets with multiple simultaneous bias types to evaluate how the method handles interacting bias mechanisms
