# ShotFinder: Imagination-Driven Open-Domain Video Shot Retrieval via Web Search

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.23232
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23232
- **Reference count:** 32
- **Primary result:** Introduces ShotFinder benchmark and imagination-driven retrieval method; shows significant gap between model performance and human level, with color and style constraints remaining major challenges.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ShotFinder, a benchmark for open-domain video shot retrieval that evaluates models on finding specific video shots based on natural language descriptions with various constraints. The benchmark consists of 1,210 YouTube video shots across 20 topics, evaluated across five constraint dimensions (temporal, color, style, audio, resolution). The authors propose an imagination-driven retrieval method that uses video-imagination prompts to expand queries before web-based video retrieval and description-guided temporal localization. Experiments reveal that while temporal localization is relatively tractable, color and style constraints remain significant challenges, with model performance lagging substantially behind human baseline.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) Generator stage uses video-imagination prompting to expand shot descriptions into effective search queries, (2) Retriever stage uses web search APIs to find and download candidate videos, and (3) Localizer stage employs adaptive frame sampling with MLLM-based temporal grounding to identify matching frames. The approach specifically addresses the challenge of bridging shot-level descriptions to video-level search semantics through the imagination mechanism, which infers likely full video contexts from shot descriptions. Evaluation uses MLLM-assisted keyframe-based metrics rather than traditional CLIP similarity, as the authors found CLIP misaligned with human judgment on this task.

## Key Results
- Model performance shows significant gap to human baseline (88.5% average), with best model achieving only 51.8% average accuracy
- Temporal constraints are most tractable (77.3% best model), while color (15.7%) and style (32.5%) remain major challenges
- Increasing frame sampling density improves performance but with diminishing returns, especially for color and style constraints
- More search queries improve shot and style retrieval but increase latency; more candidates improve shot and audio but not resolution
- Error analysis reveals generator errors (wrong queries) and retriever failures (missing videos) as primary bottlenecks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Video imagination improves retrieval recall by bridging shot-level descriptions to video-level search semantics.
- Mechanism: The model is prompted to infer what type of complete video would contain a described shot (e.g., theme, genre), then generates search keywords from this imagined context rather than directly extracting terms from the shot description. This aligns queries with how videos are titled and tagged on platforms.
- Core assumption: Shot descriptions contain implicit signals about their source video context that LLMs can infer through reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "query expansion via video imagination"
  - [section 4.2]: "we guide the model to first infer what type of complete video the shot is most likely to appear in—i.e., we ask the model to 'imagine' the original video content"
  - [corpus]: Query Expansion survey (arXiv:2509.07794) provides general LLM-based QE mechanisms; MADTempo (arXiv:2512.12929) uses query augmentation for temporal video retrieval.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adaptive frame sampling maintains temporal coverage while respecting MLLM context limits.
- Mechanism: Videos are sampled based on duration: <3 minutes → 64 frames, 3–10 minutes → 128 frames, >10 minutes → 192 frames. This approximates temporal coverage proportionally without exceeding context windows.
- Core assumption: Uniform sampling captures key moments; critical events distribute roughly evenly across time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4]: "we employ an adaptive frame sampling strategy based on video duration"
  - [section 5.1]: Explicit sampling tiers for closed-source models.
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence for this specific strategy; Video Deep Research Benchmark (arXiv:2601.06943) addresses multi-frame reasoning but not sampling ratios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A staged pipeline isolates failure modes and enables targeted optimization.
- Mechanism: Generator → Retriever → Localizer → Verifier. Each stage has focused inputs/outputs; errors are categorized by stage (e.g., wrong queries, missing videos, mis-sampled frames, verification mismatches).
- Core assumption: Stage decomposition reduces compounding errors; each component can be improved independently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline"
  - [section 4.1]: "This staged design effectively combines shot-level descriptions with open-domain video retrieval."
  - [section G.2]: Detailed error taxonomy by stage.
  - [corpus]: Video Deep Research Benchmark (arXiv:2601.06943) similarly decomposes web-based video reasoning into iterative retrieval and verification stages.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Video Temporal Grounding**
  - Why needed here: The Localizer must identify precise moments within retrieved videos matching text descriptions. Unlike retrieval (finding videos), grounding finds timestamps.
  - Quick check question: Given a 5-minute video and the query "a person drops a glass," what output does temporal grounding produce?

- Concept: **Query Expansion in IR**
  - Why needed here: The Generator expands shot descriptions into effective search queries, addressing vocabulary mismatch between user descriptions and video metadata.
  - Quick check question: Why might the query "close-up of hands typing on keyboard" fail to retrieve relevant videos, and how could expansion help?

- Concept: **MLLM Evaluation vs. CLIP Similarity**
  - Why needed here: The paper found CLIP-based metrics misaligned with human judgment; MLLM-assisted evaluation better captures fine-grained constraints.
  - Quick check question: What types of visual-semantic mismatches would CLIP cosine similarity miss that an MLLM verifier might catch?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Generator**: MLLM with video-imagination prompt → outputs 2 search queries
  - **Retriever**: Search engine API → filters n accessible URLs → downloads videos
  - **Localizer**: MLLM with adaptive frame sampling + optional audio → temporal grounding
  - **Verifier**: Separate MLLM call → validates prediction against ground-truth frame

- Critical path: Description → Generator (imagination + keywords) → Retriever (URLs + downloads) → Localizer (frames + grounding) → Verifier (match decision)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More queries improve Shot and Style but increase latency (Fig 4A: 1×2 → 3×2)
  - More candidates improve Shot and Audio but with diminishing returns on Resolution (Fig 4B)
  - Denser sampling helps Shot and Temporal but limited gains on Color/Style (Fig 4C)
  - Single-factor constraints enable clear attribution but sacrifice real-world multi-constraint complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - **Generator**: Wrong/misleading queries → irrelevant candidate pool
  - **Retriever**: Accurate queries but no accessible or relevant videos returned
  - **Localizer**: Correct video but frame sampling misses key moment or MLLM misjudges

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablate imagination**: Compare video-imagination prompting vs. direct keyword extraction on retrieval recall.
  2. **Frame sampling sensitivity**: Test if Color/Style constraints require denser or content-aware sampling strategies.
  3. **Per-constraint error analysis**: Investigate why Color and Style underperform Temporal; analyze failure cases by stage.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can multi-factor constraint retrieval be effectively decomposed into single-factor stages, or does it require end-to-end optimization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Multi-constraint shot retrieval is a more complex constraint problem, which we regard as a future research direction. Currently, by breaking it down into single factors, we aim to establish a clear standard."
- Why unresolved: The single-factor design enables controlled attribution of errors, but real editing workflows require simultaneous constraint satisfaction. It is unclear whether sequential or joint constraint modeling would be more effective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Construct multi-factor constraint test splits and compare (1) cascaded single-factor models, (2) jointly-trained multi-factor models, and (3) human performance on the same combined constraints.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What architectural modifications would substantially improve MLLM performance on color and style constraints, which currently show the largest gaps to human performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes: "Color and visual style remain major challenges" and notes that increasing frame density alone is insufficient to resolve fine-grained visual attributes.
- Why unresolved: While temporal constraints are relatively tractable, color (15.7% best) and style (32.5% best) lag significantly. The paper does not investigate whether this stems from limited color/style vocabulary in pretraining, insufficient visual resolution, or inadequate fine-grained discrimination mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies with (1) color/style-specialized visual encoders, (2) augmented color/style vocabulary during instruction tuning, and (3) hierarchical visual feature extraction focused on low-level visual attributes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does multi-turn interactive refinement of search queries improve retrieval recall compared to the current single-turn imagination-based expansion?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The limitations section states: "For query generation, we employed single-turn interactions, but we aim to expand to multi-turn interactions in future iterations."
- Why unresolved: The current imagination-based approach generates queries once, which may miss relevant keywords or over-rely on incorrect hypotheses. Multi-turn refinement could correct initial errors but introduces latency and complexity tradeoffs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implement a multi-turn agent that refines queries based on initial retrieval results and measure (1) recall improvement, (2) query efficiency in terms of API calls, and (3) error propagation from early incorrect refinements.

## Limitations

- The paper relies on web search APIs without specifying which services were used or how query formulation was optimized for video content
- Adaptive frame sampling assumes uniform distribution of key events across video duration, which may not hold for structured or narrative content
- Evaluation relies on MLLM-assisted metrics, though potential alignment issues with human judgment remain despite validation efforts
- The benchmark focuses on single-constraint scenarios, leaving multi-constraint retrieval as future work

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The staged pipeline architecture and error attribution framework are well-defined and supported by systematic error analysis
- **Medium confidence**: The video imagination mechanism shows promise but lacks direct ablation studies comparing it against simpler keyword extraction baselines
- **Medium confidence**: The frame sampling strategy is plausible but not empirically validated against alternative sampling methods or content-aware approaches

## Next Checks

1. Conduct direct ablation experiments comparing video imagination prompting against standard query expansion techniques on retrieval recall rates.
2. Test alternative frame sampling strategies (content-aware vs uniform) specifically for color and style constraint tasks where current performance lags.
3. Implement a controlled reproduction using a small benchmark subset to verify the end-to-end pipeline functionality and identify practical implementation barriers.
