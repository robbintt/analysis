# SDQM: Synthetic Data Quality Metric for Object Detection Dataset Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06596
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06596
- Reference count: 40
- SDQM achieves r=0.87 correlation with mAP50, significantly outperforming existing metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SDQM (Synthetic Data Quality Metric), a novel evaluation metric designed to assess the quality of synthetic datasets for object detection tasks without requiring full model training. The metric combines multiple sub-metrics measuring pixel intensity, spatial distribution, bounding box characteristics, label overlap, and embedding space analysis, integrated using random forest regression to predict mean Average Precision scores. SDQM demonstrates strong correlation (r=0.87) with actual model performance, significantly outperforming existing metrics like MAUVE and generative precision/recall metrics which showed only moderate or weak correlations. The metric enables efficient evaluation of synthetic datasets while reducing computational costs and providing actionable insights for dataset improvement.

## Method Summary
SDQM evaluates synthetic dataset quality by calculating six sub-metrics: V-Information (measuring dataset learnability through entropy reduction), $\beta$-Recall (measuring coverage of real data modes), dataset separability (classification difficulty), pixel intensity match (Anderson-Darling test), bounding box match (Energy Distance), and spatial distribution (RMSE). These sub-metrics are extracted using a GroundingDINO-tiny feature extractor and combined through random forest regression to predict mAP50 scores. The method requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning for V-Information calculation, making it computationally efficient compared to full training convergence.

## Key Results
- SDQM achieves r=0.87 Pearson correlation with actual mAP50 scores
- Outperforms existing metrics: MAUVE (r=0.55), generative precision/recall (r=0.59)
- V-Information sub-metric shows strongest individual correlation with performance
- Validated across diverse datasets including RarePlanes, DIMO, and WASABI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Integrating sub-metrics capturing pixel, spatial, and embedding distributions provides a proxy for downstream object detection performance (mAP) without full training.
- **Mechanism:** SDQM calculates distances between real and synthetic distributions using Energy Distance and K-S Statistic. Random Forest regression learns the non-linear mapping between these distribution gaps and final model performance.
- **Core assumption:** Relationship between statistical distribution gaps and model generalization is consistent across different synthetic-to-real domain shifts.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions combining multiple sub-metrics to predict mAP scores; Section 3.3 states random forest regression best fits the data; corpus papers highlight difficulty of synthetic-to-real domain gap.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** V-Information serves as the strongest individual predictor of dataset quality by quantifying the "learnability" of the synthetic data.
- **Mechanism:** Measures reduction in predictive entropy from frozen backbone to lightly fine-tuned head relative to real data, estimating useful information content.
- **Core assumption:** 10-epoch training on synthetic data is sufficient to approximate information gain during full convergence.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.1 states V-Information exhibits strongest individual correlation with mAP50; describes using YOLOv11n trained for E=10 epochs; corpus emphasizes need for diverse scenarios in robotics.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Selection of domain-appropriate feature extractor is critical for embedding-based metrics to function correctly.
- **Mechanism:** Metric relies on feature vectors to compare distributions; if extractor doesn't align with downstream detector's representation, distribution similarity scores become uninformative.
- **Core assumption:** Feature space of chosen detector correlates with feature space of target model family.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.2 notes GroundingDINO-tiny achieved best performance in feature extraction; CLIP and DinoV2 performed worse on DIMO dataset; corpus implies domain randomization changes feature distributions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: V-Usable Information / V-Information**
  - **Why needed here:** Highest-weighted sub-metric quantifying dataset difficulty through model's prediction uncertainty decrease when given synthetic dataset access.
  - **Quick check question:** If a synthetic dataset lowers a model's loss on a real validation set after just a few epochs, does it have high or low V-Information?

- **Concept: Distribution Distance Metrics (e.g., Energy Distance, K-S Statistic)**
  - **Why needed here:** SDQM relies on these non-parametric tests to compare "shape" of synthetic vs. real data in pixel, bounding box, and label spaces.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might K-S Statistic be preferred over simple mean difference for comparing bounding box size distributions?

- **Concept: Generative Precision & Recall ($\alpha$-Precision, $\beta$-Recall)**
  - **Why needed here:** Distinguish between "fidelity" (realism) and "diversity" (coverage); SDQM uses $\beta$-Recall to ensure synthetic data covers modes of real data distribution.
  - **Quick check question:** If a synthetic dataset consists of 1,000 identical images of one car, would it have high Fidelity or high Diversity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Real & Synthetic Images + Annotations -> GroundingDINO-tiny Feature Extractor -> Sub-metric Calculators (V-Info Engine, Embedding Metrics, Statistical Metrics) -> Integration Layer (Random Forest Regressor) -> SDQM Score

- **Critical path:**
  1. Ensuring GroundingDINO-tiny is installed and text prompts configured correctly
  2. Running 10-epoch V-Information training loop (computational bottleneck)
  3. Aggregating distinct statistical test outputs into regressor input vector

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Cost vs. Accuracy: V-Information requires GPU time (10 epochs); pure statistical metrics are nearly free but less correlated with mAP
  - Extractor Generalization: GroundingDINO was best for tested datasets, but may require re-evaluation for medical or satellite imagery

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low Correlation: Check if "Real" reference dataset is too small or unrepresentative
  - High Variance: Random Forest overfitting to validation datasets; ensure K-fold cross-validation
  - V-Info Failure: If synthetic data is garbage, 10-epoch training might diverge or yield NaN losses

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Calculate SDQM for RarePlanes dataset subsets and verify correlation (r≈0.87) with local YOLOv11 training results
  2. Ablation Study: Remove V-Information component and re-run regression to quantify predictive power loss
  3. New Domain Test: Apply SDQM to custom synthetic dataset from simulator before full training to see if score predicts Sim2Real transfer gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper explicitly states this metric could be extended to similar tasks including instance segmentation, object localization, and image classification, though these extensions have not been validated.

## Limitations
- V-Information calculation requires 10 epochs of fine-tuning, adding computational overhead
- Feature extractor selection (GroundingDINO-tiny) may not generalize across all domains
- Random Forest regressor hyperparameters and evolutionary algorithm details remain underspecified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Correlation between SDQM and mAP (r=0.87) is well-supported by experimental results across multiple datasets
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that GroundingDINO-tiny is optimal feature extractor for diverse domains requires further validation beyond tested datasets
- **Low Confidence:** Exact mechanism of evolutionary algorithm for subset selection and Random Forest hyperparameter tuning are not fully detailed

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Domain Validation: Apply SDQM to synthetic dataset from new domain (e.g., medical imaging) and compare predictions with actual mAP scores to verify GroundingDINO-tiny remains best feature extractor
2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Conduct ablation study on Random Forest hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth) to determine impact on predictive accuracy
3. V-Information Robustness: Test whether increasing training epochs (e.g., to 20 or 30) improves SDQM's correlation with mAP for more complex synthetic datasets
