# Statsformer: Validated Ensemble Learning with LLM-Derived Semantic Priors

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.21410
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21410
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Validated ensemble framework incorporating LLM-derived semantic priors that provably outperforms any convex combination of base learners, with robust downweighting of uninformative priors.

## Executive Summary
Statsformer introduces a validated ensemble framework that incorporates large language model (LLM)-derived semantic priors into supervised statistical learning. The method embeds feature importance scores from an LLM into a diverse ensemble of linear and nonlinear learners through parameterized monotone transformations, such as penalty weights, feature scaling, or instance weighting. These priors are calibrated via out-of-fold stacking, allowing the data to determine their influence. Theoretical guarantees show that Statsformer performs no worse than any convex combination of its base learners, up to statistical error, ensuring robustness to unreliable priors.

Empirically, informative LLM priors yield consistent improvements across high-dimensional biomedical, financial, and web datasets, while uninformative or misspecified priors are automatically downweighted. Adversarial simulations confirm that Statsformer degrades to baseline performance when priors are inverted, supporting its robustness. The approach is computationally efficient, requiring only a single LLM call per dataset without iterative prompting or fine-tuning, making it scalable and practical.

## Method Summary
Statsformer embeds LLM-derived feature importance scores into ensemble learners via parameterized monotone transformations (penalty weights for Lasso, feature scaling for SVM, subsampling weights for XGBoost, instance weighting for RF). The method uses K-fold out-of-fold stacking to learn a convex combination of base learners, where the meta-learner is constrained to non-negative weights summing to one. This ensures Statsformer performs at least as well as any convex combination of base learners, up to statistical error. The LLM prior is elicited once per dataset using a single prompt, making the approach computationally efficient compared to iterative fine-tuning methods.

## Key Results
- **Theoretical guarantee:** Statsformer performs no worse than any convex combination of its base learners, up to statistical error
- **Robustness to uninformative priors:** Automatic downweighting verified through adversarial control (inverting priors degrades performance to baseline)
- **Consistent empirical gains:** 2-3% improvement in classification accuracy and regression MSE across biomedical, financial, and web datasets when using informative LLM priors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Statsformer works by transforming LLM-derived priors through parameterized monotone functions (α for transformation power, β for scaling) and injecting them into ensemble learners via task-specific mechanisms (penalty weights, feature scaling, instance weighting). The out-of-fold stacking meta-learner learns optimal convex weights, automatically downweighting uninformative or misspecified priors. The theoretical guarantee ensures no degradation compared to the best convex combination of base learners, providing a safety net against unreliable LLM outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Out-of-fold stacking meta-learning:** Combines base learner predictions while preventing overfitting; needed to validate prior usefulness; quick check: verify simplex constraints on meta-learner weights
- **Parameterized monotone transformations:** Allows systematic exploration of prior influence; needed to calibrate prior strength; quick check: test α∈{0,1,2} sweeps
- **LLM-based semantic feature extraction:** Leverages pre-trained knowledge for feature importance; needed to provide informative priors in low-sample regimes; quick check: verify prompt produces scores in [0.1, 1.0] range
- **Convex combination theory:** Guarantees no worse performance than best linear combination; needed for theoretical robustness; quick check: confirm meta-learner weights sum to one
- **Ensemble diversity:** Different base learners respond differently to priors; needed to maximize information extraction; quick check: compare performance across Lasso, XGBoost, RF, SVM
- **Feature importance calibration:** LLM scores must be interpretable as relative importance; needed for meaningful prior injection; quick check: validate scores are in consistent range across features

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** LLM prompt -> feature scores V -> parameterized transformation τ_α,β(V) -> base learners B with prior injection -> OOF predictions Z -> meta-learner π̂ -> refitted ensemble

**Critical Path:** LLM feature elicitation → transformation → ensemble fitting → OOF stacking → meta-learner selection → final refitting

**Design Tradeoffs:** Single LLM call vs iterative prompting (efficiency vs potentially better priors); diverse base learners vs computational cost; simplex constraints vs unrestricted meta-learner (robustness vs flexibility)

**Failure Signatures:** If Statsformer ≈ stacking baseline with no gains → verify transformation direction and check adversarial control; if OOF meta-learner produces zero weights → priors likely uninformative or poorly calibrated

**First Experiments:** 1) Run adversarial control by inverting priors (s←(s+ε)^(-1)) to confirm degradation to baseline; 2) Compare performance using smaller LLM models (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4) for prior elicitation; 3) Test scalability on high-dimensional genomic datasets (>10,000 features) to validate low-sample regime claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees rely on convex combination structure, which may not hold for highly correlated base learners or degenerate feature spaces
- Empirical validation primarily on UCI datasets with moderate sample sizes; performance on truly massive or streaming datasets remains untested
- LLM prior elicitation depends on prompt quality and model selection, introducing variability not fully characterized in the paper

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Theoretical guarantee of no degradation vs convex combination of base learners | High |
| Empirical improvements across diverse domains with informative priors | Medium |
| Robustness to uninformative priors (automatic downweighting verified via OOF meta-learning) | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Verify Statsformer performance degradation when priors are systematically inverted (adversarial control) to confirm automatic downweighting mechanism
2. Test scalability on high-dimensional genomic datasets (>10,000 features) to validate claims about LLM utility in low-sample regimes
3. Compare computational overhead and performance when using smaller LLM models (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4) for prior elicitation
