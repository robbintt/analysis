# MME-Reasoning: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Logical Reasoning in MLLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.21327
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21327
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: MME-Reasoning benchmark reveals significant performance limitations in multimodal large language models' logical reasoning abilities, with abductive reasoning identified as a key bottleneck

## Executive Summary
MME-Reasoning is a newly proposed benchmark designed to evaluate the logical reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across three reasoning types: inductive, deductive, and abductive. The benchmark contains 1,188 carefully curated questions that span three difficulty levels and diverse question formats while avoiding reliance on perceptual skills or domain knowledge. Evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant performance limitations and pronounced imbalances across reasoning types, with abductive reasoning showing particularly poor performance. The study also demonstrates that while extended reasoning chains can improve performance, the benefits diminish with increased chain length, highlighting the need for better planning and exploration capabilities in open-ended reasoning scenarios.

## Method Summary
The MME-Reasoning benchmark was developed through a comprehensive process involving two main phases: dataset collection and evaluation. The dataset collection phase focused on curating 1,188 multimodal logical reasoning questions across three reasoning types (inductive, deductive, and abductive) and three difficulty levels (basic, intermediate, and advanced). Questions were designed to avoid reliance on perceptual skills or domain knowledge, ensuring they tested pure logical reasoning abilities. The evaluation phase involved testing multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs on the benchmark, measuring performance across different reasoning types and difficulty levels, and analyzing the impact of reasoning chain length on performance outcomes.

## Key Results
- Abductive reasoning represents a significant bottleneck for MLLMs, with consistently poor performance across multiple model evaluations
- Extended reasoning chains improve performance but with diminishing returns, suggesting limits to chain-of-thought approaches
- The benchmark reveals pronounced imbalances in MLLM performance across different reasoning types, with abductive reasoning showing the weakest results
- Questions are carefully curated to avoid reliance on perceptual skills or domain knowledge, focusing purely on logical reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by isolating logical reasoning capabilities from other cognitive skills that MLLMs might rely on. By avoiding questions that require perceptual interpretation or domain-specific knowledge, the benchmark ensures that performance differences reflect genuine reasoning abilities rather than pattern matching or knowledge retrieval. The three-way classification of reasoning types (inductive, deductive, abductive) provides a comprehensive evaluation framework that captures different logical reasoning paradigms, while the multi-level difficulty structure allows for nuanced performance analysis across skill levels.

## Foundational Learning
- **Logical reasoning types**: Understanding the distinction between inductive (generalizing from specific instances), deductive (applying general rules to specific cases), and abductive (inferring the most likely explanation) reasoning is crucial for interpreting benchmark results and identifying model weaknesses
- **Multimodal reasoning evaluation**: The benchmark demonstrates how to evaluate reasoning in multimodal contexts without conflating reasoning ability with visual or language understanding skills
- **Performance benchmarking methodology**: The careful curation process and difficulty calibration provide a model for developing robust evaluation benchmarks that can reveal genuine capabilities and limitations

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Dataset Curation -> Question Classification -> Difficulty Calibration -> Model Evaluation -> Performance Analysis

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from dataset curation through question classification and difficulty calibration to model evaluation and performance analysis. Each stage builds upon the previous one, with the quality of curation directly impacting the validity of subsequent evaluations and analyses.

### Design Tradeoffs
The benchmark trades comprehensiveness for focus by limiting the dataset to 1,188 carefully curated questions rather than including a larger but potentially noisier dataset. This approach prioritizes quality and specificity over quantity, ensuring that questions genuinely test logical reasoning rather than other capabilities. The cultural specificity of Chinese language content may limit generalizability but provides controlled testing conditions.

### Failure Signatures
Models show consistent failure patterns across reasoning types, with abductive reasoning being particularly problematic. Performance degrades predictably with increased difficulty levels, and extended reasoning chains show diminishing returns, suggesting fundamental limitations in reasoning depth rather than surface-level issues.

### First Experiments
1. Evaluate model performance across the three reasoning types to identify relative strengths and weaknesses
2. Test the impact of reasoning chain length on performance to understand the limits of chain-of-thought approaches
3. Analyze performance differences across difficulty levels to calibrate model capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding the generalizability of the benchmark, particularly concerning its reliance on Chinese language content and culturally specific visual materials. The relatively small dataset size of 1,188 questions also raises questions about statistical power for detecting nuanced performance differences. Additionally, the benchmark's effectiveness in evaluating open-ended reasoning scenarios and the role of planning and exploration capabilities in reasoning performance remain areas for further investigation.

## Limitations
- The benchmark's reliance on Chinese language and culturally specific visual content may limit its generalizability to other linguistic and cultural contexts
- The dataset size of 1,188 questions, while carefully curated, may be relatively small for comprehensive evaluation of complex reasoning tasks
- The evaluation methodology may not fully capture the nuances of open-ended reasoning scenarios where planning and exploration capabilities are critical

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Abductive reasoning represents a significant bottleneck for MLLMs, as this was consistently observed across multiple model evaluations
- **Medium confidence**: Extended reasoning chains improve performance with diminishing returns, as this depends on specific implementation details and could vary with different prompting strategies
- **Medium confidence**: The benchmark avoids reliance on perceptual skills and domain knowledge, as this requires thorough human verification and could be subjective

## Next Checks
1. Test the benchmark's questions on human subjects with varying levels of expertise to validate the difficulty calibration and ensure the questions genuinely avoid domain knowledge requirements
2. Evaluate whether the same reasoning challenges persist when the benchmark is translated or adapted for other languages and cultural contexts
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the minimum number of questions needed to reliably detect performance differences between MLLMs, ensuring the current dataset size is sufficient for robust benchmarking
