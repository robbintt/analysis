# CARPAS: Towards Content-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for Summarization in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07177
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07177
- Reference count: 36
- One-line primary result: Proposed framework improves summarization quality by up to 30% in BERTScore and 24% in ROUGE-L on synthetic data, with 23% and 16% gains on real-world data

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses aspect-based summarization when provided aspects are incomplete, irrelevant, or missing from the document. The authors propose CARPAS, a novel framework that dynamically refines and filters provided aspects based on document context before summarization. By first predicting the number of relevant aspects using either LLM prompting or a trained regression model, then guiding LLMs to refine aspects and generate summaries based on this predicted count, the framework significantly improves summarization quality across synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
The CARPAS framework uses a two-stage approach: (1) predict aspect count using a regression model (Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B + LoRA) trained on synthetic data, or direct LLM prompting, then (2) prompt LLMs (Gemma-3, GPT-4o) with the predicted count to refine aspects and generate summaries. The regression model processes document embeddings through mean pooling and a two-layer feed-forward head, while prompting strategies include Direct, CoT, CoT-SC, and Self-Refine. The method constructs synthetic datasets for earnings call transcripts and COVID-19 press conferences, augmented with real-world earnings call data.

## Key Results
- BERTScore improvements: up to 30% on synthetic data, 23% on real-world data
- ROUGE-L improvements: up to 24% on synthetic data, 16% on real-world data
- #Aspect-RM regression model reduces aspect count error by 71.7% compared to baseline
- Self-Refine prompting strategy performs best under #Aspect-RM guidance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Providing explicit aspect count to LLMs reduces overgeneration and improves summary alignment
- Mechanism: Predicted count N_pred constrains LLM output space, reducing tendency to produce overly comprehensive aspect sets and focusing attention on document-relevant content
- Core assumption: LLMs perform better when task is decomposed into discrete sub-problems rather than solved end-to-end
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.2 shows #Aspect-RM achieves 25.4% BERTScore improvement; abstract states predicted number serves as effective guidance
- Break condition: If regression prediction is inaccurate by >1, summary quality degrades significantly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs exhibit compliance behavior—match output aspect count to provided count regardless of relevance
- Mechanism: When given noisy aspects, LLMs generate summaries for irrelevant aspects rather than filtering them out
- Core assumption: LLMs treat input structure as prescriptive rather than informative
- Evidence anchors: Section 1 notes LLMs tend to predict more comprehensive aspect sets; preliminary experiments show positive correlation between provided and generated aspect counts
- Break condition: If explicitly instructed to ignore aspect count, compliance may weaken

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Trained regression model on document embeddings predicts aspect count more accurately than direct LLM prompting
- Mechanism: Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B produces document representations that, when fine-tuned with LoRA, capture structural signals correlating with aspect quantity
- Core assumption: Synthetic training data distribution matches real-world document structure sufficiently for transfer
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.2 shows #Aspect-RM achieves lowest #AbsAspDiff, reducing by 71.7% in ECT
- Break condition: If documents have hierarchical/nested aspects, single-count prediction fails

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Aspect-Based Summarization (ABS)**
  - Why needed here: CARPAS extends ABS by handling noisy/missing aspects. Understanding baseline ABS assumptions clarifies why refinement task is novel.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why traditional ABS fails when provided aspects include "Government Grants" but document only covers "Revenue" and "New Product Launches"?

- **Concept: Prompting Strategies (CoT, Self-Refine, CoT-SC)**
  - Why needed here: Paper compares four prompting strategies as baselines. Knowing how each works explains why Self-Refine performs best under #Aspect-RM guidance.
  - Quick check question: Why might Self-Refine's iterative evaluation outperform direct prompting for aspect refinement?

- **Concept: LoRA Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: Regression model uses LoRA for efficient parameter updates. Understanding this helps replicate #Aspect-RM training pipeline.
  - Quick check question: What advantage does LoRA provide over full fine-tuning for regression head in this architecture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Document → Embedding → Count Prediction → Prompt Construction (with N_pred) → LLM Refinement + Summarization
- **Critical path:** Document embeddings flow through regression model to predict aspect count, which guides LLM prompting for refinement and summarization
- **Design tradeoffs:** #Aspect-LLM vs. #Aspect-RM (zero-shot vs. training accuracy tradeoff); synthetic vs. real data (controlled experiments vs. domain transfer validation)
- **Failure signatures:** Count prediction off by >1 → summaries become misaligned; hierarchical aspects → single count prediction insufficient; smaller models take more Self-Refine steps without quality improvement
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce preliminary baseline: Run Direct/CoT/CoT-SC/Self-Refine on ECT without count guidance to confirm compliance behavior
  2. Train #Aspect-RM on synthetic ECT split (75 docs), validate count accuracy via #AbsAspDiff metric
  3. Ablate count guidance: Compare N_pred from regression vs. LLM vs. no guidance on RW-ECT to isolate count prediction's contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can CARPAS framework be adapted to handle documents containing hierarchical or nested aspect structures?
  - Basis in paper: Authors state regression-based count prediction may no longer be effective for hierarchical/nested structures
  - Why unresolved: Current methodology predicts single scalar value, unable to model parent-child relationships between topics
  - What evidence would resolve it: Modified approach outputting structured aspect tree demonstrating improved performance on hierarchically annotated data

- **Question:** Does sophisticated agentic approach outperform current regression model for identifying aspect counts and structures?
  - Basis in paper: Authors explicitly state plans to explore more sophisticated agentic approach in future work
  - Why unresolved: Current pipeline uses separately trained regression model creating point of failure
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing agentic architecture reduces aspect count error and achieves higher ROUGE-L scores

- **Question:** Does proposed method generalize to other domains such as law or education without extensive retraining?
  - Basis in paper: Authors acknowledge domain coverage remains narrow and suggest further exploration in law, education, scientific literature
  - Why unresolved: Regression model fine-tuned on finance and public health specific synthetic data
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results from training on existing synthetic data and testing on legal case summaries or scientific papers

## Limitations

- The framework's reliance on accurate aspect count prediction creates critical bottleneck—errors >1 lead to significant summary quality degradation
- Synthetic data generation may not fully capture structural complexity of real-world documents, particularly hierarchical or nested aspects
- Compliance phenomenon in LLMs suggests framework may fail if LLMs evolve to become more context-aware rather than instruction-following

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Empirical improvements in BERTScore and ROUGE-L metrics on both synthetic and real datasets are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Regression model's superiority over LLM prompting for count prediction is demonstrated, but synthetic data distribution matching assumption remains unverified
- **Low confidence**: Claimed compliance behavior mechanism lacks direct ablation studies showing LLMs would behave differently without count guidance

## Next Checks

1. **Compliance behavior ablation**: Run framework instructing LLM to "ignore input aspect count and generate only relevant summaries" to verify if compliance phenomenon is real or artifact of prompting
2. **Count prediction robustness**: Systematically vary regression model's prediction error (injecting controlled noise ±1, ±2) and measure BERTScore degradation to establish framework's brittleness threshold
3. **Hierarchical aspect handling**: Construct small test set with nested aspects (e.g., "Revenue" containing "Product Sales" and "Service Revenue") and evaluate whether single-count prediction approach fails as anticipated
