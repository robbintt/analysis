# What do vision-language models see in the context? Investigating multimodal in-context learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24331
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24331
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Vision-language models rely primarily on textual cues rather than effectively integrating visual information in multimodal in-context learning

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates in-context learning (ICL) capabilities in vision-language models (VLMs) by evaluating seven models across four architectures on image captioning tasks. The authors systematically analyze how prompt design, model architecture, and training strategies impact multimodal ICL. Their findings reveal that models trained on interleaved image-text data show stronger ICL performance but still rely primarily on textual cues rather than effectively integrating visual information. Attention analysis demonstrates that current VLMs do not fully leverage visual inputs in context, with instruction tuning potentially reducing reliance on demonstration examples. These results highlight critical limitations in current VLMs' ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates seven vision-language models across four architectures using image captioning tasks to assess multimodal in-context learning capabilities. The researchers systematically vary prompt design, including different numbers and qualities of demonstration examples, to understand how these factors influence model performance. Attention analysis is employed to investigate how models process visual versus textual information in context. The evaluation includes models with different pretraining strategies, particularly comparing those trained on interleaved image-text data versus other approaches. The study also examines the impact of instruction tuning on ICL performance by analyzing whether models rely more or less on demonstration examples after fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Models trained on interleaved image-text data demonstrate stronger ICL performance but still primarily rely on textual cues
- Attention analysis reveals VLMs do not fully leverage visual inputs in multimodal in-context learning
- Instruction tuning reduces models' reliance on demonstration examples in ICL settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that VLMs' ICL performance is influenced by pretraining data format and instruction tuning procedures. Models trained on interleaved image-text data develop better multimodal integration capabilities, likely because they learn to process visual and textual information as unified sequences during pretraining. However, attention analysis shows these models still prioritize textual information when making predictions in ICL settings. Instruction tuning appears to teach models to follow instructions more directly rather than learning from examples, which explains the reduced reliance on demonstration examples during ICL. This suggests a fundamental limitation in how VLMs integrate visual and textual information for few-shot learning.

## Foundational Learning
1. Multimodal pretraining: Why needed - To understand how different pretraining strategies affect ICL performance; Quick check - Compare models trained on interleaved vs non-interleaved data
2. Attention mechanisms in VLMs: Why needed - To analyze how models process visual vs textual information; Quick check - Examine attention weights between visual and text tokens
3. Instruction tuning effects: Why needed - To understand how fine-tuning impacts ICL reliance on demonstrations; Quick check - Compare ICL performance before and after instruction tuning
4. In-context learning methodology: Why needed - To evaluate how VLMs learn from few examples; Quick check - Test with varying numbers and qualities of demonstration examples
5. Vision-language model architectures: Why needed - To understand architectural differences in ICL capabilities; Quick check - Compare performance across different model families
6. Multimodal evaluation metrics: Why needed - To properly assess ICL performance in vision-language tasks; Quick check - Use both automated metrics and human evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Image input -> Visual encoder -> Fusion layer -> Text decoder -> Output caption
Critical path: Visual input → Visual features → Cross-modal attention → Text generation
Design tradeoffs: Interleaved pretraining improves ICL but may reduce task-specific specialization
Failure signatures: Over-reliance on text cues, poor adaptation to demonstration examples
First experiments: 1) Ablation study on pretraining data format, 2) Attention analysis comparison across architectures, 3) Instruction tuning impact evaluation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to image captioning tasks, may not generalize to other multimodal domains
- Attention analysis provides indirect evidence of visual information utilization
- Study may not fully account for variations in pretraining data and model scales
- Causal relationship between instruction tuning and ICL capability requires further investigation

## Confidence
- High confidence: Models trained on interleaved image-text data show stronger ICL performance
- Medium confidence: VLMs primarily rely on textual cues rather than visual information (based on attention analysis)
- Medium confidence: Instruction tuning reduces reliance on demonstration examples (causal relationship needs more investigation)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate attention analysis using alternative interpretability methods such as feature visualization or causal intervention studies to verify whether VLMs truly underutilize visual information
2. Extend evaluation to diverse multimodal tasks beyond captioning (e.g., visual question answering, visual reasoning) to assess generalizability of ICL limitations
3. Conduct controlled experiments varying instruction tuning intensity and demonstration quality to systematically determine their impact on ICL performance across different VLM architectures
