# Perception-Driven Bias Detection in Machine Learning via Crowdsourced Visual Judgment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.11047
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11047
- Authors: Chirudeep Tupakula; Rittika Shamsuddin
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Perception-driven bias detection framework using crowdsourced visual judgment shows promise as a scalable, interpretable alternative to traditional fairness diagnostics.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a perception-driven framework for detecting bias in machine learning datasets through crowdsourced visual judgment. Users view stripped-down 2D scatter plots and provide binary similarity judgments, which are aggregated and validated via statistical tests. The approach is label-efficient and does not require sensitive demographic attributes. Results show that perceived disparities in visual data correlate with statistically significant differences and prediction gaps in cross-group model evaluation. This method offers a scalable, interpretable alternative to traditional fairness diagnostics and lays groundwork for human-aligned, automated bias screening.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-phase pipeline: first, non-expert users view stripped-down 2D scatter plots (color-coded dots, no axis labels) and provide binary similarity judgments via a Flask web interface. These judgments are aggregated and validated against statistical significance (two-sample t-tests, p<0.05) to create calibrated bias labels. Second, classifiers (Decision Tree, SVM) are trained on distribution statistics to predict bias labels, and cross-group model evaluation (training subgroup-specific models and measuring MSE gaps) confirms whether data-level disparities propagate into algorithmic bias.

## Key Results
- Perceived disparities in visual data correlate with statistically significant differences (p=0.03557 in High Age–High Experience cluster).
- Cross-group MSE higher in all clusters, most pronounced in High_High cluster (15222.83 M→F vs. 12583.10 M→M).
- Visualizations with stronger asymmetry, imbalance, or internal clustering were significantly more likely to be flagged as biased by participants.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Human visual perception can serve as a low-cost preliminary signal for detecting group-level disparities in structured data.
- Mechanism: Non-expert users view stripped-down 2D scatter plots and render binary similarity judgments. Aggregated responses flag data segments for further analysis.
- Core assumption: Visual pattern recognition captures distributional differences that correlate with underlying statistical disparities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "human visual intuition reliably correlates with known bias cases, particularly in high-disparity clusters such as High Age–High Experience, where perceived disparities aligned with statistically significant differences (p=0.03557)"
  - [Section 4.3] "Visualizations that exhibited stronger asymmetry, imbalance, or internal clustering were significantly more likely to be flagged as biased by participants"
  - [corpus] Limited direct validation; neighbor papers focus on fairness metrics rather than perceptual approaches. No external replication cited.
- Break condition: If visualizations are too noisy, overlapping, or subtler than perceptual thresholds, user judgments may become inconsistent; calibration against statistical tests is required to reduce false positives.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Perception-flagged disparities, when calibrated with statistical tests, provide a grounded label set for training bias-predicting models.
- Mechanism: Cases where majority perception flags "different" AND t-tests confirm p<0.05 become training examples. Classifiers (decision trees, SVMs) learn to predict bias labels from distribution statistics.
- Core assumption: Calibrated perceptual labels generalize to new data slices with similar statistical properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.3] "A case is considered calibrated if it meets two criteria: (1) a majority of users perceive a disparity... and (2) the statistical test returns a p-value below a predefined threshold"
  - [Section 4.4, Table 1] Only High_High cluster showed statistical significance (p=0.03557), aligning with high user-flag frequency
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific calibration pipeline; neighbor papers address fairness auditing through formal metrics, not perceptual labeling.
- Break condition: If perception-statistics alignment is weak (many false positives/negatives), trained models will inherit noisy labels and fail to generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-group model evaluation can confirm whether perceived data disparities propagate into algorithmic bias.
- Mechanism: Train subgroup-specific models (e.g., male-only vs. female-only), evaluate MSE across groups. Performance degradation in cross-group testing signals that data-level disparities affect model behavior.
- Core assumption: Cross-group MSE gaps indicate bias rather than legitimate distributional differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.5.2] "A significant increase in prediction error (e.g., MSE) during cross-group testing may indicate that the model has learned specific patterns that fail to generalize"
  - [Section 4.5, Table 2] Cross-group MSE higher in all clusters; most pronounced in High_High cluster (15222.83 M→F vs. 12583.10 M→M)
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Detecting Statistically Significant Fairness Violations" supports layered auditing but uses formal metrics, not perception.
- Break condition: If target variable distributions legitimately differ across groups (e.g., salary gaps from structural inequity), cross-group MSE may reflect data reality rather than model bias; interpretation requires domain context.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Two-sample t-test for group comparison**
  - Why needed here: Validates whether perceived visual disparities correspond to statistically significant differences in underlying distributions.
  - Quick check question: If Group A mean=12583 and Group B mean=15222 with p=0.035, what can you conclude about the difference?

- Concept: **Cross-group model evaluation**
  - Why needed here: Determines whether data-level disparities cause model performance gaps when deployed across demographic subgroups.
  - Quick check question: A model trained on Group A has MSE 100 on Group A test data but MSE 180 on Group B test data—what might this indicate?

- Concept: **Crowdsourced aggregation and calibration**
  - Why needed here: Individual perceptual judgments are noisy; aggregating across users and calibrating against statistical ground truth improves reliability.
  - Quick check question: If 60% of users flag a visualization as "different" but the t-test returns p=0.45, should this case be used as a training label?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Data partitioning layer: Splits dataset into subgroups by features (age, experience); generates minimal 2D scatter plots.
  2. Web interface (Flask + PostgreSQL): Serves randomized image-question pairs; logs binary responses with metadata (timestamp, phrasing version, optional latency).
  3. Aggregation + calibration layer: Computes majority perception; runs two-sample t-tests; produces calibrated bias labels.
  4. ML training layer: Trains classifiers (decision tree, SVM) on distribution statistics to predict bias labels.
  5. Feedback loop: Triggers notifications, retraining, or audit checkpoints when bias is flagged.

- Critical path:
  1. Generate visualizations → 2. Collect user judgments → 3. Aggregate responses → 4. Run statistical validation → 5. Create calibrated labels → 6. Train bias-predicting model → 7. Deploy for automated screening

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Minimal visuals (no axis labels)** vs. **interpretability**: Reduces cognitive bias but limits user understanding of what they're judging.
  - **Binary questions** vs. **graded responses**: Simpler aggregation but loses nuance in borderline cases.
  - **Non-expert crowds** vs. **domain experts**: Scalable but may miss subtle domain-specific disparities.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low inter-user agreement on repeated visualizations (suggests perceptual task is ambiguous).
  - Perception flags don't correlate with statistical significance (calibration pipeline fails).
  - Trained bias-predictor has high false positive rate on new datasets (labels don't generalize).
  - Cross-group MSE gaps exist but don't align with perception flags (layered validation inconsistent).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Run t-tests on all cluster pairs; correlate user flag rates with p-values to measure perception-statistics alignment.
  2. **Phrasing A/B test**: Compare "Do groups look similar?" vs. "Do you observe a difference?" to quantify framing effects on bias detection rates.
  3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Train bias-predicting model on calibrated labels from one dataset (e.g., salary data); test on held-out clusters or a different domain to assess label transferability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does cognitive framing—specifically question phrasing—systematically interact with visual layout and user demographic background to influence bias perception judgments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "the interaction between cognitive framing, visual layout, and user background remains an open research question" after noting that phrasings were not systematically counterbalanced.
- Why unresolved: The pilot study varied question phrasing but did not fully randomize or counterbalance across users, making it impossible to isolate framing effects from individual differences.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled factorial experiment systematically varying phrasing, visual encoding, and user demographics with sufficient sample sizes for interaction analysis.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can perception-driven bias detection maintain reliability across culturally diverse populations and real-world datasets beyond the pilot study's limited participant pool?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Broader sampling across cultural and professional backgrounds is necessary to assess the generalizability of the framework" and "more rigorous, large-scale, and scientifically controlled testing is needed to validate these observations across diverse populations and real-world datasets."
- Why unresolved: The pilot cohort was limited to university students and colleagues, raising concerns about demographic bias in perception judgments and whether findings transfer to other contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Multi-site deployments with stratified sampling across cultures, ages, and professional backgrounds, evaluated on diverse real-world ML datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Which specific visual features (e.g., clustering density, spatial separation, skew) most reliably trigger human perception of group disparity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that visualizations "are not controlled experiments—meaning we cannot isolate the effects of specific visual features or data properties as precisely as we could with synthetic data."
- Why unresolved: The current design uses real-world derived visualizations with correlated visual properties, preventing causal attribution of user responses to specific perceptual cues.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using parametrically generated synthetic visualizations where individual features (separation, variance, outliers) are independently manipulated.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the optimal aggregation threshold for converting crowdsourced binary judgments into calibrated bias flags that balance false positives against missed detections?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions "a majority of users perceive a disparity (e.g., >X% of responses signal 'bias')" but does not specify or evaluate threshold values against ground truth.
- Why unresolved: No systematic analysis was conducted on how different voting thresholds affect detection accuracy, precision, or recall relative to statistical validation.
- What evidence would resolve it: ROC-style analysis varying the aggregation threshold and measuring alignment with statistically significant disparities and model performance degradation.

## Limitations
- Limited external validation: Single dataset (Kaggle salary data) and four demographic clusters, no replication on independent datasets or domains.
- Ambiguous perceptual tasks: Stripped-down visualizations without axis labels may lead to inconsistent interpretation and low inter-user agreement.
- Binary framing limitations: Yes/no questions simplify complex bias patterns and may miss nuanced disparities; framing effects could skew detection rates.

## Confidence
- High confidence: Statistical validation via two-sample t-tests and cross-group MSE evaluation are standard, well-established methods.
- Medium confidence: Crowdsourced perception-driven bias detection is innovative but lacks external replication and robust inter-user agreement metrics.
- Low confidence: Generalization of calibrated perceptual labels to new datasets or bias types is unproven; transferability remains a key uncertainty.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Apply the trained bias-predicting model to a held-out dataset from a different domain (e.g., healthcare or education) to assess label transferability and model robustness.
2. **Inter-user agreement quantification**: Compute Cohen's kappa or intra-class correlation for repeated visualizations to measure consistency of perceptual judgments and identify ambiguous cases.
3. **Phrasing framing experiment**: Conduct A/B testing with alternative question phrasings ("similar" vs. "different") to quantify framing effects on bias detection rates and optimize question design.
