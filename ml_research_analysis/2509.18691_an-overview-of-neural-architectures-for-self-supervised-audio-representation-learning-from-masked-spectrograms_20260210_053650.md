# An overview of neural architectures for self-supervised audio representation learning from masked spectrograms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.18691
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18691
- Reference count: 40
- Mamba and xLSTM achieve competitive performance to Transformers for audio representation learning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of three neural architectures - Transformer, Mamba, and xLSTM - for self-supervised audio representation learning using masked spectrogram modeling. The authors evaluate these approaches across ten diverse audio classification tasks, finding that Mamba-based models outperform standard Transformers by approximately 30% in overall score while maintaining linear complexity. The study establishes Mamba and xLSTM as viable alternatives to Transformers for learning general-purpose audio representations, particularly excelling in handling longer sequences and different time-frequency resolutions.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates three neural architectures (Transformer, Mamba, and xLSTM) for self-supervised audio representation learning through masked spectrogram modeling. The pretraining involves reconstructing masked portions of spectrograms, followed by fine-tuning on ten diverse audio classification tasks. The authors implement a consistent framework across all architectures, enabling direct comparison of their effectiveness for learning general-purpose audio representations from spectrograms.

## Key Results
- Mamba-based models outperform standard Transformers by approximately 30% in overall score across ten audio classification tasks
- xLSTM-based models achieve competitive results compared to Transformers while maintaining efficiency advantages
- Mamba and xLSTM architectures demonstrate strong performance in handling longer sequences and different time-frequency resolutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of Mamba and xLSTM architectures stems from their ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies in audio spectrograms while maintaining linear computational complexity. Unlike Transformers, which scale quadratically with sequence length, Mamba uses selective state spaces to process sequences efficiently, and xLSTM extends LSTM with exponential gating. These architectures are particularly well-suited for masked spectrogram modeling as they can effectively learn representations from both local and global context in the audio signal.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Masked spectrogram modeling** - why needed: Core self-supervised learning approach; quick check: Verify reconstruction quality of masked regions
2. **Audio spectrogram representation** - why needed: Standard audio feature format; quick check: Confirm proper time-frequency resolution
3. **Self-supervised learning paradigms** - why needed: Framework for learning without labels; quick check: Compare pretraining vs random initialization
4. **Transformer architecture** - why needed: Baseline for comparison; quick check: Validate attention mechanism implementation
5. **State space models (Mamba)** - why needed: Efficient alternative to attention; quick check: Verify linear complexity scaling
6. **xLSTM architecture** - why needed: Hybrid recurrent-attention approach; quick check: Confirm exponential gating implementation

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Spectrogram -> Masked Modeling -> [Transformer/Mamba/xLSTM] -> Audio Representation -> Downstream Classification

### Critical Path
1. Input spectrogram preprocessing and masking
2. Core architecture processing (Transformer/Mamba/xLSTM)
3. Masked reconstruction loss computation
4. Downstream fine-tuning and evaluation

### Design Tradeoffs
- Computational efficiency vs. reconstruction quality
- Model capacity vs. generalization across tasks
- Masking strategy complexity vs. learning effectiveness
- Pretraining duration vs. downstream performance

### Failure Signatures
- Poor reconstruction quality indicates insufficient model capacity
- Overfitting to pretraining task suggests inadequate regularization
- Inconsistent performance across tasks indicates domain-specific limitations
- High computational cost suggests inefficient architecture choice

### First Experiments
1. Validate spectrogram preprocessing and masking pipeline
2. Test core architecture with simplified downstream task
3. Compare pretraining vs random initialization on representative task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on ten audio classification tasks, which may not represent all potential downstream applications
- The study's focus on masked spectrogram modeling represents one specific self-supervised learning approach
- Computational efficiency claims require careful interpretation depending on hardware and implementation details

## Confidence
- Mamba and xLSTM viability as Transformer alternatives (High)
- 30% performance improvement claim (Medium)
- Generalizability across all audio tasks (Low)
- Computational efficiency claims (Medium)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying key hyperparameters across all three architectures to isolate architectural contributions from training configuration effects
2. Extend evaluation to include additional self-supervised learning approaches (e.g., contrastive learning) for comprehensive comparison
3. Perform extensive computational efficiency benchmarking across different hardware configurations and batch sizes to validate practical efficiency claims
