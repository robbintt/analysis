# Exponential Convergence Guarantees for Iterative Markovian Fitting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.20871
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20871
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Establishes first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) algorithm in solving the Schrödinger Bridge problem.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides the first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) algorithm, which solves the Schrödinger Bridge problem by alternately projecting between reciprocal classes of reference measures and Markovian processes. Under structural assumptions on log-concavity of marginals and reference measures, the paper proves that IMF converges to the Schrödinger Bridge solution at exponential rate in KL divergence. The key technical contribution is a new contraction estimate for the Markovian projection operator, with convergence rates depending on log-concavity parameters and time horizon.

## Method Summary
The IMF algorithm solves the Schrödinger Bridge problem by iteratively alternating between two projections: (1) constructing a stochastic interpolant via conditioning on current coupling endpoints using the reference bridge dynamics, and (2) computing the Markovian projection by estimating the mimicking drift that makes the process Markovian. The method requires initial marginals μ, ν, a reference potential U, an initial coupling, and time horizon T. Each iteration samples paths from the current coupling, estimates the time-dependent drift via conditional expectation regression, simulates the resulting SDE to obtain a new coupling, and repeats until convergence.

## Key Results
- Proves exponential convergence of IMF to Schrödinger Bridge solution at rate determined by log-concavity parameters and time horizon
- Establishes contraction properties of the Markovian projection operator under mild structural assumptions
- Provides convergence guarantees for both strongly log-concave and weakly log-concave marginal regimes
- Shows convergence rate scales as 1/T, with larger time horizons yielding faster convergence
- First non-asymptotic analysis of IMF algorithm for continuous R^d settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Contraction of the Markovian Projection
- **Claim:** IMF converges exponentially fast because the Markovian projection operator acts as a contraction mapping on probability measures under specific structural assumptions.
- **Mechanism:** IMF alternates between projecting onto reciprocal class of reference process and onto Markov processes. The convergence proof relies on establishing that if two couplings are close in KL divergence, their Markovian projections are even closer, creating "shrinkage" of error at every iteration.
- **Core assumption:** Time horizon T must be sufficiently large (T > max{α_μ^{-1}, α_ν^{-1}}) and marginals must satisfy log-concavity.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "The analysis relies on novel contraction properties of the Markovian projection operator..."; [section E.2] Theorem 4 formally proves KL(π^(1)_{0,T} | π̂^(1)_{0,T}) ≤ (L_U/2ξT) KL(π_{0,T} | π̂_{0,T}), establishing contraction factor.
- **Break condition:** If log-concavity parameters are too small relative to Lipschitz constant L_U, or T is too small, contraction factor ≥ 1 and proof fails.

### Mechanism 2: Lipschitz Regularization via Log-Concavity
- **Claim:** Strong or weak log-concavity of marginals and reference process enforces Talagrand inequality (T2) on bridge kernels, driving the contraction.
- **Mechanism:** The contraction proof requires bridge kernel to satisfy T2-inequality. Under log-concavity, conditional densities of Schrödinger Bridge potentials are strongly log-concave, implying T2 and ensuring perturbations don't explode when propagated through SDE dynamics.
- **Core assumption:** Assumptions H5 (Strongly log-concave) or H7 (Weakly log-concave) must hold, including requirement that joint density -log p^U_{0,t,T} is convex.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.1] Links strong log-concavity to contraction rate (L_U/T(α_φ + α_ψ + α)); [section E.3] Proof of Theorem 5 demonstrates log-concavity implies 2ξ-strong log-concavity of kernel K̂_t(y,·).
- **Break condition:** If marginals are multi-modal without "weakly log-concave" property (distinct islands with large gaps), assumptions H5/H7 violated.

### Mechanism 3: Time Horizon Scaling
- **Claim:** Increasing time horizon T tightens contraction factor, speeding up convergence provided drift estimation remains accurate.
- **Mechanism:** Convergence rate roughly proportional to 1/T. Larger T allows diffusion process to run longer, letting regularizing effect of Brownian noise (entropy) smooth out differences between reference measure and target marginals more effectively.
- **Core assumption:** Time horizon must exceed inverse convexity constants of marginals.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.1] Remark 4 states "larger values of convexity parameters... as well as stronger convexity of reference... lead to faster convergence"; Theorem 1 explicitly bounds convergence by (L_U/T(·))^n.
- **Break condition:** If T is small (close to threshold), denominator in rate approaches zero, convergence slows arbitrarily.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Schrödinger Bridge (SB) Problem**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the optimization objective IMF solves. It frames generative modeling as finding most likely path (entropy-regularized transport) between prior μ and target ν.
  - **Quick check question:** Does SB problem minimize transport cost or KL divergence relative to reference process? (Answer: KL divergence to reference measure, e.g., Brownian motion).

- **Concept: Markovian Projection**
  - **Why needed here:** This is core operator in IMF loop. It finds Markov process with same time-marginals as non-Markovian stochastic interpolant.
  - **Quick check question:** If you have non-Markovian process Y_t, what property does its Markovian projection X_t preserve? (Answer: Distribution of X_t equals distribution of Y_t for all times t).

- **Concept: Log-Concavity**
  - **Why needed here:** Convergence guarantees conditioned on marginals and reference measure being log-concave. Understanding this is crucial to knowing if theory applies to specific dataset/distribution.
  - **Quick check question:** A distribution p(x) ∝ e^{-U(x)} is strongly log-concave if U(x) is strictly convex. Does Gaussian mixture model qualify? (Answer: Generally qualifies as "weakly log-concave" under certain conditions, covered by Theorem 2, but not strongly log-concave).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Initial Coupling → Stochastic Interpolant → Drift Estimator → Markovian Projection → Updated Coupling → (iterate)
- **Critical path:** Accuracy of Drift Estimator (Eq. 11). Theory assumes exact drifts. In practice, this is neural network regression. If drift error is high, theoretical guarantees don't strictly hold, leading to bias accumulation.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Time Horizon T:** Large T ensures convergence (per theory) but increases simulation cost and potentially estimation difficulty
  - **Reference Process:** U ≡ 0 (Brownian motion) is simplest and satisfies Assumption H3 easily. Using non-zero potential U (Langevin) requires verifying Lipschitz gradient condition (H3)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Slow/No Convergence:** Theorem 1 requires T to be large enough. If T is too small, "forgetting" effect of diffusion is insufficient, algorithm may stall
  - **Marginal Mismatch:** If drift estimation error accumulates (known issue in DSB/IMF), generated final marginal P_T drifts away from target ν. Paper suggests DSBM (time-reversed training) as practical mitigation
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Synthetic Gaussians:** Implement IMF for Gaussian marginals. Verify convergence rate in KL divergence matches Theorem 1 (exponential)
  2. **Vary T:** Run algorithm on same marginals with increasing T. Plot contraction rate vs. 1/T to validate Remark 4
  3. **Weakly Log-Concave Check:** Use Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as target ν. Check if convergence still occurs and compare rate against Theorem 2 (should be slower than strongly log-concave case)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can exponential convergence guarantees for IMF be extended to practical DSBM algorithm by accounting for mimicking drift estimation and discretization errors? The conclusion states analysis "does not account for the mimicking drift estimation error or the discretization error arising in practical implementations" and lists "inclusion of approximation errors in theoretical analysis" as future work direction.

- **Open Question 2:** Do non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees hold for IMF algorithm when time horizon T is fixed or small, rather than "sufficiently large"? Conclusion highlights limitation that results hold "in regime where time horizon T is sufficiently large, while in Schrödinger Bridge problem T is typically fixed," identifying "extension to finite-time settings" as future direction.

- **Open Question 3:** Does Assumption H3 regarding Lipschitz continuity of score of transition density hold for general potentials U that are infinitely differentiable with bounded derivatives? Remark 2 states "We expect that Assumption H3 holds true also if U is infinitely differentiable with bounded derivatives, but this problem is out of scope of paper and left for future work."

## Limitations

- Theoretical guarantees assume exact drift estimation, but practical implementations require neural network regression introducing potential bias accumulation
- Convergence bounds explicitly depend on time horizon T being sufficiently large relative to log-concavity parameters, creating tension between theoretical requirements and practical computational cost
- While weakly log-concave case broadens applicability to multimodal distributions, convergence rate deteriorates as distributions deviate from strong convexity with no quantified bound on how "weak" log-concavity can be before convergence fails

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The contraction mapping mechanism for Markovian projection operator - proof structure in Theorem 4 is rigorous and assumptions are clearly stated
- **Medium Confidence:** The practical implementation of drift estimation and its impact on convergence - while theory assumes exact drifts, paper acknowledges this is neural network regression in practice without empirical validation
- **Low Confidence:** The precise quantitative relationship between "weakness" of log-concavity and degradation of convergence rate in weakly log-concave regime - Theorem 2 provides bounds but doesn't characterize how multimodal structure specifically affects constants

## Next Checks

1. **Implementation Verification:** Reproduce convergence rate experiment for Gaussian marginals where exact Schrödinger Bridge solution is known, comparing theoretical KL divergence bounds against empirical measurements across different T values

2. **Drift Estimation Error Analysis:** Implement IMF algorithm with both exact drift computation (using known transition densities) and estimated drifts (via neural networks), measuring gap in convergence rates to quantify practical impact of estimation error

3. **Multimodal Distribution Test:** Apply IMF to bimodal Gaussian mixture target distribution, measuring actual convergence behavior against theoretical bounds in Theorem 2 and characterizing how distance between modes affects convergence rate
