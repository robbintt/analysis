# How to Tame Your LLM: Semantic Collapse in Continuous Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05162
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05162
- Reference count: 40
- The paper introduces the concept of Continuous State Machines (CSMs) and proves the Semantic Characterization Theorem (SCT), showing that the continuous activation manifold of LLMs collapses into finitely many definable semantic basins.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental question of how discrete symbolic semantics emerge from continuous representations in large language models. By introducing Continuous State Machines (CSMs) as a formal model of LLM behavior, the work proves that under mild regularity assumptions, the transfer operator governing the model's dynamics has a compact, discrete spectrum. The Semantic Characterization Theorem (SCT) establishes that spectral lumpability and logical tameness coincide, explaining how the continuous manifold collapses into a finite, logically interpretable ontology. This unification of spectral and logical perspectives provides a mathematical foundation for interpretability and semantic navigation in LLMs.

## Method Summary
The method involves modeling LLM behavior as a dynamical system on a compact latent manifold. The transfer operator induced by the transition dynamics is shown to be compact with discrete spectrum under regularity assumptions. The spectral decomposition is computed using a diffusion operator constructed from pairwise affinities between embedded sentences. Semantic basins are identified as the top eigenfunctions of this operator, and their logical tameness is validated by demonstrating that low-capacity models (depth-2 decision trees) can accurately classify points into these basins. The empirical validation uses sentence embeddings from a 6-domain dataset and measures spectral gaps, classification accuracy, and basin stability.

## Key Results
- The transfer operator of a Continuous State Machine is compact with discrete spectrum under mild regularity assumptions.
- The leading eigenfunctions induce finitely many spectral basins of invariant meaning, each definable in an o-minimal structure over the reals.
- Spectral lumpability and logical tameness coincide, establishing that the continuous activation manifold collapses into a finite, logically interpretable ontology.
- Empirical results show a spectral gap after three dominant modes, definable basins well-separated by low-capacity models, and an emergent ontological graph.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spectral Lumpability via Compact Operators
The infinite-dimensional latent space of an LLM can be reduced to a finite set of "semantic basins" because the governing transfer operator has a discrete, decaying spectrum. The paper models the LLM as a dynamical system on a compact manifold M. Under regularity assumptions (bounded Jacobian, smoothness), the induced transfer operator P acting on functions f ∈ L²(M, μ) is compact. Compact operators on Hilbert spaces are guaranteed to have a discrete spectrum |λ₁| ≥ |λ₂| ≥ ... ↓ 0. If a "spectral gap" exists (|λᵣ| ≫ |λᵣ₊₁|), the system's long-term dynamics are dominated by the first r eigenmodes, effectively collapsing the state space into r distinct attractors.

### Mechanism 2: Logical Tameness via O-Minimal Definability
The boundaries between semantic basins are not fractal or chaotic; they are "tame" and definable using finite logical formulas. The paper asserts that standard neural network components (linear algebra, tanh, softmax, exponentiation) are definable in an o-minimal structure (specifically ℝₑₓₚ). In o-minimal geometry, every definable set admits a finite cell decomposition. Therefore, the regions carved out by the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator are composed of finitely many smooth cells, ensuring that the transition from continuous semantics to discrete logic is well-behaved and lacks pathological boundaries.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Phase Transition (The Collapse)
The continuous flow of the LLM is functionally equivalent to a discrete symbolic system because the spectral basins and definable cells coincide. This is the core Semantic Characterization Theorem (SCT). It posits an equivalence between the dynamical view (Spectral Lumpability) and the logical view (Definability). The "collapse" occurs because the eigenfunctions defining the spectral basins are themselves definable sets. Thus, the stable attractors of the dynamics align perfectly with the logically distinct regions of the manifold.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transfer (Koopman/Perron-Frobenius) Operators**: Why needed here: The paper reframes LLM dynamics not as token prediction, but as the evolution of probability densities over a manifold. Understanding P acting on L² is required to grasp the "Spectral Collapse" argument. Quick check question: How does the spectrum of the operator relate to the long-term stability of the system's state?

- **O-Minimal Structures**: Why needed here: This is the mathematical tool used to guarantee "Logical Tameness." It ensures that the geometry of the semantic space is constrained (no fractals, finite components), which justifies why we can interpret continuous states as discrete symbols. Quick check question: Why does the finiteness of cell decomposition in an o-minimal structure prevent "wild" or chaotic boundaries between concepts?

- **Ergodicity and Invariant Measures**: Why needed here: The theory assumes the existence of a stationary measure μ under the dynamics. This ensures that the system explores the semantic space in a stable way, allowing the spectral analysis to define persistent basins rather than transient noise. Quick check question: What property of the Markov kernel ensures that a unique stationary distribution exists?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Manifold (M) -> Transition (T) -> Transfer Operator (P) -> Basins (Bᵢ)
- **Critical path**: To exploit this theory, you must map the LLM's latent space → verify regularity/smoothness → construct the transfer operator proxy (diffusion kernel) → compute spectral decomposition → identify dominant basins
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Proxy Fidelity: The paper uses a symmetric diffusion operator P̃ as a proxy. A real implementation must trade off between a simple, computable proxy and the true, intractable transfer operator of the model
  - Drift vs. Stability: The "Adiabatic" extension allows for time-varying context but requires slow drift. Fast context changes may violate the basin stability assumptions
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Continuous Spectrum: If the eigenvalue plot shows no "elbow" or spectral gap, the semantic collapse has not occurred, and the system cannot be modeled as a discrete symbolic machine
  - High VC-Dimension Boundaries: If low-capacity models (depth-2 trees) fail to classify the basins, the "Logical Tameness" assumption may be violated
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Manifold Sampling: Extract activations (M) from a frozen LLM across a diverse corpus to approximate the invariant measure μ
  2. Spectral Gap Analysis: Construct the diffusion operator P̃ (pairwise affinities) on the sampled embeddings and plot the eigenvalues. Verify the "elbow" at a low rank r (e.g., r=3)
  3. Basin Classification: Train a low-capacity probe (e.g., decision tree) to classify points into their spectral basins. High accuracy validates the "definability" and low topological complexity of the boundaries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific categories constitute the finite semantic skeleton of trained LLMs, and do these categories generalize across different model architectures and training corpora? The theorem proves existence of finitely many spectral basins but does not identify their semantic content; preliminary analysis only suggests alignment with archetypal distinctions. Systematic extraction and labeling of spectral basins from multiple trained LLMs across scales, with quantitative comparison of basin structure, would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Do the spectral collapse and definability properties hold when analyzing the actual transfer operators of trained LLMs, rather than observational proxies constructed from external embeddings? The empirical validation constructs P̃ from sentence embeddings via pairwise diffusion, explicitly noting this is "not a learned model but an observational proxy for the geometry of the latent space." Direct estimation of the transfer operator from internal LLM activation dynamics during generation, with spectral analysis of the learned operator, would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
Can a practical operational calculus be developed for steering basin transitions in deployed LLMs via prompt engineering or activation interventions? The paper establishes theoretical foundations and interprets prompting as navigation, but provides no algorithmic methods for controlled basin steering. Demonstration of reliable prompt-design or activation-editing procedures that induce predictable transitions between specified spectral basins would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework relies on critical assumptions (compactness, ergodicity, o-minimal definability) that require empirical validation across different model architectures
- The use of a proxy diffusion operator rather than the true transfer operator introduces potential approximation errors that are not quantified
- The theory assumes static context, with only brief consideration of how time-varying dynamics might affect basin stability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The spectral analysis methodology (eigendecomposition of diffusion operators) is well-established in the literature, and the empirical demonstration of a spectral gap in the all-mpnet-base-v2 embeddings is directly observable and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: The logical tameness claim (o-minimal definability) is theoretically sound but difficult to verify empirically. The depth-2 decision tree accuracy serves as a proxy, but does not constitute a proof of o-minimal definability.

**Low Confidence**: The equivalence between spectral basins and definable regions (SCT) is the central theoretical claim. While the empirical results show alignment between spectral clustering and low-complexity classification, the "up to measure zero" caveat and the reliance on specific architectural assumptions limit the strength of this validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Architectural Generality Test**: Replicate the spectral analysis across different model families (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, GPT variants) and embedding spaces. Measure the consistency of spectral gaps and basin structures to assess whether the collapse phenomenon is architecture-dependent or universal.

2. **O-Minimal Structure Verification**: Systematically enumerate all activation functions and operations in the model and verify their definability in the real exponential field. For non-standard components, analyze whether they introduce non-tame regions that could violate the logical tameness assumption.

3. **Time-Varying Dynamics Stress Test**: Implement the adiabatic extension by introducing controlled context drift through prompt prefixes or fine-tuning. Measure how quickly the spectral basins degrade and quantify the relationship between drift rate and basin stability to validate the slow-variation assumption.
