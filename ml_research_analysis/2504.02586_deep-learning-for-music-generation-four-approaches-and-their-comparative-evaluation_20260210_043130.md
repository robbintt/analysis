- Four deep learning methods for music generation compared on aesthetic quality and application suitability

## Executive Summary
This paper presents and evaluates four deep learning approaches for generating melodies, comparing them on aesthetic quality and practical application suitability. The methods range from modified visual transformers and chat data sonification to rhythm-theory integration and GPT-3 fine-tuning. All models were trained on the Lakh MIDI Dataset and evaluated by 108 students. The study finds that GPT-3 fine-tuning achieves the highest aesthetic scores, while the Schillinger-based approach shows notable improvements over simpler sonification methods, particularly for soundtrack applications.

## Method Summary
The study compares four distinct deep learning approaches for melody generation: (1) a modified visual transformer serving as a language model for music, (2) a transformer-based sonification of chat data, (3) a transformer combined with Schillinger's rhythm theory, and (4) a fine-tuned GPT-3 Curie model. All methods were trained on the Lakh MIDI Dataset, with the first three generating melodies from scratch while the fourth was fine-tuned on music data. The evaluation involved 108 students rating generated melodies on aesthetic quality (1-5 scale) and application suitability for different contexts.

## Key Results
- GPT-3 fine-tuning (Method 4) achieved the highest average aesthetic score of 3.62/5
- Schillinger-based method (Method 3) scored comparably to visual transformer (Method 1) but significantly higher than chat sonification (Method 2)
- Schillinger method was rated most suitable for movie soundtracks
- Friedman test confirmed significant differences between methods with small effect size

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of Schillinger's rhythm theory with transformer architectures demonstrates how domain-specific musical knowledge can enhance deep learning performance. By incorporating established rhythmic principles, the model generates more musically coherent outputs compared to purely data-driven approaches. The GPT-3 fine-tuning approach benefits from pre-trained language understanding capabilities, allowing it to capture complex musical patterns with fewer training examples. The visual transformer adaptation shows that cross-domain architecture transfer can work for music generation when properly modified.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Transformer architecture fundamentals** - Why needed: Core to all four methods; Quick check: Understand self-attention and positional encoding
2. **MIDI representation for music** - Why needed: Dataset format and input/output structure; Quick check: Know note-on/note-off events and tempo mapping
3. **Schillinger rhythm theory** - Why needed: Domain knowledge integration for Method 3; Quick check: Understand complementary rhythm and interference patterns
4. **Music generation evaluation** - Why needed: How aesthetic quality was measured; Quick check: Know limitations of subjective human evaluation
5. **Statistical testing for rankings** - Why needed: Friedman test and post-hoc analysis used; Quick check: Understand non-parametric ranking tests
6. **Language model fine-tuning** - Why needed: Method 4's approach; Quick check: Know difference between prompt engineering and fine-tuning

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Chat data -> Transformer -> Melody output (Method 2)
Visual data -> Modified Transformer -> Melody output (Method 1)
MIDI data -> Transformer + Schillinger theory -> Melody output (Method 3)
MIDI data -> GPT-3 Curie -> Fine-tuned model -> Melody output (Method 4)

**Critical path:** Training data preprocessing → Model architecture selection → Training → Human evaluation → Statistical analysis

**Design tradeoffs:** Simple data sonification vs. theory-guided generation vs. large language model transfer; trade-off between model complexity and musical coherence

**Failure signatures:** Low aesthetic scores indicating poor melodic structure; high variance suggesting inconsistent generation quality; failure to capture rhythmic patterns in non-Schillinger methods

**First experiments:**
1. Generate 10 melodies with each method and perform basic statistical analysis of note distributions
2. Compare rhythm regularity between Schillinger-based method and pure transformer approaches
3. Test GPT-3 fine-tuning on smaller music datasets to establish baseline performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on subjective aesthetic judgments from students without reported musical expertise levels
- Limited to mean scores and variance without detailed analysis of specific musical elements
- Complex comparison across four distinct approaches without full accounting for architectural differences

## Confidence
- High confidence: GPT-3 fine-tuning achieving highest average aesthetic score (3.62/5)
- Medium confidence: Schillinger method's advantage over sonification requires more granular analysis
- Medium confidence: Application suitability ratings based on subjective judgments without clear criteria

## Next Checks
1. Conduct expert musician evaluations alongside student ratings to compare professional versus lay preferences
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the impact of Schillinger's rhythm theory from other architectural differences
3. Test model generalization on out-of-domain musical styles not represented in the Lakh MIDI Dataset
