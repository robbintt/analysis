# Grounding the Ungrounded: A Spectral-Graph Framework for Quantifying Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19366
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19366
- Authors: Supratik Sarkar; Swagatam Das
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Spectral-graph framework using diffusion dynamics and Laplacian eigenmodes outperforms entropy/margin baselines in hallucination detection across nine 3D multimodal panels (AUROC/AUPRC: 0.86/0.84, 0.84/0.81, 0.80/0.77)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a spectral-graph framework that quantifies hallucinations in multimodal large language models by modeling outputs as nodes on a multimodal graph Laplacian. The method defines a semantic distortion metric based on diffusion dynamics and spectral decomposition to capture the gap between model outputs and a truth manifold, enabling reference-free hallucination scoring. Empirical validation across nine 3D panels shows consistent outperformance over entropy, max-probability, and margin baselines, with tight Courant-Fischer bounds aligning with theoretical predictions.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs a multimodal graph Laplacian where outputs from CLIP, Whisper, and T5 (or variants like BLIP, SigLIP) form nodes connected by edge weights derived from kernel similarities. A diffusion process propagates through this graph, and spectral decomposition of the Laplacian yields eigenmodes that define a semantic distortion score. This score quantifies how far generated content deviates from the truth manifold without requiring ground-truth references. The method incorporates temperature-dependent Courant-Fischer bounds to provide theoretical guarantees on hallucination profiles and uses reproducing kernel Hilbert space eigenmodes for modality-aware interpretation.

## Key Results
- Semantic distortion score consistently outperforms entropy, max-probability, and margin baselines in hallucination detection (AUROC/AUPRC: 0.86/0.84, 0.84/0.81, 0.80/0.77)
- Courant-Fischer bounds are tight and align with theoretical predictions across all tested panels
- Hallucination energy surfaces decay monotonically as temperature and diffusion increase
- Framework successfully reframes hallucination quantification as a bounded, measurable quantity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by constructing a multimodal graph where each node represents an output embedding from different model components. Edge weights capture semantic similarity through kernel functions, creating a structure where hallucinated content appears as outliers in the graph topology. Diffusion dynamics smooth the graph structure while spectral decomposition identifies the principal modes of variation. The semantic distortion metric then measures deviation from the dominant eigenmodes associated with truthful content. The temperature parameter controls sensitivity to subtle distortions, while Courant-Fischer bounds provide theoretical guarantees on the measurement precision.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Laplacian and spectral theory** - Why needed: Forms the mathematical foundation for representing multimodal outputs as a structured graph and extracting meaningful spectral features. Quick check: Verify that the Laplacian matrix correctly captures the connectivity and diffusion properties of the multimodal output space.

**Diffusion processes on graphs** - Why needed: Enables smoothing of the graph structure to reveal underlying semantic patterns while suppressing noise. Quick check: Confirm that diffusion coefficients appropriately balance between preserving local structure and capturing global semantic relationships.

**Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces** - Why needed: Provides the mathematical framework for defining similarity measures between multimodal embeddings and computing eigenmodes. Quick check: Validate that kernel choice appropriately captures semantic relationships across different modalities.

**Courant-Fischer theorem** - Why needed: Supplies theoretical bounds on eigenvalue optimization that guarantee the reliability of spectral measurements. Quick check: Ensure that computed bounds match theoretical predictions across different temperature settings.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Multimodal embeddings (CLIP/Whisper/T5) -> Graph construction (Laplacian) -> Diffusion dynamics -> Spectral decomposition -> Semantic distortion score -> Hallucination quantification

Critical path: The most critical components are the graph construction (which must accurately capture multimodal relationships) and the spectral decomposition (which must reliably extract meaningful eigenmodes). The diffusion process acts as a bottleneck that can either enhance or obscure important structural features.

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances between sensitivity (detecting subtle hallucinations) and specificity (avoiding false positives). Temperature controls this tradeoff, with higher temperatures increasing sensitivity but potentially introducing more false positives. Kernel choice affects the ability to capture cross-modal relationships, while graph construction parameters determine the resolution of the semantic distortion measurement.

Failure signatures: The framework may fail when the truth manifold assumption breaks down (novel but plausible content), when underlying embeddings contain biases, or when the graph construction parameters are poorly tuned for specific hallucination types. Performance degradation typically manifests as inflated semantic distortion scores for legitimate creative content or missed detection of subtle factual errors.

3 first experiments: 1) Vary temperature parameter systematically to characterize sensitivity-specificity tradeoff, 2) Test different kernel functions to optimize cross-modal relationship capture, 3) Conduct ablation studies removing individual model components to assess contribution to hallucination detection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None provided in the source material.

## Limitations

- Performance heavily depends on quality and coverage of pre-trained multimodal embeddings, potentially inheriting biases from underlying models
- Truth manifold assumption may not hold for all hallucination types, particularly novel but plausible content
- Framework's generalizability to domains beyond tested combinations requires further validation

## Confidence

- High confidence in mathematical formulation and theoretical foundations (Courant-Fischer bounds, diffusion dynamics)
- Medium confidence in empirical performance metrics given controlled experimental conditions
- Medium confidence in generalizability to other multimodal models and domains
- Low confidence in detecting subtle or context-dependent hallucinations without extensive parameter tuning

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate performance on additional multimodal datasets with diverse content types and domains to assess generalizability beyond current test panels

2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify impact of individual graph construction parameters (temperature, diffusion coefficients, kernel choice) on hallucination detection accuracy

3. Test framework's sensitivity to different hallucination types, including novel but plausible content versus factual errors, to characterize detection boundaries and limitations
