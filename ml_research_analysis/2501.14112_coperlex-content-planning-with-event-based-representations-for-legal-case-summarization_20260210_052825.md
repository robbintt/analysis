# CoPERLex: Content Planning with Event-based Representations for Legal Case Summarization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.14112
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14112
- **Reference count**: 39
- **Primary result**: Three-stage framework combining content selection, event-based planning, and generation outperforms end-to-end approaches on legal case summarization

## Executive Summary
CoPERLex introduces a novel three-stage framework for legal case summarization that explicitly models content selection, planning, and generation. Unlike end-to-end approaches, it first extracts salient content using MemSum, then generates structured event-based plans represented as Subject-Verb-Object tuples, and finally synthesizes coherent summaries. Experiments on four legal datasets demonstrate that integrating content selection and event-centric planning improves both factual accuracy and coherence compared to existing methods.

The framework addresses key challenges in legal summarization including the need for faithfulness to source material and the complexity of legal narratives. Event-based plans outperform entity-centric alternatives by better capturing the narrative structure of legal documents. The approach offers better control over summary content while maintaining coherence, though it currently simplifies event representations and lacks expert validation.

## Method Summary
CoPERLex operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) content selection using MemSum to identify salient sentences from the original legal case, (2) event-based content planning that generates structured Subject-Verb-Object triples representing key events, and (3) summary generation conditioned on both the selected content and the planned events. The framework uses a hybrid training objective that combines planning and generation objectives, with separate evaluation for each component. This modular design allows for better control over the summarization process and improved factual accuracy compared to end-to-end approaches.

## Key Results
- Event-based planning outperforms entity-centric alternatives on legal summarization tasks
- Content selection module (MemSum) improves factual accuracy and coherence
- Hybrid training combining planning and generation objectives yields better performance
- Each component—content selection, planning, and hybrid training—contributes significantly to overall performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its explicit separation of content selection, planning, and generation stages. By first identifying salient content, then structuring it through event-based planning, and finally generating summaries, the system maintains better control over factual accuracy and narrative coherence. The event-based representation captures the narrative structure of legal cases more effectively than entity-centric approaches, while the hybrid training objective ensures that both planning and generation components work synergistically.

## Foundational Learning
- **Event-based representations (SVO triples)**: Capture the narrative structure of legal cases by modeling who did what to whom. Quick check: Verify that generated SVO triples accurately represent key legal events.
- **Content selection with MemSum**: Identifies salient sentences from lengthy legal documents before summarization. Quick check: Evaluate recall of important legal facts in selected content.
- **Hybrid training objectives**: Combines planning and generation objectives to improve overall performance. Quick check: Compare performance with separate training objectives.
- **Legal case structure**: Understanding the typical components of legal documents (facts, issues, holdings, reasoning) to guide content selection and planning.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: MemSum content selection -> Event-based planning -> Summary generation
- **Critical path**: Content selection → Event planning → Summary generation (end-to-end pipeline)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Explicit planning stage adds control but increases complexity; SVO representation simplifies events but may miss temporal/causal relationships
- **Failure signatures**: Poor content selection leads to missing key facts; inadequate planning results in incoherent summaries; generation failures produce grammatically correct but legally inaccurate summaries
- **First experiments**: 1) Evaluate MemSum content selection recall on legal facts, 2) Compare event-based vs entity-centric planning quality, 3) Test hybrid training impact by ablating planning objective

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions including the need for human expert validation of summary quality, exploration of more complex event representations beyond SVO triples, and investigation of temporal and causal modeling in legal narratives. The authors also note the potential for extending the framework to other legal tasks beyond summarization.

## Limitations
- Event representations limited to SVO triples without temporal or causal modeling
- Evaluation relies entirely on automatic metrics without human expert validation
- MemSum content selection lacks detailed error analysis for legal domain-specific phenomena
- Hybrid training objective's component contributions not fully isolated

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Three-stage framework design and ablation study results
- **Medium confidence**: Superiority of event-based planning over entity-centric approaches
- **Medium confidence**: Factual accuracy improvements, pending human evaluation
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability beyond tested legal datasets

## Next Checks
1. Conduct expert legal review to assess summary faithfulness, coherence, and practical utility
2. Compare against temporal/causal event representations to quantify limitations of SVO-only approach
3. Perform ablation studies isolating MemSum content selection quality from downstream generation performance
