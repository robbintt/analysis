# DriftLite: Lightweight Drift Control for Inference-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.21655
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21655
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces training-free inference-time scaling for diffusion models through lightweight drift control, achieving reduced weight variance and stabilized ESS across multiple benchmarks

## Executive Summary
DriftLite introduces a novel training-free framework for inference-time scaling of diffusion models by actively controlling particle drift during sampling. The method exploits a fundamental degree of freedom in the Fokker-Planck equation to minimize reweighting potential variance, formulated through two instantiations: Variance-Controlling Guidance (VCG) and Energy-Controlling Guidance (ECG). Both approaches solve a small linear system per sampling step with minimal computational overhead. Across experiments including Gaussian mixtures, molecular systems, and protein-ligand co-folding, DriftLite demonstrates substantial reductions in weight variance and stabilizes Effective Sample Size, outperforming both pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines.

## Method Summary
The core innovation of DriftLite lies in its exploitation of drift control as a degree of freedom in the Fokker-Planck equation governing diffusion processes. By formulating drift control through two guidance instantiations - VCG minimizes the variance of the reweighting potential while ECG minimizes the second moment of potential energy - DriftLite provides a principled approach to inference-time scaling. Both methods require solving a small linear system at each sampling step, adding minimal computational overhead compared to the underlying diffusion process. The framework operates entirely at inference time without requiring any training or model fine-tuning, making it a lightweight solution for scaling diffusion models.

## Key Results
- VCG and ECG instantiations significantly reduce weight variance compared to standard guidance approaches
- VCG-SMC achieves superior performance with fewer particles than sequential Monte Carlo baselines
- DriftLite demonstrates robust sample quality in high-dimensional molecular simulations including protein-ligand co-folding
- Effective Sample Size remains stable throughout sampling, indicating improved sampling efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DriftLite works by recognizing that the drift term in the Fokker-Planck equation is not uniquely determined by the target distribution. This mathematical freedom allows for strategic manipulation of the sampling dynamics to control the variance of importance weights. By minimizing either the variance of the reweighting potential (VCG) or the second moment of potential energy (ECG), the method ensures that particles remain distributed in regions of high probability mass, preventing the weight degeneracy that typically plagues particle-based sampling methods. The linear system solved at each step effectively re-routes particle trajectories to maintain diversity while converging to the target distribution.

## Foundational Learning

**Fokker-Planck Equation**
- *Why needed:* Provides the mathematical framework for understanding how probability distributions evolve under diffusion processes
- *Quick check:* Verify that the drift control term can be added without violating the conservation of probability

**Importance Sampling**
- *Why needed:* Central to understanding why weight variance matters and how drift control improves sampling efficiency
- *Quick check:* Confirm that weight variance reduction translates to better Effective Sample Size

**Effective Sample Size (ESS)**
- *Why needed:* Key metric for evaluating the quality of particle-based sampling methods
- *Quick check:* ESS should remain high throughout sampling, not just at convergence

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
DriftLite framework: Diffusion Model -> Fokker-Planck Solver -> Drift Control Module -> Linear System Solver -> Sampling Output

**Critical Path**
1. Sample particles from previous timestep
2. Compute drift correction via small linear system
3. Apply drift control to generate new particle positions
4. Compute weights and update ESS
5. Repeat until convergence

**Design Tradeoffs**
The choice between VCG and ECG involves balancing variance reduction against potential bias introduction. VCG provides more aggressive variance reduction but may require more careful tuning of guidance strength. ECG offers more stable behavior but with potentially less dramatic improvements in high-variance regimes.

**Failure Signatures**
- If the linear system becomes ill-conditioned, weight variance may actually increase
- Excessive guidance strength can lead to mode collapse in multimodal distributions
- Computational overhead may become prohibitive for extremely large particle counts

**3 First Experiments**
1. Gaussian mixture model with known modes to verify drift control maintains diversity
2. Low-dimensional particle system (DW-4) to benchmark against SMC baselines
3. Protein-ligand co-folding with varying guidance strengths to assess stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical evaluation relies primarily on synthetic and molecular simulation tasks
- Performance on real-world high-dimensional data beyond tested protein-ligand co-folding remains unexplored
- Computational overhead of solving linear systems may become significant at extreme scale

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The theoretical foundation linking drift control to variance minimization in the Fokker-Planck framework is well-established and mathematically sound.

**Medium Confidence:** The empirical superiority over pure guidance and SMC baselines is demonstrated, but the sample efficiency gains in VCG-SMC require further validation across diverse, real-world datasets.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim of "training-free" scaling is accurate for the guidance mechanism, but the practical impact on downstream task performance beyond sample quality metrics needs more investigation.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DriftLite on high-dimensional real-world datasets (e.g., image generation, natural language modeling) to assess generalizability beyond molecular simulations.
2. Benchmark the wall-clock inference time and memory usage of DriftLite against state-of-the-art inference-time scaling methods to quantify practical overhead.
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of VCG vs. ECG instantiations to determine which guidance formulation is most effective for different distribution characteristics.
