## Executive Summary
This paper presents Coupled Data and Measurement Space Diffusion Posterior Sampling (C-DPS), a novel framework for solving inverse problems using diffusion models. Unlike prior methods that retrofit measurement consistency or approximate likelihood terms, C-DPS introduces a parallel diffusion process in the measurement space evolving alongside the data-space process. This coupling enables the derivation of a closed-form posterior distribution, eliminating the need for heuristic constraints or learned likelihood approximations. The method employs a scalable, matrix-free implementation using pre-whitened conjugate gradient solvers.

The authors demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple inverse problems including inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution on FFHQ and ImageNet benchmarks. C-DPS shows improved measurement fidelity and better posterior recovery compared to existing diffusion-based approaches, with particular advantages in maintaining measurement consistency while generating high-quality reconstructions.

## Method Summary
C-DPS solves linear inverse problems by jointly evolving data and measurement spaces through coupled diffusion processes. Starting from noisy measurements y = Ax₀ + n, the method performs a forward diffusion in measurement space {yₜ} alongside the standard data-space diffusion. At each timestep, a closed-form posterior distribution is derived using the measurement-space statistics, which is then sampled via a pre-whitened conjugate gradient solver. This approach provides exact measurement consistency without requiring learned likelihood approximations or heuristic constraints. The method leverages pre-trained score networks and scales efficiently through matrix-free operations.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art FID, LPIPS, and SSIM scores across inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks on FFHQ and ImageNet datasets
- Demonstrates improved measurement fidelity compared to baseline methods including DPS, DDRM, MCG, and ReSample
- Shows better posterior recovery on ground-truth mixture model benchmark compared to existing diffusion-based inverse problem solvers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The coupling between data and measurement spaces enables exact posterior sampling by leveraging the measurement-space diffusion statistics. By deriving a closed-form posterior at each timestep, C-DPS avoids the need for learned likelihood approximations or post-hoc measurement consistency enforcement. The pre-whitened conjugate gradient solver provides efficient sampling from high-dimensional posteriors while maintaining scalability through matrix-free operations.

## Foundational Learning
**Linear inverse problems** - Recovery of unknown signal x₀ from measurements y = Ax₀ + n; needed for defining the reconstruction task and measurement operators.
**Diffusion probabilistic models** - Forward noising process with learnable reverse process; needed as the base framework for posterior sampling.
**Conjugate gradient methods** - Iterative solver for linear systems; needed for efficient posterior sampling in high dimensions.
**Measurement space modeling** - Evolution of measurement statistics alongside data space; needed for deriving closed-form posteriors.
**Matrix-free operations** - Avoiding explicit matrix computations; needed for scalability to high-resolution images.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Pre-trained score network -> Forward diffusion (data/measurement) -> Posterior precision computation -> PW-CG solver -> Sampling step

**Critical path:** For each timestep t: (1) Compute measurement-space statistics {yₜ}, (2) Calculate posterior precision Λₜ, (3) Solve for posterior mean and sample noise via PW-CG, (4) Update xₜ₋₁

**Design tradeoffs:** Exact measurement consistency vs. computational overhead of CG solver; closed-form posterior vs. flexibility of learned likelihood models; scalability through matrix-free operations vs. convergence guarantees.

**Failure signatures:** Poor reconstruction quality when CG solver fails to converge; numerical instability in posterior computation when αₜ approaches 0 or 1; degraded performance on highly ill-conditioned measurement matrices.

**First experiments:** (1) Verify CG solver convergence on simple measurement operators with varying conditioning, (2) Test posterior recovery on synthetic problems with known ground truth, (3) Validate measurement consistency by checking Ax̂ ≈ y for recovered solutions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
The method assumes Gaussian priors and noise, which may not hold for all inverse problems. The coupling strength between data and measurement spaces is implicitly controlled by the noise schedule, but optimal coupling schedules for different problem types remain unexplored. Scalability depends on efficient CG convergence, yet convergence rates for ill-conditioned measurement matrices are not characterized.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Empirical performance improvements over baseline methods (FID, LPIPS, SSIM metrics on FFHQ/ImageNet); correctness of the measurement-space diffusion process formulation; scalability claims via PW-CG implementation.

**Medium Confidence:** Claims about posterior distribution quality without ground-truth availability; generalization to non-Gaussian noise or non-linear measurement models; sensitivity to noise schedule parameters.

**Low Confidence:** Claims about "first" closed-form posterior derivation in diffusion-based inverse problems; theoretical guarantees for posterior convergence; comparison with future methods using similar measurement-space coupling approaches.

## Next Checks
1. Test CG convergence rates across different measurement operators (particularly highly subsampled masks) and document iteration counts vs. problem conditioning.
2. Validate posterior recovery on synthetic problems with known ground-truth posteriors beyond the mixture model example.
3. Evaluate sensitivity to noise schedule choices by systematically varying αₜ progression and measuring impact on reconstruction quality.
