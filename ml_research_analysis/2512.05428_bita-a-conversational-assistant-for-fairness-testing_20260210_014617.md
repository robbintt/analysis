# Bita: A Conversational Assistant for Fairness Testing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05428
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05428
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Bita enables conversational fairness testing with literature-grounded recommendations for bias detection, test plan evaluation, and exploratory charters.

## Executive Summary
Bita is a conversational assistant designed to make fairness testing accessible to practitioners without machine learning expertise. It integrates large language models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground responses in curated fairness literature. The system supports three tasks: identifying bias sources, evaluating test plans, and generating exploratory testing charters. Bita was evaluated on real-world AI systems including a sign language translator and Smart Lipstick app, demonstrating its ability to detect fairness concerns and provide actionable testing guidance.

## Method Summary
Bita combines a large language model with retrieval-augmented generation to provide fairness testing assistance through natural language conversation. The system uses SentenceTransformer for query vectorization, matches against a curated fairness literature index, and merges retrieved context with user prompts before LLM processing. It supports multi-turn dialogue with session persistence stored in SQL, allowing progressive refinement of assessments. The architecture dynamically selects between ChatGPT and Gemini models based on runtime requirements.

## Key Results
- Successfully identified fairness concerns in sign language translator and Smart Lipstick applications
- Generated actionable testing guidance that detected missed bias sources
- Provided context-specific recommendations while maintaining traceability to fairness literature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented grounding reduces hallucination and improves traceability of fairness recommendations.
- Mechanism: User queries are vectorized via SentenceTransformer, matched against a curated fairness literature index, and retrieved segments are combined with prompts before LLM processing.
- Core assumption: The curated corpus adequately covers the fairness concepts needed for diverse system types.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Bita integrates a large language model with retrieval-augmented generation, grounding its responses in curated fairness literature." [section 3.1] "Retrieved outputs are combined with user prompts to ground responses in verified knowledge."
- Break condition: If the literature index lacks coverage for novel domains, retrieved context becomes sparse.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Conversational interaction lowers expertise barriers by translating fairness concepts into actionable testing guidance.
- Mechanism: Natural language input allows testers to describe systems without writing code or configuring fairness libraries.
- Core assumption: Testers can articulate system context sufficiently in natural language.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Bita lowers the expertise barrier for fairness testing by making complex fairness concepts accessible to practitioners without specialized machine learning knowledge."
- Break condition: If testers lack domain vocabulary to describe fairness-relevant attributes, input ambiguity increases.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-turn dialogue with session persistence enables progressive refinement of fairness assessments.
- Mechanism: Interaction data is stored in SQL, allowing subsequent prompts to incorporate prior context.
- Core assumption: Stored history correctly informs future retrieval and reasoning.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4] "This structure supports multi-turn dialogue continuity, reproducibility of previous sessions."
- Break condition: If session data is not meaningfully integrated into retrieval or prompt construction.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: Bita's core architecture relies on RAG to ground LLM outputs in fairness literature.
  - Quick check question: Given a user query about "equalized odds," can you trace how it would be vectorized, matched to literature, and merged into the final prompt?

- Concept: Fairness Testing Taxonomy
  - Why needed here: Bita structures assistance around three tasks; understanding their distinctions ensures correct usage.
  - Quick check question: For a sentiment analysis API, what is the difference between identifying bias sources, evaluating a test plan, and generating an exploratory charter?

- Concept: Prompt Engineering Strategies
  - Why needed here: Bita's output quality depends on prompt design.
  - Quick check question: How would you modify the role prompt if Bita were adapted for a non-technical stakeholder audience?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Frontend -> RAG pipeline (SentenceTransformer encoder -> fairness literature index -> LLM with dynamic model selection) -> Database (SQL store for session history) -> Prompt layer (few-shot, instruction-based, role prompting)

- Critical path: 1. User submits system description → 2. Query vectorized → 3. Literature retrieval → 4. Context + query merged into structured prompt → 5. LLM generates response → 6. Response returned + stored in session DB

- Design tradeoffs: LLM model selection provides flexibility vs. reproducibility; RAG grounds responses but adds latency; conversational interface improves accessibility but assumes testers can articulate system context clearly.

- Failure signatures: Generic or hallucinated recommendations (retrieval failure); repetitive responses across turns (session context not integrated); out-of-scope advice (guardrails not triggered).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test retrieval relevance by submitting queries for well-documented fairness concepts vs. underrepresented domains.
  2. Evaluate multi-turn coherence by conducting a 5-turn session refining a test plan.
  3. Compare output quality between ChatGPT and Gemini for identical prompts and retrieval contexts.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does Bita perform when deployed in real-world industrial testing environments with practicing software testers?
- What organizational and individual barriers hinder adoption of conversational fairness testing assistants in software teams?
- How effectively does Bita generalize to AI systems beyond computer vision and NLP applications?

## Limitations

- Evaluation focuses on only two specific real-world systems, limiting generalization to other AI domains.
- Effectiveness of RAG grounding depends entirely on the comprehensiveness of the curated fairness literature corpus.
- Claim that Bita lowers expertise barriers lacks empirical validation through user studies.

## Confidence

- High: The RAG-based grounding mechanism reduces hallucination and improves traceability of fairness recommendations.
- Medium: The conversational interface lowers expertise barriers for fairness testing.
- Low: The effectiveness of multi-turn dialogue for progressive refinement of fairness assessments.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic audit of the fairness literature corpus to identify coverage gaps across different AI domains and fairness concepts.
2. Perform a user study with practitioners of varying ML expertise levels to measure actual usability improvements and whether recommendations align with user needs.
3. Evaluate retrieval relevance and recommendation quality across a broader set of AI systems to assess generalizability.
