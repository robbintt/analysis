# Building Safe GenAI Applications: An End-to-End Overview of Red Teaming for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.01742
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01742
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive survey of red teaming strategies for LLMs covering attack methods, evaluation techniques, and safety metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of red teaming strategies for large language models (LLMs), covering attack methods, evaluation techniques, and safety metrics. It categorizes attacks into prompt-based, token-based, gradient-based, and infrastructure attacks, distinguishing between single-turn and multi-turn strategies. The paper also reviews evaluation approaches, including keyword-based, encoder-based, LLM-as-a-judge, and human evaluation. It discusses various safety metrics like Attack Success Rate (ASR), Attack Effectiveness Rate (AER), and measures of toxicity, compliance, relevance, and fluency. The survey highlights available public resources, including frameworks and datasets, and outlines future directions such as improving automated multi-turn red teaming and developing standardized evaluation metrics.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing research on red teaming methodologies for LLMs through systematic literature review. It organizes attack methods into four main categories based on their technical approach, then further subdivides these by execution strategy (single-turn vs multi-turn). Evaluation frameworks are analyzed across four methodological approaches, with corresponding safety metrics defined for each. The survey methodology involved reviewing 35 key references to construct a comprehensive taxonomy of red teaming approaches and their associated evaluation methodologies.

## Key Results
- Categorization of attacks into prompt-based, token-based, gradient-based, and infrastructure attacks with single-turn and multi-turn distinctions
- Comprehensive review of evaluation approaches including keyword-based, encoder-based, LLM-as-a-judge, and human evaluation methods
- Discussion of safety metrics including ASR, AER, toxicity, compliance, relevance, and fluency measures
- Identification of public resources including frameworks and datasets for red teaming research
- Future directions highlighting need for automated multi-turn red teaming and standardized evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's categorization framework works by systematically organizing the complex landscape of LLM red teaming into discrete, analyzable components. By distinguishing between attack vectors (prompt-based, token-based, gradient-based, infrastructure) and execution strategies (single-turn vs multi-turn), the framework enables practitioners to identify specific vulnerability classes and appropriate defensive measures. The evaluation methodology mapping ensures that safety metrics are aligned with the specific attack types being measured, creating a coherent framework for assessing model robustness. The inclusion of multiple evaluation approaches (keyword-based, encoder-based, LLM-as-a-judge, human evaluation) acknowledges that different attack types require different assessment methodologies, while the standardized safety metrics provide quantitative benchmarks for comparison across studies.

## Foundational Learning

**Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: Measures the percentage of successful attacks out of total attempts. *Why needed*: Provides quantitative baseline for attack effectiveness. *Quick check*: ASR should be calculated per attack type and compared across model versions.

**Attack Effectiveness Rate (AER)**: Measures severity or impact of successful attacks. *Why needed*: Distinguishes between attacks that succeed but have minimal impact versus those causing significant harm. *Quick check*: AER should be normalized against attack complexity.

**Multi-turn vs Single-turn attacks**: Distinguishes between attacks requiring multiple interaction turns versus single-shot attempts. *Why needed*: Multi-turn attacks can exploit temporal dependencies and model state. *Quick check*: Track attack success rates separately for each category.

**Evaluation framework selection**: Different attack types require different evaluation methodologies. *Why needed*: Keyword-based methods work for simple prompt injection but fail for nuanced semantic attacks. *Quick check*: Match evaluation method to attack sophistication level.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Attack Generator -> Target LLM -> Response Evaluator -> Safety Metric Calculator -> Results Aggregator

**Critical path**: Attack generation and execution flow through to safety metric calculation determines the primary measurement pipeline

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Single-turn attacks offer simplicity but miss temporal exploitation opportunities
- Automated evaluation scales well but may miss nuanced harms that human evaluation catches
- Keyword-based evaluation is fast but shallow compared to semantic analysis methods

**Failure signatures**:
- High ASR but low AER suggests attacks are succeeding but not causing meaningful harm
- High human evaluation scores but low automated metric scores indicates model behavior that humans perceive as safe but automated systems flag
- Inconsistent results across evaluation methods suggests evaluation framework bias or attack sophistication

**First experiments**:
1. Test baseline ASR for simple prompt injection attacks across multiple model families
2. Compare single-turn versus multi-turn attack success rates on the same target models
3. Evaluate consistency between keyword-based and encoder-based evaluation methods on identical attack datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to effectively automate multi-turn red teaming at scale
- What standardized evaluation metrics should be adopted across the research community
- How to balance automated and human evaluation methods for optimal safety assessment
- Whether current safety metrics adequately capture emerging threat vectors

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation of attack effectiveness across different LLM families
- Absence of systematic comparison between single-turn and multi-turn attack strategies
- Limited discussion of adversarial attacks against specialized LLM applications (e.g., code generation, medical diagnosis)
- Potential bias in reference selection given the rapidly evolving nature of red teaming research

## Confidence
- **High**: Safety metric definitions (ASR, AER, toxicity measures) as these are standard metrics in the field
- **Medium**: Categorization of attack methods as distinct categories, as boundaries can overlap in practice and effectiveness depends on specific LLM architecture and deployment context
- **Medium**: Practical applicability of safety metrics varies across different use cases and evaluation frameworks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic benchmark testing of the categorized attack methods across multiple LLM architectures to verify claimed effectiveness and identify cross-category vulnerabilities
2. Implement controlled experiments comparing single-turn versus multi-turn attack strategies on the same target models to quantify relative success rates
3. Develop and validate a standardized evaluation framework that incorporates the discussed metrics while accounting for domain-specific safety requirements and user context variations
