# Incentive-Aligned Multi-Source LLM Summaries

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25184
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25184
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Improved factual accuracy and robustness in LLM-driven multi-source summarization via Truthful Text Summarization (TTS) framework

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces Truthful Text Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework for LLM-driven multi-source summarization. TTS addresses the problem of unreliable sources and strategic manipulation in current summarization pipelines by decomposing documents into atomic claims, eliciting each source's stance on every claim, and scoring sources using a multi-task peer prediction mechanism that rewards informative corroboration. This approach filters out low-scoring, unreliable sources before re-summarizing, structurally aligning source incentives with truthful reporting. The theoretical analysis establishes formal guarantees of informed and strong truthfulness, showing that truthful reporting maximizes a source's expected score and inclusion probability, especially as the claim count grows.

## Method Summary
The TTS framework decomposes documents into atomic claims and uses LLM-based stance elicitation to determine each source's position on each claim. Sources are scored via a multi-task peer prediction mechanism that rewards informative corroboration. Low-scoring sources are filtered out before final summarization. This creates incentive alignment where truthful, high-quality reporting maximizes inclusion probability. The approach combines theoretical guarantees of truthful incentive alignment with practical LLM-based implementation for multi-source summarization.

## Key Results
- Factual accuracy improvements: answer accuracy up to 70.7% on Natural Questions and 74.3% on ClashEval datasets
- Significant improvements in precision and robustness against adversarial or deceptive content compared to baselines
- Prevention of uninformative equilibria while improving fluency in generated summaries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by structurally aligning source incentives with truthful reporting through a peer prediction mechanism that rewards informative corroboration. By decomposing documents into atomic claims and eliciting stances, the system creates multiple independent opportunities for sources to demonstrate reliability. The multi-task peer prediction mechanism evaluates sources across all claims, making strategic manipulation costly and unlikely to succeed. This creates a Nash equilibrium where truthful reporting is the dominant strategy for sources seeking inclusion.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-task peer prediction**: Needed to evaluate source reliability across multiple claims simultaneously; quick check: ensures sources can't game the system by being truthful on only a few claims
- **Claim decomposition**: Required to create atomic units of information that can be independently verified; quick check: enables fine-grained reliability assessment
- **Incentive alignment theory**: Essential for proving that truthful reporting maximizes expected reward; quick check: establishes theoretical foundation for practical implementation
- **LLM-based stance elicitation**: Critical for automating the reliability assessment process; quick check: must maintain consistency across different claims and sources
- **Nash equilibrium analysis**: Required to prove truthful reporting is the dominant strategy; quick check: ensures system stability under strategic behavior
- **Reliability scoring aggregation**: Needed to combine multiple claim-level assessments into overall source quality; quick check: prevents manipulation through selective truthfulness

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Document -> Claim Decomposition -> Stance Elicitation -> Peer Prediction Scoring -> Source Filtering -> Re-summarization

**Critical path**: Claim decomposition and stance elicitation must complete before peer prediction scoring can begin; source filtering must finish before final re-summarization

**Design tradeoffs**: Multi-task peer prediction vs. computational overhead; fine-grained claim decomposition vs. LLM processing limits; source filtering strictness vs. information retention

**Failure signatures**: Inconsistent stance elicitation across similar claims; peer prediction scores failing to discriminate reliable from unreliable sources; computational bottlenecks during claim processing

**3 first experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison with no source filtering on NQ dataset; 2) Ablation study removing peer prediction mechanism; 3) Stress test with intentionally deceptive sources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees depend on idealized assumptions about peer prediction mechanism performance
- Current evaluation limited to two structured datasets, limiting generalizability
- Scalability concerns with increasing claim numbers and computational overhead

## Confidence
- **Core claims about factual accuracy improvements**: High
- **Theoretical guarantees of incentive alignment**: Medium
- **Generalizability across diverse domains**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Stress-test framework with adversarial, highly heterogeneous, and deliberately deceptive source inputs
2. Evaluate computational and runtime scalability as claim numbers increase
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify impact of each component on overall performance
