# How AI Fails: An Interactive Pedagogical Tool for Demonstrating Dialectal Bias in Automated Toxicity Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06676
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06676
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: Interactive tool demonstrates systematic bias in toxicity detection against African-American English

## Executive Summary
This study reveals significant bias in automated toxicity detection systems against African-American English (AAE), demonstrating that the unitary/toxic-bert model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for "identity hate" compared to Standard American English. To make these biases tangible and educational, the research introduces an interactive pedagogical tool that allows users to adjust sensitivity thresholds and observe how biased model scores combined with human-set policies lead to discriminatory outcomes. The tool uses dialectally matched sentence pairs to demonstrate that at any given threshold, AAE text is more likely to be incorrectly flagged as toxic, illustrating the real-world impact of algorithmic bias in content moderation.

## Method Summary
The study employed a quantitative benchmark approach to measure bias in the unitary/toxic-bert toxicity detection model. Researchers created dialectally matched sentence pairs in African-American English and Standard American English, then compared the model's toxicity scores between these variants. The interactive pedagogical tool was developed using web technologies to visualize how different sensitivity thresholds affect content moderation outcomes. Users can manipulate the threshold parameter and observe the differential impact on AAE versus SAE text, demonstrating how algorithmic bias manifests in real-world moderation decisions.

## Key Results
- unitary/toxic-bert scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic than Standard American English
- The same model scores AAE text 8.8 times higher for "identity hate" classifications
- At any sensitivity threshold, AAE text is more likely to be incorrectly flagged as toxic than SAE text

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by exploiting the mismatch between how toxicity detection models are trained on Standard American English data and how they perform on African-American English text. The models learn patterns and linguistic features from predominantly SAE training data, leading to systematic misclassifications when encountering AAE. The interactive tool makes this invisible bias visible by allowing users to see the direct correlation between biased model outputs and discriminatory content moderation outcomes when combined with human-set thresholds.

## Foundational Learning
- Dialectal linguistics and AAE features: Understanding linguistic differences between AAE and SAE is crucial for recognizing why models misclassify AAE text
  - Quick check: Can identify key phonological, grammatical, and lexical features that distinguish AAE from SAE
- Machine learning model bias: Knowledge of how training data distribution affects model performance on underrepresented groups
  - Quick check: Understand how imbalanced training data leads to systematic errors on minority dialects
- Content moderation policy implementation: How model scores translate into real-world moderation decisions through threshold setting
  - Quick check: Can trace the path from model output score to platform enforcement action

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Interactive Web Interface -> Toxicity Model (unitary/toxic-bert) -> Threshold Slider -> Visual Output Display

### Critical Path
User adjusts threshold slider → Interface queries model with AAE/SAE sentence pairs → Model returns toxicity scores → Interface calculates false positive rates → Visual display updates showing discriminatory outcomes

### Design Tradeoffs
The interactive approach prioritizes pedagogical clarity over comprehensive model testing. By focusing on a single model and using simplified sentence pairs, the tool achieves accessibility but may oversimplify the complexity of real-world content moderation systems.

### Failure Signatures
- If threshold is set too low: Both dialects flagged as toxic, but AAE still disproportionately affected
- If threshold is set too high: Both dialects pass moderation, but AAE content still faces higher scrutiny
- If model is retrained: Tool becomes less effective at demonstrating the original bias

### First Experiments
1. Test baseline false positive rates at default threshold setting
2. Vary threshold incrementally to map the discrimination curve
3. Compare outcomes across multiple dialectally matched sentence pairs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses on a single toxicity detection model, limiting generalizability to other platforms
- Dialectal text pairs may not capture full linguistic diversity within African-American English
- Does not examine actual real-world content moderation data, relying on simulated outcomes

## Confidence
- High confidence in quantitative benchmark results for the tested model
- Medium confidence in interactive tool's pedagogical effectiveness
- Medium confidence in real-world implications of findings
- Low confidence in generalizability across different toxicity detection systems

## Next Checks
1. Test additional toxicity detection models using the same benchmark methodology to assess systematic AAE bias
2. Conduct user studies with content moderators to evaluate how the tool affects their understanding of algorithmic bias
3. Collect longitudinal data on actual content moderation outcomes across platforms to quantify real-world impact
