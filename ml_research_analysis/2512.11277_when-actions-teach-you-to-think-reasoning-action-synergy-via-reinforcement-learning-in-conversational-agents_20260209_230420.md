# When Actions Teach You to Think: Reasoning-Action Synergy via Reinforcement Learning in Conversational Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.11277
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11277
- **Authors:** Mrinal Rawat; Arkajyoti Chakraborty; Neha Gupta; Roberto Pieraccini
- **Reference count:** 4
- **Primary result:** RL fine-tuning with GRPO achieves 1.5% relative improvement over SFT model and 40% gain over vanilla Qwen3-1.7B on tool-augmented conversational benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel three-stage training pipeline for improving reasoning and action capabilities in conversational agents without requiring expensive reasoning annotations. The approach combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging composite rewards that balance multiple aspects of reasoning and tool usage. By demonstrating that reinforcement learning can teach effective reasoning strategies directly from task outcomes, the method achieves significant performance gains on established tool-augmented conversational benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a three-stage training pipeline: (1) Base SFT to establish foundational task execution capabilities, (2) Cold-Start Reasoning SFT using a small (<100 samples) reasoning-annotated dataset to initialize structured thinking patterns, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize reasoning and actions through composite rewards. These rewards balance conditional decision-making between using tools versus direct answers, tool accuracy, reasoning efficiency, format compliance, and final answer correctness. The approach is evaluated on tool-augmented conversational benchmarks (APIGen-MT-5k and Almita), showing that RL can learn effective reasoning strategies directly from task outcomes.

## Key Results
- RL approach achieves 1.5% relative improvement over SFT model trained without explicit thinking
- 40% performance gain compared to vanilla Qwen3-1.7B model
- Demonstrates that RL can effectively learn reasoning strategies from task outcomes
- Improved generalization and performance on tool-augmented conversational benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize both reasoning and action decisions simultaneously, rather than treating them as separate sequential processes. The composite reward function creates a feedback loop where the agent learns to balance tool selection, reasoning efficiency, and answer correctness through trial and error. The cold-start phase with limited reasoning annotations provides sufficient structure for the RL phase to build upon, while the GRPO algorithm enables stable learning through group-relative advantage estimation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning with GRPO:** Needed to jointly optimize reasoning and actions through trial-and-error learning; quick check: verify gradient stability during RL training
- **Composite Reward Design:** Required to balance multiple objectives (tool selection, efficiency, accuracy); quick check: analyze reward contribution distribution
- **Cold-Start Reasoning Initialization:** Necessary to bootstrap structured thinking before RL fine-tuning; quick check: measure reasoning trace quality before and after cold-start phase
- **Tool-Augmented Conversational Benchmarks:** Essential for evaluating integrated reasoning-action capabilities; quick check: verify benchmark task completion metrics
- **Group Relative Policy Optimization:** Enables stable learning by comparing policies within groups; quick check: monitor policy entropy and KL divergence
- **Multi-Stage Training Pipeline:** Allows progressive skill development from basic execution to complex reasoning; quick check: track performance at each training stage

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
SFT Base -> Cold-Start Reasoning SFT -> GRPO RL Fine-tuning -> Composite Reward Computation

### Critical Path
1. Input prompt → reasoning trace generation
2. Tool selection decision → API call execution
3. Reward computation from outcomes
4. Policy update via GRPO
5. Output answer generation

### Design Tradeoffs
- Small reasoning dataset (<100 samples) vs. annotation cost
- Composite rewards complexity vs. learning stability
- GRPO group size vs. computational efficiency
- Reasoning depth vs. response latency

### Failure Signatures
- Reward collapse to single component
- Policy divergence during RL fine-tuning
- Over-reliance on tools vs. direct reasoning
- Degraded performance on unseen reasoning patterns

### First 3 Experiments
1. Ablation study removing individual reward components
2. Sensitivity analysis varying composite reward weights
3. Transfer learning evaluation on new reasoning domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Small-scale reasoning-annotated datasets (<100 samples) may limit generalizability to more complex reasoning patterns
- Lack of sensitivity analysis for composite reward function weights raises questions about robustness
- Baseline comparison against vanilla Qwen3-1.7B may not represent state-of-the-art approaches
- Evaluation focuses on task completion metrics without assessing reasoning trace interpretability

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Experimental setup and benchmark selection (APIGen-MT-5k, Almita)
- **High confidence:** Overall methodology structure (SFT → cold-start → RL fine-tuning)
- **Medium confidence:** Relative improvement claims (1.5% over SFT, 40% over vanilla) due to small dataset size and missing sensitivity analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying the weights of each component in the composite reward function to determine sensitivity and identify which reward signals drive the most significant improvements.
2. Test the approach on additional reasoning-augmented datasets with different complexity levels and domain characteristics to evaluate generalization beyond the current benchmarks.
3. Implement human evaluation of reasoning trace quality and interpretability alongside task completion metrics to assess the practical utility of the learned reasoning strategies.
