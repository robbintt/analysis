# Generalization in VAE and Diffusion Models: A Unified Information-Theoretic Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00849
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00849
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Unified framework analyzing VAE and DM generalization via information-theoretic bounds, showing trade-offs with diffusion time and improved VAE analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a unified information-theoretic framework to analyze the generalization capabilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). The key innovation is treating the encoder and generator as randomized mappings and deriving bounds on the divergence between generated and original data distributions. The framework provides three main contributions: improved analysis for VAEs by considering both encoder and generator generalization, explicit trade-offs in generalization terms for DMs depending on diffusion time T, and computable bounds for DMs based solely on training data. Empirical results validate the theory, showing that longer diffusion time does not necessarily lead to better generalization and that the proposed bounds can guide hyperparameter selection and optimization.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a unified framework that models both VAEs and DMs as randomized mappings between data and latent spaces. They derive generalization bounds by bounding the expected divergence between generated and true data distributions, incorporating both encoder and generator generalization. For VAEs, the framework improves upon prior analysis by explicitly considering the generalization of both components. For DMs, the framework explicitly characterizes the trade-off between different generalization terms as a function of diffusion time T, providing computable bounds based only on training data without requiring access to the true data distribution.

## Key Results
- Provides improved generalization analysis for VAEs by considering both encoder and generator generalization simultaneously
- Shows explicit trade-offs in DM generalization terms as a function of diffusion time T
- Demonstrates that longer diffusion time does not necessarily lead to better generalization
- Proposes computable bounds for DMs based solely on training data, enabling practical hyperparameter selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating the encoder and generator as randomized mappings, allowing for information-theoretic analysis of how well the learned generative model generalizes to unseen data. By deriving bounds on the divergence between generated and true distributions, the framework quantifies the trade-offs between different sources of generalization error. For DMs, the explicit dependence on diffusion time T reveals how the forward and reverse processes affect the final generalization performance, providing insight into optimal hyperparameter selection.

## Foundational Learning

**Information-theoretic generalization bounds**
- Why needed: To quantify how well generative models generalize beyond training data
- Quick check: Verify that bounds properly scale with sample size and model complexity

**Randomized mappings in generative models**
- Why needed: To model the stochastic nature of both encoder and generator in VAEs and DMs
- Quick check: Ensure mappings satisfy sub-Gaussian assumptions for bound validity

**Divergence between distributions**
- Why needed: To measure the discrepancy between generated and true data distributions
- Quick check: Confirm that chosen divergence measure (e.g., KL divergence) is appropriate for the problem

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
VAE: Data -> Encoder -> Latent -> Generator -> Generated Data
DM: Data -> Forward Diffusion -> Latent -> Reverse Diffusion -> Generated Data

**Critical path:**
1. Define randomized mappings for encoder/generator
2. Derive generalization bounds using information-theoretic techniques
3. Characterize trade-offs as function of diffusion time (for DMs)
4. Compute bounds from training data
5. Validate bounds empirically

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Accuracy vs. computability of bounds (tighter bounds may be harder to compute)
- Sub-Gaussian assumptions vs. model flexibility
- Explicit trade-offs in DMs vs. simpler unified bounds

**Failure signatures:**
- Bounds become vacuous if sub-Gaussian assumptions violated
- Poor empirical validation on complex real-world datasets
- Inability to capture mode collapse or other failure modes

**First experiments:**
1. Verify bound tightness on synthetic datasets with known ground truth
2. Test bound behavior as function of sample size and model complexity
3. Validate hyperparameter selection guidance on real datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Strong sub-Gaussian assumptions on encoder and generator mappings may not hold for all neural architectures
- Analysis focuses on divergence-based generalization bounds without accounting for mode collapse or other generative model failure modes
- Empirical validation uses synthetic datasets and limited real-world benchmarks, requiring broader testing

## Confidence

**High:** Theoretical derivation of bounds for both VAEs and DMs under unified framework
**Medium:** Practical utility of bounds for hyperparameter selection based on synthetic experiments
**Low:** Generalizability of findings to complex real-world datasets and modern large-scale diffusion models

## Next Checks
1. Test proposed bounds on diverse real-world datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with varying data complexities and distributions
2. Evaluate framework with different neural network architectures beyond standard VAEs and DMs, including flow-based models and normalizing flows
3. Conduct ablation studies on impact of sub-Gaussian assumptions by testing with models that violate these conditions and measuring bound tightness in practice
