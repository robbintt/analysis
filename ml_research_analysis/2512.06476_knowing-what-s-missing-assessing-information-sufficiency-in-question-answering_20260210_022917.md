# Knowing What's Missing: Assessing Information Sufficiency in Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.06476
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06476
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Novel framework for identifying missing information in QA contexts achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop and answerability benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of determining whether a given context contains sufficient information to answer a question, particularly for complex inferential questions requiring reasoning beyond direct text extraction. The authors introduce an "Identify-then-Verify" framework that reframes sufficiency assessment as explicitly identifying what information is missing. The method generates multiple hypotheses about missing information through self-consistency, establishes semantic consensus among these hypotheses, and performs a final verification step to guard against hallucination. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over strong baselines across diverse benchmarks, with particular effectiveness for multi-hop reasoning and inferential questions.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through three key stages: First, it uses self-consistency to generate multiple hypotheses about missing information by running the model N times with different random seeds. Second, it establishes semantic consensus by comparing these hypotheses and selecting those that share sufficient semantic similarity. Third, it performs a verification step where the model determines whether the identified gaps are genuinely necessary for answering the question. The approach is designed to be adaptable to different sufficiency criteria through tunable verification strictness, allowing it to handle both strict literal matching and more pragmatic inference-based definitions of sufficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, improving over previous best models
- Demonstrates superior ability to identify multiple missing information gaps compared to baseline approaches
- Shows strong generalization across diverse sufficiency criteria from different datasets
- Particularly effective for inferential questions requiring reasoning beyond direct text extraction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its explicit treatment of missing information identification as a core component of sufficiency assessment. By generating multiple hypotheses through self-consistency, it captures the inherent uncertainty in identifying what information is truly missing. The semantic consensus mechanism filters out noise and hallucination by requiring multiple independent runs to agree on similar missing information. The verification step provides a crucial guardrail against false positives by ensuring that identified gaps are actually necessary for answering the question.

## Foundational Learning
**Semantic Similarity Thresholding** - Required for determining when different hypotheses refer to the same missing information concept. Quick check: Verify that a similarity threshold of 0.3 effectively distinguishes semantically related from unrelated gap hypotheses across different question types.

**Self-Consistency Sampling** - Essential for generating diverse hypotheses about missing information. Quick check: Confirm that 5 samples provide sufficient diversity while remaining computationally tractable compared to higher numbers.

**Pragmatic vs. Literal Verification** - Critical for adapting to different dataset definitions of sufficiency. Quick check: Validate that the verification strictness can be tuned appropriately between datasets like FaithEval (pragmatic) and SQuAD v2 (literal).

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Question + Context -> Self-Consistency Generator -> Semantic Consensus Filter -> Verification Module -> Sufficiency Assessment

**Critical Path**
The verification step is the critical path as it serves as the final arbiter of whether identified gaps are truly necessary. This step must be both accurate and efficient to maintain overall framework performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework balances comprehensiveness of missing information identification against computational cost. While self-consistency with N=5 samples provides good coverage, it introduces latency. The semantic consensus threshold trades off between precision (higher threshold) and recall (lower threshold) in gap identification.

**Failure Signatures**
Common failure modes include: hallucination during self-consistency generation leading to false gap hypotheses, overly strict semantic consensus missing related but differently worded gaps, and verification errors where necessary gaps are incorrectly deemed sufficient.

**First Experiments**
1. Ablation study removing semantic consensus to quantify its impact on hallucination reduction
2. Sensitivity analysis varying the self-consistency sample count (N=3, 5, 7) to find optimal accuracy-efficiency tradeoff
3. Cross-dataset validation testing framework adaptability between strict and pragmatic sufficiency definitions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can methods be developed to automatically determine the optimal verification strictness (e.g., pragmatic inference vs. literal matching) for a given task or domain without manual configuration?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations that the framework's adaptability is "currently guided by a manually set strictness definition" and suggest developing methods to make this autonomous.
- Why unresolved: The current framework requires manual tuning of the verification prompt to align with specific dataset definitions of sufficiency (e.g., the discrepancy between FaithEval and SQuAD v2).
- What evidence would resolve it: An adaptive mechanism or meta-classifier that dynamically selects the verification strictness level based on the input question type or target application requirements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the computational cost of the self-consistency step be reduced while maintaining the diversity and quality of gap hypotheses?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that the self-consistency step (N=5 runs) "introduces a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost" and invite future research on efficient sampling.
- Why unresolved: Generating multiple hypotheses per query is resource-intensive, potentially limiting real-time application despite the use of a smaller 8B parameter model.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating a sampling strategy (e.g., dynamic early stopping or contrastive decoding) that achieves equivalent consensus accuracy with fewer than five generation runs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the Semantic Consensus step to the choice of similarity threshold, and does this threshold generalize across different domains?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3 describes the use of a "minimum similarity threshold of 0.3" to determine consensus, but provides no ablation study or justification for this specific hyperparameter value.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if a fixed threshold of 0.3 is robust for all question types or if it introduces noise (false consensus) in specific domains like technical or legal QA.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study analyzing the performance variance of the consensus claim selection across a range of similarity thresholds (e.g., 0.1 to 0.9).

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can evaluation benchmarks be redesigned to better reflect complex, real-world sufficiency scenarios involving open-ended inference and multiple potential gaps?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in the Limitations that "existing benchmarks... often do not fully capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking scenarios," specifically citing the need for datasets reflecting the characteristics seen in Table 4.
- Why unresolved: Current benchmarks often rely on static knowledge bases or strict literal matching, which penalize the pragmatic inference capabilities of modern LLMs.
- What evidence would resolve it: The creation and validation of a new dataset specifically designed for multi-gap, open-ended inferential questions where sufficiency is a spectrum rather than a binary label.

## Limitations
- Framework performance relies heavily on quality of self-consistency hypotheses, which may not generalize well to specialized domains
- Computational overhead from self-consistency step limits real-time application potential
- Evaluation focuses primarily on multi-hop and answerability benchmarks, leaving other QA types unexplored

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core contribution of reframing sufficiency assessment as explicit identification of missing information is well-justified and technically sound. The experimental results showing improvements over strong baselines are reproducible and methodologically rigorous.

**Medium Confidence**: The generalizability of the approach across diverse QA domains and its robustness to adversarial or noisy inputs requires further validation. The trade-offs between comprehensiveness of missing information identification and computational efficiency are not fully characterized.

**Low Confidence**: The long-term stability of the framework when deployed on continuously evolving datasets or in dynamic knowledge environments has not been established. The impact of different language model choices on framework performance is not systematically explored.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Transfer Validation**: Evaluate the framework on specialized domains (medical, legal, technical) where domain-specific terminology and reasoning patterns may challenge the semantic consensus mechanism.

2. **Adversarial Robustness Testing**: Design test cases with intentionally ambiguous contexts, misleading information, or questions designed to trigger false positives in missing information identification.

3. **Efficiency Benchmarking**: Conduct comprehensive timing analysis comparing the full Identify-then-Verify pipeline against simpler baselines across different context lengths and question complexities to establish practical deployment constraints.
