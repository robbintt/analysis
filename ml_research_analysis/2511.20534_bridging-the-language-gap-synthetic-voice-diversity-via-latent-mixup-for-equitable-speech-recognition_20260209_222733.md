# Bridging the Language Gap: Synthetic Voice Diversity via Latent Mixup for Equitable Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20534
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20534
- Reference count: 7
- Key outcome: Mixup augmentation reduces WER by 23.7% on low-resource English AN4 dataset (0.339 vs 0.785)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance for low-resource languages by introducing LATENTVOICEMIX, a novel data augmentation technique that operates in the latent space of a voice conversion model. The method generates synthetic speech samples with diverse, realistic-sounding voices by interpolating speaker timbre representations while preserving linguistic content. Evaluated across three datasets (Wolof, VCTK English, and AN4) and two ASR models (Whisper and NVIDIA NeMo), the approach achieves significant WER reductions compared to baseline augmentation methods, particularly on low-resource English data.

## Method Summary
LATENTVOICEMIX generates synthetic speech by interpolating speaker timbre vectors in Diff-HierVC's latent space while preserving linguistic content. The pipeline: (1) denoise audio with `noisereduce`, (2) extract 255-dim speaker timbre vectors via Diff-HierVC style encoder, (3) sample target and mixup speakers (both distinct from source), (4) compute t_mixed = λ·t_target + (1−λ)·t_mixup where λ~Beta(0.5,0.5), (5) generate synthetic audio preserving source linguistic content, (6) post-denoise with `noisereduce`. The method increases dataset size by 33%–200% and is evaluated on NeMo (50 epochs) and Whisper-tiny (4 epochs).

## Key Results
- On AN4 low-resource English dataset, mixup augmentation achieved 23.7% relative WER reduction (0.339 vs 0.785 WER)
- For multilingual ASR with 8h Wolof + 24h English, mixup reduced Wolof-English performance gap from 0.234 to 0.175 WER
- Fine-tuning Whisper on Wolof, mixup achieved lowest WER (0.202) vs waveform (0.217), voice conversion (0.215), and spectrogram (0.242) augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interpolating speaker timbre vectors in latent space generates novel, realistic voices while preserving linguistic content, expanding training diversity without collecting new data.
- Core assumption: Diff-HierVC's style encoder sufficiently disentangles timbre from phonetic content that linear interpolation yields valid speaker characteristics.
- Evidence: Abstract states interpolation "preserves linguistic content" and section 2.2 details the pipeline with λ~Beta(0.5,0.5).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mixup-generated timbres remain closer to original speaker distribution than waveform augmentation, producing more useful training signal.
- Core assumption: Training data within natural timbre distribution yields better generalization than out-of-distribution examples.
- Evidence: PCA visualization in section 4.2 shows mixup samples cluster within original speaker convex hull, and table 3 shows mixup outperforms waveform augmentation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Post-denoising is essential for removing synthesis artifacts that would otherwise degrade ASR training.
- Core assumption: Voice conversion introduces artifacts that act as label noise during ASR training.
- Evidence: Table 4 shows WER increases from 0.202 to 0.214 without post-denoising.

## Foundational Learning

- **Voice conversion architecture (encoder-decoder with disentangled representations)**: Understanding how Diff-HierVC separates timbre from content is prerequisite to modifying the pipeline or debugging synthesis quality.
  - Quick check: Can you explain what the 255-dimensional style encoder output represents vs. the linguistic encoding?

- **Mixup regularization theory**: The method builds on mixup principles from vision (linear interpolation encourages smoother decision boundaries).
  - Quick check: Why does Beta(0.5, 0.5) sampling prefer values near 0 and 1 rather than uniform mixing?

- **ASR evaluation metrics (WER) and failure modes**: WER is the primary metric; understanding its sensitivity to different error types aids diagnosis.
  - Quick check: If mixup augmentation increases speaker diversity but introduces slight phonetic corruption, which WER component would likely increase?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Audio → [Denoiser] → [Diff-HierVC Encoder] → Speaker Timbre Vector (255-d) ↘ Linguistic Encoding ↗ Target Audio → [Encoder] → Target Timbre Vector Mixup Audio → [Pre-stored Timbre Bank] → Mixup Timbre Vector t_mixed = λ·t_target + (1−λ)·t_mixup [Linguistic Encoding + t_mixed] → [Diff-HierVC Decoder] → Synthetic Audio → [Post-Denoiser] → Augmented Training Data

- Critical path: Timbre extraction quality → interpolation validity → synthesis fidelity → post-denoising effectiveness. The voice conversion model is the bottleneck; its pre-trained weights are frozen.

- Design tradeoffs: More augmentation increases diversity but risks overfitting to synthetic artifacts; λ distribution shape controls novelty; storing pre-computed timbre vectors trades storage for inference speed.

- Failure signatures: High WER despite augmentation suggests voice conversion corrupts phonetic content; synthetic voices sounding similar indicates timbre bank lacks diversity; WER increasing with augmentation suggests denoising failing.

- First 3 experiments: 1) Sanity check: Generate 10 synthetic samples, manually verify transcript preservation and voice diversity before training; 2) Ablation replicate: Train ASR on 8h Wolof with and without post-denoising to confirm table 4 results; 3) Scaling test: Compare 1x, 2x, and 3x synthetic augmentation ratios to find saturation point.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- Diff-HierVC architecture and pretrained weights are not directly specified, creating potential reproducibility barriers.
- Effectiveness depends on specific voice conversion model's disentanglement quality, which may vary with different implementations.
- Distribution-preserving advantage over waveform augmentation is qualitative rather than quantitative.

## Confidence
- **High**: WER improvements on AN4 dataset (0.339 vs 0.785 baseline)
- **Medium**: Multilingual ASR gap reduction (0.234 to 0.175 WER)
- **Low**: PCA distribution analysis showing mixup timbres stay closer to original speakers

## Next Checks
1. **Implementation verification**: Generate 10 synthetic samples using the exact pipeline and manually verify transcript preservation and voice diversity before proceeding to full training.
2. **Distribution analysis replication**: Create PCA visualizations of timbre vectors for original, mixup, and waveform-augmented speakers to confirm mixup-generated timbres remain within the original speaker distribution.
3. **Generalization test**: Apply the method to a different low-resource language pair (e.g., Swahili or Haitian Creole) using publicly available datasets to assess whether mixup augmentation consistently outperforms other methods across languages.
