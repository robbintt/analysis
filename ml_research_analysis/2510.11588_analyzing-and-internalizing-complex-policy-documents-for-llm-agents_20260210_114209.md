## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently internalizing complex policy documents into LLM-based agents, where large policy documents in the context window create computational overhead. The authors propose CC-Gen, a benchmark generator with controllable complexity to systematically study policy complexity and evaluate internalization methods. They further introduce CAP-CPT, a category-aware continued pretraining approach that analyzes policy specifications into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and generates targeted data to improve policy internalization. Experiments show CAP-CPT significantly improves task completion performance, especially in data-sparse settings and high complexity scenarios, achieving up to 97.3% prompt length reduction and strong results on τ-Bench.

## Method Summary
The authors propose CC-Gen, a benchmark generator with controllable complexity to systematically study policy complexity and evaluate internalization methods. CC-Gen generates synthetic policy documents with varying complexity levels, enabling controlled experiments on policy internalization. The authors then introduce CAP-CPT, a category-aware continued pretraining approach that analyzes policy specifications into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and generates targeted data to improve policy internalization. CAP-CPT uses a category-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the LLM's ability to internalize and apply complex policy documents.

## Key Results
- CAP-CPT significantly improves task completion performance, especially in data-sparse settings and high complexity scenarios
- Achieves up to 97.3% prompt length reduction through policy internalization
- Strong results on τ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM agents' ability to follow complex instructions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CAP-CPT approach works by decomposing policy documents into three key categories: factual, behavioral, and conditional. This decomposition allows the model to learn specialized representations for each category type, enabling more efficient policy internalization. By generating targeted training data for each category and fine-tuning the LLM on this data, CAP-CPT improves the model's ability to understand and apply complex policies without requiring the full document in the context window. The category-aware approach allows the model to focus on the most relevant information for each type of policy specification, reducing computational overhead while maintaining or improving performance.

## Foundational Learning
- Policy Document Complexity: Understanding how different types of policies (factual, behavioral, conditional) contribute to overall complexity is crucial for effective internalization. Quick check: Analyze a sample policy document and identify examples of each category type.
- Continued Pretraining: Adapting pre-trained LLMs to specific domains through additional training on targeted data. Quick check: Verify that CAP-CPT improves performance on in-domain tasks while maintaining general capabilities.
- Prompt Engineering: Crafting effective prompts to guide LLM behavior, especially important when reducing prompt length through internalization. Quick check: Compare performance of internalized policies vs. full document prompts on task completion metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
CC-Gen -> CAP-CPT -> τ-Bench Evaluation

### Critical Path
1. Generate synthetic policy documents with CC-Gen (controllable complexity)
2. Apply CAP-CPT category-aware continued pretraining
3. Evaluate on τ-Bench for task completion performance
4. Measure prompt length reduction

### Design Tradeoffs
- Controlled generation vs. real-world policy authenticity: CC-Gen enables systematic evaluation but may not fully capture real policy complexity
- Category separation vs. policy nuance: Clean separation into factual/behavioral/conditional may oversimplify complex policy interactions
- Fine-tuning data volume vs. performance: CAP-CPT shows strong results in data-sparse settings, but optimal data requirements remain to be determined

### Failure Signatures
- Performance degradation when policies contain mixed or ambiguous category types
- Reduced effectiveness on real-world policies that don't fit the synthetic generation patterns
- Potential overfitting to specific policy structures at the expense of generalization

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test CAP-CPT on a small set of real-world policy documents to assess generalization beyond synthetic data
2. Evaluate the impact of different category separation granularities on internalization performance
3. Measure computational efficiency gains vs. accuracy trade-offs across varying policy complexity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach relies on self-generated policy documents, which may not fully capture real-world policy complexity and nuances
- The category-aware fine-tuning approach assumes clean separation of policies into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, which may not always hold in practice
- Evaluation primarily focuses on task completion performance and prompt length reduction, without extensively exploring trade-offs with policy interpretation accuracy or robustness to adversarial inputs

## Confidence
- High: The effectiveness of CAP-CPT in improving task completion performance, especially in data-sparse settings and high complexity scenarios, is well-supported by experimental results on τ-Bench
- Medium: The claim of up to 97.3% prompt length reduction through policy internalization is supported, but generalizability to other benchmarks or real-world scenarios needs further validation
- Low: The assertion that the category-aware approach significantly outperforms other fine-tuning methods is based on comparisons within the CC-Gen benchmark, which may not fully represent the diversity and complexity of real-world policy documents

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CAP-CPT on additional real-world policy documents and benchmarks beyond τ-Bench to assess generalizability and performance in more diverse and complex scenarios
2. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of trade-offs between policy internalization and other important factors such as policy interpretation accuracy, robustness to adversarial inputs, and computational efficiency in long-term deployment
3. Investigate limitations and potential biases introduced by self-generated policy documents in CC-Gen, and explore methods to incorporate more diverse and realistic policy sources into the benchmark
