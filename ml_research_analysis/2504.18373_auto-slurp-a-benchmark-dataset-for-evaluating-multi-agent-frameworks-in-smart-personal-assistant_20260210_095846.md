# Auto-SLURP: A Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating Multi-Agent Frameworks in Smart Personal Assistant
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.18373
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18373
- Reference count: 15
- Auto-SLURP extends SLURP dataset with relabeled data and simulated servers for end-to-end evaluation of multi-agent personal assistant frameworks

## Executive Summary
Auto-SLURP is a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate multi-agent frameworks for smart personal assistants. The dataset extends the SLURP corpus by relabeling data and integrating simulated servers and external services, enabling end-to-end assessment of language understanding, task execution, and response generation across diverse task domains. The benchmark presents significant challenges to state-of-the-art frameworks, with experiments showing that AgentLite achieves the highest success rate of 46%. The dataset reveals that intent prediction remains the primary failure source, though finetuning the intent agent can improve performance by 55%. These results demonstrate that developing reliable and intelligent multi-agent personal assistants remains a significant challenge.

## Method Summary
Auto-SLURP extends the existing SLURP dataset by relabeling data to better align with multi-agent framework requirements and integrating simulated servers and external services to enable comprehensive end-to-end evaluation. The dataset covers diverse task domains and is designed to test the complete pipeline of language understanding, task execution, and response generation in multi-agent personal assistant frameworks. The evaluation methodology involves deploying four representative multi-agent frameworks on the benchmark and measuring their performance across multiple dimensions, with particular attention to success rates and failure analysis.

## Key Results
- AgentLite achieved the highest success rate of 46% among four tested frameworks
- Intent prediction was identified as the primary failure source across all frameworks
- Finetuning the intent agent improved overall performance by 55%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by providing a standardized evaluation framework that captures the end-to-end complexity of multi-agent personal assistant systems. By integrating simulated servers and external services with relabeled data, Auto-SLURP creates realistic scenarios that test not just language understanding but also task execution and response generation capabilities. The dataset's diversity across task domains ensures comprehensive evaluation, while the systematic failure analysis identifies specific bottlenecks in the multi-agent pipeline.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent framework evaluation**: Essential for understanding how different components interact in personal assistant systems; quick check involves verifying framework compatibility with benchmark requirements
- **End-to-end task evaluation**: Needed to assess complete system performance rather than isolated components; quick check involves validating task completion across all stages
- **Simulated environment deployment**: Important for creating controlled testing conditions; quick check involves ensuring simulation accurately reflects real-world service interactions
- **Failure analysis methodology**: Critical for identifying performance bottlenecks; quick check involves categorizing failures by component and task type
- **Intent prediction optimization**: Key for improving core language understanding capabilities; quick check involves measuring prediction accuracy before and after finetuning

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User Input -> Intent Agent -> Task Agent -> Response Agent -> Output Generation
- **Critical path**: Language Understanding (Intent Detection) → Task Planning → API/Service Execution → Response Generation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simulated vs real services (control vs realism), comprehensive vs focused evaluation (breadth vs depth), static vs dynamic testing (reproducibility vs adaptability)
- **Failure signatures**: Intent prediction failures show up as incorrect task routing, execution failures appear as API errors, response generation issues manifest as inappropriate or incomplete responses
- **First experiments**: 1) Run baseline framework without modifications, 2) Isolate and test intent prediction accuracy, 3) Evaluate task execution success rate independently

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on simulated servers and external services rather than real-world implementations
- Success rate metrics measured in controlled environments may not generalize to production systems
- Dataset coverage limited to specific domains, potentially missing broader personal assistant use cases

## Confidence
- High confidence in dataset creation methodology and technical implementation
- Medium confidence in performance metrics and comparative analysis due to simulated environments
- Low confidence in broader implications about intelligent personal assistants given limited domain coverage

## Next Checks
1. Deploy benchmark with actual third-party APIs and services rather than simulated versions to validate performance differences
2. Conduct cross-domain testing by applying benchmark to non-SLURP domains and use cases
3. Implement longitudinal testing over extended periods to evaluate performance with evolving user contexts and changing service availability
