# Fast and Provable Tensor-Train Format Tensor Completion via Precondtioned Riemannian Gradient Descent

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.13385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13385
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: PRGD algorithm achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedup in tensor completion compared to standard Riemannian gradient descent

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a preconditioned Riemannian gradient descent (PRGD) algorithm for low tensor-train (TT)-rank tensor completion. The method employs a data-driven metric on the tangent space of the tensor train manifold, significantly improving convergence speed over standard Riemannian gradient descent. Theoretical analysis demonstrates linear convergence under suitable initialization, while extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm substantial computational gains, reducing iterations and computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
The PRGD algorithm operates on the Riemannian manifold of low-rank tensor trains, utilizing a preconditioned metric on the tangent space that is learned from the data. This preconditioning step effectively captures the local geometry of the manifold, enabling faster convergence compared to standard Riemannian gradient descent. The algorithm alternates between retraction steps on the manifold and preconditioning updates based on the current iterate, maintaining the low TT-rank structure throughout the optimization process. The method is particularly effective for tensor completion problems where the underlying tensor has a low TT-rank structure.

## Key Results
- PRGD achieves linear convergence under suitable initialization conditions
- Computational time and iteration count reduced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods
- Successful application demonstrated on hyperspectral image completion and quantum state tomography

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The preconditioned Riemannian gradient descent works by incorporating a data-driven metric into the optimization process on the tensor train manifold. This metric effectively captures the local curvature and geometry of the manifold, allowing the algorithm to take more informed steps during optimization. By preconditioning the gradient with information from the data itself, the method can navigate the manifold more efficiently, avoiding poor local minima and accelerating convergence to the optimal solution.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tensor Train decomposition**: Why needed - Provides compact representation of high-dimensional tensors; Quick check - Verify TT-rank structure in target tensor
- **Riemannian optimization**: Why needed - Enables optimization on nonlinear manifolds while preserving constraints; Quick check - Ensure retraction and vector transport operations are correctly implemented
- **Preconditioning in optimization**: Why needed - Improves conditioning of the optimization problem for faster convergence; Quick check - Monitor convergence rate with and without preconditioning
- **Linear convergence theory**: Why needed - Provides theoretical guarantees for algorithm performance; Quick check - Verify initialization conditions for linear convergence
- **Tangent space operations**: Why needed - Enables movement on the manifold while maintaining constraints; Quick check - Validate tangent space projections

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data → Tensor Train Manifold → Tangent Space → Preconditioned Gradient → Retraction → Next Iterate

**Critical path**: Input tensor → TT decomposition → Manifold initialization → PRGD iterations (tangent space projection → preconditioning → gradient computation → retraction) → Completion result

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Data-driven metric vs. fixed metric: Improved convergence vs. computational overhead
- Linear convergence vs. robustness to initialization: Theoretical guarantees vs. practical flexibility
- TT-rank preservation vs. approximation accuracy: Computational efficiency vs. reconstruction quality

**Failure signatures**: 
- Slow convergence indicates poor initialization or inappropriate TT-rank selection
- Divergence suggests step size issues or manifold constraint violations
- Suboptimal reconstruction quality indicates insufficient TT-rank or excessive noise

**3 first experiments**:
1. Synthetic tensor completion with known TT-rank structure
2. Varying initialization strategies to test convergence robustness
3. Comparison with standard Riemannian gradient descent on identical problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical convergence conditions require precise initialization specifications that are not fully characterized
- Data-driven metric lacks rigorous justification for universal superiority over standard approaches
- Scalability to very large-scale problems remains uncertain due to unprecharacterized computational complexity of preconditioning
- Performance under varying noise levels and missing data patterns requires further investigation

## Confidence
- Theoretical convergence claims: Medium
- Empirical performance improvements: High
- Practical applicability to diverse tensor data: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive experiments on diverse tensor datasets with varying noise levels and missing data patterns to assess the robustness of PRGD
2. Analyze the computational complexity of the preconditioning step and its impact on the overall scalability of the algorithm
3. Investigate the relationship between initialization quality and convergence speed through systematic experiments with different initialization strategies
