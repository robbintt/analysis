# Ovis2.5 Technical Report

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.11737
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11737
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Ovis2.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source multimodal large language models under 40B parameters, with the 9B model scoring 78.3 on OpenCompass

## Executive Summary
Ovis2.5 introduces native-resolution vision processing and enhanced reasoning through self-reflection to overcome tiling artifacts and limited depth in previous multimodal models. It replaces fixed-resolution ViT with NaViT to preserve fine detail and global layout, and augments training with deep-reasoning data that encourages reflection and revision, exposed as an optional "thinking mode." A five-phase training curriculum and high-efficiency infrastructure with data packing and hybrid parallelism enable effective scaling. The 9B model achieves 78.3 on OpenCompass, setting a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs under 40B parameters; the 2B model reaches 73.9, also SOTA for its size, and delivers leading performance on STEM, OCR/chart, grounding, and video tasks.

## Method Summary
Ovis2.5 replaces the fixed-resolution ViT architecture with NaViT to process native-resolution images without tiling, preserving fine details and global layout context. The model incorporates enhanced reasoning capabilities through self-reflection, allowing it to revise and refine its responses, with this functionality exposed as an optional thinking mode. Training follows a five-phase curriculum that progressively builds capabilities, supported by high-efficiency infrastructure including data packing and hybrid parallelism for effective scaling.

## Key Results
- 9B model achieves 78.3 on OpenCompass, setting new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs under 40B parameters
- 2B model reaches 73.9 on OpenCompass, also achieving SOTA performance for its size category
- Delivers leading performance across STEM, OCR/chart, grounding, and video tasks while maintaining native-resolution vision processing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Ovis2.5 addresses fundamental limitations in previous multimodal models by processing images at native resolution rather than tiling them into fixed-size patches, which eliminates artifacts and preserves global context. The self-reflection reasoning mechanism allows the model to engage in deeper analytical thinking and revise its outputs, similar to chain-of-thought reasoning but specifically adapted for multimodal inputs. The five-phase curriculum enables progressive skill development, while the high-efficiency infrastructure with data packing and hybrid parallelism allows the model to scale effectively without prohibitive computational costs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Native-resolution vision processing**: Processing images at their original resolution rather than tiling preserves fine details and global layout context, which is essential for tasks requiring spatial understanding and detail preservation.
  - *Why needed*: Tiling introduces artifacts and loses global context, degrading performance on tasks requiring holistic understanding
  - *Quick check*: Compare performance on tasks requiring fine detail (text recognition, chart interpretation) between tiled and native-resolution processing

- **Self-reflection reasoning**: The model's ability to revise and refine its responses through internal reflection, exposed as an optional thinking mode
  - *Why needed*: Standard forward-only reasoning limits depth of analysis; self-reflection enables more thorough problem-solving approaches
  - *Quick check*: Measure performance improvement when thinking mode is enabled versus disabled on complex reasoning tasks

- **Five-phase training curriculum**: Progressive training approach that builds capabilities in stages rather than all at once
  - *Why needed*: Complex multimodal reasoning requires foundational skills before advanced capabilities can be effectively learned
  - *Quick check*: Validate that later training phases show improved learning efficiency compared to flat training approaches

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Raw Image -> NaViT Vision Encoder -> Cross-modal Attention -> Language Decoder -> Output
- **Critical path**: Image input → NaViT processing → Cross-modal fusion → Text generation → Response output
- **Design tradeoffs**: Native resolution processing increases computational requirements but eliminates tiling artifacts; self-reflection adds inference latency but improves reasoning depth
- **Failure signatures**: Tiling artifacts when using standard ViT instead of NaViT; shallow reasoning when thinking mode is disabled; training instability without proper curriculum phasing
- **Three first experiments**: 1) Compare performance on fine-detail tasks between NaViT and standard ViT architectures, 2) Benchmark reasoning depth with and without self-reflection mode enabled, 3) Validate training stability across different curriculum phase implementations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The report lacks detailed architectural specifications beyond high-level descriptions of NaViT integration and reasoning augmentation
- Performance claims rest entirely on OpenCompass benchmarking without cross-validation on alternative evaluation suites
- The report does not address potential biases in the deep-reasoning data used for training or generalization capabilities beyond tested tasks

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Infrastructure improvements (data packing, hybrid parallelism) and general training methodology are technically sound based on established practices
- **Medium confidence**: Performance claims on OpenCompass are credible but lack comparison with contemporaneous models and alternative benchmarks
- **Medium confidence**: Architectural innovations are plausible but without implementation details or ablation studies, specific contributions cannot be independently verified

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing Ovis2.5 against variants with only native-resolution vision processing, only enhanced reasoning capabilities, and only the five-phase curriculum to quantify individual contribution of each innovation
2. Validate performance across multiple independent benchmark suites (beyond OpenCompass) including MMMU, MathVista, and ChartQA to assess generalization across different multimodal reasoning domains
3. Release model cards detailing training data composition, potential biases, and environmental impact estimates to enable proper risk assessment and reproducibility of the reported results
