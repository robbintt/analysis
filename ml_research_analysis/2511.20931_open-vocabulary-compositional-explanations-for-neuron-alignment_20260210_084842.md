# Open Vocabulary Compositional Explanations for Neuron Alignment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.20931
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20931
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces framework for open vocabulary compositional explanations using semantic segmentation models without requiring human annotations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the dependency of compositional explanations on human-annotated datasets by introducing a framework for open vocabulary compositional explanations in the vision domain. The framework uses open vocabulary semantic segmentation models to generate segmentation masks for arbitrary concepts without requiring manual annotations. It consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The framework achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods on human-annotated datasets while offering greater flexibility and better results on datasets without human annotations.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework consists of three sequential steps: concept specification where users define arbitrary concepts of interest, mask generation using open vocabulary semantic segmentation models to create segmentation masks for these concepts without manual annotation, and explanation derivation where compositional explanations are computed from the generated masks. The framework leverages existing open vocabulary segmentation models as the core technical innovation, allowing it to operate on any dataset regardless of annotation availability. This approach eliminates the need for human-annotated concept datasets while maintaining or improving explanation quality compared to traditional methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods on human-annotated datasets
- Demonstrates superior performance on datasets without human annotations
- Enables explanations at varying levels of granularity through concept set adjustments
- Supports iterative refinement of explanations through concept set modifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from leveraging the generalization capabilities of modern open vocabulary semantic segmentation models. These models have been trained on vast datasets and can recognize and segment arbitrary concepts based on their learned visual representations. By using these models to generate segmentation masks, the framework bypasses the need for task-specific annotations while maintaining high-quality visual understanding. The compositional explanations are then derived by analyzing how neurons respond to these automatically generated segmentations, providing insights into the model's decision-making process without the limitations of pre-defined concept sets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation:** Models that can segment arbitrary concepts without explicit training on those concepts - needed because traditional methods require predefined concept sets; quick check: verify model can segment novel concepts not seen during training
- **Compositional Explanations:** Methods for understanding model decisions through constituent parts - needed to break down complex predictions into interpretable components; quick check: validate explanations align with human intuition about feature importance
- **Concept-to-Neuron Alignment:** Mapping between semantic concepts and specific neurons - needed to trace how visual features influence model behavior; quick check: ensure alignment consistency across different input examples
- **Segmentation Mask Generation:** Process of creating pixel-level masks for specified concepts - needed to provide spatial grounding for explanations; quick check: verify mask accuracy against ground truth where available
- **Iterative Refinement:** Process of improving explanations through concept set adjustments - needed to enhance explanation quality and adapt to user needs; quick check: measure improvement in explanation fidelity across refinement iterations

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Concept Specification -> Mask Generation -> Explanation Derivation
**Critical Path:** The pipeline follows a linear flow where concept definitions are transformed into segmentation masks, which are then analyzed to produce compositional explanations
**Design Tradeoffs:** Uses general-purpose segmentation models for flexibility versus potentially lower precision than specialized models trained on specific concept sets
**Failure Signatures:** Poor segmentation mask quality leads to inaccurate explanations; overlapping concepts may create ambiguous attributions; concept specification errors propagate through the entire pipeline
**Three First Experiments:** 1) Test framework on datasets with known annotations to establish baseline performance 2) Evaluate explanation quality for increasingly complex and overlapping concepts 3) Measure computational overhead compared to traditional annotation-based approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends heavily on the quality of underlying open vocabulary segmentation models
- Computational overhead from generating masks for arbitrary concepts may be significant
- Framework's handling of highly overlapping or nested concepts remains unclear
- Still requires human judgment in specifying concepts, even if not annotating them

## Confidence
- **Core methodology:** High - logical framework with reasonable technical approach
- **Performance claims ("comparable or better"):** Medium - evaluation metrics and baselines not fully detailed
- **Flexibility advantage:** Medium - practical demonstrations not explicitly described
- **Iterative refinement claims:** Medium - theoretical soundness but lacks empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies measuring the impact of segmentation model accuracy on final explanation quality by systematically varying the performance of the underlying segmentation model and quantifying the resulting changes in explanation fidelity.

2. Perform runtime analysis comparing computational costs between the open vocabulary approach and traditional methods using human-annotated datasets across different image complexities and concept sets to quantify the overhead trade-off.

3. Design experiments testing the framework's robustness with highly polysemantic concepts and overlapping visual regions, measuring explanation accuracy degradation as concept boundaries become increasingly ambiguous or nested.
