# Watch and Listen: Understanding Audio-Visual-Speech Moments with Multimodal LLM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.18110
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18110
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces TriSense, a triple-modality LLM for robust video understanding with adaptive modality fusion.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of integrating vision, audio, and speech for comprehensive video temporal understanding. The authors propose TriSense, a triple-modality LLM with a Query-Based Connector that dynamically adjusts modality contributions based on input queries. This enables robust performance even with missing or incomplete modalities. To support this, they construct TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples covering diverse modality combinations and long-form videos. Extensive experiments show TriSense achieves strong performance on segment captioning and moment retrieval across all modality settings, significantly outperforming existing models in multimodal scenarios.

## Method Summary
TriSense is a triple-modality LLM trained in three stages. Vision, audio, and speech encoders extract features, which are compressed via slot-based compression and fused using a Query-Based Connector. This connector uses cross-attention to align modality features with the query, then predicts adaptive weights via MLP and softmax to emphasize relevant modalities. The fused features are input to a Mistral-7B LLM backbone, which outputs either timestamps or text via separate heads, controlled by a `<sync>` token. The model is trained on TriSense-2M, a curated dataset with 8 modality combinations, and evaluated on segment captioning and moment retrieval tasks.

## Key Results
- TriSense achieves strong performance on segment captioning and moment retrieval across all modality settings.
- The Query-Based Connector enables robust performance under modality dropout, outperforming fixed-weight and addition baselines.
- The model demonstrates competitive results on general video understanding tasks, validating its flexibility and effectiveness.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Query-Based Connector enables adaptive, query-driven fusion of vision, audio, and speech modalities, improving robustness when modalities are missing or noisy.
- Mechanism: Cross-attention layers align each modality with the encoded query, producing query-relevant features. Global average pooling creates compact modality vectors, which an MLP maps to unnormalized weights. A softmax normalizes these into a valid distribution, and the weighted features are concatenated, compressed, and passed through a two-layer MLP before being input to the LLM backbone.
- Core assumption: Different queries require different degrees of reliance on each modality, and a learned weighting can capture this relevance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling robust performance under modality dropout."
  - [section 4.2] Equations 1–4 formalize the pooling, MLP mapping, softmax normalization, and weighted fusion.
  - [corpus] Related work on router-gated cross-modal fusion (arXiv:2508.18734) suggests adaptive weighting is a plausible strategy for robust multimodal processing, though the specific connector design here is novel.
- Break condition: The mechanism may underperform if the query is ambiguous about modality relevance, or if all modalities are equally important/irrelevant, potentially leading to unstable or suboptimal weight assignments.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Slot-based compression in the modality projectors reduces token count while preserving salient information, enabling efficient processing of long-form videos.
- Mechanism: Vision, audio, and speech tokens from the expert encoders are compressed into fixed-length vectors of 16 tokens each using a slot-based compression technique. This reduces the total token count before fusion, controlling memory usage and computational cost.
- Core assumption: A compressed representation can retain enough information for downstream tasks, and the compression rate (16 tokens) is a reasonable tradeoff between efficiency and expressiveness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "To enhance temporal awareness of the model... we apply Slot-Based Compression [12] as Modality Projector to reduce the dimensionality of the input."
  - [abstract] The model handles long-form videos averaging 905 seconds, suggesting compression is necessary for scalability.
  - [corpus] The ablation study in Table 12 shows slot=16 offers a balance between performance and computational cost, with higher slots yielding diminishing returns.
- Break condition: Aggressive compression may lose fine-grained details (e.g., audio context, speech intonation), especially in complex scenes with overlapping events.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Causal event prediction, combined with a special `<sync>` token for head switching, enhances the model's ability to reason about temporal dependencies and generate temporally aligned outputs.
- Mechanism: The video is segmented into events (timestamp, caption pairs), and the model is trained to predict the next event conditioned on prior events, the query, and multimodal features. The `<sync>` token signals the LLM to switch between time head (for timestamps) and LM head (for text), enabling outputs like moment retrieval or captioning.
- Core assumption: Video events exhibit causal structure, and predicting future events from past context improves temporal understanding and grounding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] Equations 5–6 formalize causal event prediction, and the `<sync>` token is described as a control signal for head switching.
  - [section 2.1] The paper cites TRACE [11] as prior work using causal event modeling for videos.
  - [corpus] Related work on temporal reasoning in video LLMs (e.g., DaMO, arXiv:2506.11558) supports the importance of fine-grained temporal reasoning, though the specific causal formulation here is adapted from TRACE.
- Break condition: The mechanism may struggle with non-linear, non-sequential events, or when the `<sync>` token switching logic fails to align with the task requirements.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: The Query-Based Connector uses cross-attention to align modality features with the query, a core operation for query-dependent fusion.
  - Quick check question: Given a query feature Q (n×d) and a modality feature M (m×d), can you sketch how cross-attention would compute query-relevant features?

- Concept: Temporal grounding in videos
  - Why needed here: TriSense performs moment retrieval (localizing timestamps) and segment captioning for specific intervals, requiring understanding of temporal boundaries.
  - Quick check question: How would you evaluate a model's performance on moment retrieval? What metrics (e.g., R@IoU thresholds, mIoU) are appropriate?

- Concept: Multimodal fusion strategies
  - Why needed here: The paper compares early fusion (addition), fixed-weight fusion, and adaptive query-based fusion, each with tradeoffs.
  - Quick check question: If you had vision, audio, and speech features, what are three ways you could fuse them before passing to an LLM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input video -> (Vision Encoder + Audio Encoder + Speech Encoder) -> Modality Projectors (Slot Compression) -> Cross-Attention with Query -> Query-Based Connector (adaptive weighting) -> Fusion (concat + slot compression + MLP) -> Add Time Embeddings -> LLM Backbone -> (Time Head or LM Head, switched by `<sync>` token).

- Critical path: The Query-Based Connector is the core innovation. Ensure you understand how weights are computed from pooled modality vectors via MLP and softmax, and how they scale the cross-attention outputs before fusion.

- Design tradeoffs: (1) Using 64 frames (vs. 128) reduces cost but may hurt performance on long videos—ablation in Table 7 shows 128 frames improve results. (2) The connector uses a single-layer MLP for weight prediction; deeper networks might capture more complex interactions but add risk of overfitting. (3) Fixing the connector during instruction tuning (Stage 3) preserves alignment but may limit adaptability to new query types.

- Failure signatures: (1) If a modality is absent, the model may assign near-zero weight (robustness), but if the query heavily relies on that modality, performance degrades. (2) If the `<sync>` token is mishandled, the model may output timestamps in text form or captions in timestamp format. (3) For visual-only tasks, the adaptive weighting slightly underperforms compared to fixed visual-only weights (ablation in Table 7), suggesting the connector is optimized for multimodal scenarios.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Modality ablation**: Evaluate TriSense on moment retrieval and captioning with all eight modality combinations (AVS, AV, VS, V-only, etc.) to verify robustness to missing modalities. Compare against fixed-weight and addition baselines.
  2. **Frame count sensitivity**: Run moment retrieval with 32, 64, and 128 frames on TriSense-2M and Charades-STA to quantify the tradeoff between computational cost and accuracy, as hinted in Table 7.
  3. **Connector ablation**: Replace the query-based adaptive weights with fixed equal weights (e.g., 0.33 each for AVS) and measure performance drop, especially in scenarios where one modality is clearly more relevant (e.g., audio-heavy queries). This validates the importance of adaptivity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a unified prediction head be developed that matches or exceeds the performance of the separate Time Head and LM Head architecture used in TriSense?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Appendix C.1, regarding the ablation on task-specific heads, the authors state, "There may be better unified solutions in the future" to replace the current dual-head setup which is necessary to avoid performance drops.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture relies on a special token `<sync>` to switch between heads. A unified head would need to handle both precise timestamp generation and free-form text generation without the complexity of head-switching mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified TriSense model utilizing a single unified output head that achieves temporal grounding accuracy (mIoU) and caption quality (CIDEr) comparable to or better than the dual-head baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the model's modality weighting mechanism be refined to prevent performance degradation in visual-only scenarios while maintaining multimodal robustness?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The results section notes that TriSense shows "slightly lower performance on visual-only moment retrieval compared to state-of-the-art vision models," attributing this to optimization for multimodal settings. Additionally, ablation studies show fixed visual weights sometimes outperform adaptive weights in visual-only tasks.
- Why unresolved: The Query-Based Connector optimizes for the presence of multiple modalities, potentially diluting the visual signal strength when audio/speech are absent or noisy, compared to models trained exclusively on vision.
- What evidence would resolve it: An adaptive fusion mechanism that dynamically adjusts to "single-modality dominance" modes, achieving visual-only benchmarks (e.g., Charades-STA) scores equivalent to specialized visual-only models without sacrificing Audio-Visual-Speech performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What architectural or training modifications are necessary to bridge the performance gap caused by distribution shifts in caption styles across different datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note a performance gap in zero-shot segment captioning on the LongVALE benchmark, specifically attributing it to "pattern differences in captioning styles between our Segment Captioning training data and LongVALE’s... data."
- Why unresolved: The model appears sensitive to the specific semantic structure and verbosity of the training data generated by its specific LLM pipeline, limiting its zero-shot generalization to datasets with different annotation conventions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating that domain adaptation techniques or diverse data mixing strategies allow TriSense to maintain high performance on LongVALE without retraining on its specific caption style.

### Open Question 4
- Question: To what extent does increasing the input frame density (beyond 128 frames) further improve performance on long-form videos, and what are the computational limits?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights that using fewer frames (64 vs 128) hinders accuracy on the long-video TriSense-2M dataset (avg. length 905s). Ablation studies confirm performance gains when increasing from 32 to 128 frames, suggesting potential for further gains with higher frame counts.
- Why unresolved: The model is currently constrained by memory/compute (using DeepSpeed Zero2), leaving the saturation point for frame-based temporal precision in extremely long videos undefined.
- What evidence would resolve it: A scaling analysis plotting temporal grounding accuracy (mIoU) against input frame counts (e.g., 256, 512 frames) on the TriSense-2M dataset, identifying the point of diminishing returns.

## Limitations
- The Query-Based Connector's adaptive weighting may underperform in single-modality scenarios, slightly penalizing visual-only tasks compared to fixed-weight baselines.
- Slot compression to 16 tokens per modality risks losing fine-grained details, especially in complex scenes with overlapping audio-visual events or subtle speech cues.
- The `<sync>` token mechanism for head switching is under-specified, leaving its robustness to varied temporal structures uncertain.

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core architecture and benchmark results (SC/MR metrics, ablation tables), as these are directly supported by the experimental section.
- **Medium confidence** in the claimed robustness to modality dropout and adaptive fusion benefits, since the mechanism is plausible and grounded in prior work, but the ablation comparisons are not exhaustive.
- **Low confidence** in the generalization of the `<sync>` token mechanism and slot compression to all video domains, due to limited diagnostic details and edge case handling.

## Next Checks
1. **Modality Dropout Robustness Test**: Systematically evaluate TriSense on moment retrieval and captioning with all 8 modality combinations (AVS, AV, VS, V, etc.) and compare performance drop against fixed-weight and addition baselines, especially when one modality is missing but the query depends on it.

2. **Compression Sensitivity Analysis**: Vary slot compression from 8 to 32 tokens per modality and measure the impact on both accuracy and computational cost across tasks, focusing on scenarios with overlapping audio-visual events or subtle speech cues.

3. **Connector Ablation with Task-Specific Queries**: Replace the query-based adaptive weights with fixed equal weights (e.g., 0.33 each for AVS) and test on queries where one modality is clearly more relevant (e.g., "Describe the sound of the explosion" vs. "What is the person saying?"), quantifying the performance gap and instability in weight assignments.
