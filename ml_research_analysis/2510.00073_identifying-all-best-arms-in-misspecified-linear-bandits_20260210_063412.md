# Identifying All ε-Best Arms in (Misspecified) Linear Bandits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00073
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00073
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces LinFACT algorithm for identifying all ε-best arms in linear bandits

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of identifying all arms within ε of the best arm in linear bandit settings, motivated by applications like drug discovery where multiple promising candidates are valuable. The authors introduce LinFACT, a near-optimal algorithm that overcomes limitations of conventional approaches focusing only on the single best arm or a fixed number of top arms. They establish the first information-theoretic lower bound for this problem and demonstrate that LinFACT matches this bound up to a logarithmic factor, proving its instance optimality.

## Method Summary
The LinFACT algorithm employs a phase-based approach with either G-optimal or XY-optimal sampling designs. The XY-optimal design proves superior by focusing on distinguishing between arms rather than estimating individual means. The algorithm extends to handle model misspecification and generalized linear models, providing new theoretical bounds. The method achieves time complexity of O(Kd²), significantly better than competing approaches, and demonstrates consistent high performance in identifying ε-best arms across synthetic and real drug discovery datasets.

## Key Results
- Establishes first information-theoretic lower bound for identifying all ε-best arms
- LinFACT matches lower bound up to logarithmic factors, proving instance optimality
- Achieves O(Kd²) time complexity, outperforming existing methods
- Consistently delivers high F1 scores while requiring fewer samples in experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LinFACT works by employing a phase-based approach that strategically samples arms to distinguish between those close to the best arm. The XY-optimal sampling design is key to its success, as it focuses on maximizing information about arm differences rather than individual arm means. This design choice allows the algorithm to efficiently identify all arms within ε of the best arm while minimizing sample complexity. The extension to misspecified settings and GLMs is achieved through careful adaptation of the sampling strategy and theoretical analysis.

## Foundational Learning
- Linear bandits: Framework for sequential decision making where rewards are linear functions of arm features; needed for modeling drug discovery and similar applications
- ε-best arms: All arms within ε of the best arm; needed to capture multiple promising candidates rather than just the single best
- G-optimal design: Sampling strategy minimizing maximum variance; quick check: verify variance bounds in theory
- XY-optimal design: Focuses on distinguishing between arms; quick check: compare performance against G-optimal in experiments
- Misspecified linear bandits: Extension where true model differs from assumed linear form; quick check: validate robustness in experiments
- Generalized linear models: Nonlinear extension of linear models; needed for broader applicability

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Arm pool -> Sampling design (XY-optimal) -> Phase-based exploration -> Arm identification -> ε-best arm set

**Critical path**: Arm selection -> Feature observation -> Reward measurement -> Model update -> Next arm selection

**Design tradeoffs**: XY-optimal vs G-optimal sampling (computational efficiency vs theoretical guarantees); phase-based vs continuous exploration (sample complexity vs implementation complexity)

**Failure signatures**: High variance in arm estimates; failure to distinguish close arms; excessive sample complexity

**First experiments**: 1) Compare XY-optimal vs G-optimal sampling on synthetic data; 2) Test scalability with increasing arm pool size; 3) Validate performance under different noise distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Major uncertainties remain regarding the practical implementation of the XY-optimal sampling design in high-dimensional settings, as computational advantages may diminish when the arm pool becomes extremely large. The theoretical analysis assumes exact knowledge of the misspecification parameter ζ in the extended framework, which may not be available in practice. Additionally, the assumption of sub-Gaussian noise with known variance could be restrictive for real-world applications where noise distributions are unknown or heavy-tailed.

## Limitations
- Practical implementation challenges in high-dimensional settings with massive arm pools
- Assumption of known misspecification parameter ζ may not hold in practice
- Sub-Gaussian noise assumption with known variance may be restrictive for real applications

## Confidence
High: Information-theoretic lower bound and matching by LinFACT up to logarithmic factors
High: Computational complexity improvement to O(Kd²) over existing methods
Medium: Empirical performance claims on real drug discovery data

## Next Checks
1. Empirical evaluation of LinFACT's performance under unknown noise distributions and varying misspecification parameters
2. Scalability testing with massive arm pools (K >> 10⁶) to verify O(Kd²) complexity
3. Extension of experiments to non-drug discovery domains with different reward structures
