# Demographic Attributes Prediction from Speech Using WavLM Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.12007
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12007
- **Reference count**: 36
- **Primary result**: MAE of 4.94 for age prediction and >99.81% accuracy for gender classification across various datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a general classifier based on WavLM features to infer demographic characteristics such as age, gender, native language, education, and country from speech. The framework leverages pretrained WavLM embeddings to identify key acoustic and linguistic features associated with demographic attributes. The proposed system achieves strong performance across multiple tasks, with MAE of 4.94 for age prediction and over 99.81% accuracy for gender classification, while improving upon existing models by up to relative 30% in MAE and up to relative 10% in accuracy and F1 scores across tasks.

## Method Summary
The approach uses WavLM Base+ embeddings extracted via average pooling of the final transformer layer from five datasets (TIMIT, VoxCeleb2, L2Arctic, Speech Accent Archive, Common Voice 6.1 English) all at 16kHz. Three different classification/regression heads are trained on frozen WavLM embeddings: an MLP with two hidden layers (128→64 units), ResNet32 with 32 layers and 3 residual groups, and BiLSTM with 3 layers including layer norm, dropout, and residual connections with attention. The system employs cross-entropy loss for classification tasks and uses early stopping with patience=20 and ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler. Experiments include both single-dataset training and cross-dataset generalization scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves MAE of 4.94 for age prediction across datasets
- Achieves >99.81% accuracy for gender classification
- Improves upon existing models by up to relative 30% in MAE and up to relative 10% in accuracy and F1 scores across tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of this approach stems from WavLM's ability to capture both acoustic and linguistic features relevant to demographic attributes. The self-supervised pretraining allows the model to learn rich representations that encode speaker characteristics, accent patterns, and speech production differences associated with demographic factors. By using frozen embeddings and training lightweight task-specific heads, the system can effectively leverage these learned representations without overfitting to specific datasets. The multi-dataset evaluation demonstrates robustness across different recording conditions and speaker populations.

## Foundational Learning
- **WavLM embeddings**: Self-supervised speech representations that capture both acoustic and linguistic information - needed to provide rich feature representations for demographic prediction; quick check: verify embedding dimensionality is 768 and extraction uses average pooling of final layer
- **Cross-dataset generalization**: Training on multiple datasets to improve robustness and reduce dataset bias - needed to ensure model works across different recording conditions and speaker populations; quick check: validate that all five datasets are properly preprocessed to 16kHz
- **Residual connections in ResNet**: Skip connections that allow gradients to flow through deeper networks - needed to enable effective training of the 32-layer ResNet architecture; quick check: confirm ResNet32 structure with 3 residual groups and channel sizes 16/32/64
- **Attention mechanisms in BiLSTM**: Allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the sequence - needed to improve sequence modeling for demographic attribute prediction; quick check: verify BiLSTM has 3 layers with layer norm, dropout, and residual connections
- **Early stopping with patience**: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation performance - needed to ensure generalization without manual intervention; quick check: confirm patience=20 is implemented correctly

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** WavLM Base+ (frozen) -> Embedding extraction (average pooling) -> Task-specific heads (MLP/ResNet32/BiLSTM) -> Classification/Regression output

**Critical path:** The critical path is the embedding extraction and task head training pipeline. WavLM Base+ provides 768-dimensional embeddings through average pooling of the final transformer layer, which are then fed into one of three task-specific architectures. The frozen embeddings ensure consistent feature representation while allowing flexible adaptation through the task heads.

**Design tradeoffs:** The choice of frozen embeddings versus fine-tuning represents a key tradeoff between computational efficiency and potential performance gains. Using frozen WavLM embeddings allows rapid experimentation with different task heads and ensures consistent feature extraction across datasets, but may miss task-specific refinements that fine-tuning could provide. The three different head architectures (MLP, ResNet32, BiLSTM) represent tradeoffs between model complexity, sequence modeling capability, and computational requirements.

**Failure signatures:** Poor cross-dataset generalization, particularly for country and native language tasks (F1 ~20-40%), indicates domain adaptation challenges. Underperformance on Common Voice suggests issues with self-reported, binned age labels and missing country information. Performance degradation on noisy or real-world recordings versus clean studio speech indicates sensitivity to recording conditions.

**First experiments:**
1. Validate the complete pipeline on TIMIT alone (age/gender) with the specified architectures to verify baseline performance before scaling to cross-dataset experiments
2. Run cross-dataset experiments (train on "All", test on individual datasets) and compare against baselines in Tables II-III
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing WavLM Base+ to other embedding methods (e.g., MFCC + i-vectors) on at least one classification task to confirm the claimed improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Unreported hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, batch size, dropout rate) and exact training/validation splits within development sets create uncertainty for exact reproduction
- Significant domain adaptation challenges for country and native language prediction (F1 scores of 20-40%) not fully addressed
- Common Voice experiments complicated by self-reported age ranges, missing country labels, and age binning that conflates exact age regression with categorical classification

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in age and gender prediction results (MAE=4.94, >99.81% accuracy) due to well-established tasks with consistent cross-dataset performance
- **Medium confidence** in native language and country classification results due to severe domain mismatch effects and methodological ambiguity around handling Common Voice's binned age labels
- **Medium confidence** in claimed relative improvements (30% MAE, 10% F1) without full hyperparameter disclosure and exact baseline implementations

## Next Checks
1. Re-run the complete pipeline on TIMIT alone (age/gender) with the specified architectures to verify baseline performance before scaling to cross-dataset experiments
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing WavLM Base+ to other embedding methods (e.g., MFCC + i-vectors) on at least one classification task to confirm the claimed improvements
3. Test the model's robustness by intentionally introducing domain shifts (e.g., training on clean studio speech, testing on noisy real-world recordings) to quantify generalization limits beyond the reported cross-dataset results
