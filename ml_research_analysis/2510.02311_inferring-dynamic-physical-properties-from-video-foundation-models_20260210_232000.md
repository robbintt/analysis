# Inferring Dynamic Physical Properties from Video Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02311
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02311
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Video foundation models can infer dynamic physical properties (elasticity, viscosity, friction) from video, with generative and self-supervised models outperforming MLLMs, though all models underperform compared to oracle baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether video foundation models can infer dynamic physical properties such as elasticity, viscosity, and friction from video data. The authors introduce a new benchmark dataset featuring both synthetic and real videos with physical property annotations. They evaluate three model types: video generative and self-supervised models with trainable prompts, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with various prompting strategies. The study reveals that while models can generalize from synthetic to real data, they struggle with absolute value prediction and significantly underperform compared to oracle baselines, highlighting current limitations in physical reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing synthetic and real videos annotated with physical properties (elasticity, viscosity, friction). They evaluated three model architectures: video generative models and self-supervised models enhanced with trainable prompt mechanisms, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using various prompting strategies. The evaluation framework included both absolute value prediction tasks and relative comparison tasks to assess models' understanding of physical dynamics. Performance was measured against an oracle baseline and across both synthetic and real-world video conditions to test generalization capabilities.

## Key Results
- Generative and self-supervised models achieve similar performance and generalize reasonably to real-world data
- MLLMs perform worse overall but improve with targeted prompting, especially on real videos
- Absolute value prediction remains more challenging than relative comparison for all models
- All models significantly lag behind an oracle baseline in physical property inference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that video foundation models can extract dynamic physical properties by learning spatiotemporal patterns that correlate with material behavior. The trainable prompt mechanism in generative and self-supervised models likely helps align visual features with physical property representations. MLLMs show improvement with targeted prompting because structured prompts help bridge the gap between visual observations and physical reasoning. The models' ability to generalize from synthetic to real data suggests they learn transferable physical principles, though their struggle with absolute values indicates limitations in precise quantitative reasoning from visual inputs alone.

## Foundational Learning
1. Physical property inference from visual data - needed to understand how models extract quantitative material properties from spatiotemporal video features; quick check: examine feature activation patterns during property prediction
2. Video foundation model architectures - required to understand different approaches to spatiotemporal representation learning; quick check: compare temporal attention mechanisms across model types
3. Multimodal prompting strategies - essential for understanding how MLLMs bridge visual and physical reasoning; quick check: analyze prompt effectiveness through ablation studies

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Video input -> Feature extraction (ViT/CLIP backbones) -> Physical property head (regression or comparison) -> Output
**Critical Path:** Visual feature extraction → Physical property prediction → Performance evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Generative models offer better spatiotemporal modeling but require more training data, while MLLMs provide reasoning capabilities but struggle with direct physical property inference
**Failure Signatures:** Models fail on absolute value prediction, show significant performance gap between synthetic and real data, and MLLMs underperform despite reasoning capabilities
**First Experiments:** 1) Test synthetic vs real data performance gap 2) Compare trainable prompt effectiveness across model types 3) Evaluate prompting strategies for MLLMs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- All models significantly underperform compared to oracle baseline, indicating fundamental limitations in physical reasoning
- Substantial performance gap between synthetic and real-world videos suggests poor real-world transfer
- Absolute value prediction proves much more difficult than relative comparison for all evaluated models
- MLLMs consistently underperform generative and self-supervised models, questioning current prompting effectiveness

## Confidence
- High confidence: Benchmark dataset methodology and evaluation protocols are sound
- Medium confidence: Similar performance between generative and self-supervised models
- Medium confidence: MLLM improvement with targeted prompting
- Low confidence: Absolute performance differences on real-world videos due to dataset factors

## Next Checks
1. Expand real-world video dataset substantially to test whether performance improvements are due to dataset size or inherent model limitations
2. Conduct ablation studies on trainable prompt mechanism to isolate its contribution to performance
3. Test additional MLLM prompting strategies including chain-of-thought reasoning and tool-augmented approaches
