core_contribution: This paper develops a transfer learning method for community detection
  in multiple networks that are locally stored and privacy-preserved. The method,
  TransNet, uses an adaptive weighting strategy to combine eigenspaces from source
  networks based on their similarity to the target network and privacy levels, followed
  by a regularization step that optimally balances the weighted eigenspace with that

# Privacy-Preserving Transfer Learning for Community Detection using Locally Distributed Multiple Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.00890
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00890
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: Transfer learning method for community detection using privacy-preserved, locally distributed source networks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TransNet, a transfer learning framework for community detection in multiple networks that are locally stored and privacy-preserved. The method employs an adaptive weighting strategy to combine eigenspaces from source networks based on their similarity to the target network and privacy levels, followed by a regularization step that optimally balances the weighted eigenspace with that of the target network. Theoretical results show that the adaptive weighting satisfies an error-bound-oracle property, meaning the error bound only depends on informative source networks. The regularization step further improves the eigenspace estimation, achieving a smaller error bound than using either the target network alone or the weighted source networks alone.

## Method Summary
TransNet operates in three main phases: (1) Privacy preservation and local processing where each node applies Randomized Response perturbation to their adjacency matrix, debiases the result to recover an unbiased estimate, and computes top-K eigenvectors; (2) Central aggregation where the central server receives local eigenspaces, computes adaptive weights based on estimated heterogeneity and privacy levels, and aggregates them into a weighted average; (3) Regularization and clustering where the aggregated source eigenspace is optimally balanced with the target network's eigenspace through ridge-type optimization, and the resulting eigenspace is used for K-means clustering.

## Key Results
- TransNet outperforms spectral clustering on target network only and distributed learning methods using only source networks
- The method shows particular advantage when source networks have varying quality due to privacy preservation and heterogeneity
- Real data experiments on AUCS and Politics datasets confirm practical effectiveness in improving community detection accuracy
- Adaptive weighting satisfies error-bound-oracle property, where error bound only depends on informative source networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Adaptive weighting improves the signal-to-noise ratio of aggregated source eigenspaces by down-weighting networks with high heterogeneity or high privacy noise.
- **Mechanism:** The algorithm computes weights $\hat{w}_l$ inversely proportional to an estimated error term combining privacy noise and structural heterogeneity. This ensures that "informative" networks contribute more to the aggregated estimate $\bar{U}$.
- **Core assumption:** The estimated heterogeneity $\hat{E}_{\theta,l}$ and privacy parameters are sufficiently accurate proxies for the true signal quality of a source network.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "...adaptive weighting strategy to combine eigenspaces from source networks based on their similarity to the target network and privacy levels..."; [section] Definition 1 defines weights based on noise and heterogeneity terms; Theorem 1 proves the "error-bound-oracle property" where non-informative networks are dominated.
- **Break condition:** If source networks have extremely high privacy noise such that local eigenspace estimation $\hat{U}_l$ fails completely before aggregation, weighting cannot recover the signal.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Regularization of the target eigenspace using the aggregated source eigenspace yields a lower error bound than using either source or target data alone.
- **Mechanism:** A ridge-type optimization seeks an eigenspace $V$ that aligns with the target's noisy eigenspace while minimizing distance to the aggregated source eigenspace. This effectively "transfers" structural knowledge if the source aggregation is reliable.
- **Core assumption:** The target network is sparse or weakly signaled, and the aggregated source eigenspace provides a biased but lower-variance prior.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "...regularization step that optimally balances the weighted eigenspace with that of the target network."; [section] Theorem 3 shows the error bound for the regularized estimator is bounded by the minimum of the source-only and target-only errors.
- **Break condition:** If the target network is dense and distinct from all sources, the regularization term may introduce bias that degrades accuracy compared to the target-only approach.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Differential privacy is achieved via a Randomized Response mechanism, and the resulting bias is removable by a linear transformation.
- **Mechanism:** Edges are flipped with specific probabilities ($1-q$ for edges, $1-q'$ for non-edges). Since the perturbation is a linear operation, an inverse linear transform recovers an unbiased estimate $\hat{A}$ of the adjacency matrix.
- **Core assumption:** The parameters $q$ and $q'$ are known, and $q + q' \neq 1$ to avoid singularity in the debiasing step.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "The edges of each locally stored network are perturbed using the randomized response mechanism... followed by a regularization step."; [section] Section 2 details Eq. (3) ensuring $E(\hat{A}_l | A_l) = A_l$.
- **Break condition:** If the privacy requirement is too strict (e.g., $q \approx 0.5$), the variance introduced by the debiasing denominator explodes, destabilizing the spectral decomposition.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Stochastic Block Models (SBM)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire theoretical analysis relies on data generated from an SBM, where nodes belong to $K$ communities and edge probabilities depend on community memberships.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how the rank of the probability matrix $P = \Theta B \Theta^T$ relates to the number of communities $K$?

- **Concept: Spectral Clustering & Eigenspaces**
  - **Why needed here:** The method operates in the "eigenspace" (top $K$ eigenvectors). Understanding that these vectors reveal community membership is crucial for Steps 1 and 2.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is the Procrustes alignment (aligning $\hat{U}_l$ with $\hat{U}_0$) necessary before averaging eigenspaces?

- **Concept: Differential Privacy (DP)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper assumes local data is not shared directly but perturbed to satisfy $\epsilon$-DP. Understanding the trade-off between $\epsilon$ (privacy budget) and data utility is the motivation for the debiasing
