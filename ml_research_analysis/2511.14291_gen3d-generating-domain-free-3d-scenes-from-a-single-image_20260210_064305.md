# GEN3D: Generating Domain-Free 3D Scenes from a Single Image

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.14291
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14291
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Achieves 75.05 overall WorldScore, surpassing previous methods in 3D consistency, camera control, and subjective quality

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating high-quality 3D scenes from a single image, overcoming limitations of traditional neural 3D reconstruction methods that rely on dense multi-view captures. The proposed method, Gen3d, leverages a hierarchical strategy combining depth estimation, diffusion-based inpainting, and 3D Gaussian splatting to create wide-scope, domain-free 3D scenes. The approach decomposes input images into foreground and background layers, generates initial point clouds, and iteratively expands them through novel view synthesis using Stable Diffusion. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate strong generalization capability, with Gen3d achieving state-of-the-art performance on the WorldScore benchmark.

## Method Summary
Gen3d addresses single-image 3D scene generation through a three-stage hierarchical pipeline. First, it performs depth estimation using Moge2, followed by SAM depth-guided segmentation to separate foreground and background layers. Lama-ControlNet with depth-conditioned attention generates background inpainting. Second, an initial point cloud is created from RGBD data and iteratively expanded through N steps of novel view synthesis: projecting to new camera poses, inpainting masked regions with Stable Diffusion, lifting to 3D, and aggregating aligned points. Finally, the aggregated point cloud initializes a 3D Gaussian splatting representation, which is optimized using N+1 original images plus M reprojected views with masked L1+SSIM loss. The method supports text prompts, RGB images, or RGBD inputs, achieving 75.05 overall WorldScore on the benchmark.

## Key Results
- Achieves 75.05 overall WorldScore on benchmark, surpassing previous methods
- Demonstrates superior 3D consistency and camera control compared to baselines like LucidDreamer and WonderWorld
- Shows strong generalization across diverse domains without dataset-specific training
- Eliminates geometric artifacts and maintains consistent style across generated views

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hierarchical approach enables domain-free generation by decomposing the complex 3D reconstruction problem into manageable stages. Depth estimation and segmentation create accurate geometric priors, while iterative expansion through diffusion-based inpainting ensures content consistency across views. The ray-constrained alignment prevents drift during aggregation, and 3D Gaussian splatting provides high-fidelity rendering with efficient representation. The combination of masked supervision during training ensures that artifacts from inpainting are excluded from the final 3D representation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Depth estimation (Moge2)**: Predicts metric depth from single images to establish geometric structure - needed for accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D input
- **SAM depth-guided segmentation**: Uses depth information to improve mask quality for separating foreground/background - needed for accurate layer decomposition
- **Lama-ControlNet inpainting**: Conditions image generation on depth maps for spatially coherent background completion - needed to maintain 3D consistency in generated regions
- **Ray-constrained point alignment**: Aligns newly generated points with existing geometry along viewing rays - needed to prevent drift and maintain geometric coherence
- **3D Gaussian splatting**: Represents 3D scenes as anisotropic Gaussian primitives for efficient rendering - needed for high-quality, real-time novel view synthesis
- **Masked L1+SSIM loss**: Trains 3DGS only on valid regions to exclude inpainted artifacts - needed to maintain fidelity while avoiding training on hallucinated content

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Single image -> Moge2 depth estimation -> SAM segmentation -> Lama-ControlNet inpainting -> Initial point cloud -> N-step expansion (Stable Diffusion inpaint + 3D lift + ray alignment) -> Aggregated point cloud -> 3DGS initialization -> Masked L1+SSIM training -> Novel view synthesis

**Critical path:** Depth estimation → Segmentation → Inpainting → Iterative expansion → 3DGS optimization

**Design tradeoffs:** The method trades training data requirements for computational complexity during inference, requiring multiple diffusion-based generation steps but avoiding the need for large-scale 3D datasets. The ray-constrained alignment balances geometric accuracy against computational efficiency, while masked training prevents artifacts from propagating into the final representation.

**Failure signatures:** Visible seams at view boundaries indicate depth inconsistency or failed ray alignment; inconsistent inpainting across views breaks 3D coherence; geometric holes or floaters in complex occlusions suggest incorrect depth-guided segmentation or insufficient inpainting coverage.

**First experiments:** (1) Verify depth estimation accuracy on diverse scenes using Moge2; (2) Test SAM segmentation with depth guidance on challenging foreground-background separations; (3) Validate ray-constrained point alignment prevents geometric drift during iterative expansion

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance heavily dependent on quality of off-the-shelf depth estimation and segmentation models
- Computational cost increases linearly with number of expansion steps N
- Method requires careful parameter tuning for camera trajectories and training hyperparameters
- Potential sensitivity to variations in diffusion model outputs across different hardware/software versions

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Core architectural approach and integration of off-the-shelf models (Moge2, SAM, Stable Diffusion, 3DGS); hierarchical decomposition strategy; technical specifications for layer generation, world expansion, and 3DGS optimization

**Medium confidence:** Complete reproduction due to critical unknowns in camera trajectory parameters, 3DGS training specifics, and precise point alignment algorithm; these gaps could significantly impact quantitative performance

## Next Checks

1. **Camera trajectory ablation study**: Systematically test different N values and trajectory presets on WorldScore examples to identify optimal parameters for 3D consistency versus generation speed

2. **Point alignment boundary behavior**: Implement visualization tools to verify ray-constrained interpolation correctly handles depth discontinuities at occlusion boundaries, preventing geometric artifacts

3. **WorldScore benchmark replication**: Run complete pipeline on 50-100 WorldScore examples with different random seeds to establish performance variance and compare against reported metrics in camera control and 3D consistency categories
