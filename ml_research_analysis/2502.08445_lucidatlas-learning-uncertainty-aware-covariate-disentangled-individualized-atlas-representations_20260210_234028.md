# LucidAtlas: Learning Uncertainty-Aware, Covariate-Disentangled, Individualized Atlas Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.08445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08445
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Uncertainty-aware atlas with covariate disentanglement and prior knowledge incorporation

## Executive Summary
LucidAtlas is a novel interpretable atlas representation that integrates covariate effects, uncertainties, and prior knowledge for population-level analysis. The method uses an additive neural network structure to disentangle covariate contributions to both population trends and variances, while modeling spatial dependencies and heteroscedasticity. A key innovation is the marginalization approach that accounts for covariate dependencies when interpreting individual feature effects, addressing limitations of traditional neural additive models. Experiments on two medical datasets—pediatric airway geometry and OASIS brain volumes—demonstrate superior performance in capturing population distributions, with best Negative Log-Likelihood scores of 0.0110 and 0.0161 respectively. The method achieves mean absolute relative percent differences of 3.0% and 3.0% for airway cross-sectional area and brain volume regression. Incorporating prior knowledge (e.g., monotonicity constraints) further improves interpretability and alignment with domain expectations, enabling reliable individualized predictions and uncertainty quantification.

## Method Summary
LucidAtlas extends the NAISR framework to model population-level distributions while disentangling covariate effects on both mean trends and uncertainties. The method employs an additive neural network structure where each covariate has dedicated subnetworks for mean ($f_i$) and variance ($g_i$) contributions. A key innovation is the marginalization approach that interprets individual feature effects by averaging over the conditional distribution of other covariates, addressing the limitation of traditional neural additive models that assume feature independence. The framework models spatial dependencies through conditioning on a global mean shape and captures heteroscedasticity by modeling the log-variance as a function of covariates. Prior knowledge can be incorporated through constraints on the shape functions, such as monotonicity regularization. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the data under the learned distribution, producing individualized predictions with uncertainty estimates.

## Key Results
- Best Negative Log-Likelihood scores of 0.0110 and 0.0161 on pediatric airway and OASIS brain volume datasets
- Mean absolute relative percent differences of 3.0% and 3.0% for airway cross-sectional area and brain volume regression
- Incorporation of monotonicity constraints improved alignment with domain expectations and interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LucidAtlas works by explicitly modeling the relationship between covariates and both the population mean trend and variance structure, while accounting for spatial dependencies. The additive structure allows for interpretable covariate disentanglement, with each feature having dedicated subnetworks for mean and variance contributions. The marginalization approach is critical because it correctly interprets individual feature effects by conditioning on the distribution of other covariates, rather than assuming independence. This is particularly important for medical datasets where features are often correlated. The heteroscedastic modeling captures how uncertainty varies across the population based on covariates, which is essential for reliable individualized predictions. Prior knowledge incorporation through constraints like monotonicity ensures that the learned representations align with domain expectations, improving interpretability and clinical utility.

## Foundational Learning
- **Additive neural networks**: Why needed - to enable interpretable covariate disentanglement; Quick check - verify each feature's subnetwork captures meaningful variation
- **Heteroscedastic modeling**: Why needed - to capture how uncertainty varies across the population; Quick check - confirm variance predictions correlate with known sources of variability
- **Marginalization approach**: Why needed - to correctly interpret feature effects in presence of covariate dependencies; Quick check - compare with traditional neural additive model interpretations
- **Spatial dependency modeling**: Why needed - to capture local correlations in anatomical structures; Quick check - verify predictions respect known anatomical constraints
- **Prior knowledge incorporation**: Why needed - to ensure learned representations align with domain expectations; Quick check - validate monotonicity constraints produce clinically sensible results
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Why needed - to provide reliable confidence estimates for individualized predictions; Quick check - calibrate uncertainty estimates against observed errors

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Population data -> Additive neural network (mean subnetworks + variance subnetworks) -> Marginalized interpretations -> Uncertainty-aware predictions

**Critical Path**
1. Data preprocessing and feature extraction
2. Additive neural network training with heteroscedastic likelihood
3. Marginalization for interpretation
4. Prior knowledge incorporation (optional)
5. Uncertainty-aware prediction generation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Additive structure enables interpretability but may limit modeling of complex interactions
- Marginalization improves interpretation but increases computational complexity
- Heteroscedastic modeling captures uncertainty but requires more complex training
- Prior knowledge incorporation improves alignment with domain expectations but may bias results

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance when covariate dependencies are extremely strong
- Computational bottlenecks during marginalization for high-dimensional feature spaces
- Suboptimal uncertainty estimates when Gaussian assumptions are violated
- Interpretability issues when features are highly collinear

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Compare Negative Log-Likelihood on held-out data with and without marginalization
2. Test monotonicity constraints by varying regularization strength
3. Evaluate sensitivity of interpretations to different covariate distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can LucidAtlas be extended to model non-Gaussian population distributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 states that "Expanding beyond Gaussian assumptions, more flexible probabilistic frameworks—such as non-parametric approaches or mixture models—could improve expressiveness and model fits."
- Why unresolved: The current formulation relies on Gaussian assumptions for heteroscedasticity, which may be insufficient for datasets with heavy-tailed noise or complex multimodal variations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integration of mixture density networks or normalizing flows into the LucidAtlas framework, demonstrating improved Negative Log-Likelihood scores on data with known non-Gaussian characteristics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do identifiability issues affect the reliability of covariate disentanglement when features are highly dependent?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 notes that "Identifiability issues arise when covariates are dependent or the latent space is redundant, potentially affecting interpretability."
- Why unresolved: While the paper introduces a marginalization approach for interpretation, it does not mathematically guarantee that the additive subnetworks will uniquely converge when covariates are strongly correlated.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis or sensitivity study showing the stability of the learned shape functions $f_i$ under different random initializations or data splits with high collinearity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework be adapted for full probabilistic 3D shape modeling rather than 1D cross-sectional areas?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 outlines future work: "In future work, we plan to develop a probabilistic representation for 3D shape modeling with uncertainties by extending NAISR."
- Why unresolved: The current validation is limited to 1D cross-sectional area (CSA) functions and scalar brain volumes; extending this to high-dimensional 3D meshes requires solving for spatial correlations across complex surfaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formulation that successfully applies the uncertainty-aware additive model to 3D coordinate sets or meshes, capturing spatially varying confidence intervals across an entire organ surface.

## Limitations
- Limited validation to two medical datasets, raising questions about generalizability
- Computational complexity of marginalization approach may scale poorly with high-dimensional features
- Additive structure may miss important non-additive interactions between covariates
- Current formulation limited to 1D representations, not full 3D shape modeling
