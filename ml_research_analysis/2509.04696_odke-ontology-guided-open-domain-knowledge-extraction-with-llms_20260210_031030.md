# ODKE+: Ontology-Guided Open-Domain Knowledge Extraction with LLMs
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.04696
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04696
- Reference count: 4
- Ingests 19 million facts with 98.8% precision from 9 million Wikipedia pages

## Executive Summary
ODKE+ is a production-grade system for scalable open-domain knowledge extraction using large language models (LLMs). It automatically ingests millions of facts from web sources with high precision by combining modular components: an Extraction Initiator detects missing or stale facts, an Evidence Retriever collects supporting documents, hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply pattern-based rules and ontology-guided LLM prompting, a lightweight Grounder validates facts against source context, and a Corroborator ranks and normalizes candidates. ODKE+ dynamically generates ontology snippets tailored to each entity type, enabling scalable, type-consistent extraction across 195 predicates. The system processes over 9 million Wikipedia pages, ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with 98.8% precision. It achieves up to 48% overlap with third-party knowledge graphs and reduces update lag by 50 days on average, demonstrating that LLM-based extraction grounded in ontological structure can deliver trustworthy, production-scale knowledge ingestion.

## Method Summary
ODKE+ employs a modular architecture for open-domain knowledge extraction that combines pattern-based rules with ontology-guided LLM prompting. The system starts with an Extraction Initiator that identifies missing or stale facts, followed by an Evidence Retriever that collects supporting documents. Hybrid Knowledge Extractors use both rule-based patterns and LLM prompts enhanced with dynamically generated ontology snippets specific to each entity type. A lightweight Grounder validates extracted facts against source context, while a Corroborator ranks and normalizes candidate facts. The ontology-guided approach enables consistent extraction across 195 predicates by providing structured context to LLMs, reducing hallucination and improving precision at scale.

## Key Results
- Processes 9 million Wikipedia pages, extracting 19 million high-confidence facts
- Achieves 98.8% precision through sampled manual annotation
- Reduces update lag by 50 days compared to traditional knowledge graph updates
- Achieves 48% overlap with third-party knowledge graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ODKE+ works by grounding LLM-based extraction in structured ontological knowledge rather than relying on general prompting alone. The system generates entity-specific ontology snippets that provide LLMs with precise type constraints and predicate definitions, enabling consistent extraction across diverse entity types. This approach combines the flexibility of LLMs with the reliability of pattern-based rules, while the modular architecture allows independent optimization of each component. The Grounder validates facts against source context to prevent hallucination, and the Corroborator uses cross-validation to filter low-confidence extractions. Dynamic ontology generation scales the system to 195 predicates without manual prompt engineering for each new entity type.

## Foundational Learning
- **Ontology-guided LLM prompting**: Providing structured ontological context to LLMs improves extraction consistency and reduces hallucination. Quick check: Compare extraction precision with and without ontology snippets for the same entity types.
- **Modular knowledge extraction pipeline**: Separating detection, retrieval, extraction, validation, and ranking enables independent optimization and failure isolation. Quick check: Measure precision impact when bypassing individual components.
- **Hybrid extraction approaches**: Combining rule-based patterns with LLM flexibility achieves both precision and coverage. Quick check: Evaluate performance trade-offs between pure rule-based, pure LLM, and hybrid approaches.
- **Dynamic ontology generation**: Automatically creating entity-specific ontology snippets enables scalability to large predicate sets without manual prompt engineering. Quick check: Measure extraction accuracy degradation as predicate count increases.
- **Context-aware grounding**: Validating extracted facts against source context prevents hallucination and improves precision. Quick check: Compare precision rates with and without Grounder validation.
- **Cross-validation ranking**: Using multiple extraction sources and corroboration improves fact reliability. Quick check: Measure precision improvement from corroborator vs single-source extraction.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Extraction Initiator -> Evidence Retriever -> Hybrid Knowledge Extractors -> Grounder -> Corroborator
- **Critical path**: Extraction Initiator identifies candidates → Evidence Retriever fetches documents → Hybrid Extractors generate facts → Grounder validates against context → Corroborator ranks and normalizes
- **Design tradeoffs**: Prioritizes precision over recall (98.8% precision vs unknown recall), uses lightweight grounding to balance accuracy and speed, employs dynamic ontology generation to scale to 195 predicates without manual engineering
- **Failure signatures**: Low recall indicates missed fact detection or retrieval failures; high precision with low overlap suggests overly conservative extraction thresholds; grounding failures indicate source context mismatches or LLM hallucination
- **First experiments**: 1) Measure extraction precision for 10 sample entity types with and without ontology snippets, 2) Compare processing throughput for Wikipedia vs news articles, 3) Test system resilience by introducing controlled adversarial content into source documents

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses solely on Wikipedia, limiting generalizability to noisier web sources
- Precision metrics rely on sampled manual annotation without clear inter-annotator reliability measures
- Performance on long-tail predicates and rare entity types remains unclear
- Heavy dependence on LLM components raises concerns about production costs and latency

## Confidence
- High confidence in system architecture and core methodology
- Medium confidence in precision metrics due to limited evaluation scope
- Medium confidence in scalability claims without stress-testing on diverse domains
- Low confidence in generalization to non-Wikipedia sources

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ODKE+ performance on multiple diverse web sources (news articles, forums, technical documentation) to assess robustness to domain variation and noise levels
2. Conduct systematic analysis of extraction performance across predicate frequency distribution to identify potential long-tail coverage gaps
3. Implement cross-annotator reliability assessment for the precision evaluation and test the system's performance under adversarial or intentionally misleading source content
