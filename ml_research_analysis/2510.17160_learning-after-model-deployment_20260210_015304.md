# Learning After Model Deployment
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17160
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17160

- One-line primary result: Achieves 85-89% accuracy on continual learning benchmarks using a frozen feature extractor and LDA with shared covariance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Autonomous Learning after Model Deployment (ALMD), a framework enabling AI agents to learn new classes on the fly after deployment without human engineers. The proposed PLDA method leverages pre-trained model features and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with a shared covariance matrix across classes, achieving classification accuracy very close to joint training upper bounds without catastrophic forgetting. PLDA performs continual out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and incremental learning using Mahalanobis distance metrics, and uniquely leverages emerging classes (C_E) to improve OOD detection accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet demonstrate PLDA's superior performance compared to seven online continual learning baselines.

## Method Summary
PLDA is a post-deployment learning framework that uses a frozen pre-trained model as a feature extractor combined with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) using a shared covariance matrix. When new samples arrive, the system detects whether they belong to existing classes or represent out-of-distribution (OOD) samples using Mahalanobis distance. OOD samples are labeled by an oracle and incorporated into the model by updating class means through a running average. The method leverages emerging classes (C_E) - newly detected classes with few samples - to improve OOD detection accuracy. This approach achieves continual learning without replay buffers or feature fine-tuning, eliminating catastrophic forgetting by design.

## Key Results
- Achieves 85-89% accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet while learning new classes incrementally
- Outperforms seven online continual learning baselines including ER, MIR, and Experience Replay methods
- Reduces training time by orders of magnitude compared to joint training approaches
- Successfully performs continual OOD detection with 90% accuracy on CIFAR-100

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A frozen, shared covariance matrix enables new class learning without catastrophic forgetting and reduces data requirements. The PLDA method precomputes a single, shared covariance matrix (Σ) from initial classes using a frozen pre-trained model's features, treating it as a universal property of the feature space that is not updated when new classes arrive. For each new class, PLDA only needs to compute a class mean (µ_i) using a running average of few available samples.

### Mechanism 2
Emerging, not-yet-converged classes (C_E) can be leveraged to improve dynamic detection of other novel samples. PLDA includes the current, unconverged means of C_E classes in its Mahalanobis distance calculations, allowing the system to detect samples from classes it has just started learning. New OOD samples are more likely to be similar to recently seen OOD samples (the emerging classes) than to long-settled ID classes.

### Mechanism 3
A pre-trained model's frozen features eliminate the need for replay buffers and fine-tuning, directly sidestepping the primary cause of catastrophic forgetting. PLDA uses a frozen pre-trained model (e.g., ViT-B/14-DINOv2) as a fixed feature extractor, with all learning happening in a separate, lightweight statistical model on top of these features. Since the backbone weights are never modified, feature representations for old classes remain stable and interference is impossible by design.

## Foundational Learning

- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: The core learning engine of PLDA provides the statistical framework for defining classes using means and covariances. Understanding LDA's assumptions (multivariate normality, shared covariance) is essential to grasp how PLDA learns and classifies.
  - Quick check: Given a dataset of points, could you explain how LDA would compute a decision boundary between two classes if you assume they share the same covariance matrix?

- **Mahalanobis Distance**: The distance metric used for both OOD detection and classification measures the distance from a point to a distribution mean, accounting for the covariance structure. Understanding this metric is essential to see why a shared covariance matrix is useful.
  - Quick check: How does Mahalanobis distance differ from simple Euclidean distance, and why is it more appropriate when features have different scales or are correlated?

- **Catastrophic Forgetting (in Continual Learning)**: The paper frames its contribution around solving this problem for post-deployment learning. Understanding what CF is—why it happens in neural networks (weight interference) and how methods like replay, regularization, and parameter isolation try to solve it—provides context for PLDA's "no CF" claim via its frozen-feature approach.
  - Quick check: Why does fine-tuning a neural network on a new task typically cause it to forget how to perform an old task, and how does freezing a model's weights prevent this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  1. Pre-trained Model (Frozen Backbone) -> OOD Detector and LDA Model -> Label Manager -> Incremental Learner
  2. Feature vector -> Mahalanobis distance calculation -> Classification or OOD detection -> Mean update

- **Critical path**:
  1. A raw input enters the system
  2. The Pre-trained Model transforms it into a feature vector
  3. The OOD Detector uses the feature vector and the LDA model's means/Σ to determine if it's OOD
  4. If not OOD, it's classified using the LDA model. Path ends.
  5. If OOD, the Label Manager is invoked to get a label
  6. The Incremental Learner updates the appropriate mean vector in the LDA model with the new feature vector
  7. If the class was in C_E and has now seen enough samples, it is moved to C_L

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Accuracy vs. Flexibility: PLDA sacrifices the ability to adapt features for new tasks, limiting its applicability to domains with highly specialized concepts
  - OOD Detection vs. False Positives: Using emerging classes (C_E) for detection helps find more OOD samples but risks misclassifying true ID samples as OOD
  - Ask Frequency vs. Learning Speed: The CL threshold (number of samples to move a class from C_E to C_L) balances learning speed against accuracy

- **Failure signatures**:
  1. Model stagnation on new concepts indicates frozen PTM features are insufficient for those concepts
  2. Runaway OOD false positives suggest OOD detection thresholds are too stringent or C_E set has grown with noisy means
  3. Poor initial performance indicates the pre-trained model is a poor fit for the domain

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Sanity Check on Initial Classes: Train the initial LDA model on pre-deployment dataset and evaluate classification accuracy
  2. OOD Detection Ablation: Compare OOD detection F1-score using only ID classes vs. including emerging classes (C_E)
  3. Continual Learning vs. Upper Bound: Introduce new classes in a stream and compare final accuracy to joint training upper bound

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance is ultimately bounded by the pre-trained model's feature quality, as the method cannot adapt features for new tasks
- The shared covariance assumption may break down when new classes are drawn from fundamentally different distributions
- The emerging class mechanism introduces noise that could lead to false positives in OOD detection, especially with unrepresentative early samples

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The "no catastrophic forgetting" claim is strongly supported by the architectural choice of a frozen backbone
- **Medium Confidence**: The OOD detection improvement via C_E is plausible and supported by experiments but sensitive to early sample quality
- **Medium Confidence**: Overall accuracy and efficiency claims are well-demonstrated but ultimately bounded by pre-trained model quality

## Next Checks
1. **Extreme Novelty Test**: Deploy PLDA on a dataset where new classes are drawn from a fundamentally different distribution (e.g., CIFAR-100 initial classes, then new classes from medical imaging)
2. **Noise Injection in Emerging Classes**: Systematically add noise or adversarial samples to early samples of a new class and evaluate if this causes a spike in false positive OOD detections
3. **Scalability of Covariance Estimation**: Evaluate PLDA accuracy when the initial dataset used to estimate the shared covariance is very small or very large
