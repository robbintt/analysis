# Enhancing Japanese Large Language Models with Reasoning Vectors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.02913
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02913
- Reference count: 8
- Authors: Carolina Minami Oguchi; Leo Wei; Koyo Kobayashi; Hsin-Tai Wu; Dipak Ghosal
- Key outcome: Reasoning capabilities can be transferred from English to Japanese LLMs through reasoning vectors, improving performance on AIME24 without additional training data

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to enhance Japanese Large Language Models (LLMs) by transferring reasoning capabilities from English models through reasoning vectors. The method extracts weight differences between pre-trained and post-trained reasoning models to create a reasoning vector, which is then added to a Japanese instruction-tuned target model. Experiments on the AIME24 dataset demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with the enhanced model surpassing the original reasoning model at higher weights. This simple approach offers a promising path for boosting under-resourced language models using existing advancements in other languages.

## Method Summary
The approach involves extracting a reasoning vector by calculating the weight difference between a pre-trained English LLM and its post-trained reasoning counterpart. This vector is then added to a Japanese instruction-tuned target model at various weights to enhance its reasoning capabilities. The method requires no additional training data or fine-tuning, making it computationally efficient. The authors conducted experiments on the AIME24 dataset, evaluating the performance of the enhanced Japanese model against baselines and the original reasoning model.

## Key Results
- Incorporating reasoning vectors consistently improved Japanese LLM performance on AIME24
- The enhanced model surpassed the original reasoning model at higher reasoning vector weights
- The approach demonstrated effectiveness without requiring additional training or labeled data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The reasoning vector captures the weight changes that enable enhanced reasoning capabilities in the source English model. By transferring these specific weight modifications to a Japanese model, the target model inherits the reasoning improvements without needing to learn them from scratch. This works because the underlying reasoning patterns and problem-solving approaches are largely language-agnostic, allowing the weight differences to be effectively transferred across languages.

## Foundational Learning

**Weight Difference Extraction** - Understanding how to compute meaningful differences between model states
- Why needed: Forms the basis of creating transferable reasoning enhancements
- Quick check: Verify that the difference vector captures relevant changes by examining magnitude and distribution

**Cross-Lingual Transfer** - Principles of transferring capabilities between language models
- Why needed: Enables leveraging advancements in high-resource languages for low-resource ones
- Quick check: Validate that transferred patterns remain effective across language boundaries

**Instruction Tuning** - Process of adapting models to follow instructions
- Why needed: Ensures the target model can effectively utilize the reasoning enhancements
- Quick check: Confirm model maintains instruction-following capabilities after enhancement

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Source English LLM -> Reasoning Vector Extraction -> Japanese Target LLM -> Enhanced Model
The critical path flows from the source model through the vector extraction process to the target model application, with the reasoning vector serving as the transfer mechanism.

**Critical Path**: The sequence from computing the weight difference to applying it at optimal weights represents the core workflow that determines model performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades architectural compatibility for simplicity - requiring matched architectures limits applicability but enables straightforward vector transfer without complex alignment procedures.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when vector weights are too high (overfitting) or too low (underutilization), and when source and target models have significantly different architectures.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test multiple vector weights to identify optimal enhancement levels
2. Compare performance across different source-target model pairs
3. Evaluate stability of improvements across multiple random seeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, though several implications remain unexplored regarding the generalizability and limitations of the approach.

## Limitations
- The method requires source and target models to share the same architecture, limiting cross-architecture applications
- Lack of a held-out validation set for determining optimal vector weights introduces uncertainty
- Evaluation is limited to a single mathematical reasoning benchmark, not addressing broader task categories

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Reasoning vectors can enhance Japanese LLM performance | Medium |
| The method requires no additional training data | High |
| The approach is simple to implement | High |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments across multiple model architectures to assess the generalizability of reasoning vectors beyond architecture-matched models.
2. Perform ablation studies using a held-out validation set to determine optimal vector weights and evaluate the stability of performance improvements.
3. Test the approach on diverse Japanese language tasks beyond mathematical reasoning to evaluate its effectiveness across different reasoning domains and real-world applications.
