# Sequence-to-Image Transformation for Sequence Classification Using Rips Complex Construction and Chaos Game Representation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10141
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10141
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: 86.8% (breast cancer) and 94.5% (lung cancer) accuracy using CGR + Rips complex + CNN

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel topological approach that transforms molecular sequences into images by combining Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with Rips complex construction from algebraic topology. The method maps sequence elements to 2D coordinates via CGR, computes pairwise distances, and constructs Rips complexes to capture both local structural and global topological features. The authors provide formal guarantees on representation uniqueness, topological stability, and information preservation. Extensive experiments on anticancer peptide datasets demonstrate superior performance over vector-based, sequence language models, and existing image-based methods, achieving 86.8% and 94.5% accuracy on breast and lung cancer datasets, respectively. The topological representation preserves critical sequence information while enabling effective utilization of vision-based deep learning architectures for molecular sequence analysis.

## Method Summary
The method transforms molecular sequences into images using a two-stage process: first, Chaos Game Representation maps each amino acid to 2D coordinates via p_i = α·p_{i-1} + (1-α)·c(s_i), where c(s_i) represents the vertex coordinates for each of 20 amino acids positioned at regular polygon corners. Second, pairwise Euclidean distances are computed and Rips complexes are constructed with ε=0.3 to capture topological features. The resulting complexes are visualized as 8×8 figures with vertices and edges, then used as input to convolutional neural networks. The authors evaluate multiple CNN architectures (1/3/4-layer custom, ResNet-50, VGG19, EfficientNet, DenseNet) on 80-20 train-test splits with stratified sampling across two anticancer peptide datasets (breast cancer: 949 sequences, 4 classes; lung cancer: 901 sequences, 4 classes).

## Key Results
- Achieved 86.8% accuracy on breast cancer dataset (949 sequences, 4 classes)
- Achieved 94.5% accuracy on lung cancer dataset (901 sequences, 4 classes)
- Outperformed vector-based methods, sequence language models, and existing image-based methods
- Demonstrated superior performance particularly for shorter sequences (<10 amino acids)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages topological features preserved through the CGR-to-Rips complex transformation. CGR provides a geometric embedding that preserves local sequence information through coordinate proximity, while Rips complexes capture global topological relationships through distance-based edge construction. The combined representation maintains both local structural patterns and global connectivity information critical for sequence classification. The image-based representation enables transfer of powerful computer vision techniques to molecular sequence analysis without losing essential sequence information. The topological stability guarantees ensure that small perturbations in sequences result in small changes in the representation, maintaining robustness.

## Foundational Learning
- **Chaos Game Representation (CGR)**: Geometric mapping technique that transforms sequences into 2D coordinates by iterative point placement; needed to create visualizable sequence embeddings
- **Rips Complex Construction**: Algebraic topology method that builds simplicial complexes from distance matrices; needed to capture higher-order topological relationships between sequence elements
- **Algebraic Topology**: Mathematical framework for studying properties preserved under continuous deformations; needed to provide theoretical guarantees on representation quality
- **Anticancer Peptide Classification**: Biological task of categorizing peptides by therapeutic potential; needed to demonstrate practical application of the method
- **Sequence-to-Image Transformation**: General paradigm of converting sequential data to visual representations; needed to bridge molecular biology and computer vision domains

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Sequence → CGR Mapping → Distance Matrix → Rips Complex → 8×8 Image → CNN → Classification
**Critical Path**: CGR parameters → Rips complex ε threshold → Image rendering → CNN architecture → Training hyperparameters
**Design Tradeoffs**: CGR provides geometric embedding but depends critically on α parameter and vertex positioning; Rips complexes capture topology but require careful ε selection to avoid sparse/dense graphs; image representation enables CNN use but may lose some sequential dependencies
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate incorrect α or ε parameters, inadequate image resolution, or architectural mismatch between topological features and CNN receptive fields
**First Experiments**: 1) Test CGR sensitivity with different α values (0.3, 0.5, 0.7) on a small sequence subset; 2) Validate Rips complex construction by visual inspection across ε=0.1, 0.3, 0.5; 3) Train simple 2-layer CNN baseline to establish performance floor before adding complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Critical implementation details unspecified: CGR parameters (α value, vertex coordinates), image specifications, CNN architecture details, and training hyperparameters
- Class imbalance in "Very Active" class (18-24 samples) may affect statistical reliability of reported metrics
- Absence of ablation studies to isolate contributions of CGR versus Rips complex components
- No comparison with state-of-the-art sequence transformers or hybrid approaches

## Confidence
*High confidence* in the conceptual framework combining CGR with Rips complexes for sequence representation. The mathematical foundations and theoretical guarantees appear sound based on algebraic topology principles.

*Medium confidence* in the experimental methodology and reported results. While the general approach is described, critical implementation details are missing, and the class imbalance issue raises concerns about result reliability.

*Low confidence* in the practical reproducibility of the claimed results. The absence of specific parameters, hyperparameters, and architectural details means independent verification is currently impossible.

## Next Checks
1. Obtain the original Grisoni et al. dataset and verify the exact sequence counts and class distributions match the paper's claims (949 breast, 901 lung sequences with specified class sizes).

2. Implement the complete CGR + Rips complex pipeline with multiple parameter settings (different α values and ε thresholds) to determine sensitivity and identify which parameter combination reproduces the reported results.

3. Train multiple CNN architectures with varying depths and configurations on the generated images to establish whether the 3-layer CNN architecture is optimal or if results are sensitive to architectural choices.
