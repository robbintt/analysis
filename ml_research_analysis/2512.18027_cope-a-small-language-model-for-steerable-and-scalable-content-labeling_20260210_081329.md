# CoPE: A Small Language Model for Steerable and Scalable Content Labeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18027
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18027
- Reference count: 40
- 9-billion parameter model achieving GPT-4o-level performance at 1% of its size

## Executive Summary
CoPE is a small language model designed for policy-driven content labeling that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being dramatically smaller than large frontier models. The authors introduce Contradictory Example Training, where the model learns to interpret written content policies by training on diverse, internally consistent but contradictory policies. They also present Binocular Labeling, an LLM-assisted method for generating unambiguous training datasets. The 9-billion parameter model achieves 91% F1 score for hate speech detection and matches GPT-4o performance while operating on a single consumer GPU with sub-200ms latency.

## Method Summary
CoPE employs two key innovations: Contradictory Example Training, where the model learns to interpret written content policies by training on diverse, internally consistent but contradictory policies, and Binocular Labeling, an LLM-assisted method for generating unambiguous training datasets. The model is trained to interpret written policies rather than relying on predefined labels, enabling rapid adaptation to evolving content standards. The architecture is optimized for efficient deployment on consumer hardware while maintaining high accuracy across seven harm categories including hate speech, sexual content, and harassment.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91% F1 score for hate speech detection with 89% precision and 93% recall
- Matches GPT-4o performance in policy-based content classification while being 1% of its size
- Runs on a single consumer GPU with sub-200ms latency for real-time moderation
- Demonstrates that policy interpretation can be transformed from ML problem to policy writing problem

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Contradictory Example Training forces the model to develop robust policy interpretation skills by exposing it to multiple valid but conflicting content standards. This approach teaches the model to understand the reasoning behind policies rather than memorizing specific label mappings. Binocular Labeling creates high-quality training data by using LLMs to generate diverse perspectives on content labeling, ensuring the model learns nuanced distinctions. The small model size enables efficient inference while the policy-driven approach allows rapid adaptation without retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- **Policy-driven training**: Needed to enable rapid policy updates without model retraining; quick check: can new policies be implemented within hours rather than weeks
- **LLM-assisted dataset generation**: Required to create diverse, high-quality training examples at scale; quick check: does Binocular Labeling reduce human annotation costs by 80%+
- **Contradictory policy exposure**: Essential for developing robust policy interpretation skills; quick check: does model maintain performance across diverse policy frameworks
- **Efficient inference optimization**: Critical for real-time deployment on consumer hardware; quick check: can model run on single GPU with <200ms latency

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Policy Input -> Contradiction Training Module -> Binocular Labeling System -> 9B Parameter Model -> Content Classification Output

**Critical Path**: Policy text enters Contradiction Training module which generates policy interpretations, passes through Binocular Labeling system for dataset creation, feeds into the 9B parameter model, producing final content classifications

**Design Tradeoffs**: Small model size vs. accuracy (achieved by superior training methodology), real-time latency vs. computational cost (optimized for consumer GPU deployment), policy flexibility vs. model complexity (simplified through policy-driven approach)

**Failure Signatures**: Over-reliance on specific policy wording patterns, degradation when policies contain implicit cultural context, performance drop with highly ambiguous content requiring human judgment

**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Test policy interpretation across 10 diverse policy frameworks, 2) Measure latency and throughput on various consumer GPU configurations, 3) Evaluate robustness to adversarial policy manipulation attempts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on LLM-generated test sets rather than human-annotated ground truth
- Focus on English-language content policies limits generalizability across linguistic and cultural contexts
- Claims about transforming policy interpretation from ML to policy writing problem may overstate practical implications

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Architectural innovations are well-described and internally consistent. Technical implementation details for achieving sub-200ms latency are verifiable.

**Medium confidence**: Performance metrics depend on LLM-generated evaluation data that may not reflect true human judgment. Scalability claims need real-world deployment validation.

**Low confidence**: Assertion that policy interpretation can be fully transformed from ML to policy writing problem overstates practical implications. Real-world moderation involves complex contextual understanding.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing CoPE's policy interpretation against expert human moderators across diverse content types and cultural contexts to validate LLM-generated test set results.

2. Test model robustness against adversarial policy manipulation by attempting to craft policies that would cause systematic misclassification, measuring both accuracy degradation and model calibration.

3. Deploy CoPE in a real-world content moderation pipeline with live traffic to measure actual latency, throughput, and error rates under production conditions with varied content types and policy updates.
