- This paper reviews opportunities and challenges of large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages in humanities research, emphasizing data scarcity, model bias, and the need for innovative methods to preserve cultural and linguistic heritage.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive review of how large language models can be applied to low-resource languages in humanities research. It identifies transformative potential for linguistic, historical, and cultural studies through automated text generation, translation, and analysis. The study emphasizes the critical role of interdisciplinary collaboration and customized models while highlighting persistent challenges including data scarcity, model bias, and ethical concerns. The paper calls for innovative methods and tools to integrate low-resource languages into academic discourse, advancing preservation and understanding of global linguistic diversity.

## Method Summary
This survey paper synthesizes existing literature on LLM applications for low-resource languages in humanities contexts. It analyzes techniques including transfer learning, MoE architectures, cross-lingual pretraining, RAG, LoRA fine-tuning, and chain-of-thought reasoning. The paper examines multiple benchmark datasets (AmericasNLI, TLUE, ChrEn, QueEn, MiLiC-Eval, AraDiCE) and discusses performance baselines, typically showing <40% accuracy on low-resource tasks and significant tokenization inefficiencies for non-Latin scripts.

## Key Results
- LLMs show potential for linguistic, historical, and cultural research through automated text generation, translation, and analysis
- Cross-lingual knowledge transfer via pivot languages can yield significant performance gains (33.8% improvements reported)
- Tokenization inefficiencies create substantial computational overhead for morphologically complex scripts
- Mixture-of-Experts architectures can reduce parameter interference and improve low-resource language modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Lingual Knowledge Pivot
- **Claim:** Improved performance in low-resource languages is likely contingent on the model's ability to use high-resource languages as internal reasoning anchors.
- **Mechanism:** Chain-of-thought reasoning allows the model to process complex low-resource queries by generating intermediate steps in a related high-resource "pivot" language before producing the final output. This bypasses the lack of direct pre-training data in the target language.
- **Core assumption:** The low-resource language shares sufficient structural or semantic overlap with the high-resource pivot language for the reasoning transfer to remain valid.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 7.5.1 notes that fine-tuning on reasoning traces in Swahili produces 33.8% gains because the model learns to use well-represented languages as internal pivot points. Abstract states that transfer learning offers improvements, implying structural similarities are leveraged. Corpus neighbors like "Unveiling Factors for Enhanced POS Tagging" in Medieval Romance languages support the utility of leveraging related high-resource linguistic structures.
- **Break condition:** Fails when the target language is linguistically isolated or typologically distinct from all high-resource languages in the pre-training set (e.g., distinct click languages or isolate languages), preventing effective pivot.

### Mechanism 2: Sparse Expert Routing (MoE)
- **Claim:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures may preserve low-resource language features better than dense models by reducing parameter interference.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of a single dense block of parameters where high-resource languages dominate (the "curse of multilinguality"), MoE uses gating networks to route specific linguistic inputs to dedicated "expert" sub-networks. This isolates the grammatical and morphological rules of low-resource languages from being overwritten by dominant languages.
- **Core assumption:** The routing mechanism can accurately identify the linguistic features of the low-resource input to direct it to the correct expert.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 7.5.2 explicitly contrasts dense models with MoE, noting MoE maintains dedicated expert networks for different language families to prevent interference, achieving "2.5 BLEU point improvements." Section 7.6.1 warns that standard dense models suffer from "parameter interference," which MoE architectures are designed to address.
- **Break condition:** Fails if the routing mechanism itself is trained predominantly on high-resource patterns, causing it to misallocate low-resource inputs to irrelevant experts.

### Mechanism 3: Inference-Time Context Augmentation
- **Claim:** Massive context windows (400K–1M tokens) can temporarily substitute for missing pre-training data by effectively "memorizing" a corpus during inference.
- **Mechanism:** Rather than encoding linguistic knowledge into weights (which requires massive data), the model ingests the entire relevant corpus (dictionaries, grammar rules, parallel texts) as context. This allows the model to perform "lookups" for translation or analysis tasks without prior internalization.
- **Core assumption:** The model can effectively attend to relevant sections of the massive context without getting lost or hallucinating connections.
- **Evidence anchors:** Key Outcome highlights that context windows of 400K-1M tokens enable handling entire small language corpora. Section 7.5.4 discusses "dynamic resource integration" where models alternate between reasoning and tool use, loading external resources as needed.
- **Break condition:** Fails if the provided context data is noisy, unstandardized, or culturally disconnected; "garbage in, garbage out" still applies, as noted in the Abstract regarding data quality issues.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: The "Curse of Multilinguality"
- **Why needed here:** This is the fundamental tension in the paper. Adding more languages to a fixed-capacity model eventually degrades performance on all of them.
- **Quick check question:** Why would adding more training data in English potentially hurt the model's accuracy in a low-resource dialect?

### Concept: Morphological Tokenization
- **Why needed here:** Low-resource languages often suffer from "over-tokenization" (e.g., Tibetan requiring 70+ tokens per sentence vs. 27 for English), which inflates computational costs and degrades performance.
- **Quick check question:** How does the tokenization efficiency of a morphologically complex script (like Bengali or Tibetan) differ from English when using standard BPE?

### Concept: Parameter Isolation (Adapters/LoRA)
- **Why needed here:** To adapt models to new low-resource languages without destroying the base capabilities.
- **Quick check question:** Instead of retraining all model weights, what lightweight component would you add to teach a model a new dialect while keeping the "multilingual core" stable?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Base Transformer backbone with standardized tokenizer -> Adapter Layer (language-specific LoRA modules) -> Retrieval Module (RAG system) -> Router (MoE gate to linguistic experts)

### Critical path:
1. Tokenization Audit -> 2. Adapter Fine-tuning (Transfer Learning) -> 3. RAG Integration -> 4. Routing Optimization

### Design tradeoffs:
- Dense vs. MoE: Dense models are cheaper to serve but suffer interference; MoE preserves low-resource features but requires complex routing and higher memory
- Synthetic Data: Using MT to generate training data bridges gaps but risks amplifying bias (feedback loops)

### Failure signatures:
- Token Explosion: Sentences truncating due to non-Latin scripts consuming the context window
- Cultural Hallucination: Fluent but factually incorrect translations of cultural metaphors (high fluency, low fidelity)
- Routing Misclassification: A dialect being processed by a standard language expert, losing nuance

### First 3 experiments:
1. Tokenization Stress Test: Measure token length for a standard paragraph in the target language vs. English to quantify the "token tax"
2. Zero-Shot Pivot Test: Prompt the model to reason about a low-resource text in a related high-resource language to test cross-lingual transfer capabilities
3. Context-Only Injection: Feed a small dictionary (via RAG or context) for an unseen term and test immediate translation accuracy to evaluate in-context learning limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can LLMs accurately model language evolution and dialectal variation in low-resource languages given fragmented data and spatiotemporal variability?
- Basis in paper: The authors highlight the difficulty of tracking "spatiotemporal variability" and "language change" in low-resource contexts where data is often "fragmented" or "scattered" (Section 2.2).
- Why unresolved: Current models struggle to generalize across time periods and regions with minimal data, and "slow accumulation of low-resource language data delays the update process."
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful reconstruction of historical linguistic shifts in a low-resource language with <10k written records, validated by longitudinal dialectal benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can models capture implicit meanings and culturally specific metaphors in low-resource literary or religious texts without extensive cultural annotations?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.3.2 identifies a "critical challenge" in "limited capacity to interpret the implicit and multilayered meanings" inherent in religious and ancient texts.
- Why unresolved: Models lack the "deep, implicit knowledge that emerges only through extensive pretraining," and training data often misses the symbolic context required for interpretation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A standardized evaluation framework where LLMs outperform baseline syntactic translators in detecting allegorical meanings in texts like the Diamond Sutra or Vedic hymns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures be adapted to prevent resource misallocation for low-resource languages when routing mechanisms are trained on high-resource patterns?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.6.1 notes that while MoE architectures allow language-specific parameters, "the routing mechanisms themselves are trained predominantly on high-resource language patterns, potentially misallocating computational resources."
- Why unresolved: The gating networks in current MoE models may fail to identify and route complex low-resource linguistic features correctly, leading to interference or neglect.
- What evidence would resolve it: An architectural modification where expert gates demonstrate high specificity for low-resource languages (e.g., Quechua, Tibetan) without requiring massive retraining of the router.

## Limitations

- As a survey paper, it lacks empirical validation and original experimental results
- Humanities-specific applications (literary translation, historical interpretation) lack standardized evaluation frameworks
- Data quality issues in low-resource corpora complicate both training and evaluation

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The fundamental problem of data scarcity for low-resource languages is well-established and extensively documented
- The "curse of multilinguality" affecting dense models as language count increases is theoretically sound
- Tokenization inefficiencies for non-Latin scripts are measurable and documented

**Medium Confidence:**
- Transfer learning through pivot languages will improve performance in most low-resource contexts, though effectiveness varies significantly
- MoE architectures can reduce parameter interference, but optimal configurations remain under-specified
- Context windows can temporarily substitute for missing training data, though reliability depends on context quality

**Low Confidence:**
- Specific performance improvements from fine-tuning lack detailed methodology and may not generalize
- Claims about humanities-specific applications lack standardized evaluation frameworks
- Ethical considerations and bias mitigation strategies are discussed but not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Lingual Transfer Validation Test:**
   Select a well-documented low-resource language pair (e.g., Quechua-Spanish from QueEn benchmark). Implement the chain-of-thought reasoning approach with a related high-resource pivot language. Measure improvement over baseline zero-shot performance with statistical significance testing across multiple language pairs.

2. **MoE Routing Effectiveness Benchmark:**
   Compare dense vs. MoE architectures on a standardized low-resource translation task. Measure both overall BLEU scores and per-language performance to detect interference patterns. Analyze routing accuracy to ensure low-resource inputs are correctly classified to appropriate experts.

3. **Context Window Substitution Experiment:**
   Test translation quality on a low-resource language using only context window injection (no fine-tuning). Compare performance across different context window sizes (128K, 400K, 1M tokens). Measure hallucination rates and fidelity to source material using human evaluation panels familiar with the target culture.
