# Generative to Agentic AI: Survey, Conceptualization, and Challenges

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.18875
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18875
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** The survey contrasts Generative AI (GenAI) with Agentic AI, highlighting the latter's reasoning, interaction, and autonomy capabilities. Agentic AI addresses GenAI limitations by enabling complex multi-step tasks, dynamic tool usage, and real-time learning through interaction. It leverages reasoning models for iterative planning and reflection, reducing errors and enhancing interpretability. Memory management and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) are key features for handling large datasets and staying current. Agentic AI's tool use and interaction with environments, including simulations and web browsers, expand its application scope. However, challenges remain in safety, security, and evaluation, particularly as agents operate in dynamic, complex environments. The evolution from GenAI to Agentic AI represents a significant step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI), though fundamental breakthroughs may still be required.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically contrasts Generative AI (GenAI) with Agentic AI, defining the transition from static, immediate-response models to dynamic, reasoning-based agents. Agentic AI introduces iterative planning, reflection, and tool use to address GenAI's limitations in handling complex, multi-step tasks. The paper synthesizes a taxonomy of Agentic AI components—reasoning, memory, and interaction—and identifies key challenges, including safety, evaluation, and the path toward AGI. Through a three-iteration literature review, it establishes a unified definition of Agentic AI while highlighting gaps in existing surveys, particularly the lack of distinction from GenAI.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a three-iteration literature review methodology based on Wohlin 2014. It begins with a meta-survey of existing surveys to identify gaps, followed by snowballing (backward and forward citation searches) from five seed surveys. A targeted search then focuses on sub-topics like reasoning, memory, and tools, restricted to recent publications (2024+). The approach synthesizes a unified definition of Agentic AI while identifying conceptual gaps in existing surveys, particularly the lack of distinction from GenAI.

## Key Results
- Agentic AI introduces iterative reasoning via decomposition and reflection, enabling complex multi-step tasks beyond GenAI's immediate responses.
- Dynamic tool and environment interaction grounds Agentic AI in real-time data, overcoming GenAI's static knowledge limitations.
- Inference-time compute scaling allows Agentic AI to explore multiple reasoning paths, trading latency for accuracy.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Iterative Reasoning via Decomposition and Reflection
Agentic AI resolves complex, multi-step problems by replacing immediate responses with a loop of problem decomposition, execution, and self-correction. The system decomposes a high-level goal into sub-tasks (Planning), executes them, and utilizes a "Reflection" phase to verify outputs against the goal. If verification fails, it refines the approach (Self-Refine) rather than stopping at the first generated token. This mechanism assumes the foundation model can judge the quality of its own intermediate outputs or utilizes external tools (e.g., compilers) for validation.

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic Tool and Environment Interaction
Agents overcome the static knowledge limitations of Generative AI by learning to select and utilize external tools (APIs, calculators, browsers) to ground their reasoning in real-time data. Rather than generating an answer from parametric memory, the agent generates an action (e.g., an API call), observes the environment's output, and feeds this result back into its reasoning context (ReAct pattern). This mechanism assumes the environment provides reliable, observable feedback, and the agent can correctly map natural language intents to specific tool schemas.

### Mechanism 3: Inference-Time Compute Scaling
Agentic AI allows for dynamic resource allocation during inference, trading off latency for accuracy by exploring multiple reasoning paths (e.g., Tree of Thoughts). Instead of a single pass, the agent generates a graph or tree of potential solutions. A "Controller" evaluates partial paths, pruning poor ones and expanding promising ones, effectively "thinking" longer on difficult problems. This mechanism assumes a reliable heuristic or evaluation model to score intermediate reasoning steps accurately.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Basics**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly defines Agentic AI as incorporating RL elements—specifically the loop of *perception, action, and reward* from the environment. Understanding "exploration vs. exploitation" is critical for designing agent behaviors.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain the difference between an agent's *policy* (how it acts) and its *world model* (how it predicts the environment)?

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
  - **Why needed here:** CoT is the evolutionary precursor to Agentic reasoning. The paper traces the move from "shallow reasoning" (CoT in GenAI) to "deep reasoning" (iterative planning in Agents). You must understand CoT to grasp how agents break problems down.
  - **Quick check question:** How does "Least-to-Most" prompting differ from standard CoT in terms of task decomposition?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - **Why needed here:** Memory management is a key differentiator. Agents rely on external memory (Vector DBs) to maintain context over long horizons and access up-to-date information, moving beyond the fixed context windows of standard GenAI.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the primary limitation of purely parametric memory (model weights) that RAG attempts to solve?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Foundation Model (Brain) -> Orchestrator (Controller) -> Memory Module -> Tool Interface
- **Critical path:** User Goal → Decomposition (Planner) → Tool/Action Execution → Observation → Reflection (Verification) → Final Answer
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Autonomy vs. Control:** Highly autonomous agents (Level 4) are efficient but risky (unpredictable actions); Level 2 agents allow human oversight but are slower.
  - **Cost vs. Accuracy:** Using a small model with extensive reasoning (high inference compute) vs. a large model with immediate response (high training cost).
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Infinite Loops:** The planner continuously refines a step without converging.
  - **Tool hallucination:** The agent invents non-existent API parameters.
  - **Error Cascades:** A minor error in early decomposition invalidates all subsequent sub-tasks.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Static vs. Agentic Comparison:** Run a math reasoning task (e.g., MATH-500) using a standard GenAI model vs. a simple agent wrapper implementing "Self-Refine" loops. Measure accuracy vs. token usage.
  2. **Tool Integration Test:** Build a simple "Calculator Agent." Task it with multi-step arithmetic. Verify if it correctly outputs code/API calls to solve the problem rather than guessing the answer.
  3. **RAG Context Stress Test:** Feed a 50-page document to a GenAI model (if it fits the window) vs. an Agentic RAG system. Query for specific details buried in the text to test retrieval accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Are chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths in Agentic AI faithful to the actual decision-making process?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4.1 notes that "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may not always be faithful to the underlying decision process."
- **Why unresolved:** Agentic systems integrate complex components like planning algorithms and external tools, obscuring the causal link between generated text and internal logic.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of causal intervention methods that verify if changing a reasoning step actually changes the final outcome.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can we reliably evaluate Agentic AI systems operating in dynamic, complex environments?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4.1 states that evaluating reliability, task performance, and potential harms "remains challenging and incomplete."
- **Why unresolved:** Agents behave non-deterministically, require long time-spans to complete tasks, and operate in partially observable environments that are difficult to benchmark.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Creation of standardized benchmarks that assess failure awareness and safety in open-ended, interactive scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is scaling current Agentic AI systems sufficient to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4.2 questions whether "incremental technological advances" are enough or if "fundamentally new approaches are required."
- **Why unresolved:** Barriers such as limited availability of high-quality training data and the difficulty of generalizing to novel, out-of-distribution tasks persist.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstrating efficient mastery of novel tasks (e.g., ARC-AGI-2) without relying on massive, task-specific training data.

## Limitations
- The primary uncertainty lies in the evaluation of Agentic AI systems in real-world scenarios, particularly around safety and security when agents operate with high autonomy (Level 4).
- While the paper outlines the evolution toward AGI, it remains unclear whether current Agentic AI architectures represent a fundamental breakthrough or incremental improvement, as the "core breakthroughs" needed for AGI are not specified.
- The claim about inference-time compute scaling (Tree of Thoughts) lacks strong evidence from the provided corpus, which focuses more on application domains than on computational tradeoffs.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The distinction between GenAI and Agentic AI is well-supported, particularly the shift from immediate responses to iterative reasoning and tool use.
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanisms of iterative reasoning (Decomposition + Reflection) and dynamic tool interaction are logically sound but may face practical limitations.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim about inference-time compute scaling (Tree of Thoughts) lacks strong evidence from the provided corpus.

## Next Checks
1. **Safety Framework Validation:** Develop and test a concrete framework for evaluating Agentic AI safety in dynamic environments, focusing on Level 4 autonomy risks.
2. **Compute Scaling Experiment:** Conduct a controlled experiment comparing GenAI vs. Agentic AI on multi-step reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH-500), measuring accuracy vs. token usage to validate the inference-time compute scaling claim.
3. **Tool Integration Stress Test:** Build a Calculator Agent and test its ability to handle multi-step arithmetic, verifying whether it correctly uses tools (e.g., API calls) rather than guessing answers, and identify failure modes like tool hallucination.
