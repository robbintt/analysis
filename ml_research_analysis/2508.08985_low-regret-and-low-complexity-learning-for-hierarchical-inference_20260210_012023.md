core_contribution: This work addresses the Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL) problem
  in edge intelligence systems, where a compact on-device model (Local-ML) and a high-accuracy
  remote model (Remote-ML) collaborate for inference. The challenge is to dynamically
  learn when to offload data to the remote model based on the local model's confidence,
  while both the offloading cost and accuracy function are unknown.

# Low-Regret and Low-Complexity Learning for Hierarchical Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08985

- Key outcome: Achieves O(log T) regret for hierarchical inference using confidence-based offloading policies

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL) problem in edge intelligence systems, where a compact on-device model (Local-ML) and a high-accuracy remote model (Remote-ML) collaborate for inference. The key challenge is to dynamically learn when to offload data based on the local model's confidence, while both the offloading cost and accuracy function are unknown. The authors introduce a novel approach by modeling the probability of correct inference as an increasing function of the local model's confidence measure. They propose two policies, HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework, achieving order-optimal regret of O(log T) while maintaining low computational complexity.

## Method Summary
The authors model hierarchical inference as a multi-armed bandit problem where each "arm" corresponds to a confidence level of the local model. They introduce two policies: HI-LCB, which maintains confidence bounds for each confidence level and achieves O(log T) regret, and HI-LCB-lite, which uses a confidence threshold approach with O(1) per-sample computational complexity. Both policies exploit the monotonic relationship between confidence and accuracy to make offloading decisions. The key innovation is using the local model's confidence measure as the decision-making signal, rather than raw prediction scores, enabling more efficient exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

## Key Results
- HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite achieve O(log T) regret, improving over existing O(T^(2/3)) bounds
- HI-LCB-lite offers O(1) per-sample computational complexity suitable for resource-constrained devices
- On ImageNet1k, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, HI-LCB with α=0.52 outperforms Hedge-HI policy in most settings for T=100,000 samples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The monotonic relationship between confidence and accuracy enables efficient learning. By observing that higher confidence correlates with higher accuracy, the UCB-based approach can effectively explore the confidence-accuracy space while exploiting known good confidence levels. This structural assumption allows the algorithm to make informed decisions about when to trust the local model versus when to incur the cost of offloading.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-armed bandit theory: Why needed - provides regret analysis framework for sequential decision making; Quick check - verify that the confidence levels can be treated as independent arms
- Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms: Why needed - enables balancing exploration and exploitation in unknown environments; Quick check - confirm that confidence bounds converge appropriately
- Hierarchical inference systems: Why needed - models the practical edge-cloud collaboration scenario; Quick check - ensure that the cost model accurately reflects real-world constraints
- Confidence calibration: Why needed - validates the monotonic relationship assumption; Quick check - test confidence-accuracy correlation across different model architectures
- Computational complexity analysis: Why needed - ensures feasibility on resource-constrained devices; Quick check - measure actual memory and compute overhead on target hardware

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Local-ML (confidence measure) -> Decision Policy (HI-LCB/HI-LCB-lite) -> Remote-ML (offloading decision) -> Cost and Accuracy feedback
- Critical path: Confidence measurement → Policy decision → Inference execution → Feedback collection
- Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. offloading cost vs. computational complexity; HI-LCB offers better regret at higher complexity, while HI-LCB-lite prioritizes efficiency
- Failure signatures: Poor confidence calibration breaks the monotonic assumption; network latency spikes disrupt cost estimates; confidence bounds fail to converge in non-stationary environments
- First experiments: 1) Validate confidence-accuracy monotonicity on target datasets and models; 2) Test regret convergence on synthetic confidence-accuracy curves; 3) Measure computational overhead of confidence bound maintenance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Monotonicity assumption between confidence and accuracy lacks theoretical justification and may not hold for all model architectures
- O(log T) regret bound critically depends on the structural assumption which could break down with non-stationary data
- Computational complexity analysis doesn't fully account for memory overhead from maintaining confidence bounds

## Confidence
- High: Regret bounds and computational complexity claims (follow directly from UCB analysis)
- Medium: Empirical superiority over Hedge-HI (based on specific datasets and fixed parameters)
- Medium-Low: Practical applicability (doesn't address model drift, varying network conditions, or confidence calibration issues)

## Next Checks
1. Test the monotonicity assumption across diverse model architectures (CNNs, transformers, small MLPs) and confidence metrics (softmax entropy, distance-to-decision boundary)
2. Evaluate performance under non-stationary conditions where the accuracy-confidence relationship changes over time
3. Implement HI-LCB-lite on actual edge devices to measure real-world memory and energy consumption, particularly the overhead of maintaining confidence bounds across confidence levels
