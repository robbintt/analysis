# An Information-Geometric Approach to Artificial Curiosity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.06355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06355
- Authors: Alexander Nedergaard; Pablo A. Morales
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Information rewards derived from occupancy geometry unify exploration strategies

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a geometric framework for artificial curiosity in reinforcement learning by formulating intrinsic rewards through information geometry principles. The approach addresses sparse reward environments by deriving exploration bonuses from the structure of occupancy distributions on state spaces. The framework unifies count-based exploration and maximum entropy exploration as special cases of α-information rewards, providing a principled way to balance exploration and exploitation through geodesic interpolation on an occupancy manifold.

## Method Summary
The method constructs intrinsic rewards as concave functions of reciprocal occupancy distributions, uniquely constrained by invariance under congruent Markov morphisms and agent-environment interactions. Information rewards are formulated using the Amari-Čencov tensor, with the α-parameter controlling the curvature of the occupancy manifold and thus determining exploration strategies. The framework derives natural gradients in occupancy space, providing strong theoretical guarantees particularly in flat geometry (α=-1). The approach traces (α+2)-geodesics connecting uniform and maximally rewarding occupancies, enabling a smooth exploration-exploitation trade-off.

## Key Results
- Information rewards are uniquely invariant under agent-environment interactions when formulated as concave functions of reciprocal occupancy
- The α-parameter in the Amari-Čencov tensor uniquely determines the curvature of the occupancy manifold, governing exploration strategies
- Optimizers of artificial curiosity with α-information rewards trace (α+2)-geodesics connecting uniform and maximally rewarding occupancies
- Natural gradients in occupancy space provide strong theoretical guarantees, particularly in flat geometry (α=-1)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the geometric structure of occupancy distributions to derive intrinsic rewards that are invariant under agent-environment interactions. By formulating rewards as concave functions of reciprocal occupancy and using the Amari-Čencov tensor with α-parameter, the method creates a unified exploration strategy that smoothly interpolates between count-based and maximum entropy exploration. The geodesic structure on the occupancy manifold provides natural gradients that guide exploration in a principled manner, ensuring that the agent explores efficiently while maintaining theoretical guarantees about convergence and optimality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Occupancy distributions**: Represent state visitation frequencies over time, fundamental for defining information rewards
  - Why needed: Provides the geometric space on which intrinsic rewards are defined
  - Quick check: Verify occupancy distributions sum to 1 and are stationary under the policy

- **Amari-Čencov tensor**: Defines the Fisher-Rao metric for statistical manifolds, controlling curvature
  - Why needed: Determines the geometry of the occupancy manifold and thus exploration behavior
  - Quick check: Confirm the tensor satisfies metric properties (symmetry, positive definiteness)

- **Geodesic interpolation**: Provides shortest paths on curved manifolds between distributions
  - Why needed: Enables principled exploration-exploitation trade-offs through smooth transitions
  - Quick check: Verify geodesics satisfy the geodesic equation and connect target distributions

- **Natural gradients**: Gradient descent on Riemannian manifolds using the inverse metric tensor
- Why needed: Ensures efficient exploration by accounting for the manifold's geometry
- Quick check: Confirm natural gradients reduce to standard gradients in flat geometry

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Policy → Occupancy Distribution → Information Reward → Natural Gradient → Updated Policy

Critical path: Policy execution → State visitation → Occupancy update → Reward computation → Gradient calculation → Policy update

Design tradeoffs:
- α-parameter selection: Controls exploration vs exploitation balance
- Manifold curvature: Affects convergence speed and exploration efficiency
- Computational complexity: Natural gradient calculation vs standard gradients

Failure signatures:
- Poor exploration: α too close to 0 (count-based) or -1 (max entropy)
- Slow convergence: Incorrect manifold geometry specification
- Numerical instability: High curvature manifolds with small step sizes

First experiments:
1. Test on discrete gridworld with known optimal policy to verify convergence
2. Compare α=0 and α=-1 cases to establish baseline performance
3. Implement on continuous control task to test scalability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees rely heavily on specific assumptions about Amari-Čencov tensor structure
- Practical implementation in high-dimensional state spaces remains untested
- Connection between information-theoretic rewards and actual learning performance needs empirical validation
- Relationship between α-parameters and exploration efficiency across different task types is not fully characterized

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Mathematical derivation of information rewards from information geometry principles appears sound
- Invariance properties under Markov morphisms are well-established

Medium confidence:
- Practical implications of geodesic interpolation for exploration-exploitation trade-offs need more empirical support
- Framework's scalability to complex environments requires further investigation

Low confidence:
- Direct relationship between information rewards and improved learning outcomes across diverse tasks needs validation
- Framework's robustness to model misspecification and noise is not addressed

## Next Checks

1. Implement the framework on standard exploration benchmarks (e.g., Atari games) to test empirical performance across different α values
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the α-parameter's impact on learning efficiency across task types
3. Test the framework's behavior in non-stationary environments where occupancy distributions change over time
