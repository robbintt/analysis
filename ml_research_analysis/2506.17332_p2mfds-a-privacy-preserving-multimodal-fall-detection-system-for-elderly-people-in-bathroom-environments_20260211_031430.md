# P2MFDS: A Privacy-Preserving Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.17332
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17332
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves 95.0% accuracy, 87.9% recall, and 91.3% F1-score in bathroom fall detection using mmWave radar + 3D vibration fusion

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces P2MFDS, a privacy-preserving multimodal fall detection system specifically designed for elderly individuals in bathroom environments. The system addresses limitations of unimodal approaches by fusing mmWave radar and 3D vibration sensing data to capture both macro-scale motion dynamics and micro-scale impact signatures. A dual-stream CNN-BiLSTM-Attention architecture processes radar point clouds while a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch handles vibration data, with both streams incorporating attention mechanisms to emphasize fall-relevant temporal segments. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance with 95.0% accuracy, 87.9% recall, and 91.3% F1-score while maintaining privacy through non-optical sensing modalities.

## Method Summary
P2MFDS employs a dual-stream neural network architecture that processes mmWave radar data (10 Hz, 3D point clouds) through a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention pipeline and triaxial vibration data (100 Hz) through multi-scale CNN with SEBlock and Self-Attention. The system uses Moving Average Filtering for vibration signals and Exponential Low-Pass Filtering for radar data to suppress environmental noise. A large-scale multimodal dataset was collected in real bathroom settings with 48 participants performing 9 scenarios across 3 hours of recording. The radar and vibration streams extract modality-specific features, which are concatenated and classified via a lightweight fully connected layer to detect falls while preserving privacy through non-optical sensing.

## Key Results
- Achieves 95.0% accuracy, 87.9% recall, and 91.3% F1-score on bathroom fall detection
- Outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal approaches through multimodal fusion
- Successfully distinguishes falls from fall-like activities (object drops) using complementary sensor signatures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fusing mmWave radar with 3D vibration sensing improves fall detection accuracy compared to unimodal approaches in bathroom environments. mmWave radar captures macro-scale motion dynamics (velocity, distance, signal energy) from 3D point clouds, while vibration sensors detect micro-scale impact signatures from floor contact. The two modalities provide orthogonal information—radar tracks body movement through space while vibration registers ground-level impact forces—enabling the classifier to distinguish falls from fall-like activities (e.g., object drops) that may confound a single sensor type.

### Mechanism 2
Attention mechanisms in both processing streams improve recall by emphasizing temporally critical segments (fall impact phase) over background activity. The BiLSTM-Attention branch learns temporal dependencies in radar sequences and applies learned weights to highlight motion segments indicative of fall dynamics. The Self-Attention mechanism in the vibration branch recalibrates channel-wise features via the SEBlock, then attends to temporal positions with high impact energy. Both mechanisms suppress noise and focus classifier capacity on discriminative features.

### Mechanism 3
Low-pass filtering tailored to each modality preserves fall-related signatures while suppressing environmental noise, improving downstream feature quality. A Moving Average Filter (MAF) smooths vibration data to remove transient disturbances; an Exponential Low-Pass Filter (ELPF) adapts to rapid radar motion changes. This preprocessing reduces electrical interference, multipath reflections, and high-frequency noise before feature extraction.

## Foundational Learning

- **1D Convolutions for Time-Series**: Both radar point clouds and vibration signals are 1D temporal sequences; 1D CNNs extract local temporal-spatial patterns (motion segments, impact pulses) before sequence modeling. Quick check: Can you explain why a kernel size of 7 captures longer-range dependencies than a kernel size of 3 in a 1D CNN?

- **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**: The radar branch uses BiLSTM to integrate both past and future context when classifying a time step, useful when fall events span multiple frames with precursors and aftermath. Quick check: How does a BiLSTM differ from a unidirectional LSTM in terms of the information available at each hidden state?

- **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Block**: The vibration branch uses SE blocks to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature importance, emphasizing impact-related channels and suppressing irrelevant ones. Quick check: What does the "squeeze" operation compute, and how does the "excitation" operation use it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Sensor input → MAF/ELPF preprocessing → Radar: 1D CNN → BiLSTM → Attention → Vibration: Multi-scale 1D CNN → SEBlock → Self-Attention → Concat → FC → Classification

- **Critical path**: Preprocessing filter parameters (α for ELPF, N for MAF) directly affect signal fidelity; attention weight initialization influences training convergence; fusion layer dimensionality balances capacity vs. overfitting.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Dual-stream complexity vs. single-stream simplicity: More parameters, better modality-specific feature extraction, but higher training data requirements. Multi-scale CNN kernels: Capture diverse temporal scales but increase computation; smaller kernels may miss long-range impact patterns. SEBlock bottleneck ratio: Aggressive compression loses channel information; conservative compression adds parameters without benefit.

- **Failure signatures**: High false positives on object drops: Vibration stream over-emphasizing impact without radar motion corroboration. Low recall on slow falls (e.g., sliding down wall): Radar stream fails to detect rapid motion; attention weights under-emphasize gradual deceleration. Performance drop across bathroom layouts: Sensor placement changes multipath and vibration propagation; model overfits to training geometry.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation on attention mechanisms: Train radar-only and vibration-only streams with and without attention to isolate each component's contribution to recall and precision.
  2. Filter parameter sweep: Vary MAF window size (N) and ELPF smoothing factor (α) to quantify tradeoff between noise suppression and signal preservation on a held-out validation set.
  3. Cross-layout generalization: Train on one bathroom configuration, test on another with different dimensions/tiling to assess deployment robustness and identify sensor placement sensitivity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does P2MFDS perform when deployed with actual elderly users in real home bathrooms over extended periods? Basis: "large-scale, long-term deployments in real homes with elderly people are needed to further validate robustness and usability." Why unresolved: All experiments used 48 healthy adults aged 20–30 who emulated elderly movement patterns under controlled conditions, not actual elderly participants in naturalistic settings.

- To what extent do temperature fluctuations and partial occlusions degrade system performance in bathroom environments? Basis: "environmental factors—such as temperature fluctuations or partial occlusions—may still pose challenges." Why unresolved: Experiments were conducted in a controlled bathroom setting without systematic evaluation of temperature variation effects or occlusion scenarios.

- How does adaptive calibration improve detection accuracy across diverse bathroom layouts and construction materials? Basis: Future work explicitly includes "exploring adaptive calibration" and "extending the dataset across diverse bathroom layouts." Why unresolved: Current evaluation used a single 2.5m × 1.1m × 2.2m bathroom with specific tile flooring and wall materials.

## Limitations

- Missing critical implementation details including exact CNN channel dimensions, BiLSTM hidden sizes, attention weight initialization, and filter constants (MAF window N, ELPF α)
- Limited class distribution statistics in the dataset raise questions about class balance and potential overfitting
- Cross-layout generalization claims are not experimentally validated with diverse bathroom configurations
- No real-world deployment data from actual elderly users in home environments

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The dual-stream architecture design combining CNN-BiLSTM-Attention for radar and multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention for vibration is well-specified and logically sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: The 95.0% accuracy and 87.9% recall figures are reported with clear metrics, but without full hyperparameter details and independent validation, reproduction risks remain.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about cross-bathroom deployment robustness and real-world effectiveness are not empirically supported in the paper.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Studies**: Systematically remove attention mechanisms from both streams to quantify their individual contributions to recall and precision.
2. **Filter Sensitivity Analysis**: Sweep MAF window sizes and ELPF smoothing factors to identify optimal noise-signal tradeoff for fall event preservation.
3. **Cross-Layout Testing**: Train the model on one bathroom configuration and evaluate on geometrically distinct bathrooms to assess deployment generalization and sensor placement sensitivity.
