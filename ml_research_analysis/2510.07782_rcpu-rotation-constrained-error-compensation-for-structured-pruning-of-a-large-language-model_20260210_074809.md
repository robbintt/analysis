# RCPU: Rotation-Constrained Error Compensation for Structured Pruning of a Large Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07782
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07782
- Authors: Shuichiro Haruta; Kazunori Matsumoto; Zhi Li; Yanan Wang; Mori Kurokawa
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Outperforms existing structured pruning baselines on LLaMA-7B with better perplexity and task accuracy

## Executive Summary
RCPU introduces a rotation-constrained error compensation method for structured pruning of large language models. The approach addresses the challenge of maintaining model performance while significantly reducing size, particularly when working with limited calibration data. By applying rotation matrices to realign pruned subspaces with original outputs, RCPU preserves critical geometric properties while achieving superior compression rates compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
RCPU combines rotation matrix transformations with variance-aware importance scoring for structured pruning. The method first computes importance scores for weight matrices based on their contribution to principal output directions, then applies a rotation matrix to compensate for geometric distortions introduced during pruning. This rotation ensures that norms and inner products are preserved in the reduced subspace, maintaining the model's representational capacity. The approach requires no architectural modifications and adds minimal computational overhead, making it practical for deployment.

## Key Results
- Consistently outperforms WANDA-sp and FLAP baselines across various pruning ratios on LLaMA-7B
- Achieves better perplexity scores on language modeling tasks
- Maintains higher accuracy on language understanding benchmarks
- Demonstrates effectiveness with limited calibration data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The rotation-constrained approach works by preserving the geometric structure of the weight space during pruning. When columns are removed from weight matrices, the remaining subspace can become misaligned with the original output space, causing performance degradation. RCPU's rotation matrix realigns this pruned subspace, ensuring that critical directional information and vector relationships are maintained. This geometric preservation allows the model to retain more of its original representational capacity even after significant compression.

## Foundational Learning
- **Rotation matrices**: Orthogonal transformations that preserve vector norms and inner products - needed to maintain geometric properties during pruning, check by verifying orthonormality properties
- **Structured pruning**: Selective removal of weight matrix columns or rows - needed for efficient model compression, check by comparing compression ratios
- **Variance-aware importance scoring**: Method to identify critical weight components - needed to preserve principal output directions, check by analyzing score distributions
- **Subspace alignment**: Process of realigning reduced dimensional spaces with original spaces - needed to prevent performance degradation, check by measuring alignment angles
- **Calibration data**: Limited dataset used for pruning decisions - needed when full training data is unavailable, check by varying dataset sizes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input -> Importance Scoring -> Pruning Decision -> Rotation Matrix Application -> Output

**Critical Path:**
Importance scoring → pruning decision → rotation matrix computation → model weight update

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational overhead vs. performance preservation
- Pruning ratio vs. geometric fidelity
- Calibration data requirements vs. generalization
- Rotation matrix precision vs. implementation complexity

**Failure Signatures:**
- Performance degradation despite pruning
- Rotation matrix instability or divergence
- Importance scores failing to identify critical weights
- Subspace misalignment persisting after rotation

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Ablation study comparing RCPU with and without rotation matrix
2. Sensitivity analysis of pruning ratios on perplexity scores
3. Cross-model validation on architectures beyond LLaMA-7B

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness demonstrated primarily on LLaMA-7B with limited exploration of other LLM architectures
- Calibration dataset characteristics and size requirements not thoroughly explored
- Computational overhead lacks quantitative benchmarking against pruning-only approaches

## Confidence
- High confidence: Geometric preservation claims and rotation matrix implementation are mathematically sound
- Medium confidence: Empirical superiority over baselines demonstrated but limited to specific benchmarks
- Medium confidence: Claims about minimal overhead and no architectural changes are plausible but under-quantified

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate RCPU across multiple LLM architectures (Mistral, GPT-Neo, etc.) to assess generalizability beyond LLaMA-7B
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the rotation matrix contribution from the variance-aware importance scoring
3. Benchmark inference-time latency and memory overhead with RCPU against unpruned models and other structured pruning methods
