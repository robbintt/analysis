# Roadmap for using large language models (LLMs) to accelerate cross-disciplinary research with an example from computational biology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.03722
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03722
- Authors: Ruian Ke; Ruy M. Ribeiro
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a roadmap for integrating large language models (LLMs) into cross-disciplinary research, illustrated through a computational biology case study on HIV rebound dynamics

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive roadmap for integrating large language models (LLMs) into cross-disciplinary research workflows, using computational biology as a concrete example. The authors demonstrate how iterative interactions with ChatGPT can facilitate literature review, data analysis, methodology development, and manuscript drafting. The study emphasizes a human-in-the-loop approach where LLMs serve as augmentative tools rather than replacements for human expertise, providing practical prompts for researchers to effectively leverage LLMs while maintaining scientific rigor.

## Method Summary
The authors developed their roadmap through iterative experimentation with ChatGPT in a computational biology context, specifically studying HIV rebound dynamics. They systematically explored how LLMs can assist across the research lifecycle, from initial literature review to final manuscript preparation. The methodology involves crafting specific prompts for different research tasks, validating LLM outputs through expert review, and refining the approach based on observed limitations and failures. The computational biology case study serves as both a proof-of-concept and a practical demonstration of the proposed framework.

## Key Results
- LLMs can effectively synthesize literature across different fields, generate code for data preprocessing and visualization, and suggest computational methods
- The human-in-the-loop approach allows researchers to leverage LLM capabilities while maintaining scientific rigor through expert validation
- The roadmap provides practical, actionable prompts for researchers to accelerate cross-disciplinary research while being aware of limitations like hallucinations and oversimplification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLMs work effectively as research assistants in cross-disciplinary contexts because they can rapidly process and synthesize information across multiple domains, translate concepts between fields, and generate preliminary analyses that humans can refine. The iterative nature of human-LLM interaction allows for progressive refinement of both understanding and outputs. The computational biology example demonstrates that LLMs can bridge technical gaps between biology and computational methods, making advanced analysis accessible to researchers without deep programming expertise.

## Foundational Learning

**Cross-disciplinary research concepts**: Understanding how knowledge transfer occurs between fields is essential for recognizing where LLMs can add value. Quick check: Can you identify three examples where computational methods have transformed biological research?

**Prompt engineering fundamentals**: The ability to craft effective prompts determines the quality of LLM outputs. Quick check: Can you formulate a prompt that would help an LLM distinguish between correlation and causation in a dataset?

**Scientific validation principles**: Maintaining rigor when using automated tools requires understanding of verification processes. Quick check: What three validation steps would you apply to LLM-generated code before using it in published research?

**Computational biology basics**: Familiarity with both biological concepts and computational approaches helps in evaluating LLM suggestions. Quick check: Can you explain how differential equation modeling applies to viral dynamics?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Researcher -> Prompt formulation -> LLM interaction -> Output generation -> Expert validation -> Iteration cycle

**Critical path**: Literature review -> Method development -> Data analysis -> Results interpretation -> Manuscript preparation, with LLM assistance at each stage

**Design tradeoffs**: Speed vs. accuracy (LLMs provide rapid initial work but require careful validation), breadth vs. depth (LLMs can cover wide territory but may miss nuanced details), automation vs. control (LLMs accelerate routine tasks but require human oversight for critical decisions)

**Failure signatures**: Hallucinations in literature review (made-up references), oversimplification of complex methods, incorrect code syntax or logic, misinterpretation of domain-specific terminology

**First experiments**:
1. Use LLM to summarize 10 recent papers in a new field and validate the accuracy against original sources
2. Generate code for a basic data visualization task and test it on sample data
3. Draft an abstract for a hypothetical cross-disciplinary study and evaluate it against established writing guidelines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- The roadmap lacks systematic evaluation of how effectively LLMs actually accelerate research workflows compared to traditional methods
- The study does not adequately address how to handle LLM limitations in high-stakes scientific decisions or provide concrete protocols for balancing automation with expert oversight
- Critical limitations including hallucination risks and oversimplification are acknowledged but not quantified or systematically addressed

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: LLMs can assist with literature synthesis, code generation, and manuscript drafting in cross-disciplinary contexts. The technical capabilities demonstrated are well-established.
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed roadmap provides a reasonable framework for LLM integration, but lacks empirical validation of its effectiveness and efficiency gains.
- **Low confidence**: The study does not adequately address how to handle LLM limitations in high-stakes scientific decisions or provide concrete protocols for balancing automation with expert oversight.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing research timelines and outcomes when using LLMs versus traditional methods across multiple cross-disciplinary projects
2. Develop and validate systematic protocols for expert review and validation of LLM-generated content at each research stage
3. Create a framework for quantifying and mitigating hallucination risks in domain-specific scientific contexts through rigorous testing across diverse subject areas
