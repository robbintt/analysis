# Vision-LLMs for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11282
- Authors: Ning Yang; Hengyu Zhong; Haijun Zhang; Randall Berry
- Reference count: 40
- ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy

## Executive Summary
ST-Vision-LLM introduces a novel approach to spatiotemporal traffic forecasting by treating it as a vision-language fusion problem. The method encodes historical traffic data as visual patches through a Vision-LLM encoder, enabling global context perception, while using textual prompts for targeted cell-level predictions. A numerical encoding scheme allows floating-point values to be represented as single tokens, improving efficiency. The model achieves significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly in long-term predictions and cross-domain few-shot scenarios.

## Method Summary
The approach reframes spatiotemporal traffic forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Historical traffic data is encoded as visual patches via a Vision-LLM encoder, enabling global context perception. Textual prompts are used for targeted cell-level predictions. A novel numerical encoding scheme represents floating-point values as single tokens for improved efficiency. The model is trained through two stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for foundational learning, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for enhanced predictive accuracy.

## Key Results
- Outperforms existing methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy
- Exceeds second-best baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios
- Demonstrates strong generalization and data efficiency in few-shot, cross-domain, and zero-shot settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The vision-language fusion approach leverages the powerful pattern recognition capabilities of Vision-LLMs to capture global spatiotemporal patterns while maintaining the precision of numerical predictions through efficient encoding schemes. The dual-stage training process allows the model to first learn general traffic patterns through SFT before optimizing for specific predictive accuracy with GRPO.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision-LLM encoding fundamentals: Understanding how traffic data is transformed into visual patches enables efficient global pattern recognition
- Numerical encoding schemes: Converting floating-point values to single tokens is crucial for maintaining precision while improving computational efficiency
- Vision-language fusion principles: Integrating visual and textual modalities allows the model to leverage complementary strengths of both approaches
- GRPO optimization: Understanding this reinforcement learning technique is essential for grasping how the model refines its predictions beyond initial SFT training

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Traffic Data -> Vision-LLM Encoder -> Visual Patches -> Fusion Layer -> Numerical Encoder -> Predictions

Critical Path:
Historical traffic data flows through Vision-LLM encoder to create visual representations, which are then fused with textual prompts and processed through numerical encoding to generate predictions.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Vision-language fusion vs. traditional time-series approaches
- Computational efficiency of numerical encoding vs. potential precision loss
- Two-stage training (SFT + GRPO) vs. single-stage alternatives

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance on extreme weather conditions suggests limitations in handling anomalous events
- Potential sensitivity to data quality issues not explicitly addressed in the methodology
- Cross-domain generalization may be limited to similar geographic regions

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate long-term prediction accuracy across multiple time horizons
2. Test cross-domain performance using PeMSD4 and D1 datasets
3. Assess few-shot learning capabilities with varying amounts of training data
