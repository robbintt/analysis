# Bridging the Fairness Gap: Enhancing Pre-trained Models with LLM-Generated Sentences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06795
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06795
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: Fair-Gender significantly reduces gender bias in PLMs while maintaining or improving downstream performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses gender bias in pre-trained language models (PLMs) by proposing Fair-Gender, a novel method that leverages large language model (LLM)-generated sentences for debiasing. Traditional approaches rely on external corpora, which may lack quality and diversity. Fair-Gender generates attribute-balanced, semantically rich pairwise sentences using LLMs, but filters them using causal analysis to avoid negative transfer. The method applies causal effect estimation to identify aligned sentences for incorporation into PLMs, ensuring positive transfer while preserving model expressiveness. Experiments show Fair-Gender significantly reduces gender biases, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Auto-Debias in fairness metrics and maintaining or improving language understanding on GLUE tasks.

## Method Summary
Fair-Gender addresses gender bias in pre-trained language models by leveraging LLM-generated sentences for debiasing. The method generates attribute-balanced, semantically rich pairwise sentences using LLMs, then applies causal analysis to filter out potentially harmful sentences that could cause negative transfer. By estimating causal effects, Fair-Gender identifies sentences that align with the target PLM's knowledge distribution for incorporation into the model. This approach ensures positive transfer while preserving model expressiveness. The method is task-agnostic and has been tested across multiple PLM backbones, demonstrating significant reductions in gender bias while maintaining or improving downstream performance on language understanding tasks.

## Key Results
- Fair-Gender significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Auto-Debias in fairness metrics (SEAT, ICAT, CrowS-Pairs)
- The method maintains or improves language understanding performance on GLUE benchmark tasks
- Fair-Gender demonstrates effectiveness across multiple PLM backbones, showing scalability and task-agnostic nature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Fair-Gender works by generating attribute-balanced, semantically rich sentences using LLMs, then applying causal analysis to filter out potentially harmful sentences that could cause negative transfer. The causal effect estimation identifies sentences that align with the target PLM's knowledge distribution, ensuring positive transfer while preserving model expressiveness. This approach leverages the strengths of both LLM generation (diversity and quality) and causal analysis (precision in filtering) to create a more effective debiasing method than traditional corpus-based approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Causal Effect Estimation**
- Why needed: To identify which LLM-generated sentences will have positive transfer effects on the target PLM without introducing new biases
- Quick check: Verify that the causal model correctly identifies known biased vs unbiased sentence pairs in validation set

**Attribute-Balanced Sentence Generation**
- Why needed: To create diverse, high-quality training data that represents multiple perspectives and reduces bias
- Quick check: Confirm generated sentence pairs have balanced representation across target attributes

**Negative Transfer Prevention**
- Why needed: To avoid incorporating harmful sentences that could worsen model performance or introduce new biases
- Quick check: Test that filtered sentences don't degrade performance on standard language tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
LLM Generator -> Causal Filter -> PLM Incorporation -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**
1. LLM generates attribute-balanced sentence pairs
2. Causal analysis filters sentences for positive transfer
3. Filtered sentences incorporated into target PLM
4. Model evaluated on fairness and language understanding metrics

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Generation quality vs. computational cost: Higher quality LLM prompts yield better sentences but increase generation time
- Filtering strictness vs. data quantity: Stricter causal filtering reduces negative transfer risk but may limit available training data
- Model expressiveness preservation vs. bias reduction: Aggressive debiasing could potentially harm model performance

**Failure Signatures**
- Performance degradation on standard language tasks indicates over-aggressive debiasing
- Minimal improvement in fairness metrics suggests ineffective filtering or incorporation
- High variance in results across different PLM backbones indicates method sensitivity to model architecture

**3 First Experiments**
1. Generate and manually inspect 100 sentence pairs to verify attribute balance and semantic quality
2. Test causal filtering on a small set of known biased vs unbiased sentences to validate effectiveness
3. Measure performance impact of incorporating 1,000 vs 10,000 filtered sentences on a target PLM

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas for future research emerge from the limitations section, including testing the method's generalizability to other languages, cultural contexts, and bias types beyond gender.

## Limitations

- The evaluation is limited to English language models and gender-related bias dimensions
- The causal analysis framework relies on specific implementation choices that may not transfer to other bias mitigation scenarios
- Claims of scalability and task-agnostic effectiveness are supported by experiments across multiple PLM backbones but within a constrained set of tasks and datasets

## Confidence

**Effectiveness of Fair-Gender in reducing gender bias:** High confidence - Multiple evaluation metrics show consistent improvements over baselines

**Preservation of model expressiveness and downstream performance:** High confidence - GLUE benchmark results demonstrate maintained or improved performance

**Scalability and task-agnostic nature:** Medium confidence - While tested across multiple PLM backbones, the range of tasks and languages is limited

## Next Checks

1. Test Fair-Gender's effectiveness on non-English language models and multilingual PLMs to assess cross-linguistic generalization

2. Evaluate the method's performance on bias types beyond gender (e.g., racial, age-related) using appropriate benchmarks

3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of LLM generation, filtering, and incorporation steps to the overall performance gains
