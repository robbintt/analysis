# Restoring Rhythm: Punctuation Restoration Using Transformer Models for Bangla, a Low-Resource Language

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.18448
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18448
- Reference count: 33
- Authors achieve 97.1% accuracy on News test set using XLM-RoBERTa-large with data augmentation

## Executive Summary
This study addresses punctuation restoration for Bangla, a low-resource language, by leveraging multilingual transformer models and synthetic data augmentation. The authors construct a large, diverse Bangla dataset and apply token-level noise injection to improve generalization to noisy ASR transcripts. Using XLM-RoBERTa-large with a BiLSTM classifier, they achieve strong performance across clean text (97.1% accuracy on News) and noisy ASR outputs (90.2% accuracy), establishing a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration while providing publicly available datasets and code.

## Method Summary
The approach uses XLM-RoBERTa-large encoder followed by a BiLSTM layer and fully connected classifier for 5-class sequence labeling (period, comma, question, exclamation, O). Bangla text is tokenized using BPE with max sequence length 256. Data augmentation applies substitution, deletion, and insertion noise at rate α=0.20. The model is trained with cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer (lr=5e-6), batch size 8, for 10 epochs on ~2.17M training tokens, with evaluation on three test sets (News, Reference, ASR).

## Key Results
- Best model (α=0.20 augmentation) achieves 97.1% accuracy on News test set
- Strong generalization to noisy ASR: 90.2% accuracy on ASR-derived transcripts
- Severe class imbalance affects rare punctuation: exclamation marks achieve only 34.8-46.3% F1-score

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-lingual Transfer via Multilingual Pretraining
Multilingual pretrained transformers enable effective punctuation restoration in low-resource languages through cross-lingual knowledge transfer. XLM-RoBERTa-large, pretrained on 100+ languages using masked language modeling on 2TB of Common Crawl data, encodes universal syntactic and semantic patterns that transfer to Bangla. Fine-tuning adapts these representations to the punctuation restoration objective, assuming Bangla punctuation patterns share structural regularities with other languages in the pretraining corpus.

### Mechanism 2: Bidirectional Context Modeling
Bidirectional sequence modeling captures contextual cues needed for accurate punctuation placement. The BiLSTM layer processes sequences in both forward and backward directions, providing each position with both preceding and following context. This is critical since punctuation decisions often depend on upcoming sentence structure (e.g., recognizing a question from word order). The mechanism assumes punctuation placement is a sequential decision problem where both left and right context matter.

### Mechanism 3: Noise-Injecting Data Augmentation
Noise-injecting data augmentation improves generalization to real-world ASR outputs by simulating transcription errors. The augmentation pipeline applies substitution (replacing tokens with unknown), deletion (removing tokens), and insertion (adding unknown tokens) at controlled rate α. This exposes the model to perturbed inputs during training, forcing it to learn robust punctuation patterns that survive ASR-style noise. The mechanism assumes ASR errors in Bangla follow similar patterns to the synthetic noise injected.

## Foundational Learning

- **Token-level sequence labeling with transformers**: Punctuation restoration is framed as assigning one of five labels to each token. Understanding how transformers produce per-token representations is essential. *Quick check*: Given an input sequence of N tokens, what is the shape of the output logits from this architecture before the final softmax?

- **Subword tokenization (BPE)**: Bangla has complex morphology and a large vocabulary. Byte-Pair Encoding handles rare words and script variants, which affects how punctuation labels align with tokens. *Quick check*: If a Bangla word is split into 3 subword tokens, how should the punctuation label for that word position be assigned during training?

- **Class imbalance in sequence labeling**: Exclamation marks comprise <1% of training tokens, leading to F1-scores as low as 34.8-46.3%. Understanding how imbalance affects learning is critical for diagnosis. *Quick check*: Why might accuracy be a misleading metric when evaluating performance on rare punctuation classes like exclamation marks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw unpunctuated Bangla text → BPE tokenizer → XLM-RoBERTa-large → BiLSTM → Fully connected layer (5 outputs) → Softmax → Punctuation label

- **Critical path**: Data preprocessing → Punctuation label alignment → Augmentation (if α > 0) → Forward pass through transformer → BiLSTM → Classifier → Loss computation and backpropagation

- **Design tradeoffs**: XLM-RoBERTa-large vs. base offers higher accuracy but slower inference; augmentation strength α balances ASR robustness vs. clean-text performance; BiLSTM adds sequential modeling but increases parameters

- **Failure signatures**: Low exclamation mark recall (23-36%) indicates class imbalance; confusion between comma and period (26-29% misclassification) suggests sentence boundary ambiguity; performance drop from News (97.1%) to ASR (90.2%) indicates domain mismatch

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline reproduction: Train without augmentation, evaluate on all three test sets to confirm reported metrics
  2. Ablation of BiLSTM: Remove BiLSTM layer and connect transformer outputs directly to classifier
  3. Class imbalance mitigation: Apply weighted loss or oversampling for exclamation marks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Integration of Prosodic Features**: Can integrating prosodic features such as pause duration and pitch shifts with the transformer model significantly reduce punctuation errors in noisy ASR transcripts? The paper suggests this holds promise but remains beyond current scope.

- **Fine-tuning on Disfluency-Annotated Speech**: Does targeted fine-tuning on speech-derived corpora annotated with disfluency markers effectively mitigate the confusion between commas and periods found in noisy transcripts?

- **Specialized Techniques for Rare Punctuation**: What specific data balancing or architectural modifications are required to improve the prediction of rare punctuation marks, specifically exclamation marks?

## Limitations
- Severe class imbalance for exclamation marks (<1% of training data) results in very low F1-scores (34.8-46.3%)
- Synthetic augmentation may not accurately simulate real ASR error patterns documented in neighbor research
- Missing architectural details (BiLSTM configuration, learning rate schedule) limit exact reproduction

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core architectural framework, dataset construction, and primary performance metrics are well-documented
- **Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of multilingual transfer and augmentation mechanisms supported by results but lack ablation studies
- **Low Confidence**: Specific contributions of BiLSTM layer cannot be verified without ablated model results

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study Replication**: Train and evaluate three model variants (full model, transformer-only, baseline without augmentation) to isolate individual contributions
2. **Class Imbalance Mitigation Experiment**: Implement class-weighted loss or oversampling specifically for exclamation marks and measure impact on F1-score
3. **Domain Adaptation Validation**: Create cross-domain evaluation (clean→ASR and ASR→clean) and implement more sophisticated augmentation simulating phonetic confusions and disfluencies
