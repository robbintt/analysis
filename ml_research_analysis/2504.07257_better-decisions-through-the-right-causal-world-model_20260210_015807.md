core_contribution: This paper introduces COMET, a method for extracting interpretable
  causal world models from reinforcement learning environments. The approach uses
  symbolic regression to map object properties to internal state variables and then
  models how these states evolve over time, with LLM-based semantic annotation to
  improve interpretability.

# Better Decisions through the Right Causal World Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.07257
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07257
- Reference count: 2
- Method extracts interpretable causal world models from RL environments using symbolic regression and LLM-based semantic annotation

## Executive Summary
COMET introduces a novel approach to extracting interpretable causal world models from reinforcement learning environments. By combining symbolic regression with LLM-based semantic annotation, the method can identify object properties and their update rules, enabling agents to learn from true causal structures rather than spurious correlations. The framework demonstrates improved generalization to modified environments and shows promise for accelerating environment simulation through JAX reimplementation.

## Method Summary
COMET uses symbolic regression to map object properties to internal state variables in RL environments, then models how these states evolve over time. The approach employs LLM-based semantic annotation to improve interpretability of the extracted causal models. This framework aims to provide agents with a deeper understanding of environmental dynamics by learning the true causal relationships between objects and states, rather than relying on surface-level correlations.

## Key Results
- Successfully identifies object properties and their update rules in Atari games Pong and Freeway
- Extracts causal relationships between objects and environment internal states
- Achieves 30-100x speedup in environment simulation through JAX reimplementation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
COMET leverages symbolic regression to discover mathematical expressions that map observable object properties to latent state variables. By incorporating LLM-based semantic annotation, the method bridges the gap between abstract mathematical representations and human-understandable concepts. This combination allows the framework to uncover the underlying causal structure of the environment, enabling more robust decision-making that generalizes beyond the training distribution.

## Foundational Learning
- Symbolic Regression: Discovering mathematical expressions that describe relationships between variables
  - Why needed: To uncover the functional relationships between object properties and latent states
  - Quick check: Verify that the extracted expressions accurately predict state transitions
- Causal Inference: Identifying true cause-effect relationships in observational data
  - Why needed: To distinguish genuine causal relationships from spurious correlations
  - Quick check: Test model performance on modified environments with altered causal structures
- LLM-based Semantic Annotation: Using language models to interpret and label abstract representations
  - Why needed: To make the extracted causal models interpretable and actionable
  - Quick check: Validate the accuracy of LLM-generated annotations through human evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Object Properties -> Symbolic Regression -> Latent States -> LLM Annotation -> Causal Model
Critical path: Environment observation -> Object property extraction -> Symbolic regression -> Causal model formation
Design tradeoffs: Interpretability vs. accuracy, computational efficiency vs. model complexity
Failure signatures: Incorrect object property identification, spurious correlations in causal relationships, LLM annotation errors
First experiments: 1) Test on simple environments with known causal structures, 2) Evaluate interpretability through human assessment, 3) Benchmark simulation speed against original environment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on quality of symbolic regression and availability of ground truth labels
- Potential biases and errors introduced by LLM-based semantic annotation process
- Limited evaluation scope (only two Atari games) raises questions about generalizability

## Confidence
- Correct identification of object properties and update rules: High
- Demonstration of causal relationships vs. spurious correlations: High
- 30-100x speedup in environment simulation: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test COMET on a broader range of environments with varying complexity levels, including partially observable and stochastic settings
2. Implement a human evaluation study where domain experts assess the interpretability and correctness of extracted causal models across different application domains
3. Conduct systematic ablation studies to quantify the impact of each component (symbolic regression, LLM annotation, JAX implementation) on overall performance
