# Consistency-based Abductive Reasoning over Perceptual Errors of Multiple Pre-trained Models in Novel Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.19361
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19361
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed abduction-based ensemble outperforms individual models and standard baselines by ~13.6% F1 and ~16.6% accuracy on simulated aerial imagery with distributional shifts

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of deploying pre-trained perception models in novel environments where distributional shifts degrade performance. The core idea is to leverage consistency-based abduction over multiple models, using error detection rules to identify and manage conflicting predictions at test time. By framing the problem as an abductive reasoning task, the approach seeks a subset of predictions that maximizes coverage while minimizing logical inconsistencies derived from domain constraints. Two algorithms are proposed: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and a scalable Heuristic Search (HS). Extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset with controlled distributional shifts show that the abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving average relative improvements of approximately 13.6% in F1-score and 16.6% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets. These results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging novel scenarios.

## Method Summary
The framework combines multiple pre-trained perception models with domain-specific constraints through abductive reasoning. The approach involves three main phases: (1) Learning error detection rules for each model by identifying misclassifications on the training set, (2) Constructing a logic program that encodes these rules along with domain constraints (such as class mutual exclusivity), and (3) Using consistency-based abduction to find an optimal assignment of object classes that maximizes coverage while minimizing logical inconsistencies. Two algorithms are proposed: an exact IP-based approach and a heuristic search method. The system operates at test time without retraining, making it suitable for deployment in novel environments where traditional fine-tuning is impractical.

## Key Results
- The proposed framework achieves average F1-score improvements of ~13.6% and accuracy improvements of ~16.6% over individual models across 15 test datasets
- The approach consistently outperforms standard ensemble baselines including majority voting, weighted voting, and stacking methods
- Both the exact IP method and the heuristic HS method show similar performance, with HS providing better scalability while maintaining competitive accuracy
- The framework demonstrates robustness to varying degrees of distributional shift, with performance gains increasing as the gap between training and test distributions widens

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by explicitly modeling and resolving inconsistencies between multiple imperfect models rather than simply aggregating their predictions. By learning error detection rules that capture when each model is likely to fail, and by enforcing domain constraints that reflect real-world knowledge (like mutual exclusivity of object classes), the system can identify and correct systematic errors. The abductive reasoning process finds assignments that maximize coverage of objects while minimizing logical conflicts, effectively combining the strengths of different models while mitigating their individual weaknesses. This approach is particularly effective in novel environments where traditional ensemble methods that assume independent errors may fail to capture the complex failure modes that arise from distributional shifts.

## Foundational Learning
- Abductive reasoning: Why needed - provides formal framework for finding most plausible explanations given observations and constraints; Quick check - verify that the logic program correctly encodes the problem constraints
- Distributional shift: Why needed - understanding how and why model performance degrades in novel environments; Quick check - confirm that the simulated shifts in the dataset adequately represent real-world scenarios
- Error detection rules: Why needed - capture model-specific failure patterns to enable targeted corrections; Quick check - validate that learned rules accurately predict model errors on held-out data
- Consistency checking: Why needed - ensures that final predictions satisfy domain constraints and don't contain logical contradictions; Quick check - verify that the solver correctly identifies and resolves all inconsistencies
- Integer Programming formulation: Why needed - provides exact solution method for optimization problem; Quick check - confirm that the IP formulation correctly models the abduction problem
- Heuristic search algorithms: Why needed - provide scalable alternative to exact methods for larger problems; Quick check - validate that the heuristic method finds near-optimal solutions efficiently

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Pre-trained models -> Error detection rules -> Logic program (Π) -> Abductive solver (IP or HS) -> Consistent object class assignments

Critical path:
1. Run multiple pre-trained models on input image to get predictions
2. Apply error detection rules to identify potential false predictions
3. Construct logic program with predictions and domain constraints
4. Solve abductive reasoning problem to find consistent assignment
5. Output final object class predictions

Design tradeoffs:
- Exact IP method vs heuristic HS method: accuracy vs scalability
- Richness of domain constraints vs computational complexity
- Granularity of error detection rules vs learning complexity
- Coverage maximization vs consistency minimization (via parameter β)

Failure signatures:
- Poor performance when domain constraints are inaccurate or incomplete
- Scalability issues with exact IP method for large numbers of objects/classes
- Degradation when error detection rules fail to capture model failure patterns
- Suboptimal performance when models have highly correlated errors

Three first experiments:
1. Evaluate on a small-scale problem with known ground truth to verify correctness
2. Compare performance of IP vs HS methods on problems of increasing size
3. Test sensitivity to different values of the coverage-consistency tradeoff parameter β

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How do more sophisticated domain constraints (beyond simple class mutual exclusivity) affect the abductive framework's ability to resolve complex inconsistency scenarios among model predictions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "In future work, we plan to focus on the logic program for the deduction process to incorporate more sophisticated rules to infer alternative sets of assignments that address diverse inconsistency scenarios among model predictions."
- Why unresolved: Current domain knowledge Πdom contains only basic integrity constraints (Eq. 1: ¬assign(c′, ω) ← assign(c, ω)). Richer temporal, spatial, or semantic constraints remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing current formulation against enriched constraint sets (e.g., spatial co-occurrence rules, temporal consistency) on the same MDS-A benchmark, reporting F1/Accuracy improvements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How well does the consistency-based abduction framework generalize to real-world perception data beyond simulated environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All experiments use the AirSim-generated MDS-A dataset with controlled weather variations. The paper acknowledges deployment scenarios like "emergency response" and "NGO aid" but validates only on synthetic data.
- Why unresolved: Simulated data lacks real sensor noise, compression artifacts, and unpredictable environmental factors that may affect both perception models and metacognitive rule reliability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on real-world aerial imagery datasets (e.g., DOTA, VisDrone) with naturally occurring distribution shifts, comparing performance gaps between synthetic and real domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: At what scale does the Integer Programming approach become computationally intractable, and how does the performance gap between IP+TB and HS+TB widen with increasing problem size?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note "optimizing runtime efficiency remains a priority to enable scalability and practical application in real-world scenarios" and that solving IP instances is "NP-hard in the worst case."
- Why unresolved: Experiments tested limited scales (O(N · |F| · |C|) with 6 models, 4 classes). Scaling behavior with hundreds of models or object classes remains uncharacterized.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying N (objects per image), |F| (number of models), and |C| (class count), measuring solve time and solution quality degradation for both algorithms.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Would jointly learning error detection rules across multiple models (rather than independently per model) capture inter-model error correlations that improve abductive reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states "rules for the individual models are learned independently from each other, so we assume there is no existing knowledge of how the models perform together." This design choice may miss systematic correlated failures.
- Why unresolved: Independent rule learning cannot detect patterns like "when models A and B both predict class c under condition X, they tend to both be wrong"—potentially valuable for abduction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparison of independently-learned rules (current approach) vs. jointly-learned rules on identical test splits, measuring whether joint learning improves consistency resolution or F1-scores.

## Limitations
- Reliance on simulated data with controlled shifts, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world distributional changes
- Potential scalability issues with the exact IP method for larger problems, though the heuristic approach partially addresses this
- The assumption that domain constraints are known and can be effectively encoded as error detection rules

## Confidence
High: Effectiveness of framework in simulated aerial imagery dataset with controlled distributional shifts
Medium: Generalizability to real-world scenarios and other domains beyond aerial imagery
Medium: Scalability of exact IP method for larger problems
Low: Performance on perception tasks beyond object detection in aerial imagery

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework on real-world datasets from diverse domains (e.g., autonomous driving, medical imaging) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of specific domain constraints and error detection rules on performance
3. Compare the proposed approach with more recent ensemble methods and test-time adaptation techniques to establish its relative effectiveness
