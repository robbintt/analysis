# Neural Machine Translation for Coptic-French: Strategies for Low-Resource Ancient Languages

## Quick Facts

- This paper presents the first systematic study of neural machine translation for Coptic→French, addressing the challenge of translating low-resource ancient languages.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first systematic study of neural machine translation for Coptic→French, addressing the challenge of translating low-resource ancient languages. The authors evaluate four key strategies: (1) comparing direct fine-tuning vs. pivot-based translation, (2) choosing between pre-trained models with and without prior exposure to Coptic, (3) leveraging stylistic diversity by training on multiple French Bible translations, and (4) building robustness to noise by corrupting training data. Experiments show that fine-tuning outperforms pivot and multilingual baselines (BERTScore: 0.820 vs. 0.595–0.620), that models pre-trained on related scripts (Hieroglyphic) or Coptic perform best (Helsinki: BERTScore 0.850), and that including all translation variants in training improves generalization (best BLEURT/COMET scores). Noise injection at 50% corruption yields the best trade-off between clean-text quality and robustness to real-world degradation. Two strong NMT models are released for this task.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluated four strategies for translating Coptic to French using neural machine translation. They compared direct fine-tuning of pre-trained models against pivot-based translation through English, tested models with and without prior Coptic exposure, leveraged stylistic diversity from multiple French Bible translations, and built robustness through synthetic noise injection in training data. The evaluation used BERTScore, BLEURT, and COMET metrics across clean and noisy test sets, with experiments conducted on a corpus of approximately 50,000 parallel sentences.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning outperforms pivot and multilingual baselines (BERTScore: 0.820 vs. 0.595–0.620)
- Models pre-trained on related scripts (Hieroglyphic) or Coptic perform best (Helsinki: BERTScore 0.850)
- Including all translation variants in training improves generalization (best BLEURT/COMET scores)
- Noise injection at 50% corruption yields optimal trade-off between clean-text quality and robustness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works because it systematically addresses the unique challenges of ancient language translation: extreme data scarcity, orthographic variations, and text degradation. Fine-tuning pre-trained models with Coptic exposure leverages transfer learning from related scripts and languages. Using multiple French Bible translations captures stylistic diversity, helping the model generalize beyond a single translation style. Noise injection during training builds robustness to the physical degradation common in ancient manuscripts, while the pivot approach provides a fallback when direct translation data is insufficient.

## Foundational Learning

**Transfer Learning**: Pre-training on related scripts or languages before fine-tuning on the target task. Why needed: Ancient languages have minimal training data, making it essential to leverage knowledge from related linguistic resources. Quick check: Verify that pre-training data shares linguistic features with the target language.

**Multilingual Models**: Joint training on multiple languages using shared representations. Why needed: Maximizes limited data by finding cross-linguistic patterns and provides fallback translation paths. Quick check: Confirm the model can handle code-switching between languages.

**Noise Injection**: Deliberately corrupting training data to improve robustness. Why needed: Ancient manuscripts contain physical degradation, transcription errors, and orthographic variations. Quick check: Test model performance degrades gracefully as noise increases.

**Style Transfer**: Training on multiple translation variants to capture linguistic diversity. Why needed: Biblical texts have multiple legitimate translations reflecting different interpretive traditions. Quick check: Ensure model can reproduce different stylistic choices when prompted.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Coptic Text -> Preprocessor (Transliteration/Encoding) -> NMT Model (Fine-tuned or Pivot) -> French Translation -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**: The fine-tuning approach with pre-trained models showing prior Coptic exposure represents the most direct and highest-performing path from input to translation output.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Fine-tuning offers superior performance but requires more computational resources than pivot approaches. Using multiple translation variants improves generalization but increases training complexity. Noise injection improves robustness but may reduce clean-text quality if overdone.

**Failure Signatures**: Pivot approaches show significant quality degradation (BERTScore drops to 0.595-0.620). Models without Coptic exposure perform poorly on script-specific features. Over-aggressive noise injection (>50%) degrades translation quality on clean text.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare fine-tuning vs. pivot baselines on a held-out validation set
2. Test pre-trained models with and without Coptic exposure on clean text
3. Evaluate noise injection at 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% corruption levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Extreme data scarcity (only ~50,000 sentence pairs) limits generalizability beyond biblical texts
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture translation quality for ancient language content with stylistic variation
- Findings may not transfer to other ancient language pairs with different linguistic properties

## Confidence

**High**: Relative performance ranking of fine-tuning vs. pivot approaches
**Medium**: Claims about optimal noise corruption levels (50%)
**Low**: Cross-linguistic generalizability of findings to other ancient language pairs

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate model robustness using real-world Coptic manuscript scans with physical degradation rather than synthetically corrupted text
2. Test whether pre-training strategies effective for Coptic transfer to other ancient languages with different scripts (e.g., Sanskrit, Ancient Greek)
3. Assess whether including multiple translation variants improves quality for non-biblical Coptic text domains like documentary papyri or literary works
