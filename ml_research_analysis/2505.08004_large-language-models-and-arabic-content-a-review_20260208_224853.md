## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.08004
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08004
- Authors: Haneh Rhel; Dmitri Roussinov
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: Review of Arabic LLMs covering NLP tasks, benchmarks, and challenges including morphology, dialects, and evaluation gaps

## Executive Summary
This review examines the development and application of large language models for Arabic natural language processing tasks. The authors analyze pre-trained models like AraBERT and MARBERT, which have demonstrated strong performance on tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and text classification. The review highlights the challenges posed by Arabic's rich morphology, complex structure, and diverse dialects, while discussing recent advances in model architectures and evaluation methodologies. Key findings include the effectiveness of sub-word tokenization for morphological handling, the performance benefits of model scaling, and the potential of prompt engineering as an alternative to fine-tuning for specific tasks.

## Method Summary
The review synthesizes existing literature on Arabic LLMs through comprehensive analysis of pre-trained models, benchmarks, and evaluation studies. It examines models including AraBERT, MARBERT, EgyBERT, ALLaM, and ArabianGPT, along with benchmarks such as ALUE, NADI, and task-specific datasets. The methodology involves systematic categorization of models by architecture (BERT-family, GPT-family, T5-family), tokenization approaches, and performance metrics. The review evaluates models across various Arabic NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, grammatical error correction, translation, and AI detection, while identifying gaps in current research and proposing future directions.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 demonstrates high accuracy in Arabic grammar correction with F1 score of 65.49
- AraMUS (11B parameters, 529GB corpus) outperforms smaller models on multi-task benchmarks
- Arabic NLP tasks face significant challenges due to rich morphology, complex structure, and diverse dialects
- Growing focus on dialect-specific models and high-quality Arabic corpora to address resource gaps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sub-word tokenization reduces vocabulary explosion from Arabic's rich morphology.
- Mechanism: Arabic's root-and-pattern structure (e.g., ك-ت-ب → كتاب, كاتب, مكتوب) creates many surface forms from single roots. Farasa segmentation used by AraBERT splits words into prefixes, roots, and suffixes before tokenization, which reduces vocabulary size and improves coverage of morphological variants.
- Core assumption: Morphological decomposition preserves semantic meaning while reducing out-of-vocabulary rates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Arabic NLP tasks face various challenges due to the complexities of the Arabic language, including its rich morphology, intricate structure"
  - [section 4.1]: "A Sub-Word Tokenisation method was used for data processing, employing Farasa segmentation... to divide words into roots, prefixes, and suffixes, which helped reduce redundancy and managed the complexity of the Arabic lexical"
  - [corpus]: Related work on code-switched Arabic NLP confirms morphological complexity remains a central challenge across Arabic NLP systems.
- Break condition: If segmentation introduces ambiguity (multiple valid parses) without disambiguation, performance degrades on diacritized or ambiguous texts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model and data scale correlate with improved multi-task performance in Arabic LLMs.
- Mechanism: Larger parameter counts and training corpora enable better generalization across Arabic's diverse variants (MSA, CA, and dialects). AraMUS (11B parameters, 529GB corpus) outperformed smaller models like SABER (369M) and JABER (135M) on multi-task benchmarks.
- Core assumption: Scale compensates for linguistic complexity without requiring architecture changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1]: "AraMUS outperformed the other smaller models in multi-tasks and confirmed that increasing the model and dataset scale could improve models' performance"
  - [section 6.1]: "Academics and researchers are continuously employing techniques of fine-tuning and transfer learning to improve these models' performance"
  - [corpus]: AraReasoner benchmarking paper confirms scaling effects but notes Arabic-specific reasoning tasks remain underexplored.
- Break condition: Diminishing returns if training data quality is low or dialect coverage is imbalanced—larger models may overfit to dominant variants.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prompt engineering with few-shot learning can approach fine-tuned performance on specific Arabic NLP tasks.
- Mechanism: GPT-4 with expert prompts and few-shot examples achieved F1=65.49 on Arabic Grammatical Error Correction (AGEC), demonstrating that in-context learning can partially substitute task-specific fine-tuning for low-resource languages.
- Core assumption: The base model has sufficient Arabic representations from multilingual pre-training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GPT-4 demonstrating high accuracy in grammar correction (F1 score of 65.49)"
  - [section 4.2]: "GPT-4, experts' prompts with few-shot learning, have presented a competitive performance on AGEC tasks... although further improvements need to match the fine-tuned models"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus evidence on prompt engineering effectiveness specifically for Arabic; related surveys note this as an emerging area.
- Break condition: Prompt-based approaches underperform when tasks require deep morphological analysis or dialect-specific knowledge not well-represented in pre-training data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Arabic morphological complexity (root-and-pattern, agglutination, diacritics)
  - Why needed here: All Arabic NLP models must handle morphological derivation and inflection; failure to understand this leads to vocabulary explosion and ambiguity.
  - Quick check question: Given the root ك-ت-ب (k-t-b, "write"), can you predict how prefixes/suffixes change meaning and surface form?

- Concept: Dialectal variation vs. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)
  - Why needed here: Models trained only on MSA underperform on dialectal content; ~30 dialects with phonological, morphological, and lexical differences.
  - Quick check question: Why might a sentiment analysis model trained on Egyptian tweets fail on Gulf Arabic data?

- Concept: Pre-training objectives (MLM, NSP, RTD, RLHF)
  - Why needed here: Early Arabic PLMs use MLM/NSP (AraBERT, MARBERT), while recent LLMs use RLHF; understanding trade-offs informs model selection.
  - Quick check question: What is the computational cost difference between MLM-based pre-training and RLHF-based alignment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Tokenizer: Farasa (AraBERT), AraNizer (ArabianGPT), or standard BPE; choice affects OOV rates and morphological handling
  - Encoder backbone: BERT-family (AraBERT, MARBERT, EgyBERT) for understanding tasks; T5-family (AraT5) for text-to-text
  - Decoder backbone: GPT-family (ArabianGPT, ALLaM) for generation tasks
  - Pre-training corpus: MSA-focused (Wikipedia, news) vs. dialect-rich (social media, tweets); MARBERT uses 2.5B tokens including dialectal content
  - Benchmarks: ALUE (MSA-focused), NADI (dialect identification), task-specific (ASTD for sentiment, QALB for grammar correction)

- Critical path:
  1. Define target task and language variant (MSA, specific dialect, or mixed)
  2. Select base model: monolingual Arabic (AraBERT, MARBERT) vs. multilingual (mBERT, GPT-4)
  3. Choose tokenization aligned with morphological complexity
  4. Identify benchmark/dataset for evaluation (ALUE for general, NADI for dialects)
  5. Apply fine-tuning or prompt engineering based on resource constraints

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Monolingual (AraBERT) vs. Multilingual (GPT-4): Monolingual captures Arabic-specific morphology better; multilingual enables cross-lingual transfer but may dilute Arabic representations
  - Encoder-only vs. Decoder-only: Encoders excel at classification/understanding; decoders better for generation; encoder-decoder (T5) for translation/summarization
  - Scale vs. accessibility: AraMUS (11B) shows strong performance but requires 16× A100 GPUs; smaller models (EgyBERT) enable local deployment but may sacrifice generalization

- Failure signatures:
  - High OOV rate on dialectal text: Indicates tokenizer/corpus mismatch; consider dialect-specific model (EgyBERT for Egyptian)
  - Poor performance on diacritized text: AI detectors and models struggle with diacritics; dediacritization layer may help but loses information
  - Overfitting to benchmark patterns: ALUE concentrates on MSA; models may not generalize to real-world dialectal content
  - Ambiguity errors on undiacritized text: Words like علم can mean "teach," "flag," "knowledge" depending on diacritics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate AraBERT vs. MARBERT vs. multilingual GPT-4 on target task using ALUE or task-specific benchmark; document F1/accuracy gaps
  2. Tokenization ablation: Test Farasa segmentation vs. character-level vs. standard BPE on dialectal dataset (e.g., NADI); measure OOV reduction and task performance
  3. Prompt engineering sweep: For generation/correction tasks, compare zero-shot, few-shot, and expert-prompt strategies on GPT-4; quantify gap vs. fine-tuned models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can transfer learning be effectively leveraged to integrate diverse Arabic dialectal variations into LLMs to improve generalization across regional texts?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state the need to explore "effective methods to integrate dialectal variations into LLMs and leveraging transfer learning technologies to aid models in generalisation across dialects."
- **Why unresolved:** Current models like EgyBERT excel in specific dialects but fail in MSA, while models like AraBERT focus on MSA and struggle with dialectal nuances.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A model architecture or fine-tuning methodology that demonstrates high performance (state-of-the-art F1 scores) on benchmarks covering multiple dialects simultaneously (e.g., NADI, MADAR) without catastrophic forgetting.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What novel evaluation metrics are required to accurately reflect the unique linguistic nuances of the Arabic language, such as rich morphology and diacritics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper calls for "proposing new metrics to evaluate the models' performance and reflect all the nuances of the Arabic language" in the Future Work section.
- **Why unresolved:** Standard benchmarks often rely on generic metrics (like BLEU) or focus primarily on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), failing to capture the complexity of dialectal or diacritized text.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The adoption of a standardized benchmark that scores models specifically on morphological correctness, diacritization accuracy, and orthographic consistency alongside semantic understanding.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent do cultural biases in existing Arabic datasets influence LLM outputs, and what criteria are necessary to ensure fairness?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors highlight the need to "examine how biases in Arabic datasets may impact models' outputs by developing appropriate cultural criteria to ensure fairness."
- **Why unresolved:** There is a lack of research on how the scarcity of diverse, high-quality Arabic corpora might reinforce cultural biases or misrepresent the "Arabic-speaking world" in model outputs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comprehensive audit of major Arabic LLMs identifying specific cultural biases, followed by the release of a "culturally aligned" dataset that mitigates these issues.

## Limitations
- Limited temporal coverage as the review focuses on developments through 2023, missing newer models like Jais (13B parameters)
- Several discussed models (ALLaM, ArabianGPT) have limited public availability, preventing independent verification
- Benchmark coverage gaps with ALUE focusing heavily on MSA rather than comprehensive dialect evaluation

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (mechanistic understanding well-established):
- Morphological tokenization benefits (Farasa segmentation reducing OOV rates)
- Scale-performance correlation in Arabic LLMs
- Dialect-specific model necessity for regional variants

**Medium Confidence** (supported by evidence but with gaps):
- GPT-4 prompt engineering effectiveness for Arabic tasks
- Comparative performance across different Arabic PLM architectures
- AI detection reliability in Arabic content

**Low Confidence** (insufficient empirical backing):
- Long-term generalization across all 30+ Arabic dialects
- Cost-effectiveness comparisons between fine-tuning vs. prompting approaches
- Cross-lingual transfer capabilities from Arabic to other morphologically rich languages

## Next Checks

1. **Tokenization Ablation Study**: Compare Farasa segmentation against character-level and BPE tokenizers on a dialectally diverse Arabic corpus (e.g., combining NADI, ASTD, and Twitter data). Measure OOV rates, tokenization consistency, and downstream task performance (F1 scores) across MSA and major dialectal varieties.

2. **Prompt Engineering Benchmarking**: Systematically evaluate GPT-4's Arabic performance using zero-shot, few-shot, and expert-crafted prompts across 5 distinct NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, NER, translation, grammar correction, question answering). Compare against fine-tuned Arabic-specific models using identical datasets and metrics to quantify the prompt-tuning performance gap.

3. **Dialect Coverage Analysis**: Train or fine-tune a single Arabic LLM (e.g., AraBERT) on progressively more dialectally diverse corpora (starting with MSA, adding Egyptian, then Gulf, Levantine, etc.). Evaluate performance degradation/improvement on dialect identification (NADI) and sentiment analysis tasks to identify the minimum dialectal coverage needed for robust Arabic NLP.
