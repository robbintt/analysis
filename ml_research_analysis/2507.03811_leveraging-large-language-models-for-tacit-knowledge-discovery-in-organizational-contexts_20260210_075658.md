- Primary result: 94.9% full-knowledge recall in organizational knowledge discovery using LLM-based agents

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to tacit knowledge discovery in organizations using LLM-based agents. The core method involves simulating organizational knowledge dissemination through epidemic models and employing an agent that iteratively interacts with employees to reconstruct dataset descriptions. The agent uses prompt-chaining techniques and self-critical feedback to navigate organizational structures and extract fragmented knowledge. Across 864 simulations with various company structures and dissemination parameters, the agent achieved 94.9% full-knowledge recall. Notably, the approach successfully recovered information without directly accessing the domain specialist (patient zero), demonstrating its ability to navigate organizational complexity.

## Method Summary
The methodology simulates organizational knowledge dissemination using epidemic models, where knowledge spreads through organizational networks from an initial domain specialist (patient zero). An LLM-based agent iteratively interacts with employees, employing prompt-chaining techniques and self-critical feedback to navigate organizational structures and extract fragmented knowledge. The approach was tested across 864 simulations with various company structures and dissemination parameters, using different knowledge fragmentation levels and organizational hierarchies to evaluate the agent's effectiveness in recovering complete information.

## Key Results
- Achieved 94.9% full-knowledge recall across 864 simulations
- Successfully recovered information without directly accessing the domain specialist (patient zero)
- Self-critical feedback scores showed strong correlation with external evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by modeling organizational knowledge as a spreading process through epidemic models, where information flows from specialists through networks of employees. The LLM agent acts as a knowledge reconstructor, using prompt-chaining to systematically query employees and piece together fragmented information. Self-critical feedback allows the agent to evaluate its own responses and refine its knowledge extraction strategy. This iterative process enables the agent to navigate complex organizational structures and recover complete information even when the original knowledge source is inaccessible.

## Foundational Learning
- Epidemic modeling: Needed to simulate realistic knowledge dissemination patterns in organizations. Quick check: Verify the model accurately represents different network structures and information spread rates.
- Prompt-chaining: Required for systematic information extraction through multiple interaction rounds. Quick check: Test chain robustness with varying prompt complexity and employee responses.
- Self-critical feedback: Essential for agent self-evaluation and strategy refinement. Quick check: Validate feedback accuracy against human evaluation metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Epidemic Model -> Knowledge Network -> LLM Agent -> Employee Interaction -> Knowledge Reconstruction -> Self-Critical Evaluation

Critical Path:
1. Initialize epidemic model with patient zero and organizational structure
2. Simulate knowledge dissemination through network
3. LLM agent queries employees using prompt-chaining
4. Agent performs self-critical evaluation of gathered knowledge
5. Iterate until knowledge reconstruction complete

Design Tradeoffs:
- Model complexity vs. simulation efficiency
- Query depth vs. interaction overhead
- Agent autonomy vs. human oversight requirements

Failure Signatures:
- Early termination of knowledge spread in epidemic model
- Inconsistent responses across employee interactions
- Low self-critical evaluation scores

First Experiments:
1. Test agent performance with different organizational structures (hierarchical vs. flat)
2. Vary knowledge fragmentation levels to assess recovery capabilities
3. Compare performance with and without self-critical feedback mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on simulated organizational structures may not capture real-world complexity
- High recall rates based on controlled simulations rather than empirical testing
- Potential LLM biases in knowledge representation not addressed
- Scalability to larger, more complex organizational structures unclear

## Confidence

High: Core methodology and simulation results are clearly presented and logically structured. The use of epidemic models for knowledge dissemination and the iterative agent approach are well-defined.

Medium: Correlation between self-critical feedback scores and external evaluation metrics is promising but requires further validation in real-world scenarios to confirm generalizability.

Low: Insufficient information on potential limitations of the LLM model used, such as biases in knowledge representation or challenges in handling ambiguous or conflicting information from multiple sources.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical testing of the approach in real organizational settings to validate the simulation results and assess performance in complex, dynamic environments.

2. Investigate the impact of different organizational structures and knowledge types on the agent's effectiveness, including scenarios with high information fragmentation or conflicting knowledge sources.

3. Evaluate the scalability of the approach by testing it on larger datasets and more complex organizational hierarchies to determine its limitations and potential optimizations.
