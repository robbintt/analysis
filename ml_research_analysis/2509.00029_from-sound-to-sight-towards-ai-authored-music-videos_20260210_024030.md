- This paper introduces two novel pipelines for automatically generating music videos from user-specified songs, leveraging off-the-shelf deep learning models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents two innovative pipelines for automatically generating music videos from audio tracks using deep learning models. The first approach uses CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) to extract musical attributes from audio segments, which are then converted into narrative scene descriptions by a reasoning LLM. The second approach employs a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) that directly generates coherent narratives from raw audio without explicit feature extraction. Both pipelines convert textual prompts into video clips using diffusion-based text-to-video models. A preliminary user evaluation with five participants assessed the narrative quality, visual coherence, and emotional alignment of the generated videos, showing that the CLAP-based pipeline achieved slightly higher overall ratings compared to the LALM-based pipeline.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two distinct pipelines for AI-generated music videos. The first pipeline uses CLAP for audio analysis, extracting segment-wise and track-wide musical attributes, which are then translated into narrative scene descriptions by a reasoning LLM. The second pipeline employs a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to directly generate a coherent narrative from raw audio, bypassing explicit feature extraction. Both pipelines convert textual prompts into video clips using diffusion-based text-to-video models. The approach leverages existing deep learning models for audio analysis, narrative generation, and video synthesis to create automated music visualization systems.

## Key Results
- CLAP-based pipeline achieved higher overall ratings (M = 2.93, SD = 1.01) compared to LALM-based pipeline (M = 2.64, SD = 0.89)
- Narrative concepts were well-received by participants, though visual consistency and character continuity need improvement
- Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of using off-the-shelf deep learning models for automatic music video generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining): A model that learns joint representations of audio and text, enabling cross-modal understanding between sound and language
- Large Audio Language Models (LALM): Models trained on audio data that can directly process and generate text from sound inputs without explicit feature extraction
- Diffusion-based text-to-video models: Generative models that create video sequences from textual descriptions by iteratively denoising random noise
- Reasoning LLMs: Large language models specialized in logical inference and narrative construction from extracted features

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Audio -> CLAP/LALM -> Narrative Generation -> Text-to-Video Diffusion -> Final Video
**Critical Path**: Audio input → Feature extraction (CLAP) or direct processing (LALM) → Narrative generation → Video synthesis → Final output
**Design Tradeoffs**: Explicit feature extraction (CLAP) vs. direct audio-to-text (LALM) - the former offers more control but requires feature engineering, while the latter is more streamlined but potentially less interpretable
**Failure Signatures**: Poor narrative coherence from audio analysis, visual inconsistency in generated frames, mismatch between musical mood and visual content
**3 First Experiments**: 1) Test CLAP feature extraction accuracy across different music genres, 2) Evaluate LALM narrative generation quality on diverse audio samples, 3) Measure video generation quality with different text-to-video models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Very small user evaluation (N=5 participants) limits statistical power and generalizability
- Subjective nature of video quality assessment and lack of standardized evaluation metrics
- No detailed analysis of reasoning LLM's narrative generation quality or LALM's direct audio-to-narrative capabilities

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Feasibility of using off-the-shelf deep learning models for automatic music video generation
**Medium Confidence**: Comparative performance between CLAP-based and LALM-based pipelines
**Low Confidence**: Claim that these techniques can expand music visualization beyond traditional approaches

## Next Checks
1. Scale user evaluation: Conduct a large-scale user study (minimum 30-50 participants) with diverse demographic backgrounds and music preferences to obtain statistically robust comparisons between the two pipelines
2. Implement automated quality metrics: Develop and validate quantitative metrics for narrative coherence, visual consistency, and emotional alignment that can complement subjective user ratings and enable systematic comparisons across different music genres
3. Test cross-genre generalization: Evaluate both pipelines across multiple music genres (classical, pop, electronic, jazz, etc.) to assess their robustness and identify genre-specific strengths and limitations in the feature extraction and narrative generation processes
