# Large Language Model Agents Are Not Always Faithful Self-Evolvers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22436
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22436
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Self-evolving LLM agents consistently rely on raw experience but often disregard condensed experience, even when it is the only form provided.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates experience faithfulness—the causal dependence of self-evolving LLM agents on their accumulated experience. Through controlled causal interventions across four self-evolving frameworks, ten LLM backbones, and nine environments, the authors uncover a striking asymmetry: agents consistently rely on raw experience but often disregard or misinterpret condensed experience, even when it is the only form provided. This gap persists across single- and multi-agent settings and model scales. The unfaithfulness is traced to three factors: semantic limitations of condensed content, internal processing biases that suppress experience, and task regimes where pretrained priors suffice. These findings challenge assumptions about self-evolving methods and highlight the need for more faithful experience integration.

## Method Summary
The study uses controlled causal interventions to test whether LLM agents causally depend on their experience. Four self-evolving frameworks (ExpeL, Dynamic Cheatsheet, ReasoningBank, G-Memory) are tested across ten LLM backbones and nine environments. Experience faithfulness is measured by perturbing retrieved memories (raw and condensed) and observing performance changes. Interventions include removing experience, shuffling steps, replacing with irrelevant content, corrupting text, and adding filler characters. Integrated Gradients attribution is used to analyze internal processing biases.

## Key Results
- Agents show strong faithfulness to raw experience (performance drops when perturbed) but weak faithfulness to condensed experience (minimal performance change when perturbed).
- This asymmetry persists across single- and multi-agent settings and across model scales.
- Condensed experience often has semantic limitations (generic, mismatched) that can actively harm performance through distraction, overreliance, or premature inference.
- Internal processing biases suppress condensed experience in favor of local context signals.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Agents are causally dependent on raw experience trajectories but exhibit weak faithfulness to condensed experience summaries.
- **Mechanism:** Controlled causal interventions (e.g., shuffling, corrupting, replacing with irrelevant content) are applied to agent inputs. If an agent's downstream behavior (performance) significantly changes, the agent is deemed "faithful" to that experience type. The study finds performance drops sharply when raw experience is perturbed but remains largely unchanged when condensed experience is perturbed.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: Intervention types are valid proxies for disrupting semantic content without introducing artifacts that independently degrade performance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Using controlled causal interventions... we uncover a striking asymmetry: while agents consistently depend on raw experience, they often disregard or misinterpret condensed experience..."
  - [section 4.1] "Faithfulness to raw experience is strong and robust... removing raw experience (w/o Raw Exp.) reliably causes substantial performance degradation... Condensed experience often has minimal behavioral influence."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence. Corpus neighbors (e.g., "MemEvolve," "Evo-Memory") focus on the design of evolving memory systems, not on diagnosing faithfulness via causal intervention.
- **Break condition:** An agent maintains high performance when raw experience is removed or corrupted, or shows significant degradation when only condensed experience is perturbed.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Internal processing biases within the LLM backbone suppress the influence of condensed experience in favor of local contextual signals.
- **Mechanism:** Integrated Gradients (IG) attribution quantifies each prompt segment's influence on the output. The analysis reveals that raw experience receives moderate, stable attribution across model layers, while condensed experience receives consistently low attribution. The "Current Trajectory" segment dominates in later layers, indicating a strong local-context bias.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: Attribution methods like Integrated Gradients accurately reflect information flow and influence within the model.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...internal processing biases that suppress experience..."
  - [section 5.2] "Condensed experience remains underutilized... IG scores attributed to condensed experience remain consistently low... Current trajectory dominates later layers."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. Corpus neighbors do not analyze internal processing biases or attribution in self-evolving agents.
- **Break condition:** IG attribution for condensed experience is high and stable across layers, comparable to or exceeding attribution for raw experience.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Condensed experience is often semantically limited—vague, generic, or mismatched—which can actively harm agent performance through distraction, overreliance on incorrect priors, or premature inference.
- **Mechanism:** Error analysis of cases where agents fail with condensed experience but succeed without it reveals three failure modes: (1) Distraction, where generic heuristics override task goals; (2) Overreliance, where outdated patterns are followed rigidly; and (3) Premature Inference, where agents skip verification based on assumptions from summaries.
- **Core assumption:** The failure mode categorization is comprehensive and correctly attributes causality to the content of the condensed experience.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...semantic limitations of condensed content..."
  - [section 5.1] "...condensed summaries may be uninformative or misaligned... leading to unnecessary detours or complete drift from the target."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. Related work (e.g., "WISE-Flow") focuses on creating structured experience but does not analyze semantic limitations or failure modes.
- **Break condition:** Providing high-quality, context-specific condensed experience consistently improves performance without introducing the identified failure modes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Causal Intervention in AI Systems:**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core methodology relies on controlled causal interventions to test the faithfulness of agent behavior. Understanding that you can test if a system *actually uses* an input by perturbing that input is fundamental.
  - Quick check question: If I replace a model's input A with random noise and its output doesn't change, what does that say about the model's dependence on A?

- **Attribution Methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients):**
  - Why needed here: To understand *why* an agent ignores an input, the paper uses attribution methods to trace information flow inside the model. This helps distinguish between "input is useless" vs. "model ignores the input."
  - Quick check question: What does a low attribution score for a specific input token indicate about that token's influence on the final prediction?

- **Raw vs. Condensed Knowledge Representation:**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central distinction is between "raw" (full trajectories) and "condensed" (summaries/heuristics) experience. This trade-off between information density and specificity is a key concept in memory and RAG systems.
  - Quick check question: What key property of "condensed" experience makes it more prone to the "semantic limitation" failures described in the paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Experience Repository -> Retriever -> Prompt Constructor -> LLM Backbone -> Evaluator

- **Critical path:**
  The path from **Retriever** to **Prompt Constructor** to **LLM Backbone** is the most critical for faithfulness. The way experiences are formatted and positioned in the prompt directly influences the backbone's internal processing biases. The paper shows that simply placing condensed experience in the prompt is insufficient; it is often suppressed by the model.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Raw vs. Condensed Memory:** Raw memory is more faithful but less token-efficient. Condensed memory is token-efficient but suffers from semantic limitations and low faithfulness.
  - **Static vs. Dynamic Injection:** The paper suggests static pre-pending is ineffective. Dynamic, context-aware injection (not fully explored but alluded to in the conclusion) is a potential future direction.
  - **Model Scale vs. Faithfulness:** Larger models perform better overall but do not inherently solve the faithfulness gap for condensed experience.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Raw Experience Intervention:** Significant performance drop (>10-20%) indicates faithfulness. Little or no drop suggests the agent was not relying on it.
  - **Condensed Experience Intervention:** Little to no performance drop across Corrupt, Irrelevant, and Filler interventions indicates unfaithfulness. Sometimes performance even improves, suggesting the original condensed content was actively harmful (semantic limitations).
  - **Knowledge-Intensive Tasks:** Very low sensitivity to *any* experience intervention indicates the model is relying on its internal pretrained priors rather than external memory.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Raw vs. Condensed Ablation:** On a task like ALFWorld or WebShop, systematically remove raw and condensed experience from an agent like ExpeL. Measure the performance delta for each. This confirms the basic faithfulness asymmetry in your setup.
  2. **Condensed Content Corruption:** Take the ReasoningBank framework (condensed-only) and replace the distilled insights with generic, irrelevant statements. If performance holds, it confirms that the agent was not faithfully using the original content.
  3. **Task Type Analysis:** Compare faithfulness on an embodied task (ALFWorld) vs. a knowledge QA task (HotpotQA). The QA task should show low sensitivity to all experience interventions, confirming the "pretrained priors" hypothesis.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How can automatic condensation methods be redesigned to optimize for alignment and behavioral utility rather than surface brevity?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The impact statement notes, "This opens up promising directions for automatic condensation methods that optimize for alignment and usability, rather than surface brevity alone."
  - Why unresolved: The study finds current condensed experiences are often semantically limited (too abstract or generic) to guide behavior causally.
  - What evidence would resolve it: New condensation algorithms generating actionable, context-specific heuristics that result in significantly higher intervention sensitivity.

- **Question:** Does incorporating experience as a situationally-aware, interactively-triggered signal improve faithfulness compared to static prepending?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose that "Incorporating experience as a situationally-aware, interactively-triggered signal holds promise for more faithful and efficient adaptation."
  - Why unresolved: Static prepending leads to "internal processing biases" where the model suppresses retrieved information in favor of local context.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A dynamic retrieval framework where behavioral sensitivity to condensed experience is restored or significantly improved.

- **Question:** Can architectural modifications or fine-tuning mitigate the internal bias that suppresses condensed experience in favor of local context?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.2 identifies "internal processing biases" via Integrated Gradients analysis, and Section 4.4 shows model scaling does not resolve the faithfulness gap.
  - Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that simply increasing model capacity does not cure the "faithfulness asymmetry."
  - What evidence would resolve it: A modified model architecture where attribution scores for condensed experience are robustly maintained in deeper layers.

## Limitations

- **Intervention Fidelity:** The specific perturbations (e.g., "Irrelevant" tasks, "Corrupt" text) may not consistently maintain semantic validity without introducing confounding artifacts.
- **Attribution Method Validity:** The use of Integrated Gradients assumes attribution scores accurately reflect information flow, but attribution methods have known limitations in capturing complex, non-linear dependencies in LLMs.
- **Incomplete Failure Mode Analysis:** The study provides qualitative examples of semantic limitations but does not exhaustively test all possible failure modes.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core finding that agents consistently depend on raw experience but often disregard condensed experience. This is supported by systematic causal interventions across multiple frameworks and environments.
- **Medium Confidence:** The attribution of unfaithfulness to semantic limitations, internal processing biases, and task regimes. While the evidence is compelling, these mechanisms are inferred from patterns rather than definitively proven.
- **Low Confidence:** The completeness of the failure mode categorization (Distraction, Overreliance, Premature Inference). The study provides qualitative examples but does not exhaustively test all possible semantic limitations.

## Next Checks

1. **Intervention Robustness Test:** Repeat the causal interventions using different perturbation strategies (e.g., semantic similarity-based irrelevant tasks, structured corruption patterns) to verify that the unfaithfulness gap persists across perturbation types.
2. **Attribution Method Comparison:** Compare Integrated Gradients attribution results with alternative methods (e.g., SHAP, attention-based scores) to assess whether the observed processing biases are consistent across attribution techniques.
3. **Semantic Quality Control:** Implement a controlled experiment where condensed experience is systematically varied in quality (e.g., high-quality summaries vs. generic heuristics) to directly measure the impact of semantic limitations on faithfulness.
