# TS-HINT: Enhancing Semiconductor Time Series Regression Using Attention Hints From Large Language Model Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05419
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05419
- Reference count: 0
- TS-HINT achieves 3.92 RMSE on full CMP dataset and 8.20 RMSE with 5-shot learning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TS-HINT, a novel time series foundation model framework that enhances semiconductor chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process monitoring by incorporating attention hints derived from large language model reasoning. The approach addresses the challenge of predicting material removal rate (MRR) in semiconductor manufacturing, where traditional methods lose temporal dynamics through static feature extraction and require extensive datasets. By leveraging LLM attention mechanisms and saliency maps as guidance during training, TS-HINT enables effective few-shot learning even in data-constrained environments while maintaining competitive performance on full datasets.

## Method Summary
TS-HINT combines time series foundation modeling with attention hints extracted from large language model reasoning processes. The framework uses attention mechanism data and saliency maps to guide the learning process during training, allowing the model to capture temporal dynamics more effectively than traditional feature engineering approaches. The model is designed to work directly with multivariate time series features without requiring extensive preprocessing or feature extraction, making it particularly suitable for industrial applications where labeled data is scarce.

## Key Results
- Achieves 3.92 RMSE on full CMP dataset, comparable to existing methods
- Demonstrates strong 5-shot learning performance with 8.20 RMSE
- Shows effective few-shot learning capabilities in limited data settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TS-HINT leverages attention mechanisms from large language models to provide structured guidance for time series learning. The LLM-derived attention hints help the model identify relevant temporal patterns and feature relationships that might be missed by conventional approaches. This cross-domain transfer of reasoning patterns allows the foundation model to learn more effectively from limited data by focusing on the most informative aspects of the time series signals.

## Foundational Learning
- Time series foundation models: Why needed - To capture complex temporal dependencies without manual feature engineering; Quick check - Verify model can learn from raw multivariate time series
- Attention mechanisms: Why needed - To identify relevant temporal patterns and relationships; Quick check - Ensure attention maps align with domain expertise
- Few-shot learning: Why needed - To enable model training with limited labeled data; Quick check - Test performance across different shot counts
- Saliency maps: Why needed - To provide interpretable guidance for model focus; Quick check - Validate saliency maps highlight meaningful features
- Cross-domain knowledge transfer: Why needed - To leverage LLM reasoning patterns for time series tasks; Quick check - Test performance consistency across different manufacturing processes

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Time Series Data -> Attention Hint Extraction -> TS-HINT Model -> MRR Prediction

Critical path: Raw time series input → Attention hint processing → Foundation model training → Few-shot adaptation → Final prediction

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational overhead from LLM integration against improved learning efficiency in data-scarce scenarios. The attention hint mechanism adds complexity but enables better generalization with limited data.

Failure signatures: Poor attention hint quality leads to suboptimal model focus; insufficient LLM reasoning diversity reduces transfer effectiveness; inadequate few-shot adaptation fails to capture domain-specific patterns.

First experiments:
1. Baseline comparison: Test TS-HINT against traditional feature engineering methods on full dataset
2. Few-shot scalability: Evaluate performance across 1-shot through 20-shot scenarios
3. Attention contribution: Conduct ablation studies removing LLM-derived attention hints

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope focused primarily on MRR prediction in CMP processes
- Unclear generalizability of LLM attention hints across different semiconductor manufacturing domains
- Computational overhead of incorporating LLM reasoning patterns not thoroughly analyzed
- Few-shot learning claims demonstrated only for 5-shot scenarios without broader scalability testing

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation of TS-HINT framework and CMP dataset results
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability claims to other semiconductor processes and time series domains
- **Medium confidence**: Few-shot learning performance claims beyond tested 5-shot scenario

## Next Checks
1. Test TS-HINT across multiple semiconductor manufacturing processes (e.g., etching, deposition) and compare performance consistency across domains
2. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies to quantify the exact contribution of LLM-derived attention hints versus other architectural innovations
3. Evaluate performance across a broader range of few-shot scenarios (1-shot through 20-shot) to understand scalability limits and identify optimal shot thresholds
