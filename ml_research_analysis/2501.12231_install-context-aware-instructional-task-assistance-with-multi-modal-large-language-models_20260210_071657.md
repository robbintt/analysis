# InsTALL: Context-aware Instructional Task Assistance with Multi-modal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.12231
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12231
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Context-aware instructional video assistant achieving state-of-the-art performance on task and action recognition

## Executive Summary
InsTALL is a context-aware instructional video assistant that integrates procedural task graphs with multimodal large language models to enable real-time assistance for multi-step tasks. By leveraging a procedural graph constructed from instructional videos, InsTALL enhances task recognition, action recognition, action prediction, and plan prediction capabilities beyond what LLMs can achieve alone. The approach combines visual and textual embeddings with graph-based context, enabling accurate step identification even in ambiguous scenarios. Evaluated on COIN and CrossTask datasets, InsTALL achieves state-of-the-art performance across five tasks and two error-detection tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods. For example, it reaches 98.9% task recognition accuracy on COIN and 99.6% on CrossTask. The graph injection reduces the reasoning burden on LLMs, making InsTALL a robust solution for visually aware task assistance.

## Method Summary
InsTALL integrates procedural task graphs with multimodal large language models to provide context-aware assistance for instructional tasks. The system constructs a procedural graph from instructional videos, which captures task sequences and action dependencies. This graph is then used to enhance LLM reasoning by providing structured context for task recognition, action prediction, and plan prediction. The approach combines visual and textual embeddings with graph-based context, enabling accurate step identification even in ambiguous scenarios. By reducing the reasoning burden on LLMs through graph injection, InsTALL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieves 98.9% task recognition accuracy on COIN dataset
- Achieves 99.6% task recognition accuracy on CrossTask dataset
- Outperforms existing methods on five task-related tasks and two error-detection tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages procedural task graphs to provide structured context that enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. By combining visual and textual embeddings with graph-based context, it can accurately identify task steps even in ambiguous scenarios. The graph injection approach reduces the reasoning burden on LLMs by providing pre-structured task information, allowing the system to focus on real-time assistance rather than complex reasoning from scratch.

## Foundational Learning

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Instructional Videos -> Procedural Graph Construction -> Multimodal Embedding Generation -> Graph-Enhanced LLM Reasoning -> Task Assistance Output

**Critical Path**
Procedural Graph Construction → Multimodal Embedding Generation → Graph-Enhanced LLM Reasoning

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Graph construction accuracy vs. computational overhead
- Embedding richness vs. processing speed
- LLM reasoning complexity vs. real-time responsiveness

**Failure Signatures**
- Graph construction errors leading to incorrect task sequences
- Embedding mismatches causing step identification failures
- LLM reasoning limitations in novel or complex scenarios

**First Experiments**
1. Evaluate task recognition accuracy on COIN dataset with varying graph completeness
2. Test action prediction performance on CrossTask dataset with different embedding strategies
3. Measure real-time latency impact of graph injection on LLM reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on recognition accuracy without extensive real-world usability testing
- Reliance on pre-constructed procedural task graphs from instructional videos
- Limited assessment of performance on novel tasks outside training corpus

## Confidence

**High Confidence**
- Task recognition accuracy claims (98.9% on COIN, 99.6% on CrossTask) given specific datasets and evaluation methodology

**Medium Confidence**
- Action prediction and plan prediction capabilities, as these depend heavily on procedural graph quality and may vary with task complexity

**Low Confidence**
- Real-time performance and robustness claims in dynamic, real-world environments, as these are not extensively validated

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user studies with real-world task completion scenarios to evaluate practical usability, error recovery, and user satisfaction beyond accuracy metrics
2. Test system performance on novel tasks not present in the training corpus to assess generalization capabilities and knowledge update mechanisms
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and latency in real-time deployment scenarios, particularly for mobile or resource-constrained environments
