# A Modular, Data-Free Pipeline for Multi-Label Intention Recognition in Transportation Agentic AI Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.03363
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03363
- Reference count: 6
- Achieves 70.15% accuracy, 95.92% AUC, and 5.35% Hamming loss in maritime transportation domain

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DMTC, a modular, data-free pipeline for multi-label intention recognition in transportation agentic AI systems. The approach eliminates the need for costly annotated datasets by generating synthetic training data through prompt-engineered LLMs, encoding text with Sentence-T5 for semantic representation, and training with a novel online focal-contrastive loss that emphasizes hard samples. Applied in maritime transportation, DMTC demonstrates strong performance compared to both classical machine learning methods and end-to-end LLM baselines, while enabling autonomous routing of user queries to task-specific modules.

## Method Summary
DMTC generates synthetic training data through prompt-engineered LLMs to avoid manual annotation costs. Text inputs are encoded using Sentence-T5 for semantic representation, then trained using a novel online focal-contrastive loss that emphasizes hard samples. The system is designed as a modular pipeline that can autonomously route user queries to appropriate task-specific modules based on recognized intentions, achieving competitive performance without requiring large annotated datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieves 70.15% accuracy, 95.92% AUC, and 5.35% Hamming loss in maritime transportation domain
- Sentence-T5 embeddings provide at least 3.29% improvement in subset accuracy over alternatives
- Online focal-contrastive loss contributes an additional 0.98% performance gain
- Outperforms both classical ML methods and end-to-end LLM baselines like GPT-4 and GPT-4o

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by eliminating manual data annotation through synthetic data generation, using Sentence-T5 embeddings to capture semantic relationships between transportation intentions, and employing online focal-contrastive loss to focus learning on difficult classification boundaries. The modular architecture enables task-specific routing of user queries based on recognized intentions, making the system adaptable to various transportation scenarios without requiring extensive retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- **Synthetic data generation via prompt engineering**: Needed to avoid costly manual annotation; quick check: verify generated data diversity and realism
- **Sentence-T5 embeddings**: Required for semantic representation of text; quick check: compare embedding quality across different text encoders
- **Online focal-contrastive loss**: Essential for emphasizing hard samples during training; quick check: measure improvement in classification of difficult cases
- **Multi-label classification framework**: Necessary for handling multiple simultaneous intentions; quick check: validate performance on multi-intent scenarios
- **Modular agentic architecture**: Critical for task-specific routing; quick check: test routing accuracy across different query types
- **Maritime domain knowledge**: Important for application context; quick check: assess transferability to other transportation domains

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Query -> Intent Recognition -> Task Routing -> Domain-Specific Module -> Response
**Critical Path**: Query processing through intent recognition to task routing determines overall system latency
**Design Tradeoffs**: Data-free approach sacrifices potential performance gains from real annotated data for scalability and cost reduction
**Failure Signatures**: Poor intent recognition leads to incorrect task routing; embedding quality issues degrade overall classification accuracy
**First Experiments**:
1. Benchmark intent recognition accuracy across different text embedding methods
2. Test routing accuracy when intent recognition confidence falls below threshold
3. Measure computational overhead of synthetic data generation versus real data annotation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability and generalizability beyond maritime transportation contexts remain unverified
- Reliance on prompt-engineered synthetic data may introduce biases from underlying LLM training corpus
- Computational overhead of Sentence-T5 embeddings and online focal-contrastive loss during inference was not characterized

## Confidence
- High: Modular architecture design and query routing capabilities
- Medium: Performance metrics in single domain with synthetic data
- Low: Data-free claim due to implicit dependence on LLM training data

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark DMTC against real-world annotated datasets from multiple transportation domains to assess cross-domain performance
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of Sentence-T5 embeddings versus OFC loss
3. Measure computational latency and resource requirements during inference to evaluate deployment feasibility in resource-constrained environments
