# Scalable and Interpretable Scientific Discovery via Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SVGP KAN)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00260
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00260
- Authors: Y. Sungtaek Ju
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: SVGP-KAN achieves Test RMSE of 0.36 ± 0.05 on Friedman #1 with 100% feature selection accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes the Sparse Variational GP-KAN (SVGP-KAN), which integrates sparse variational inference with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) topology to enable scalable uncertainty quantification and interpretability for large scientific datasets. The method models univariate edge functions as independent Gaussian Processes and employs inducing points to reduce computational complexity from O(N³) to O(NM²) or O(BM²) per mini-batch. The architecture uses analytic moment matching to propagate uncertainty through layers while maintaining closed-form layer means and variances. The SVGP-KAN is evaluated on three experiments demonstrating feature selection, uncertainty quantification, and competitive performance on the Friedman #1 benchmark.

## Method Summary
SVGP-KAN combines sparse variational Gaussian processes with KAN topology by modeling each univariate edge function as an independent GP with inducing points. The model achieves O(NM²) complexity through variational inference and propagates uncertainty via analytic moment matching. During training, the model optimizes inducing point locations and kernel hyperparameters to maximize the ELBO. Feature relevance is determined post-hoc through permutation importance analysis, while functional forms are classified by examining learned lengthscales. The architecture maintains interpretability by preserving the additive structure of KANs while scaling to large datasets.

## Key Results
- On Friedman #1 benchmark (10 features, 5 relevant), achieved Test RMSE of 0.36 ± 0.05 and 100% selection rate for true features across 5 trials
- Successfully identified relevant features and learned appropriate functional forms in synthetic dataset with periodic, linear, and noise features
- Demonstrated uncertainty quantification during extrapolation on 2D surface reconstruction task with uncertainty increasing in unobserved regions
- Reduced computational complexity from O(N³) to O(NM²) or linear in sample size using M=20 inducing points per edge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The architecture achieves linear scaling in data size ($N$) by decoupling model complexity from dataset size using sparse variational inference.
- Mechanism: Instead of computing a full $N \times N$ covariance matrix (which costs $O(N^3)$), the model introduces $M$ inducing points per edge. The variational distribution $q(u)$ is optimized over these $M$ points, and the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is computed using mini-batches.
- Core assumption: The inducing points $\mathbf{Z}$ are sufficient statistics for the underlying function, meaning $M \ll N$ is adequate to capture the signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "reduces computational complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(NM^2)$ or linear in sample size."
  - [section 2.2] "This decouples the computational cost from the total dataset size $N$, achieving $O(M^2)$ complexity per sample."
  - [corpus] Related work 'Uncertainty Quantification for Scientific Machine Learning using SVGP KAN' corroborates the integration of sparse variational GP frameworks for scalability.
- Break condition: If the underlying function requires $M \approx N$ inducing points to capture complex, high-frequency variations, the computational advantage collapses.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The network propagates uncertainty through deep layers by treating inputs to subsequent layers as Gaussian random variables.
- Mechanism: The model employs Analytic Moment Matching. Given an input distribution $x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, it analytically computes the expected value and variance of the output $f(x)$. Crucially, input variance ($\sigma^2$) acts as a regularizer, increasing the effective lengthscale and smoothing the function.
- Core assumption: The independence of edge GPs allows the summation of variances, and the first two moments (mean and variance) are sufficient to characterize the distribution for the next layer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "This equation demonstrates a regularization property... as the uncertainty about the input location increases, the effective lengthscale increases, smoothing the function."
  - [section 4.2] "The uncertainty quantification exhibited a pattern corresponding to the additive variance."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence for this specific moment-matching mechanism in KANs is weak/absent; rely on paper derivation.
- Break condition: If the true posterior is highly multi-modal or non-Gaussian, the moment matching approximation may fail to capture the uncertainty distribution accurately.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The model identifies relevant features and functional forms without explicit symbolic regression libraries by analyzing kernel hyperparameters.
- Mechanism: The model learns lengthscales $\ell$ during optimization. A lengthscale $\ell \to \infty$ implies the RBF kernel linearizes (linear trend), while a short $\ell$ implies high-frequency non-linear behavior. Permutation importance is used post-hoc to confirm signal vs. noise.
- Core assumption: The standard RBF kernel is flexible enough to degenerate into a linear function or fit complex periodicity based solely on lengthscale tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "A learned lengthscale $\ell \to \infty$ implies that the RBF kernel has linearized locally... whereas $\ell \ll 1$ implies high-frequency non-linear behavior."
  - [section 4.1] "For the linear input, the optimization process drove the lengthscale hyperparameter to large values ($\ell > 3.0$)."
  - [corpus] 'Projective Kolmogorov Arnold Neural Networks' discusses functional space discovery, supporting the general capability of KAN variants for structural identification.
- Break condition: If the functional relationship is discontinuous, the standard RBF kernel assumption may fail to converge to the correct form (noted in Conclusion as a limitation).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (SVGP)**
  - Why needed here: This is the core engine replacing standard weights. You must understand how inducing points approximate a distribution to grasp how the model scales.
  - Quick check question: How does the complexity of SVGP scale with the number of inducing points $M$ vs. data points $N$?

- Concept: **Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - Why needed here: This justifies the network topology (univariate functions on edges, summation on nodes) which allows for the factorization of the GP covariance.
  - Quick check question: In a KAN, where are the learnable functions located, and how are they combined to form the output?

- Concept: **Moment Matching**
  - Why needed here: This explains how information flows between layers. Unlike standard backprop, this system propagates probability distributions.
  - Quick check question: If input uncertainty ($\sigma^2$) increases, what happens to the "effective lengthscale" of the next layer, and how does that affect the prediction smoothness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Layer -> SVGP-KAN Layer (matrix of independent univariate GPs) -> Aggregator (sums edge outputs) -> Moment Matcher (computes mean and variance) -> Output Layer (predictive mean and variance)

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize edge GPs with inducing locations $\mathbf{Z}$
  2. Forward pass: Compute expected activations $\psi_1$ and variances using analytic moment matching (Eq in 2.3)
  3. Loss computation: Calculate ELBO using mini-batches
  4. Post-hoc: Run Permutation Importance to prune noise features

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Additivity vs. Multiplicativity**: The architecture is inherently additive. Deep layers are required to model multiplicative interactions (e.g., $x_0 x_1$), which may be less efficient than specialized architectures.
  - **Noise Modeling**: A physics-informed noise lower bound is recommended to prevent the model from explaining signal as aleatoric noise.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Lengthscale Collapse**: If lengthscales don't diverge for linear trends, the "structural discovery" mechanism fails.
  - **Overfitting Noise**: If noise variance is not lower-bounded, the GP might fit perfect curves to noise features (permutation importance check prevents this).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Basic Discovery**: Train on $y = \sin(3\pi x_1) + 1.5x_2 + \epsilon$. Verify that $x_1$ gets short $\ell$, $x_2$ gets long $\ell$, and noise features are pruned.
  2. **Extrapolation Test**: Train on $x \in [-1,1]$, test on $x \in [-1.5, 1.5]$. Verify that uncertainty increases outside the training domain.
  3. **Benchmark (Friedman #1)**: Train on 10-dim data (5 signal, 5 noise). Check if Test RMSE $\approx 0.36$ and signal features are selected 100% of the time.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can explicit multiplication layers be integrated into the SVGP-KAN topology to capture multiplicative interactions without requiring excessive network depth?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] The conclusion states a current limitation is the "restriction to additive structures" and proposes "exploring multiplication layers" as future work.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture relies on additive aggregation ($y_j = \sum \phi(x_i)$), forcing the model to learn multiplicative terms solely through deep composition, which is inefficient.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified SVGP-KAN with multiplication layers that accurately reconstructs multiplicative functions (e.g., $y=x_1x_2$) using fewer layers than the additive baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can non-stationary kernels be incorporated while retaining the analytic moment matching required for tractable uncertainty propagation?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] The conclusion identifies "integrating non-stationary kernels for discontinuous phenomena" as a specific direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current mathematical framework (Section 2.3) relies on the Squared Exponential (RBF) kernel for closed-form moment updates; non-stationary kernels typically preclude such analytic solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of analytic expected values for kernels like the Matérn or Rational Quadratic, or successful application of the model to step-function data without over-smoothing.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the mean-field independence assumption between edge GPs bias uncertainty estimates in layers with highly correlated inputs?
- Basis in paper: [Inferred] Section 2.3 notes the "Assumption of independence between edge GPs" is a mean-field approximation used to simplify variance calculations.
- Why unresolved: While necessary for computational efficiency, ignoring the covariance between edges could lead to overconfident predictions or incorrect variance attribution in complex physical systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of predicted variance against empirical error rates on datasets specifically designed with high inter-input correlation versus independent inputs.

## Limitations
- The current architecture is restricted to additive structures, requiring deep layers to model multiplicative interactions which is computationally inefficient
- The RBF kernel assumption may fail for discontinuous or highly complex functional relationships that cannot be captured through lengthscale tuning alone
- The model requires a physics-informed noise lower bound to prevent overfitting to aleatoric noise, adding domain-specific complexity

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The computational complexity claims (O(NM²) vs O(N³)) and uncertainty propagation through moment matching are mathematically well-established mechanisms.
- **Medium Confidence**: The structural discovery capability via lengthscale analysis is theoretically sound but requires validation on more diverse real-world scientific datasets.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim of superior interpretability without symbolic regression libraries needs empirical validation against established feature selection methods.

## Next Checks

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Evaluate SVGP-KAN against standard interpretable models (Lasso, Random Forests) and deep learning models on multiple UCI datasets to establish relative performance.

2. **Functional Form Recovery**: Test the lengthscale-based classification on synthetic functions with known discontinuities and sharp transitions to validate RBF kernel limitations.

3. **Scalability Stress Test**: Systematically vary M (inducing points) and dataset size N to empirically verify the claimed O(NM²) scaling and identify the point where M ≈ N breaks the computational advantage.
