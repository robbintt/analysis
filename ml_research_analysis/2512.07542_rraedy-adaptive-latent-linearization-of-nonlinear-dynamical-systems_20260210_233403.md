# RRAEDy: Adaptive Latent Linearization of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.07542
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07542
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Autoencoder that automatically discovers optimal latent dimension and enforces linearized dynamics through truncated SVD and DMD, achieving accurate predictions across multiple benchmark systems.

## Executive Summary
RRAEDy introduces an adaptive autoencoder architecture for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems. The key innovation is a truncated SVD layer that automatically prunes latent variables based on their singular values, eliminating the need for manual dimension selection. Combined with a Dynamic Mode Decomposition operator for temporal evolution, the model enforces linearized dynamics without auxiliary losses. Theoretical analysis proves the learned operator remains marginally stable with eigenvalues near 1, ensuring robust long-term predictions.

## Method Summary
RRAEDy operates as an autoencoder with a truncated SVD bottleneck. High-dimensional states are encoded to an intermediate latent space, then decomposed via SVD and truncated to rank $k^*$. A DMD operator $W$ is computed analytically from the time-series of truncated latent coefficients. The model predicts future states by applying $W$ repeatedly in the compressed latent space. An adaptive algorithm iteratively reduces $k^*$ during training based on stagnation criteria, forcing the model to discover the minimal representation. The decoder maps reconstructed latent states back to the input space. The architecture uses MLPs or CNNs depending on data dimensionality, with Adabelief optimizer and a single reconstruction loss.

## Key Results
- Achieves 7.37% NPE on Van der Pol oscillator, 4.64% NPE on Burgers' equation, 7.21% NPE on 2D Navier-Stokes, and 6.14% NPE on Rotating Gaussians
- Maintains marginal stability (eigenvalues near 1) of the learned linear operator across all experiments
- Ablation study confirms necessity of adaptive bottleneck, SVD regularization, and DMD enforcement for preventing latent "holes" and unstable dynamics
- Successfully extends to parametric ODEs while preserving stability and performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adaptive Latent Dimension Discovery
RRAEDy automatically identifies the minimal latent dimension required to represent system dynamics through truncated SVD. During training, an algorithm progressively decrements the truncation rank $k^*$ based on stagnation criteria, forcing the model to compress information into fewer latent variables while pruning those with negligible singular values.

### Mechanism 2: Hard Linearization Without Auxiliary Losses
Instead of using neural networks to predict next latent states, RRAEDy computes a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) operator $W$ analytically via least-squares. This acts as a "hard" linear constraint, with the single reconstruction loss forcing the encoder to map nonlinear inputs to a latent space specifically solvable by this linear operator.

### Mechanism 3: Guaranteed Marginal Stability
The SVD layer imposes an orthonormal basis on the latent space, and combined with the Lipschitz continuity of the encoder, this structure mathematically bounds the distance of the DMD operator from the identity matrix. This ensures eigenvalues cluster near the unit circle, preventing exploding forecasts.

## Foundational Learning

- **Truncated SVD & Low-Rank Approximation**: Essential for understanding how the model "prunes" the latent space by retaining only top $k$ singular values as a lossy compression filter. *Quick check:* If you truncate SVD to rank $k=5$ for a matrix of rank 100, what happens to the reconstruction error vs. storage size?

- **Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)**: The engine of this architecture that fits a linear operator $A$ such that $x_{t+1} \approx A x_t$ using least squares, effectively linearizing the best-fit dynamics. *Quick check:* Given a sequence of states $X$, how does DMD differ from simply calculating the average velocity?

- **Autoencoder Bottlenecks**: Understanding the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and latent dimension size is critical, as the paper automates this trade-off. *Quick check:* What happens to an autoencoder's ability to generate new valid samples if the bottleneck is too large (overfitting) vs. too small (underfitting)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Encoder ($E$) -> Latent SVD (truncate to $k^*$) -> Latent DMD (compute $W$) -> Decoder ($D$)
- **Critical path:** The Adaptive Algorithm is the most distinct operational step. You must implement the loop: Train -> Check Stagnation -> Decrement $k^*$ -> Continue
- **Design tradeoffs:** Start with $k^*$ larger than expected intrinsic dimension to avoid forcing $W \approx I$ immediately. Batch consistency requires post-training step to find common basis $U_f$ for inference
- **Failure signatures:** Removing SVD regularization causes "holes" in latent space and predictions develop artifacts. Starting with small fixed $k^*$ forces $W \approx I$, failing to capture dynamics
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check (Van der Pol Oscillator): Plot phase space of ground truth vs. RRAEDy prediction to verify limit cycle capture
  2. Ablation on Stability: Train without SVD step, monitor eigenvalues of resulting linear operator for divergence from 1
  3. Extrapolation Test: Train on short horizon, predict 3x-5x that horizon to test forecast boundedness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Stochastic Dynamics Extension:** Can RRAEDy be extended to effectively model stochastic dynamical systems? The current deterministic DMD operator cannot capture random noise or uncertainty inherent in stochastic processes.

2. **Multi-Scale Systems:** How does the adaptive rank selection perform on multi-scale systems with highly separated temporal frequencies? Distinct multi-scale dynamics might be unevenly compressed if one scale dominates the energy spectrum.

3. **Real-World Experimental Data:** Does theoretical stability and convergence hold for real-world experimental data that may violate i.i.d. or Lipschitz continuity assumptions? Clean simulation data satisfies these assumptions, but sensor noise or irregular sampling in physical experiments often violate them.

## Limitations
- Adaptive bottleneck critically depends on unspecified stagnation criteria, potentially leading to different optimal $k^*$ values across runs
- Theoretical stability proofs assume Lipschitz continuity of encoder without empirical validation
- Model requires post-training "common basis" step for inference, but computational cost and stability are not quantified

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Empirical performance on benchmark datasets | High |
| Theoretical stability properties (marginal stability, eigenvalue bounds) | Medium |
| Necessity of SVD regularization and DMD enforcement | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Initialization:** Run adaptive algorithm multiple times with different random seeds and initial $k^*$ values to quantify variance in discovered latent dimensions and final NPE

2. **Stability Under Noise:** Evaluate model performance on datasets with added Gaussian noise at various SNR levels to test robustness of marginal stability property

3. **Operator Spectrum Analysis:** For each experiment, plot eigenvalue distribution of learned DMD operator $W$ and compare against theoretical bound from Lemma 2 to verify marginal stability empirically
