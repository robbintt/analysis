# InspireDebate: Multi-Dimensional Subjective-Objective Evaluation-Guided Reasoning and Optimization for Debating

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.18102
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18102
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: 44% higher correlation with expert judgments, 57% improvement in open-source model debate performance

## Executive Summary
InspireDebate introduces a novel framework for enhancing LLM debate performance through multi-dimensional evaluation and optimization. The system addresses limitations in existing debate systems by integrating subjective and objective evaluation criteria via InspireScore, which combines four subjective dimensions (emotional appeal, argument clarity, argument arrangement, topic relevance) with two objective metrics (fact authenticity, logical validity). The framework employs a two-stage approach: supervised fine-tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning followed by multi-dimensional direct preference optimization using InspireScore feedback. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both subjective and objective evaluation dimensions, narrowing the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models.

## Method Summary
InspireDebate is a two-stage framework for optimizing LLM debate performance. Stage 1 applies supervised fine-tuning using GPT-4o-generated structured debate samples with explicit reasoning and argument sections to address instruction refusal and establish structured argumentation. Stage 2 employs multi-dimensional direct preference optimization using InspireScore, which aggregates four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity, argument arrangement, topic relevance) with two objective metrics (fact authenticity via web-based retrieval-augmented generation, logical validity via first-order logic formalization). The framework integrates real-time fact verification and achieves significant improvements in both subjective and objective evaluation dimensions.

## Key Results
- InspireScore achieves 44% higher correlation with expert judgments compared to existing methods
- 57% improvement in open-source model debate performance narrowing the gap with proprietary systems
- Subjective score improvement from 0.366 to 0.723 when combining SFT and DPO stages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-dimensional evaluation combining subjective and objective criteria improves alignment with human judgment in debate assessment.
- Mechanism: InspireScore aggregates four subjective dimensions (emotional appeal, argument clarity, argument arrangement, topic relevance) with two objective metrics (fact authenticity, logical validity). The unified score leverages LLM-based fact extraction, web verification, and first-order logic formalization for objective assessment, while prompt-based evaluation handles subjective criteria. The aggregation achieves Pearson correlation of 0.643 with expert judgments.
- Core assumption: Human debate evaluation inherently balances rhetorical persuasion with logical soundness, and both aspects are necessary for comprehensive assessment.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "InspireScore achieves 44% higher correlation with expert judgments compared to existing methods"; [section 5.2] Table 2 shows InspireScore achieving Pearson=0.643 vs. Debatrix at 0.394

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Supervised fine-tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning enables structured argumentation and reduces instruction refusal in open-source models.
- Mechanism: The SFT stage constructs a dataset using GPT-4o to generate debate samples with explicit `<reasoning and analysis>` and `<argument>` sections. Training on this structured format teaches models to decompose arguments systematically rather than generating heuristic responses. This addresses the instruction refusal problem observed in safety-aligned open-source models (LLaMA-8B, Qwen-1.5B) when handling controversial debate topics.
- Core assumption: Decomposing argumentation into explicit reasoning steps improves logical coherence and enables more precise evaluation feedback.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.1] "Training on this dataset enables the model to generate responses that not only deliver conclusions but also articulate a clear, structured reasoning process"; [section 5.4.1] SFT provides the largest subjective evaluation improvement (0.366 → 0.625 for LLaMA-8B)

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Direct Preference Optimization with multi-dimensional InspireScore feedback aligns model outputs with comprehensive debate quality criteria.
- Mechanism: After SFT establishes structured output capability, DPO constructs preference pairs (yw, yl) where the winning response achieves higher InspireScore. The optimization objective directly maximizes the likelihood of generating higher-scoring responses across all six dimensions simultaneously, rather than optimizing for a single reward signal.
- Core assumption: Multi-dimensional preference signals can be effectively aggregated into a single optimization objective without dimension-specific conflicts degrading overall performance.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.2] "Unlike conventional methods that rely on an explicitly learned reward function, InspireScore directly compares debate responses across multiple evaluation dimensions"; [section 5.4.1] DPO combined with SFT achieves 0.723 subjective score vs. 0.625 for SFT alone

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: First-Order Logic (FOL) Formalization for Natural Language
  - Why needed here: InspireScore's logical validity assessment requires converting debate arguments into symbolic predicates and inference rules. Without understanding FOL conversion, the objective evaluation mechanism is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given the premise "All junk food causes health issues" and "Anything causing health issues should be banned," can you derive the FOL expressions and valid conclusion?

- Concept: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) Loss Function
  - Why needed here: The second optimization stage uses DPO to align models with InspireScore feedback. Understanding the preference optimization objective is essential for debugging training dynamics and reward hacking.
  - Quick check question: How does DPO differ from PPO in terms of reward model requirements, and what happens if preference pairs have near-identical scores?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Integration
  - Why needed here: Web-RAG enables real-time fact verification during debates. Understanding retrieval-query generation and evidence integration is critical for both evaluation accuracy and debate generation.
  - Quick check question: If retrieved evidence contradicts a model's internal knowledge, how should the generation process resolve this conflict?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Web-RAG Module -> InspireScore Evaluator -> DPO Trainer -> SFT Data Generator -> Base Model

- Critical path: 1. Construct SFT dataset (100 topics → GPT-4o samples) → 2. Fine-tune base model with LoRA (3 epochs, lr=1e-5) → 3. Generate preference pairs via self-debate on 510 topics → 4. Rank pairs using InspireScore; train DPO → 5. Evaluate on held-out 100 topics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Unified vs. dimension-specific optimization**: Full InspireScore DPO outperforms single-dimension rewards (0.732 vs. 0.663 for EA-only), but dimension conflicts may emerge on specialized topics
  - **Web-RAG latency vs. accuracy**: Real-time retrieval improves fact authenticity but adds inference overhead; offline retrieval may suffice for non-time-sensitive debates
  - **Corpus annotation cost**: Human evaluation requires 3 trained annotators per debate; InspireScore reduces but does not eliminate human oversight needs

- Failure signatures:
  - **Instruction refusal**: Open-source models declining controversial topics (Appendix B.1); resolved via SFT with structured templates
  - **Reasoning-argument disconnect**: CoT steps not supporting final argument; requires SFT data quality filtering
  - **Fact verification false positives**: Web search returning irrelevant or low-quality sources; needs query refinement and source credibility weighting

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline correlation check**: Run InspireScore on 20 debates with human annotations; verify Pearson >0.5 before full deployment
  2. **Ablation by component**: Train LLaMA-8B with SFT-only, DPO-only, and SFT+DPO; confirm both stages contribute (expect 15-20% gap each)
  3. **Dimension conflict analysis**: Optimize separately for each of 6 dimensions; identify pairs with negative transfer (e.g., emotional appeal vs. logical validity)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How can conflicting optimization signals across subjective and objective evaluation dimensions be resolved without causing suboptimal global debate performance?
  - Basis: "the current framework lacks explicit mechanisms for handling conflicting optimization signals across dimensions, which may result in suboptimal global performance"
  - Resolution evidence: Comparison experiment using multi-objective optimization frameworks (e.g., Pareto optimization) versus current aggregation approach

- **Open Question 2**: Can dynamic or user-guided evaluation criteria generation improve the adaptability of debate optimization across diverse topics and evolving preferences?
  - Basis: "the reliance on fixed evaluation dimensions may constrain adaptability to diverse debate topics or evolving user preferences"
  - Resolution evidence: Experiment implementing adaptive criteria selection based on topic embeddings, measuring correlation with human judgments across diverse debate domains

- **Open Question 3**: What efficient reinforcement learning techniques can reduce the computational costs of multi-dimensional DPO and real-time Web-RAG while maintaining optimization effectiveness?
  - Basis: "Scalability challenges arise from the significant computational demands of multi-dimensional DPO and real-time retrieval"
  - Resolution evidence: Benchmarking InspireDebate variants using alternative RL methods (e.g., GRPO, PPO with value caching) with wall-clock time and API call counts as metrics

## Limitations

- The FOL-based logical validity assessment pipeline is not fully specified, making replication of the objective evaluation component challenging
- Web-RAG integration timing and query formulation for fact verification are not clearly described, raising concerns about consistency and reproducibility
- Dimension-specific optimization ablation shows mixed results, with emotional appeal optimization degrading overall performance, suggesting potential conflicts in the multi-dimensional reward signal

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Subjective evaluation improvements (44% correlation increase, 57% debate performance gains) are well-supported by controlled experiments and ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence**: The two-stage optimization framework (SFT + DPO) is clearly described and validated, though specific hyperparameters remain unspecified
- **Low Confidence**: The objective evaluation components (fact authenticity, logical validity) rely on under-specified technical details that could significantly impact reported performance

## Next Checks

1. **Correlation Validation**: Test InspireScore on 20 debates with human annotations to verify Pearson correlation >0.5 before deployment
2. **Component Ablation**: Train LLaMA-8B with SFT-only, DPO-only, and SFT+DPO to confirm both stages contribute independently to performance gains
3. **Dimension Conflict Analysis**: Optimize separately for each of 6 dimensions to identify negative transfer effects, particularly between emotional appeal and logical validity
