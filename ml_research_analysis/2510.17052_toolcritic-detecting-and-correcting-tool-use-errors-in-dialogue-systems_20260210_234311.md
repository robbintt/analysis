# ToolCritic: Detecting and Correcting Tool-Use Errors in Dialogue Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.17052
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17052
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: ToolCritic detects and corrects eight distinct tool-use errors in dialogue systems, improving tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines on the Schema-Guided Dialogue dataset.

## Executive Summary
ToolCritic is a diagnostic model that detects and corrects tool-use errors in multi-turn dialogue systems. It identifies eight distinct error categories, including premature invocation, argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs. Trained on a synthetic dataset, ToolCritic provides targeted feedback to improve LLM responses. Experiments on the Schema-Guided Dialogue dataset show that ToolCritic improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines like zero-shot prompting and self-correction. Human evaluation further confirms that ToolCritic's full feedback leads to more effective revisions, making it a promising approach for enhancing LLM reliability in task-oriented dialogue applications.

## Method Summary
ToolCritic is a diagnostic model designed to detect and correct tool-use errors in multi-turn dialogue systems. It identifies eight distinct error categories, including premature invocation, argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs. Trained on a synthetic dataset, ToolCritic provides targeted feedback to improve LLM responses. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on the Schema-Guided Dialogue dataset, where it outperforms baselines such as zero-shot prompting and self-correction.

## Key Results
- ToolCritic detects and corrects eight distinct tool-use errors in dialogue systems.
- Improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines on the Schema-Guided Dialogue dataset.
- Human evaluation confirms that ToolCritic's full feedback leads to more effective revisions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ToolCritic leverages a diagnostic approach to identify and correct tool-use errors in dialogue systems. By training on a synthetic dataset, it learns to recognize common error patterns and provide targeted feedback. This targeted feedback enables the model to improve LLM responses, leading to better tool-calling accuracy and overall system reliability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Error Categories**: Why needed: To systematically identify and correct tool-use errors. Quick check: ToolCritic can accurately classify errors into one of eight predefined categories.
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Why needed: To train the model on diverse error scenarios without requiring extensive real-world data. Quick check: The synthetic dataset covers a wide range of tool-use errors and scenarios.
- **Targeted Feedback**: Why needed: To provide specific guidance for correcting identified errors. Quick check: The feedback mechanism improves LLM responses by addressing the root cause of errors.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: LLM -> ToolCritic Diagnostic Model -> Targeted Feedback -> Improved LLM Responses
- **Critical Path**: The critical path involves the LLM generating a response, ToolCritic diagnosing errors, and the feedback loop improving the LLM's next response.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The use of a synthetic dataset allows for controlled training but may limit real-world generalization. The eight error categories provide structure but may miss rare or novel error types.
- **Failure Signatures**: If ToolCritic fails to detect an error, the LLM may continue to make the same mistake in subsequent turns. If the feedback is not actionable, the LLM may not improve its response.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate ToolCritic on a dataset of actual, open-ended user dialogues with real tool interactions. 2) Conduct formal significance testing on all reported improvements. 3) Systematically probe ToolCritic's ability to detect and correct errors outside the eight defined categories.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Major uncertainties remain around ToolCritic's performance in truly open-ended, noisy real-world settings.
- The synthetic training corpus may not capture the full diversity and complexity of actual user inputs and tool interactions.
- The paper does not report statistical significance tests for the reported improvements, so the claimed gains should be interpreted with caution.

## Confidence
- **Core Technical Contribution**: High
- **Real-World Applicability**: Medium

## Next Checks
1. **Real-World Deployment Test**: Evaluate ToolCritic on a dataset of actual, open-ended user dialogues with real tool interactions, not just synthetic or constrained scenarios.
2. **Statistical Significance**: Conduct formal significance testing (e.g., t-tests) on all reported improvements to ensure observed gains are not due to chance.
3. **Error Category Robustness**: Systematically probe ToolCritic's ability to detect and correct errors outside the eight defined categories, including rare or novel error types not seen during training.
