# Symbolic Graphics Programming with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05208
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05208
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: RL with verifiable rewards improves SVG generation, achieving performance comparable to proprietary models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating accurate vector graphics (SVG) from natural language descriptions using large language models. The authors propose a reinforcement learning approach with verifiable rewards that does not require paired image-program data. Their method uses a format-validity gate to ensure only syntactically valid, renderable SVGs receive perceptual rewards based on cross-modal alignment between rendered images and text descriptions. The approach substantially improves semantic quality and compositional reasoning, with analyses revealing emergent behaviors like finer object decomposition and contextual detail addition.

## Method Summary
The method trains an LLM (Qwen-2.5-7B) to generate SVG code from text captions using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with verifiable rewards. The reward consists of a format-validity gate that checks for proper "Think-Answer" structure, successful rendering via CairoSVG, and bans on text-rendering tags, combined with cross-modal similarity scores computed using vision encoders (SigLIP for text-image alignment, DINO for image-image alignment). The model is trained on a 50/50 mixture of COCO 2017 image-caption pairs and MMSVG-Illustration-40k, with a strict filtering of text-centric items. The approach achieves performance comparable to proprietary models without requiring paired image-program data.

## Key Results
- RL with verifiable rewards substantially improves semantic quality and compositional reasoning of generated SVGs
- Performance reaches parity with proprietary models on benchmark evaluations
- Analyses reveal RL induces finer object decomposition and generation of contextually relevant visual elements
- Format-validity gate prevents reward hacking through malformed code or text elements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Reinforcement learning with verifiable cross-modal rewards improves SVG generation by aligning rendered images with text descriptions. The policy model generates SVG code, which is rendered to an image. A vision encoder computes similarity between the rendered image and the input text. This similarity score serves as a reward signal that guides policy updates via GRPO, increasing the probability of generating SVGs that render into semantically aligned images.

### Mechanism 2
The format-validity gate ensures only syntactically valid, renderable SVGs receive perceptual rewards, preventing reward hacking through malformed code. A binary reward checks for a "Think-Answer" structure and that the SVG renders successfully via CairoSVG. Invalid outputs receive zero reward, blocking gradient signals from poor code and forcing the model to prioritize correctness before semantic alignment.

### Mechanism 3
RL training induces emergent behaviors such as finer object decomposition and contextual detail addition, improving visual coherence without explicit supervision. During RL optimization, the policy discovers that decomposing objects into simpler primitives and adding scene-appropriate details increases cross-modal similarity scores. These behaviors are reinforced over training steps, leading to more structured and semantically rich SVGs.

## Foundational Learning

- **SVG structure and rendering**: Understanding that SVG is an XML-based format with primitives (e.g., `<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<path>`) that render to vector graphics is essential to grasp how LLMs generate visual content via code and how validity checks work.
  - Quick check: Can you explain how a simple SVG `<rect x="10" y="20" width="50" height="30" fill="red"/>` would render, and why coordinate precision matters?

- **Reinforcement learning fundamentals (policy gradient, GRPO)**: The method uses GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) to update the LLM policy based on reward signals, a variant of PPO without a critic model.
  - Quick check: How does GRPO differ from standard PPO in terms of advantage estimation and policy updates?

- **Cross-modal embeddings (CLIP, SigLIP, DINO)**: The reward relies on vision encoders to compute text-image similarity; understanding their embedding spaces is key to why alignment rewards work.
  - Quick check: What is the difference between CLIP and SigLIP in terms of training objectives, and how might this affect their suitability as reward models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input text caption -> LLM policy model (Qwen-2.5-7B) -> SVG code generation -> CairoSVG renderer -> Raster image -> Vision encoders (SigLIP, DINO) -> Reward calculator -> GRPO algorithm -> Policy update

- **Critical path**:
  1. Sample a batch of captions
  2. For each caption, sample multiple SVG codes from the policy
  3. Render each SVG to an image
  4. Check format validity; if invalid, reward = 0
  5. If valid, compute text-image similarity via SigLIP (and optionally image-image via DINO)
  6. Combine rewards with weighting (λText, λImage)
  7. Compute advantages across samples per caption and update policy via GRPO

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Reward encoder choice: SigLIP tends to improve factual grounding and diversity over CLIP, but the paper uses SigLIP Base/16-384 as the default for balance
  - Training data mixture: A 50/50 mix of COCO and MMSVG balances scene-level and object-level generalization; pure datasets specialize but cross-domain performance drops
  - CoT prompting: Optional; experiments show marginal quantitative differences, but it may aid interpretability

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Entropy collapse: Policy becomes deterministic, generating repetitive SVGs. Mitigated by asymmetric clipping (clip_high=0.28, clip_low=0.2)
  - Reward hacking: Model generates text elements to inflate scores. Prevented by banning `<text>`, `<tspan>`, `<textPath>` tags
  - Low diversity: Over-optimization for similarity reduces output variety. Monitor diversity metrics during training

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablate reward encoders: Train with CLIP vs. SigLIP (and DINO vs. none) on a small subset to measure impact on VQA, CLIP-Score, and diversity
  2. Validate format gate: Train with and without the format-validity reward to assess its necessity for preventing invalid outputs and stabilizing training
  3. Analyze training dynamics: Track code length, element count, and comment-to-element ratio over training steps to verify emergent decomposition and detail-adding behaviors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the visual reasoning and drawing skills acquired through symbolic graphics programming transfer to broader, non-visual reasoning tasks? The authors explicitly state this as a promising direction but have not evaluated performance on external reasoning benchmarks.

- How can the specific performance gap in texture binding be mitigated given the inherent limitations of standard SVG primitives? The paper identifies the limitation but does not propose a specific method to overcome the rigidity of SVG parameterization for complex textures.

- To what extent can adaptive curricula improve the training dynamics or final performance compared to the current random sampling approach? The authors identify "developing adaptive curricula" as a key area for future work to potentially enhance the learning process.

## Limitations

- Reward reliability: The effectiveness of cross-modal similarity scores as semantic alignment rewards is assumed but not empirically validated against human judgment of image-text correspondence.
- Format gate brittleness: The format-validity check may fail to catch semantically invalid SVGs that still render technically.
- Generalization scope: Improvements on SGP benchmarks may not transfer to real-world scenarios with diverse caption styles and compositional complexity beyond the training data distribution.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The RL training pipeline (GRPO with verifiable rewards) is correctly implemented and reproducible based on the detailed methodology.
- **Medium confidence**: The observed improvements in VQA, CLIP-Score, and compositional reasoning are genuine, but the exact contribution of each mechanism is not fully isolated.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that RL induces emergent behaviors is supported by qualitative analysis but lacks quantitative ablation or controlled experiments to confirm causality.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a user study where humans rate text-image semantic alignment for top-RL and top-CLIP generations to verify that SigLIP similarity scores correlate with human perception.
2. Train with and without the format-validity gate while keeping all other conditions equal to quantify its impact on validity rates, reward stability, and final performance.
3. Evaluate the trained model on out-of-distribution captions from different datasets or real-world user queries to measure robustness and identify potential overfitting to the training distribution.
