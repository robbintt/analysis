# Taxation Perspectives from Large Language Models: A Case Study on Additional Tax Penalties

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.03444
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03444
- Reference count: 40
- Large language models struggle with complex taxation reasoning tasks, with the best model (o3) achieving only 79% F1 score

## Executive Summary
This study introduces PLAT, a benchmark dataset for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on taxation reasoning, specifically focusing on additional tax penalties derived from Korean court precedents. The research demonstrates that current LLMs face significant challenges in handling complex tax penalty cases that require nuanced legal reasoning beyond simple statute application. Through experiments with ten different models, the study reveals performance limitations particularly in the "Application" and "Conclusion" stages of the IRAC framework, with the strongest model achieving an F1 score of 79%. The findings suggest that while LLMs can process tax statutes, they struggle with the comprehensive analysis required for real-world tax penalty decisions, especially when conflicting legal principles and taxpayer circumstances must be weighed.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed PLAT, a dataset of 300 examples based on Korean court precedents requiring complex reasoning for additional tax penalties. They evaluated ten large language models across the IRAC framework stages (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion), with particular focus on cases requiring comprehensive understanding of conflicting legal principles. The study tested the effectiveness of retrieval augmentation and self-reasoning techniques to improve model performance, analyzing both quantitative metrics and qualitative error patterns.

## Key Results
- o3 model achieved the highest F1 score of 79% but struggled significantly in "Application" and "Conclusion" stages
- LLMs showed particular difficulty with cases requiring comprehensive analysis of conflicting legal principles and taxpayer circumstances
- Integration of retrieval and self-reasoning techniques provided partial performance improvement but failed to consistently reach correct conclusions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The limited success of LLMs in tax penalty reasoning stems from their inability to effectively weigh competing legal principles and incorporate contextual taxpayer circumstances. The IRAC framework reveals that while models can identify issues and extract relevant rules, they struggle to apply these rules in a nuanced manner that considers the full complexity of legal precedents. This suggests that current architectures lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities needed for real-world tax penalty determinations.

## Foundational Learning
- IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion): Why needed - provides structured approach to legal reasoning; Quick check - can models correctly identify each component in tax cases
- Additional tax penalty concepts: Why needed - central to benchmark task; Quick check - can models distinguish between different penalty types
- Korean court precedent interpretation: Why needed - dataset source requires cultural/legal context understanding; Quick check - can models apply precedents correctly
- Legal principle conflict resolution: Why needed - core challenge in complex cases; Quick check - can models weigh competing principles appropriately
- Taxpayer circumstance analysis: Why needed - contextual factors crucial for penalty decisions; Quick check - can models incorporate relevant contextual information

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: PLAT dataset -> LLMs (10 models) -> IRAC framework evaluation -> Retrieval augmentation -> Self-reasoning integration
- Critical path: Dataset input → Issue identification → Rule extraction → Application reasoning → Conclusion generation
- Design tradeoffs: Domain-specific vs general-purpose models, retrieval-augmented vs standalone reasoning
- Failure signatures: Incorrect issue identification, misapplied legal rules, inadequate conflict resolution, incomplete conclusion formation
- First experiments: 1) Test baseline models without augmentation, 2) Evaluate retrieval-augmented performance, 3) Compare self-reasoning integration effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly state open questions, suggesting potential areas for future research include:
1. How can LLMs be better trained to handle conflicting legal principles in tax cases?
2. What architectural modifications could improve the "Application" and "Conclusion" stages of tax reasoning?
3. How might domain-specific fine-tuning impact performance on complex tax penalty cases?

## Limitations
- Dataset limited to Korean court precedents, potentially reducing generalizability across jurisdictions
- Focus on additional tax penalties represents a narrow slice of taxation challenges
- Current LLMs struggle with nuanced reasoning required for real-world tax penalty decisions

## Confidence
- High: Core findings regarding LLM performance limitations on complex tax reasoning tasks
- Medium: Effectiveness of retrieval and self-reasoning integration techniques
- Low: Broader generalizability across tax domains and jurisdictions

## Next Checks
1. Test the same benchmark with models fine-tuned on domain-specific tax training data to determine if specialized training improves performance on complex reasoning tasks
2. Expand evaluation to include cases from multiple jurisdictions and tax domains to assess generalizability of findings beyond Korean additional tax penalties
3. Conduct ablation studies on retrieval and self-reasoning components to quantify their individual contributions and identify optimal integration strategies
