# PeerCoPilot: A Language Model-Powered Assistant for Behavioral Health Organizations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21721
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21721
- Reference count: 19
- PeerCoPilot is now deployed at CSPNJ, a large PRO serving over 10,000 service users

## Executive Summary
PeerCoPilot is an LLM-powered assistant designed to support peer providers at peer-run behavioral health organizations (PROs) in creating wellness plans, constructing goals, and locating organizational resources. The system combines trusted, vetted resource databases with LLM capabilities through retrieval-augmented generation to ensure information reliability. Human evaluations with 15 peer providers and 6 service users showed over 90% support for using PeerCoPilot, with the tool delivering more reliable and specific information than baseline LLMs.

## Method Summary
PeerCoPilot implements a four-module architecture using GPT-4o mini as the backend LLM. The system employs a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline with a 1,300+ resource database using SentenceTransformer (MPNet v2) embeddings for matching. Key modules include resource recommendation via RAG, benefit eligibility using GPT-4 extraction plus deterministic formulas, goal construction with SMART framework prompting, and question generation with wellness dimensions prompting. The architecture aggregates outputs via GPT-4 to craft final responses aligned with 8 dimensions of wellness.

## Key Results
- Over 90% of peer providers and service users support using PeerCoPilot
- Resources were 33% more specific than baseline LLMs
- 79% more likely to include correct contact information
- 92% of resources were verified compared to 48% for baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Vetted Resource Grounding
RAG pipeline improves resource reliability and specificity compared to baseline LLMs. GPT-4 extracts resource needs from service user situations; SentenceTransformer creates embeddings matched against a 1,300+ vetted resource database via L2 distance; top matches are injected into the LLM context window for response generation. Core assumption: The resource database is comprehensive for target domains; embedding similarity correlates with actual relevance.

### Mechanism 2: Deterministic Benefit Eligibility Decoupling
Removing benefit eligibility from LLM generative path reduces factual errors on high-stakes queries. GPT-4 extracts structured demographic fields; manually-curated eligibility formulas derived from government websites compute deterministic eligibility status; results are passed to response synthesis rather than generated. Core assumption: Eligibility rules are correctly translated and kept current; extraction accuracy is sufficient.

### Mechanism 3: Structured Framework Scaffolding for Goal and Question Generation
Prompting with established frameworks (SMART goals, 8 dimensions of wellness) produces more actionable and holistic outputs. Goal construction module prompts GPT-4 with SMART framework; question generation prompts with wellness dimensions to ensure comprehensive follow-up questions across physical, spiritual, social, intellectual, financial, environmental, occupational, and emotional domains. Core assumption: Peer providers value structured outputs; frameworks align with actual practice norms.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: Core architecture pattern; understanding embedding-based retrieval is prerequisite for debugging resource recommendation failures.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why L2 distance on embeddings might return semantically similar but practically irrelevant resources?

- Concept: Prompt Engineering for Structured Outputs
  - Why needed here: All modules depend on prompts that enforce output structure (SMART goals, wellness dimensions, field extraction).
  - Quick check question: What prompt elements would you modify if goal outputs became too generic after a model update?

- Concept: Hybrid Deterministic-LLM Architectures
  - Why needed here: Benefit eligibility uses a hybrid pattern; engineers must understand when to use rules vs. generation.
  - Quick check question: For a new module, what criteria would determine whether to use deterministic logic vs. LLM generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Frontend (React + Socket.IO chat interface) -> Backend orchestration (aggregates outputs from 4 modules) -> Module 1 (RAG pipeline over 1,300+ resources) -> Module 2 (GPT-4 extraction + hardcoded formula evaluation) -> Module 3 (GPT-4 with SMART framework prompting) -> Module 4 (GPT-4 with wellness dimensions prompting)

- Critical path: 1. Peer provider inputs service user situation 2. Parallel module execution (resource extraction/retrieval, benefit extraction/evaluation, goal generation, question generation) 3. Aggregation prompt combines module outputs 4. GPT-4 synthesizes holistic response aligned with 8 wellness dimensions 5. Response rendered in chat interface

- Design tradeoffs: Database-grounded retrieval vs. open web knowledge (higher reliability but coverage limited to vetted resources); deterministic benefit formulas vs. LLM generation (reduces hallucination but requires manual maintenance); verbose structured responses vs. simple answers (peer providers preferred detail; service users found baseline simpler)

- Failure signatures: "Links weren't usable or did not go to the specific webpage" (baseline LLM hallucinated URLs); sparsely-populated database categories lead to poor resource matches (housing underperformed vs. health); extraction errors in benefit eligibility could propagate silently

- First 3 experiments: 1. Resource coverage audit: Run retrieval on historical service user scenarios, measure retrieval success rate by domain, identify database gaps 2. Extraction accuracy test: Feed benefit eligibility module 50 synthetic profiles with known correct answers, measure field extraction accuracy and downstream eligibility errors 3. Response verbosity A/B test: Compare current output length vs. condensed version on peer provider comprehension speed and service user comprehension

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How does PeerCoPilot perform in larger-scale, longitudinal deployments across multiple PROs with diverse service user populations? Current evaluation is based on a single PRO (CSPNJ), a small sample (15 providers, 6 users), and short-term interactions.

2. Can the resource database be maintained and expanded efficiently to ensure comprehensive coverage across all wellness dimensions in different geographic regions? The paper notes performance discrepancies due to database population.

3. How can PeerCoPilot be adapted for service users and peer providers with low literacy or non-English language backgrounds? These are proposed features, not implemented or tested.

4. Does reliance on PeerCoPilot over time reduce peer providers' critical thinking or domain knowledge? The study is short-term and does not investigate long-term cognitive effects.

## Limitations
- The resource database's completeness and coverage across all relevant domains remains a critical limitation, particularly for underrepresented categories like housing.
- Human evaluation metrics rely on self-reported support without objective performance benchmarks against alternative approaches in real-world deployment scenarios.
- Benefit eligibility formulas require manual maintenance and may lag behind policy changes, creating potential for outdated or incorrect eligibility determinations.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Retrieval-augmented generation architecture improves resource reliability (supported by 33% specificity increase and 79% better contact information accuracy).
- **Medium Confidence**: Human evaluation support (>90% positive) reflects user satisfaction but lacks objective performance comparison data.
- **Low Confidence**: Benefit eligibility module's long-term accuracy given the need for manual formula maintenance and potential policy changes.

## Next Checks
1. Database Coverage Audit: Systematically evaluate retrieval performance across all resource categories using historical service user scenarios to identify and prioritize database expansion for underrepresented domains like housing.

2. Benefit Eligibility Accuracy Test: Conduct systematic testing of the extraction and eligibility determination pipeline with synthetic profiles covering edge cases and policy boundary conditions to measure error rates.

3. Real-World Deployment Monitoring: Implement continuous monitoring of PeerCoPilot in CSPNJ's operational environment, tracking resource recommendation accuracy, user satisfaction changes over time, and any emerging failure patterns in actual use.
