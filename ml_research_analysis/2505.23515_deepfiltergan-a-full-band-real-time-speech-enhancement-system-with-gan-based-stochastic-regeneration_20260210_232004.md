# DeepFilterGAN: A Full-band Real-time Speech Enhancement System with GAN-based Stochastic Regeneration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.23515
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23515
- Reference count: 0
- Best overall ranking across multiple evaluation metrics: 2.25

## Executive Summary
DeepFilterGAN introduces a two-stage speech enhancement system designed for full-band real-time processing at 48kHz. The first stage uses DeepFilterNet2, a predictive model trained to suppress noise, while the second stage employs a GAN-based generative model with stochastic regeneration to recover over-suppressed speech content. The system integrates noisy speech as conditioning information, enabling the GAN to access residual noise details. Evaluated on the 2024 Urgent Challenge dataset, DeepFilterGAN improves NISQA-MOS score from 2.66 to 3.12 and achieves the best overall ranking across all metrics.

## Method Summary
DeepFilterGAN operates as a two-stage system: Stage 1 uses DeepFilterNet2 (2.31M parameters) with a multi-component loss function (spectral, multi-resolution spectrogram, local SNR, SI-SDR, mel L1) trained for 45 epochs. Stage 2 employs a modified Online SpatialNet generator (1.14M parameters, 4 blocks, hidden=16, 2 input channels) and MelGAN discriminator (0.13M parameters), trained for 200 epochs with the first stage frozen. The generator receives a 2-channel input concatenating noisy speech with Stage 1 output, enabling stochastic regeneration of over-suppressed speech. STFT processing uses 960-sample windows (20ms) with 480-sample hop and 2-frame look-ahead for 40ms latency. Hinge loss plus time-domain L1 loss is used, with discriminator updates every 2nd iteration.

## Key Results
- NISQA-MOS score improves from 2.66 to 3.12 with Stage 2 enabled
- Best overall ranking across all metrics: 2.25
- Noisy speech conditioning is critical, confirmed by ablation study
- System achieves real-time performance with 40ms latency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system addresses the fundamental tradeoff between noise suppression and speech preservation. Stage 1 aggressively suppresses noise but over-suppresses speech, while Stage 2's GAN-based stochastic regeneration recovers this lost speech content using the noisy speech conditioning as a reference. The 2-channel input mechanism allows the generator to distinguish between residual noise and over-suppressed speech components.

## Foundational Learning
- **GAN-based stochastic regeneration**: Needed to recover over-suppressed speech content without introducing artifacts. Quick check: Monitor if Stage 2 output contains speech segments removed in Stage 1.
- **Noisy speech conditioning**: Provides the generator with residual noise information for better recovery decisions. Quick check: Verify 2-channel input concatenation is correctly implemented.
- **Two-stage architecture**: Separates aggressive noise suppression from fine-grained speech recovery. Quick check: Compare Stage 1 vs Stage 2 spectrogram outputs.
- **Multi-scale discriminator**: Enables realistic time-domain reconstruction. Quick check: Monitor discriminator loss ratio to generator loss.
- **Real-time constraints**: 40ms latency achieved through STFT configuration. Quick check: Verify STFT window/hop parameters.
- **Multi-component loss**: Balances spectral, time-domain, and perceptual objectives. Quick check: Monitor individual loss components during Stage 1 training.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: 48kHz Audio -> DeepFilterNet2 (Stage 1) -> Concatenation (Noisy+Intermediate) -> Online SpatialNet Generator -> MelGAN Discriminator -> Enhanced Speech
- **Critical path**: Audio input → STFT → Stage 1 → 2-channel concatenation → Stage 2 Generator → Time-domain reconstruction → Output
- **Design tradeoffs**: Frozen Stage 1 enables stable GAN training but prevents joint optimization; concatenation is simple but may not be optimal fusion.
- **Failure signatures**: Mode collapse in GAN (discriminator dominates), over-suppression not recovered, latency exceeding 40ms.
- **First experiments**: 1) Verify 2-channel input formatting; 2) Monitor discriminator-to-generator loss ratio; 3) Compare spectrograms between stages.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Would end-to-end joint training of both stages improve optimization compared to the current two-step scheme with a frozen first stage?
- What is the specific contribution of the Mamba architecture in the second stage generator to handling long-term temporal dependencies?
- Is simple concatenation of the noisy speech with the intermediate enhanced speech the optimal conditioning mechanism for providing noise context to the generator?

## Limitations
- Missing critical hyperparameters: learning rates, weight decay schedules, optimizer type, β weighting for L1 loss, gradient clipping thresholds
- Exact multi-component loss formulation details for Stage 1 not fully specified
- Two-stage training prevents joint optimization of feature extraction and generation

## Confidence
- System Architecture and Design Choices: High confidence
- Evaluation Results and Dataset: High confidence
- Training Procedure and Hyperparameters: Medium confidence
- Ablation Study Findings: High confidence

## Next Checks
1. Verify the implementation of noisy speech concatenation by checking that the 2-channel input (noisy + Stage 1 output) is correctly formatted before feeding into the Stage 2 generator.
2. Monitor discriminator-to-generator loss ratio during Stage 2 training to ensure the discriminator doesn't dominate (should update every 2nd iteration as specified).
3. Compare spectrogram outputs between Stage 1 and Stage 2 to confirm that over-suppressed speech content is actually being recovered by the GAN regeneration process.
