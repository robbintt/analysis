# Infinite-Dimensional Operator/Block Kaczmarz Algorithms: Regret Bounds and $λ$-Effectiveness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07604
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07604
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Presents comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing regret bounds of block Kaczmarz algorithms in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, extending classical Kaczmarz method to modern machine learning contexts

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing regret bounds of block Kaczmarz algorithms in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The authors extend the classical Kaczmarz method to modern machine learning contexts by developing operator-theoretic regret bounds with explicit λ-dependence for generalized Kaczmarz algorithms. They prove dimension-free O(1/k) average regret bounds that hold for any relaxation parameter λ ∈ (0,2), and demonstrate these bounds are sharp when the system is λ-effective and measurement operators are partial isometries.

The work makes significant contributions to understanding the relationship between algorithm parameters, system properties, and convergence behavior. A major achievement is proving that the exponential system {e^{2πinx}}_{n≥0} is λ-effective for all λ ∈ (0,2) if and only if the underlying measure is singular (except when λ=1). This is established using Hardy space theory and a novel λ-dependent inner function criterion, connecting algorithmic performance to harmonic analysis and frame theory in infinite-dimensional settings.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a unified framework for analyzing operator-theoretic regret bounds in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. They employ projection-based learning algorithms with relaxation parameter λ ∈ (0,2) and establish dimension-free O(1/k) average regret bounds. The framework uses Hardy space theory to characterize λ-effectiveness of exponential systems and derives mixed regret bounds for noisy cases with i.i.d. additive noise. The method provides explicit noise-aware guidance for choosing relaxation parameters based on noise level and iteration count, connecting algorithmic performance to harmonic analysis and frame theory.

## Key Results
- Dimension-free O(1/k) average regret bounds that hold for any relaxation parameter λ ∈ (0,2)
- Sharpness of regret bounds when system is λ-effective and measurement operators are partial isometries
- λ-effectiveness characterization: exponential system {e^{2πinx}}_{n≥0} is λ-effective for all λ ∈ (0,2) if and only if underlying measure is singular (except λ=1 allows normalized Lebesgue measure)
- Mixed regret bounds for noisy case that separate estimation error from noise contribution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by establishing rigorous operator-theoretic regret bounds with explicit λ-dependence for generalized Kaczmarz algorithms. The key mechanism is the λ-effectiveness property, which ensures that the projection operators satisfy specific geometric conditions that guarantee convergence. The use of Hardy space theory provides the mathematical foundation for characterizing when exponential systems are λ-effective, connecting the algorithm's performance to the spectral properties of the underlying measure.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hardy space theory**: Provides the mathematical foundation for analyzing function spaces and their properties. Needed for characterizing λ-effectiveness of exponential systems. Quick check: Verify that the inner function criterion correctly identifies λ-effective systems.
- **Partial isometry operators**: Used to model measurement operators in the framework. Needed to establish conditions for sharp regret bounds. Quick check: Confirm that the projection operators satisfy the partial isometry property.
- **λ-effectiveness property**: A geometric condition ensuring convergence of projection-based algorithms. Needed to guarantee the dimension-free O(1/k) regret bounds. Quick check: Test λ-effectiveness on various exponential systems with different measures.
- **Frame theory**: Provides the framework for understanding redundant representations in Hilbert spaces. Needed to connect algorithmic performance to harmonic analysis. Quick check: Verify that the generalized Fourier expansions converge in L²(μ).

## Architecture Onboarding
The component map follows: Kaczmarz algorithm -> Relaxation parameter λ -> Projection operators -> λ-effectiveness -> Regret bounds -> Noise analysis
Critical path: Kaczmarz iteration → Projection selection → λ-parameter choice → Convergence analysis → Regret bound verification
Design tradeoffs: Exact operator knowledge vs. practical implementation, Sharp regret bounds vs. computational complexity, Noise-aware parameters vs. unknown noise statistics
Failure signatures: Non-λ-effective systems lead to divergence, Partial isometry violation breaks sharp bounds, Unknown noise statistics invalidate parameter selection
First experiments: 1) Test λ-effectiveness on exponential systems with singular measures, 2) Verify dimension-free O(1/k) regret bounds numerically, 3) Implement noise-aware parameter selection on benchmark inverse problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on specific operator classes (partial isometries) limits applicability to general inverse problems
- Results depend heavily on λ-effectiveness property requiring careful verification for specific applications
- Theoretical framework assumes exact operator knowledge, less applicable to noisy or approximate operator scenarios common in practice

## Confidence
- High: Dimension-free regret bounds and their sharpness, following from rigorous operator-theoretic arguments
- Medium: Noise-aware parameter selection guidance, facing practical challenges with unknown noise statistics
- Medium: Hardy space characterization of λ-effectiveness, relying on specific technical conditions that may not hold in all contexts

## Next Checks
1. Implement numerical experiments testing the noise-aware relaxation parameter selection on benchmark inverse problems with varying noise levels
2. Extend the λ-effectiveness analysis to additional function systems beyond exponentials (e.g., wavelets, polynomials)
3. Develop practical algorithms that approximate the theoretical framework when operator knowledge is imperfect or incomplete
