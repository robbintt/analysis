# Towards a Common Framework for Autoformalization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.09810
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09810
- **Reference count:** 28
- **Primary result:** Unified framework for autoformalization across mathematics, logic, planning, and knowledge representation domains

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fragmentation in autoformalization research by proposing a unified conceptual framework that encompasses tasks across mathematics formalization, logical inference, planning, and knowledge representation. Through a review of 81 research papers, the authors identify that despite addressing similar tasks of translating informal natural language into formal representations, these fields use inconsistent terminology and lack shared methodologies. The proposed framework defines autoformalization through four key parameters: the informal language, domain-specific subset, formal reasoning language, and semantic equivalence criterion, providing a common vocabulary and conceptual foundation for cross-domain collaboration.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic review of 81 research papers across four domains of autoformalization, identifying commonalities and differences in terminology, methodologies, and evaluation approaches. The authors propose a theoretical framework (Definition 1) that unifies these diverse tasks through a 4-parameter structure: informal language (Li), domain-specific subset, formal reasoning language (Lf), and semantic equivalence criterion (E). Through case studies in mathematics (Lean theorem prover), first-order logic (FOLIO benchmark), logic programming (SWI-Prolog game theory), planning (PDDL logistics), and knowledge representation (OWL ontologies), the framework is validated by demonstrating how each domain's autoformalization task fits this common structure. The paper also identifies key challenges including semantic verification, scalability, and cross-domain transfer opportunities.

## Key Results
- Autoformalization tasks across four domains share a common 4-parameter structure that can serve as a unifying framework
- LLMs perform autoformalization effectively when framed as translation rather than direct reasoning
- Semantic equivalence validation can be approximated through computable validation criteria that proxy theoretical equivalence
- Cross-domain knowledge transfer potential exists but requires systematic understanding of structural similarities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs perform autoformalization effectively when the task is framed as translation rather than direct reasoning.
- Mechanism: LLMs trained as next-token predictors excel at pattern-based translation between language pairs. By mapping informal natural language to formal representations, the model exploits its strongest capability (translation) rather than its weaker capability (reliable logical inference).
- Core assumption: The syntactic and semantic patterns in formal languages are learnable from training data containing aligned informal-formal pairs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "autoformalization leverages a task that large language models naturally excel at—translation—by mapping informal language into formal representations"
  - [section 1] "This offers a potentially more efficient and interpretable alternative, or at least a complementary approach, to building general-purpose LLM-based reasoners"
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Autoformalization in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey" corroborates this translation framing but corpus lacks comparative studies proving translation > direct reasoning.
- Break condition: If formal language syntax is sufficiently novel or domain-specific that no correlated patterns exist in pretraining data, translation quality degrades sharply.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Semantic equivalence can be approximately verified through computable validation criteria (V) that proxy the ideal equivalence criterion (E).
- Mechanism: The framework explicitly separates E (theoretical semantic equivalence) from V (practical validation). Each domain instantiates V differently: BLEU scores and manual evaluation for mathematics, answer correctness for FOL reasoning, payoff verification for game formalization, plan cross-validation for PDDL, and consistency checking for ontologies.
- Core assumption: The validation criterion V correlates sufficiently with E that passing V implies acceptable semantic preservation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "This distinction is important: E defines what it means for an informal and formal expression to 'mean the same thing'... whereas V provides a practical means of verifying whether a given pair satisfies this equivalence"
  - [section 3.2, Planning case] "For a reconstructed domain D'o generated by replacing an action a in the original domain Do, plan-based reasoning is used to determine equivalence"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence on V-E correlation; neighbor papers focus on different evaluation metrics but do not systematically validate against ground-truth equivalence.
- Break condition: When V admits false positives (semantically incorrect formalizations pass validation) or false negatives (correct formalizations fail), the proxy breaks down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A unified four-parameter definition enables cross-domain knowledge transfer by revealing shared structure.
- Mechanism: By abstracting autoformalization to (Li, domain subset, Lf, E), the framework reveals that apparently disparate tasks (math formalization, NL-to-PDDL, NL-to-OWL) share the same core structure. This structural alignment suggests transfer learning potential: techniques effective in one domain (e.g., iterative refinement with feedback) may generalize.
- Core assumption: The four parameters capture the essential variation across domains; cross-domain similarities outweigh differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a common framework could accelerate progress by enabling knowledge exchange between fields and supporting transfer learning approaches"
  - [section 3] "Building on these shared foundations, we now propose a unified conceptual framework that can encompass this broad class of tasks"
  - [corpus] Neighbor "Aria: An Agent For Retrieval and Iterative Auto-Formalization via Dependency Graph" uses dependency-graph retrieval, but no corpus evidence directly demonstrates successful cross-domain transfer yet.
- Break condition: If domain-specific nuances (e.g., temporal operators in LTL, type systems in Lean) dominate the formalization challenge, generic cross-domain methods provide limited benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: First-order logic (FOL) syntax and semantics
  - Why needed here: FOL appears as a target formalism in 30 reviewed papers and is foundational to PDDL, Prolog, and many reasoning systems. Understanding quantifiers (∀, ∃), predicates, and entailment is prerequisite to following the FOL case study and the framework's "formal reasoning language" parameter.
  - Quick check question: Given premises ∀x(Square(x)→FourSided(x)) and ∀x(FourSided(x)→Shape(x)), what inference rule derives ∀x(Square(x)→Shape(x))?

- Concept: Formal languages vs. informal languages (expressiveness-decidability tradeoff)
  - Why needed here: The paper repeatedly notes that formal languages are "less expressive than informal languages" (section 3.1). Understanding why semantic equivalence E is fundamentally underdetermined—and why V can only approximate it—requires grasping this gap.
  - Quick check question: Why can't we computationally decide whether an English sentence and a Lean theorem "mean the same thing"?

- Concept: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) and proof assistants
  - Why needed here: 32 of 81 reviewed papers target ITPs (Lean, Isabelle/HOL, Rocq, Mizar). The mathematics case study assumes familiarity with theorem statements, proof goals, and machine-verifiability.
  - Quick check question: In the Isabelle/HOL example, what does "shows False" indicate about the theorem being formalized?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (informal language) -> Translation engine (LLM) -> Validation module (domain-specific V) -> Output (formal language)
- Critical path:
  1. Define domain subset of Li (what types of expressions will you formalize?)
  2. Select Lf based on: (a) expressiveness for domain, (b) available reasoning tools, (c) computational tractability
  3. Specify equivalence criterion E (what semantic content must be preserved?)
  4. Implement validation criterion V as computable proxy (automated where possible, manual where necessary)
  5. Build prompt/fine-tuning pipeline with aligned informal-formal pairs
  6. Integrate feedback loop: V failure → error signal → refinement
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. tractability: More expressive Lf (higher-order logic, dependent types) enables richer formalization but complicates automated verification.
  - Automated vs. manual validation: Fully automated V scales but risks false positives; manual V is reliable but expensive.
  - Domain-specific vs. general models: Specialized models (fine-tuned on Lean, PDDL) outperform on their domain but lack cross-domain flexibility.
- Failure signatures:
  - Syntactic garbage: Output violates Lf grammar → add syntax checker or few-shot grammar examples
  - Semantic drift: Output parses but misrepresents input meaning → strengthen V with counterexample testing
  - Hallucinated symbols: Output references undefined predicates/functions → add symbol grounding step or allowed-predicate list (as in PDDL case study)
  - Over/under-specification: Output captures too much/little detail → refine domain subset definition or E criterion
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce one case study (e.g., NL-to-FOL on FOLIO benchmark) using an open LLM; measure V pass rate and manually inspect failures to calibrate semantic drift.
  2. Test cross-domain transfer: Fine-tune on mathematics formalization data, evaluate on PDDL generation without domain-specific training; quantify performance gap.
  3. Implement interactive formalization loop: User provides clarification when V fails; measure reduction in semantic errors vs. one-shot translation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Is it possible to train intelligent systems to acquire the dual competence required to assess semantic correspondence between informal and formal domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state, "An open question is whether it is possible to train intelligent systems to acquire the dual competence that humans possess: understanding both formal and informal domains, and being able to assess correspondence between them."
- Why unresolved: Fully automated verification appears impossible in principle because natural language and its intended meaning are inherently informal and ambiguous.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of a model that successfully integrates verification capabilities directly into the autoformalization process to perform automated human-level semantic verification.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can new formal languages be designed specifically for autoformalization to offer a better balance between expressiveness and computational tractability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The text identifies "an open problem is exploring the development of new formal languages designed specifically for autoformalization, which might offer better balance points in the expressiveness-tractability spectrum."
- Why unresolved: There is a fundamental tension in existing languages where increased expressive power often leads to computational complexity that makes automated reasoning undecidable or intractable.
- What evidence would resolve it: The creation and successful implementation of a novel formal language optimized for autoformalization tasks without sacrificing verification efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the systematic structural similarities in autoformalization across different fields that would enable cross-domain transfer learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that transferring reasoning patterns across domains "is still a big open challenge that requires a more systematic understanding of the structural similarities in the way autoformalization is used across fields."
- Why unresolved: Current approaches are highly domain-specific (e.g., mathematics vs. planning), and the shared underlying formal structures have not yet been systematically analyzed or exploited.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of general autoformalization tools that successfully transfer reasoning patterns to new domains with minimal additional training.

## Limitations
- The semantic equivalence criterion (E) remains largely subjective in the reviewed literature, with validation proxies (V) varying significantly across domains
- No systematic experiments demonstrate actual transfer learning benefits between mathematics, planning, and knowledge representation tasks
- The framework's cross-domain applicability is theoretically compelling but lacks empirical validation of practical transfer learning benefits

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The observation that autoformalization tasks across domains share structural similarity (4-parameter definition)
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that framing autoformalization as translation leverages LLM strengths, based on theoretical reasoning rather than comparative empirical studies
- **Low confidence:** The assertion that a common framework will accelerate progress through cross-domain knowledge transfer, pending empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Semantic Proxy Validation:** Systematically compare validation criterion V outcomes against ground-truth semantic equivalence E in at least two domains to quantify false positive/negative rates.
2. **Cross-Domain Transfer Experiment:** Train on mathematics formalization, evaluate on PDDL generation (and vice versa) to measure practical transfer learning benefits.
3. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Test how variations in each of the four framework parameters affect formalization success rates across different domain combinations.
