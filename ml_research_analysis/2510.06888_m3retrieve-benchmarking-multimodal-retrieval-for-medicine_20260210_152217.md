# M3Retrieve: Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval for Medicine

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.06888
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06888
- **Authors**: Arkadeep Acharya; Akash Ghosh; Pradeepika Verma; Kitsuchart Pasupa; Sriparna Saha; Priti Singh
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Primary result**: Introduces a comprehensive multimodal medical retrieval benchmark spanning 16 specialties and 5 domains

## Executive Summary
M3Retrieve addresses the critical gap in standardized evaluation frameworks for medical retrieval systems by introducing a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess multimodal retrieval capabilities in healthcare contexts. The benchmark covers 16 medical specialties across 5 domains, integrating over 1.2 million text documents with 164K multimodal queries from open-access repositories. Four distinct retrieval tasks mirror real-world clinical workflows, from visual context retrieval to case study analysis. Domain expert validation ensures clinical relevance, while experiments with ten leading retrieval models reveal performance patterns across different retrieval paradigms, establishing M3Retrieve as a robust platform for advancing medical information access systems.

## Method Summary
The M3Retrieve benchmark was constructed through systematic curation of open-access medical repositories, resulting in a dataset containing over 1.2 million text documents and 164K multimodal queries. The framework defines four core retrieval tasks: Visual Context Retrieval, Multimodal Summary Retrieval, Query-to-Image Retrieval, and Case Study Retrieval, each designed to address specific clinical information needs. Domain experts validated query-document relevance mappings to ensure clinical accuracy and practical applicability. The benchmark evaluates ten retrieval models across five paradigms, including both uni-modal and multimodal approaches, providing comprehensive performance insights across the medical information retrieval landscape.

## Key Results
- Multimodal dense encoders (e.g., MM Embed) excel in image-text tasks, while uni-modal dense models (e.g., NV Embed) dominate text-only retrieval
- The benchmark successfully spans 16 medical specialties and 5 domains, providing comprehensive coverage of medical information needs
- Domain expert validation ensures clinical relevance of query-document mappings, enhancing practical applicability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its alignment with actual clinical workflows through diverse task design and rigorous validation processes. By incorporating multiple retrieval paradigms and domains, M3Retrieve captures the complexity of real-world medical information access scenarios. The expert validation process ensures that retrieved results would be clinically meaningful, addressing a critical gap in existing benchmarks that often prioritize technical performance over practical utility.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal retrieval fundamentals**: Understanding how text and image data can be jointly processed for improved information access; needed to appreciate model performance differences across tasks
- **Medical information hierarchy**: Knowledge of how clinical information is structured and accessed in practice; needed to understand task design rationale
- **Dense vs sparse retrieval paradigms**: Distinction between neural embedding-based and keyword-based approaches; needed to interpret model performance patterns
- **Clinical validation processes**: Methods for ensuring medical content accuracy and relevance; needed to assess benchmark credibility
- **Open-access medical data sources**: Understanding available repositories and their limitations; needed to contextualize dataset composition
- **Retrieval evaluation metrics**: Knowledge of precision, recall, and ranking metrics in information retrieval; needed to interpret benchmark results

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Curation -> Task Definition -> Expert Validation -> Model Benchmarking -> Performance Analysis

**Critical Path**: The essential workflow flows from data collection through task specification to expert validation, as this ensures clinical relevance before performance evaluation. Each stage builds upon the previous, with validation serving as a quality gate before benchmarking.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The benchmark prioritizes clinical relevance over pure technical performance, potentially limiting coverage of emerging medical modalities. The focus on English-language sources from Western healthcare systems may reduce generalizability to other contexts.

**Failure Signatures**: Imbalanced text-image ratios could skew results toward text-dominant models. Geographic and linguistic biases may limit applicability in non-Western medical contexts. Limited representation of emerging modalities like genomics data may miss future retrieval challenges.

**First Experiments**:
1. Benchmark a baseline keyword-based retriever across all four tasks to establish minimum performance standards
2. Test cross-specialty generalization by training on one specialty and evaluating on others
3. Evaluate query-document relevance judgments by multiple experts to assess inter-rater reliability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Text documents (1.2M) vastly outnumber image data (164K), potentially skewing evaluations toward text-dominant retrieval paradigms
- Reliance on open-access repositories may limit representation of proprietary medical modalities like genomics data
- Focus on English-language content from US and European sources creates potential geographic and linguistic biases

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in structural design and task diversity, given clear task definitions and expert validation
- **Medium confidence** in cross-paradigm performance conclusions, as text-image ratio may favor certain model types
- **Low confidence** in generalizability claims across all specialties, given uneven data distribution

## Next Checks
1. **Data Balance Validation**: Conduct statistical analysis comparing retrieval performance across equal-sized subsets of text-only and multimodal documents to control for dataset size effects.

2. **Geographic/Institutional Generalizability**: Test benchmark tasks using medical data from non-Western healthcare systems to assess cultural and institutional bias.

3. **Clinical Workflow Integration**: Partner with clinical institutions to evaluate whether top-performing models on M3Retrieve actually improve real-world diagnostic or information retrieval workflows in practice.
