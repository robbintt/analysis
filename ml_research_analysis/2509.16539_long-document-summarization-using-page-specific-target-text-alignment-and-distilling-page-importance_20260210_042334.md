# Long document summarization using page specific target text alignment and distilling page importance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.16539
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16539
- Authors: Pushpa Devi; Ayush Agrawal; Ashutosh Dubey; C. Ravindranath Chowdary

- Primary result: Proposed PTSPI model achieves 6.32% ROUGE-1 and 8.08% ROUGE-2 improvement over state-of-the-art on arXiv dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of long document abstractive summarization, where transformer-based models like BART are limited by fixed context windows and quadratic memory requirements. The authors propose two models: PTS (Page-specific Target-text alignment Summarization) and PTSPI (Page-specific Target-text alignment Summarization with Page Importance). PTS divides documents into fixed-length pages and aligns each page with relevant parts of the target summary, rather than providing the entire summary to every page. PTSPI extends this by adding a teacher-student distillation layer that learns dynamic page importance weights to focus on the most informative pages. Experiments on the arXiv benchmark dataset show that PTSPI outperforms the state-of-the-art by 6.32% in ROUGE-1 and 8.08% in ROUGE-2 scores, while also improving computational efficiency through page-level processing.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a two-stage approach for long document summarization. First, PTS divides long documents into fixed-length pages and aligns each page with relevant segments of the target summary, avoiding the need to process the entire summary for each page. Second, PTSPI extends PTS by incorporating a teacher-student distillation mechanism that learns dynamic page importance weights, allowing the model to focus on the most informative pages during summarization. This approach addresses the computational limitations of transformer models while improving summarization quality through targeted page processing and importance weighting.

## Key Results
- PTSPI achieves 6.32% improvement in ROUGE-1 and 8.08% improvement in ROUGE-2 over state-of-the-art methods
- The model demonstrates improved computational efficiency through page-level processing
- Significant performance gains are demonstrated on the arXiv benchmark dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing two key challenges in long document summarization: computational efficiency and relevance alignment. By dividing documents into pages and processing them separately, the model avoids the quadratic memory requirements of transformer models while maintaining context coherence. The page-specific target alignment ensures that each page is summarized with respect to its most relevant summary segments, rather than the entire summary. The teacher-student distillation mechanism learns to identify and prioritize the most informative pages, effectively reducing noise from less relevant content and focusing computational resources where they matter most.

- **Abstractive summarization** - Fundamental concept for understanding the task; Quick check: How does abstractive differ from extractive summarization?
- **Memory-efficient attention** - Relevant for understanding the computational benefits; Quick check: What are some common approaches to reduce attention complexity?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Document pages -> Page alignment module -> Transformer encoder -> Teacher-student distillation -> Page importance weights -> Summarization decoder

Critical path: Document → Page segmentation → Page alignment → Page importance weighting → Summarization → Output

Design tradeoffs: Fixed-length pages vs. semantic pages (simplicity vs. context coherence), full summary vs. aligned segments (comprehensive context vs. computational efficiency), teacher-student distillation vs. direct importance learning (robustness vs. simplicity)

Failure signatures: Poor page segmentation leading to context loss, misaligned page-summary pairs causing incoherent summaries, incorrect page importance weights causing focus on irrelevant content, computational overhead from distillation layer

First experiments: 1) Test page segmentation on a sample document to verify context preservation, 2) Validate page-summary alignment by manually checking a few page-summary pairs, 3) Run ablation study comparing PTS with and without page importance weights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Methodology lacks detail on how the teacher-student distillation mechanism computes page importance weights
- arXiv benchmark dataset may have limited generalizability to other domains
- No ablation studies presented to isolate contributions of page alignment versus page importance weighting

## Confidence
High confidence: The general approach of dividing documents into pages and processing them separately is technically sound and addresses the computational limitations of transformer models. The performance improvement claims are plausible given the efficiency gains of page-level processing.

Medium confidence: The alignment mechanism between pages and target summary segments appears reasonable, but the exact implementation details are unclear. The teacher-student distillation for page importance is conceptually valid but lacks sufficient methodological detail for full validation.

Low confidence: The claimed superiority over state-of-the-art methods without extensive ablation studies or testing on multiple datasets makes it difficult to assess whether the improvements come from the proposed innovations or other factors like dataset-specific optimization.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to separately measure the impact of page alignment versus page importance weighting on summarization performance, using the same arXiv dataset.

2. Test the model on at least two additional long-document summarization datasets from different domains (e.g., legal documents, scientific papers from other fields) to assess generalizability beyond arXiv.

3. Provide detailed implementation specifications for the teacher-student distillation mechanism, including the exact algorithm used to compute dynamic page importance weights and how these weights are integrated during both training and inference.
