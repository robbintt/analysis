# DeepWideSearch: Benchmarking Depth and Width in Agentic Information Seeking

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.20168
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20168
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Key outcome:** Introduces first benchmark for agentic information seeking across deep reasoning and wide-scale information collection, achieving only 2.39% success rate with state-of-the-art agents

## Executive Summary
DeepWideSearch introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic information seeking that requires both deep reasoning capabilities and wide-scale information collection. The benchmark constructs 220 challenging questions through two methods: converting existing deep search tasks with table schema augmentation (Deep2Wide) and enhancing wide search queries with synthesized multi-hop sub-questions (Wide2Deep). Current state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% success rate, revealing fundamental limitations in handling combinatorial complexity across both dimensions.

The evaluation reveals four primary failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow. These findings demonstrate that existing agent architectures fundamentally struggle with tasks requiring simultaneous multi-step reasoning and comprehensive structured information collection. The benchmark provides critical insights into the architectural requirements needed for more capable agentic information seeking systems.

## Method Summary
DeepWideSearch constructs a benchmark of 220 questions by converting existing datasets through two complementary approaches. Deep2Wide extends deep search tasks by augmenting them with table schema information, requiring agents to identify core entities through multi-step reasoning while collecting structured data. Wide2Deep enhances wide search queries by synthesizing multi-hop sub-questions, demanding comprehensive information collection across multiple dimensions. This dual construction method ensures the benchmark tests both deep reasoning capabilities and wide-scale information gathering simultaneously.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% success rate on DeepWideSearch benchmark
- Error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow
- Agents struggle with combinatorial complexity of identifying core entities through multi-step reasoning while collecting comprehensive structured information
- The benchmark demonstrates that current architectures fundamentally fail at simultaneous deep and wide information seeking tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The benchmark's dual construction approach (Deep2Wide and Wide2Deep) effectively captures the combinatorial complexity of real-world information seeking by requiring agents to simultaneously perform multi-step reasoning and comprehensive structured data collection. This design forces agents to navigate both the depth of reasoning chains and the breadth of information coverage, creating a more realistic evaluation of agentic capabilities than existing single-dimension benchmarks.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multi-hop reasoning in information seeking**: Required for connecting entities across multiple steps to identify core information
   - Why needed: Many real-world queries require following chains of relationships
   - Quick check: Can the agent follow a chain of 3-4 reasoning steps to reach a conclusion?

2. **Structured information collection**: Involves gathering comprehensive data from tables and schemas
   - Why needed: Real queries often require multiple data points across different dimensions
   - Quick check: Does the agent retrieve all required columns from relevant tables?

3. **Context management**: Critical for handling multiple pieces of information without overflow
   - Why needed: Wide tasks generate substantial context that must be maintained
   - Quick check: Can the agent maintain coherence across 5+ retrieval steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** User Query -> Entity Extraction -> Multi-hop Reasoning -> Table Retrieval -> Context Management -> Answer Generation

**Critical path:** Entity Extraction → Multi-hop Reasoning → Table Retrieval → Context Management → Answer Generation

**Design tradeoffs:** Deep reasoning vs. wide retrieval (prioritizing depth reduces breadth coverage, and vice versa)

**Failure signatures:** 
- No reflection: Agent fails to reconsider incorrect intermediate steps
- Overreliance on internal knowledge: Agent ignores retrieved evidence
- Insufficient retrieval: Agent stops before collecting all necessary information
- Context overflow: Agent loses track of earlier retrieved information

**3 first experiments:**
1. Test entity extraction accuracy on multi-hop reasoning chains
2. Evaluate table retrieval completeness across different schema complexities
3. Measure context retention over increasing numbers of retrieval steps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but implicit questions remain about how these findings generalize to non-table-based information seeking tasks and whether the identified failure modes represent fundamental limitations or architectural choices that could be addressed through different design approaches.

## Limitations
- Benchmark conversion process may introduce artifacts that don't generalize to natural information-seeking scenarios
- Focus on table-based structured data may not represent full diversity of real-world information-seeking tasks
- Error analysis lacks quantitative breakdown of relative contributions from different failure modes
- The 2.39% success rate may be influenced by the specific conversion methodology rather than representing a fundamental performance ceiling for agentic information seeking

## Confidence
- High confidence: Benchmark construction methodology and dataset conversion processes are clearly described and reproducible
- Medium confidence: Characterization of failure modes and their implications for agent architecture limitations
- Low confidence: Generalizability of findings to broader information-seeking contexts beyond table-based structured data
- Low confidence: Whether the observed performance represents fundamental architectural limitations or could be improved through alternative approaches

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies by systematically removing each conversion method (Deep2Wide and Wide2Deep) to isolate whether specific transformation artifacts drive the observed performance gaps rather than fundamental architectural limitations

2. Implement human evaluation studies where information-seeking experts attempt the same tasks to establish whether the benchmark difficulty reflects genuine combinatorial complexity or artificial constraints introduced during question construction

3. Test alternative agent architectures with different prompting strategies, retrieval mechanisms, and context management approaches to determine whether the 2.39% baseline represents a performance floor or whether specific architectural choices could substantially improve outcomes

4. Evaluate the benchmark's performance with domain-specific agents trained on table-based data to determine if the low success rate is due to general agent limitations or lack of domain-specific adaptation

5. Analyze the distribution of success rates across different types of questions (Deep2Wide vs Wide2Deep) to identify which construction method contributes most to the overall difficulty
