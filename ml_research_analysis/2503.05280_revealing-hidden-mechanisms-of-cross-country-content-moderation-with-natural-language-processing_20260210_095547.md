- This paper explores how LLMs can be used to reverse-engineer and explain content moderation decisions across countries.

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that neural classifiers can reverse-engineer content moderation decisions across five countries with high accuracy (F1 scores up to 93.39). The authors train multi-label classifiers on historical Twitter data to predict censorship across Germany, France, India, Turkey, and Russia. They employ Shapley value attribution to identify influential entities behind censorship decisions and use LLMs to generate explanations for moderation decisions. Human evaluation shows these LLM-generated explanations are moderately helpful (average score 3.64/5), though the study finds that LLMs still struggle to fully capture the nuanced, context-dependent rules governing censorship patterns that vary by country and over time.

## Method Summary
The study uses Twitter Stream Grab dataset (1% subsample, 2011-2020) containing English-only tweets from five countries. The authors train multi-label classifiers using seven models including BERT variants, Pythia 1B, and Llama 3.2, with hyperparameters set at 1 epoch, learning rate 1e-5, dropout 0.1, and batch size 8. They employ Shapley values to identify influential entities behind censorship and prompt three LLMs (Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, GPT-4o-mini) to generate explanations for moderation decisions. The classification task predicts whether a tweet is censored in each country, while the explanation task provides rationales for these decisions. Human evaluators rate the generated explanations on fluency, helpfulness, and preference.

## Key Results
- Multi-label classifiers achieve F1 scores up to 93.39 (Pythia 1B on aggregated test)
- Zero-shot LLMs perform poorly on moderation classification (53.6% accuracy on aggregate test)
- Human evaluation shows LLM-generated explanations are moderately helpful (average score 3.64/5)
- Censorship patterns align with real-world events (e.g., "Kavanaugh Hearings" in Germany/France 2018)
- "Other" category posts are hardest to classify across all countries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Training neural classifiers on historical censorship data can approximate platform-level moderation policies with high accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** The paper trains multi-label classifiers (BERT variants, Pythia 1B, Llama 3.2) on tweets labeled as censored or not across five countries. Models learn statistical patterns distinguishing censored content, achieving F1 scores up to 93.39 (Pythia 1B on aggregated test).
- **Core assumption:** Historical moderation decisions encode consistent policy patterns that generalize to unseen content.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "train classifiers to reverse-engineer content moderation decisions across countries; achieving high F1 scores (up to 93.39)"
  - [section 4.1] "We train a multi-label classifier using five encoder-based language models... Additionally, we include two small-scale decoder-based LLMs, Pythia (1B) and Llama 3.2 (1B)"
  - [corpus] Related work "Decoding the Rule Book" extracts implicit moderation criteria using similar classification approaches, supporting the feasibility of this mechanism.
- **Break condition:** If censorship policies shift rapidly or are applied inconsistently (e.g., manual review with high variance), trained classifiers will fail to generalize. Zero-shot LLMs performed poorly (Table 4: GPT-4o-mini 53.6% accuracy), suggesting training on domain-specific data is critical.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Shapley value attribution identifies tokens that disproportionately influence censorship predictions, revealing entity-level patterns aligned with real-world events.
- **Mechanism:** SHAP computes per-token contribution to model output. Aggregating top tokens by mean absolute Shapley value reveals entities like "KavanaughHearings" (Germany/France 2018), "MSG" (India), or "EnesKanterFoundation" (Turkey) that correspond to documented political/social events.
- **Core assumption:** Token-level importance from SHAP approximates actual moderation rationale (not just model artifact).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "use Shapley values to identify influential entities behind censorship"
  - [section 5.2] "We observe a clear alignment between censored content and real-world events. For instance, the 'Kavanaugh Hearings' appear frequently in Germany and France"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support for Shapley-based censorship analysis; this appears novel. Related work on explainability (LIME, SHAP) exists but not applied to cross-country moderation.
- **Break condition:** If influential tokens reflect spurious correlations (e.g., common words in censored posts rather than causal factors), entity-level inferences will be misleading. The paper notes "Other" category posts are hardest to classify (Figure 1b), suggesting ambiguous cases lack clear token signals.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** LLM-generated explanations for censorship decisions provide moderately useful rationales but fail to fully capture context-dependent rules.
- **Mechanism:** Three LLMs (Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, GPT-4o-mini) generate explanations for why posts were censored. Human evaluators rate helpfulness at ~3.64/5 (72%), with Aya-23 preferred despite lower general capability, possibly due to stronger multilingual/cultural understanding.
- **Core assumption:** LLM world knowledge includes sufficient context about regional political/cultural sensitivities to rationalize moderation decisions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Human evaluation shows that LLM-generated explanations are moderately helpful (average helpfulness score of 3.64/5)"
  - [section 5.3] "most annotators preferred the generations produced by Aya-23... This preference may be attributed to Aya-23's enhanced multilingual capabilities"
  - [corpus] "Probing Association Biases in LLM Moderation Over-Sensitivity" documents LLM systematic biases in moderation, supporting the finding that explanations may be unfaithful or incomplete.
- **Break condition:** If LLM explanations reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than faithful reasoning (per Turpin et al. 2023, cited in paper), human preference does not validate correctness. The paper acknowledges "LLMs struggle to fully capture the nuanced, context-dependent rules."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-label classification for multi-jurisdictional moderation**
  - Why needed here: A single post can be censored in multiple countries simultaneously (e.g., Germany AND France). Standard binary classification fails to capture this.
  - Quick check question: Given a tweet censored in both Turkey and Russia, does your model architecture support independent predictions per country?

- **Concept: SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for token attribution**
  - Why needed here: Understanding *why* a model predicts censorship requires identifying which input features drive the decision.
  - Quick check question: If SHAP identifies "freedom" as high-importance for Turkey censorship, how would you verify this reflects policy vs. training distribution artifact?

- **Concept: Transfer learning with encoder vs. decoder architectures**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares fine-tuned encoders (BERT, RoBERTa) with small decoders (Pythia, Llama). Performance varies by architecture and scale.
  - Quick check question: Your team wants to deploy censorship detection for a new country with limited labeled data. Would you choose a fine-tuned encoder or a zero-shot LLM approach, and what tradeoffs apply?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Twitter Stream Grab dataset (1% sample 2011-2020) → country-labeled censored/uncensored posts → train/val/test split (country-stratified, max 500 samples/country in test) → 7 classification models tested → SHAP for token importance → LLM prompting for rationales → human evaluation (45 samples/country)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Data acquisition via Twitter API (note: tweet deletion/availability issues reduce sample)
  2. Fine-tune classifier on aggregated data (no country-separation during training)
  3. Generate Shapley values per country subset to identify key entities
  4. Prompt LLMs for explanation generation
  5. Human evaluation on 15 samples/country × 3 LLMs

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Training: Aggregated multi-country training improves data efficiency but may dilute country-specific signals vs. per-country models
  - Model selection: Pythia 1B achieved highest F1 but decoder models are less interpretable than encoders; SHAP works but requires careful aggregation
  - Evaluation: Human evaluation is costly; paper uses only 45 samples/country, limiting statistical power

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Zero-shot LLMs fail on Germany/France/Russia (Table 4: 34-49% accuracy) — indicates domain shift between pretraining and moderation task
  - "Other" category misclassification dominates across countries (Figure 1b) — ambiguous content lacks consistent token patterns
  - India/Russia show high variance (Table 3: BERT-Tiny scores 0.0) — likely due to small sample sizes (5028 and 4669 posts respectively)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Train RoBERTa-base on the provided dataset using the paper's hyperparameters (1 epoch, lr=1e-5, batch=8). Target: replicate ~90 F1 on aggregated test. Verify data splits match paper description.
  2. **Country-specific vs. unified model:** Compare unified model (paper's approach) against 5 separate country-specific models on held-out test sets. Hypothesis: countries with more data (Germany, France) may benefit from unified training; low-data countries (India, Russia) may not.
  3. **Shapley sanity check:** Compute SHAP values for a subset of 50 censored posts per country. Manually verify top-5 tokens align with known censorship categories (e.g., political terms for India, religious terms for Turkey). Flag cases where top tokens appear semantically irrelevant.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does analyzing native-language content, rather than English-only posts, affect the accuracy of censorship prediction and the validity of generated explanations in multilingual countries?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly list investigating "how multilingualism influences censorship practices" and expanding analysis to more countries as future directions.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study is limited to English-language tweets, which may fail to capture localized discourse patterns in countries like Turkey, Russia, and India where non-English political discourse is significant.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study replicating the current methodology on native-language datasets from the same five countries to measure performance differences.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do the identified censorship patterns and high classifier performance (F1 ~93) transfer to platforms with different moderation guidelines and user demographics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The "Limitations" section notes the analysis is "Platform-Specific" to Twitter and that findings may vary across Facebook, Instagram, or regional networks.
- **Why unresolved:** Twitter has distinct policies and user bases; models trained on Twitter data may not generalize to platforms with different community standards or algorithmic enforcement.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Cross-platform experiments applying the trained models to datasets from other social media platforms to test for domain shift and performance degradation.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can mechanistic interpretability techniques (e.g., activation patching) provide more faithful explanations for context-dependent moderation decisions than post-hoc Shapley values?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] In "Opening Directions for Future Work," the authors suggest building on findings using "advanced techniques such as activation patching... and circuit discovery" to ensure explanations remain faithful.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper finds that current LLM explanations struggle with "nuanced, context-dependent rules" and may be unfaithful (aligned to preferences rather than facts).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study comparing the faithfulness and accuracy of explanations derived from internal model mechanics (patching) versus the external feature attribution (SHAP) used in the paper.

## Limitations
- Platform-specific findings may not generalize to other social media platforms with different moderation guidelines
- Analysis limited to English-language tweets, missing native-language discourse patterns in multilingual countries
- LLM-generated explanations may be unfaithful post-hoc rationalizations rather than capturing actual moderation reasoning

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Classification performance metrics (F1 scores, accuracy per country) - these are directly measurable and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** Entity identification via Shapley values - while methodologically sound, the alignment between SHAP-identified tokens and real-world events requires careful interpretation
- **Low Confidence:** LLM-generated explanations' faithfulness - human preference does not guarantee the explanations accurately capture model reasoning or actual moderation criteria

## Next Checks
1. **Temporal Generalization Test:** Retrain classifiers on rolling time windows (2011-2015, 2016-2020) and evaluate performance on held-out periods to quantify degradation over time. This would validate whether the approach can adapt to evolving censorship patterns.

2. **Counterfactual Token Analysis:** Systematically replace identified influential tokens with semantically similar alternatives and measure impact on predictions. This would distinguish genuine policy signals from spurious correlations in the training data.

3. **Explanation Faithfulness Validation:** Use automated faithfulness metrics (e.g., completeness, sufficiency) to evaluate whether LLM explanations accurately reflect the token attributions identified by SHAP. Compare against human-annotated ground truth rationales where available.
