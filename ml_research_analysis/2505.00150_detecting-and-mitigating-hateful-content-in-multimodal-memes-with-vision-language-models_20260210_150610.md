# Detecting and Mitigating Hateful Content in Multimodal Memes with Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: VLMs with definition-guided prompts outperform baselines on hateful meme detection without fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of detecting and mitigating hateful content in multimodal memes using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The authors introduce a definition-guided prompting technique that enhances VLMs' reasoning capabilities for hate detection by incorporating detailed definitions and clear classification criteria. They also propose UnHateMeme, a unified framework that automatically identifies and replaces hateful textual and visual components in memes to transform them into non-hateful versions while preserving image-text coherence. The approach demonstrates strong empirical performance on established benchmarks without requiring additional fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The paper presents two key contributions for addressing hateful content in multimodal memes. First, it introduces definition-guided prompting for hate detection, where VLMs are provided with comprehensive definitions of hatefulness along with clear classification criteria to improve reasoning accuracy. Second, it proposes the UnHateMeme framework for hate mitigation, which automatically analyzes the type and source of hateful content in memes and generates appropriate substitutions. The framework replaces hateful textual elements and/or modifies visual components to create non-hateful memes that maintain coherence between image and text. Both approaches leverage the reasoning capabilities of VLMs without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- VLMs with definition-guided prompts achieve superior performance on hateful meme detection compared to multiple baselines
- The UnHateMeme framework successfully converts hateful memes into non-hateful versions that meet human-level criteria for both hate speech and multimodal coherence
- Both detection and mitigation approaches work effectively without additional fine-tuning, demonstrating the power of prompt engineering with VLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging VLMs' inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities through carefully designed prompting strategies. The definition-guided prompting provides VLMs with explicit criteria and comprehensive definitions of hatefulness, enabling more accurate classification by reducing ambiguity in interpretation. The UnHateMeme framework exploits VLMs' understanding of both visual and textual modalities to identify hate sources and generate contextually appropriate replacements. By maintaining the coherence between modified image and text components, the framework preserves the essential structure and meaning of memes while eliminating harmful content.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: Multimodal AI models that process both visual and textual information simultaneously. Why needed: Essential for understanding the complex interplay between images and text in memes. Quick check: Can the model accurately describe both visual and textual components of a given meme.
- **Definition-guided prompting**: A technique where models are provided with detailed definitions and classification criteria during inference. Why needed: Helps VLMs understand nuanced concepts like hatefulness that require context-specific interpretation. Quick check: Does the prompt include clear examples and edge cases for hate speech.
- **Multimodal coherence**: The semantic consistency between visual and textual elements in a meme. Why needed: Critical for maintaining meme structure and humor while modifying content. Quick check: After modification, does the image still align with and support the textual message.
- **Zero-shot learning**: The ability of models to perform tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. Why needed: Enables rapid deployment and adaptation to new types of hate speech. Quick check: Can the model generalize to hate content not seen during training of the base model.
- **Adversarial robustness**: The ability to handle deliberately crafted inputs designed to bypass detection. Why needed: Real-world deployment requires resilience against bad actors. Quick check: Can the system detect hate content with subtle wording or obscured visual elements.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Meme -> Vision Encoder -> Text Encoder -> Multimodal Fusion -> Hate Detection Module -> Hate Classification; Input Meme -> Hate Analysis Module -> Content Substitution Generator -> Output Modified Meme

**Critical Path**: Meme Input → Hate Detection → If hateful → UnHateMeme Mitigation → Output Non-hateful Meme; otherwise → Direct Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes prompt engineering over fine-tuning, trading potential performance gains from task-specific training for flexibility and reduced computational requirements. This approach enables rapid adaptation to new hate patterns but may sacrifice some accuracy compared to extensively fine-tuned models.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may struggle with culturally specific hate speech, subtle or coded language, memes that rely heavily on context beyond the image-text pair, and content that deliberately obscures hateful elements through visual manipulation or complex wordplay.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test detection accuracy on a diverse set of memes containing both overt and subtle hate speech across different cultural contexts
2. Evaluate mitigation effectiveness by measuring whether human annotators can distinguish between original hateful memes and those processed by UnHateMeme
3. Assess coherence preservation by having evaluators rate whether modified memes maintain logical consistency between image and text

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies primarily on synthetic and limited real-world datasets, raising concerns about generalization to the full diversity of hateful memes
- The definition-guided prompting approach depends heavily on the quality and completeness of provided definitions, which may not capture all emerging forms of hate speech
- The automatic substitution generation may struggle with maintaining cultural context and subtle humor characteristic of many memes

## Confidence
- Detection framework claims: Medium confidence - Strong empirical results but limited dataset diversity
- Mitigation framework claims: Medium confidence - Effective on test cases but uncertain about generalization
- Performance superiority claims: Medium confidence - Lacks direct comparison with fine-tuned state-of-the-art models

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on larger, more diverse real-world datasets including memes from different cultural contexts and languages
2. Conduct human evaluation studies with diverse annotator pools to assess cultural sensitivity and context preservation in mitigation
3. Perform adversarial testing by having participants deliberately attempt to craft memes that bypass the detection and mitigation systems
