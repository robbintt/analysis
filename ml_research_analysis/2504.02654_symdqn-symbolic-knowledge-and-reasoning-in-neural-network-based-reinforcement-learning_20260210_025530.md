# SymDQN: Symbolic Knowledge and Reasoning in Neural Network-based Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.02654
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02654
- Authors: Ivo Amador; Nina Gierasimczuk
- Reference count: 6
- This paper presents SymDQN, a novel reinforcement learning architecture that integrates symbolic reasoning with deep neural networks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SymDQN, a neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning architecture that combines Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DuelDQN) with Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) modules. The system is designed to navigate a 5x5 grid environment where an agent must collect objects with varying rewards while avoiding negative-reward objects. The architecture incorporates four LTN modules: Shape Recognizer, Reward Predictor, Action Reasoner, and Action Filter, each contributing to different aspects of the decision-making process. The modular approach allows for systematic analysis of how symbolic reasoning components enhance traditional neural network-based reinforcement learning.

## Method Summary
The SymDQN architecture integrates DuelDQN with four specialized LTN modules to create a neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning system. The Shape Recognizer identifies different object shapes in the environment, while the Reward Predictor estimates potential rewards for actions. The Action Reasoner provides logical constraints on possible actions based on the current state, and the Action Filter module prevents actions that would lead to negative rewards. These components work together within the DuelDQN framework, with the LTN modules providing additional symbolic reasoning capabilities that guide the agent's decision-making process. The system is trained and evaluated in a controlled 5x5 grid environment with various shaped objects carrying different reward values.

## Key Results
- SymDQN significantly outperforms baseline DuelDQN in both learning speed and precision
- ActionFilter module enables SymDQN to achieve perfect avoidance of negative-reward objects
- ActionReasoner module provides initial learning benefits but may hinder long-term performance
- Modular design allows for analysis of how different neuro-symbolic components contribute to learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of symbolic reasoning with deep neural networks in SymDQN creates a hybrid system that leverages the strengths of both approaches. The LTN modules provide logical constraints and symbolic knowledge that complement the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks. This combination allows the agent to reason about actions more effectively, particularly in avoiding negative rewards through the ActionFilter module. The symbolic components can capture relationships and rules that might be difficult for pure neural networks to learn directly, especially in environments with clear logical structures. The modular design enables the system to isolate and analyze the contributions of different reasoning components, providing insights into how symbolic knowledge enhances learning performance.

## Foundational Learning
- Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DuelDQN): A DQN variant that separates state value and advantage functions, needed for stable Q-value estimation; quick check: compare Q-value distributions with and without dueling architecture
- Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs): Neural networks that learn logical rules and constraints, needed for integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks; quick check: verify logical consistency of learned rules
- Reinforcement Learning in Grid Environments: Basic RL setup where agents learn optimal policies through reward maximization; quick check: ensure proper reward signal propagation
- Modular Neural Architecture: Design pattern where different components handle specific tasks, needed for isolating effects of symbolic reasoning modules; quick check: verify module independence and interaction

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input -> Shape Recognizer -> Reward Predictor -> Action Reasoner -> Action Filter -> DuelDQN Core -> Output Actions

Critical path: Environment Observation → Shape Recognizer → Reward Predictor → Action Filter → DuelDQN → Action Selection → Environment

Design tradeoffs: The modular approach allows for flexibility in component design and analysis but introduces additional computational overhead. The symbolic reasoning modules provide logical constraints but may limit the agent's ability to discover novel solutions. The system trades pure neural network adaptability for structured reasoning capabilities.

Failure signatures: If ActionFilter fails, the agent may take actions leading to negative rewards. If ActionReasoner fails, the agent may violate logical constraints in its decision-making. If Shape Recognizer fails, the agent cannot properly identify objects in the environment.

First experiments:
1. Test individual LTN modules in isolation to verify their basic functionality
2. Evaluate the impact of removing each LTN module on overall performance
3. Compare learning curves of SymDQN versus DuelDQN across different training episodes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The 5x5 grid environment represents a relatively simple test case that may not capture real-world complexities
- The study focuses on a single agent navigating between shapes, limiting generalizability to multi-agent systems
- The paper lacks detailed analysis of computational overhead introduced by symbolic reasoning components

## Confidence
- SymDQN significantly outperforms baseline DuelDQN: High confidence
- ActionFilter module enables perfect avoidance of negative-reward objects: Medium confidence
- Modular design allows for analysis of component contributions: High confidence
- Symbolic reasoning substantially enhances RL agents' performance: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test SymDQN on more complex grid environments with larger state spaces, multiple agents, and dynamic reward structures to evaluate scalability and robustness.

2. Conduct ablation studies with varying combinations of the LTN modules to better understand their interactions and identify optimal configurations for different task requirements.

3. Measure and compare computational overhead and training time between SymDQN and baseline DuelDQN across different hardware configurations to assess practical deployment implications.
