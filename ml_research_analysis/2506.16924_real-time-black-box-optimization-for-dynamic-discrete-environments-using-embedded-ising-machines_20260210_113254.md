# Real-Time Black-Box Optimization for Dynamic Discrete Environments Using Embedded Ising Machines

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.16924
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16924
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Real-time black-box optimization method for dynamic discrete environments achieves ~80% relative performance compared to white-box solutions in wireless beamforming coordination

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of real-time black-box optimization in dynamic discrete environments where optimization problems evolve over time and cannot be explicitly modeled. The proposed RT-BBO method extends static black-box optimization by incorporating a dynamic adaptation mechanism with sliding-window datasets, pre-training weight decay, and exploration incentives. The approach is demonstrated in wireless beamforming coordination for moving users, where the algorithm must adapt to changing channel conditions while optimizing discrete beam patterns. The method achieves approximately 80% relative performance compared to ideal white-box solutions, significantly outperforming greedy and random selection methods while maintaining 57 sampling cycles per second.

## Method Summary
The RT-BBO method combines a Factorization Machine with Quantum Annealing (FMQA) framework with a dynamic adaptation mechanism for real-time optimization. The core innovation is the integration of sliding-window dataset management, pre-training weight decay, and exploration incentive to enable the quadratic surrogate model to adapt to environmental changes while balancing exploration-exploitation. The method uses an embedded Simulated Bifurcation Machine (SBM) to efficiently find optimal actions from enormous discrete variable spaces. The algorithm is specifically designed for scenarios where the objective function changes over time, requiring continuous adaptation without explicit problem formulation. The approach is validated on a wireless beamforming coordination problem with moving users, demonstrating effective real-time adaptation to dynamic channel conditions.

## Key Results
- Achieves approximately 80% relative performance compared to ideal white-box solutions in dynamic wireless beamforming coordination
- Maintains 57 sampling cycles per second, meeting the 10 Hz sampling rate threshold for effective real-time adaptation
- Significantly outperforms both greedy and random selection methods in dynamic environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method succeeds by combining three key mechanisms: dynamic dataset management through sliding windows that retain recent relevant data while discarding outdated information, weight decay during pre-training that prevents overfitting to obsolete patterns, and exploration incentives that ensure continued search for better solutions even when current performance is acceptable. The embedded SBM efficiently explores the enormous discrete action space by leveraging quantum-inspired optimization techniques, while the Factorization Machine provides a flexible quadratic surrogate model that can capture complex interactions between discrete variables.

## Foundational Learning

**Dynamic Optimization**
*Why needed:* Environments change over time, requiring algorithms to continuously adapt rather than converge to a single solution
*Quick check:* Algorithm maintains performance when objective function parameters shift during execution

**Factorization Machines**
*Why needed:* Handle sparse, high-dimensional discrete data while capturing variable interactions efficiently
*Quick check:* Model accurately represents complex variable relationships in the surrogate function

**Simulated Bifurcation Machine**
*Why needed:* Efficiently solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems at scale
*Why needed:* Provide real-time performance through parallel processing on FPGAs
*Quick check:* Sampling rate exceeds 10 Hz threshold for real-time adaptation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
RT-BBO -> Sliding Window Manager -> Pre-training Weight Decay -> Exploration Incentive -> Factorization Machine -> SBM Solver -> Action Selection

**Critical Path**
Environment observation → Sliding window update → Model training with weight decay → Exploration bonus calculation → SBM optimization → Action execution → Reward collection

**Design Tradeoffs**
The method balances exploration-exploitation through the exploration incentive parameter, which must be tuned based on environment dynamics. Sliding window size trades off between retaining sufficient historical data for stable learning and discarding outdated information quickly enough to adapt to changes.

**Failure Signatures**
Performance degradation when sampling rate drops below 10 Hz, indicating insufficient adaptation speed. Poor performance when exploration incentive is too low (premature convergence) or too high (excessive random exploration). Failure to adapt when weight decay is insufficient or window size is too large.

**First Experiments**
1. Test algorithm on synthetic dynamic functions with known ground truth to verify adaptation capability
2. Vary exploration incentive parameter systematically to find optimal balance for different environment dynamics
3. Measure performance degradation as sampling rate decreases below 10 Hz threshold

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Tested only on wireless beamforming coordination, limiting generalizability to other dynamic discrete optimization problems
- Performance dependent on maintaining sampling rate above 10 Hz, which may be challenging for larger or more complex problems
- Computational requirements for scaling to larger variable spaces not fully characterized

## Confidence

**High Confidence**
- Technical implementation of RT-BBO framework following established optimization principles
- Algorithmic descriptions are clear and methodologically sound

**Medium Confidence**
- 80% relative performance claim based on single application domain
- 57 sampling cycles per second performance metric without characterization of scaling requirements

## Next Checks

1. Test algorithm across diverse dynamic discrete optimization problems beyond wireless beamforming to evaluate generalizability
2. Conduct systematic analysis of performance degradation as problem size scales up, particularly focusing on the 10 Hz sampling rate threshold
3. Compare against state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches in dynamic environments to establish relative positioning in the broader optimization landscape
