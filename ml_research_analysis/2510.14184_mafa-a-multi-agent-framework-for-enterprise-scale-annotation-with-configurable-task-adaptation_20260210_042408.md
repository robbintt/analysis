# MAFA: A Multi-Agent Framework for Enterprise-Scale Annotation with Configurable Task Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.14184
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14184
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Multi-agent framework eliminates 1M utterance backlog, achieves 86% human agreement, saves 5,000+ hours annually

## Executive Summary
MAFA is a multi-agent framework designed to address annotation backlogs in enterprise settings, specifically demonstrated in financial services. The system combines specialized agents with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism to process utterances at scale. Rather than requiring code changes for task adaptation, MAFA uses configuration files that enable organizations to define custom annotation types dynamically. The framework was deployed at JP Morgan Chase, where it successfully eliminated a backlog of one million utterances while significantly reducing manual annotation workload.

The system processes utterances with confidence classifications, allowing human annotators to focus on ambiguous cases that require expert judgment. MAFA demonstrates consistent performance improvements over baseline approaches, achieving higher accuracy metrics across multiple datasets and languages. The configuration-driven approach provides flexibility for different organizational needs while maintaining systematic reasoning capabilities through its multi-agent architecture.

## Method Summary
MAFA employs a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents handle different aspects of the annotation process, coordinated through a judge-based consensus mechanism. The framework uses configuration files to define custom annotation types and task parameters, enabling dynamic adaptation without code modifications. Agents perform structured reasoning on input data, generating confidence scores for their classifications. The system processes utterances through multiple stages of analysis, with high-confidence classifications routed for immediate processing and lower-confidence cases flagged for human review. The architecture supports multiple languages and dataset types, with performance metrics measured against human annotator agreement.

## Key Results
- Eliminated 1 million utterance backlog at JP Morgan Chase deployment
- Achieved 86% agreement rate with human annotators while saving over 5,000 hours annually
- Outperformed baselines with 13.8% higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% better Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% improved F1 score

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MAFA's effectiveness stems from its multi-agent architecture that combines specialized reasoning capabilities with a consensus-based approach. Each agent focuses on specific aspects of the annotation task, allowing for deeper expertise in particular domains while the judge mechanism ensures consistency across agents. The confidence classification system (typically 85% high, 10% medium, 5% low) enables intelligent routing of cases, directing ambiguous utterances to human experts while automating clear cases. The configuration-driven task adaptation allows organizations to tailor the system to their specific needs without extensive development cycles, making the framework scalable across different annotation types and domains.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent consensus mechanisms** - why needed: to combine specialized expertise while maintaining consistency; quick check: agreement rates between agents
- **Confidence-based routing** - why needed: to optimize human expert time by focusing on ambiguous cases; quick check: distribution of confidence scores
- **Configuration-driven adaptation** - why needed: to enable rapid task customization without code changes; quick check: configuration file completeness and validation
- **Structured reasoning** - why needed: to ensure systematic and traceable annotation decisions; quick check: reasoning chain completeness
- **Enterprise-scale deployment considerations** - why needed: to handle production workloads and integration requirements; quick check: throughput and latency metrics
- **Human-AI collaboration design** - why needed: to create effective handoff between automated and manual annotation processes; quick check: human review workload distribution

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Configuration Manager -> Agent Pool -> Judge Module -> Confidence Classifier -> Routing System -> Output Store

**Critical Path**
Input utterance → Configuration parsing → Agent analysis → Judge consensus → Confidence scoring → Output routing → Storage

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Agent specialization vs. generalization: specialized agents provide deeper expertise but require more configuration complexity
- Confidence threshold calibration: higher thresholds reduce human workload but may miss important cases
- Configuration flexibility vs. system stability: extensive configurability enables adaptation but introduces potential variability

**Failure Signatures**
- Low agreement rates between agents indicating configuration issues or ambiguous task definitions
- High volume of low-confidence classifications suggesting model limitations or inadequate training data
- Configuration parsing errors preventing proper task setup and agent coordination

**First Experiments**
1. Run configuration validation test with sample annotation types to verify parsing and agent initialization
2. Execute single-agent processing pipeline with test utterances to validate individual component functionality
3. Test judge consensus mechanism with synthetic agent outputs to verify agreement calculation and routing logic

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single-domain deployment in financial services limits generalizability to other annotation tasks and domains
- Performance metrics based on agreement with human annotators rather than independent ground truth validation
- Configuration file quality heavily influences system performance, introducing variability across organizational implementations

## Confidence
- **High**: Efficiency improvements and backlog reduction claims (specific deployment metrics and hours saved)
- **Medium**: Accuracy improvements over baselines (measured through agreement with human annotators)
- **Low**: Cross-domain applicability and generalizability to different annotation tasks (single-domain deployment)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent validation of annotation accuracy using external ground truth datasets across multiple domains beyond financial services
2. Perform systematic evaluation of configuration file quality and its impact on annotation performance across different organizational contexts
3. Test the framework's performance on annotation tasks beyond utterance classification, such as document annotation or multi-modal data labeling
