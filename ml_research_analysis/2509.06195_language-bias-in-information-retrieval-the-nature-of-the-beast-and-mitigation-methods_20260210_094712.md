core_contribution: This paper studies language fairness in multilingual information
  retrieval (MLIR), motivated by the observation that semantically equivalent queries

# Language Bias in Information Retrieval: The Nature of the Beast and Mitigation Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.06195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06195

- Primary result: Neural retrievers show less language bias than BM25, with XLM-R performing best

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates language fairness in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR), revealing that semantically equivalent queries in different languages often yield inconsistent ranking outputs. The authors introduce a mean rank correlation (MRC) metric to measure fairness and present MultiEuP-v2, a comprehensive multilingual dataset spanning 24 European languages. Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate that DPR-based neural retrievers exhibit significantly less language bias than traditional BM25, with XLM-R emerging as the most equitable performer. The study introduces LaKDA, a language-aware KL-divergence alignment loss that substantially improves fairness without sacrificing retrieval performance, representing a significant advancement in addressing systematic inequities in MLIR systems.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating and mitigating language bias in multilingual information retrieval. They propose mean rank correlation (MRC) as a fairness metric based on ranking consistency for semantically parallel queries across languages. The MultiEuP-v2 dataset provides parallel query-document pairs across 24 European languages, enabling robust fairness evaluation. To address identified biases, they introduce LaKDA, a language-aware KL-divergence alignment loss that encourages consistent relevance scoring across languages. The method is evaluated across multiple neural retrievers (mBERT, XLM-R) and compared against traditional BM25, demonstrating significant improvements in fairness metrics while maintaining retrieval effectiveness.

## Key Results
- Neural retrievers (mBERT, XLM-R) exhibit significantly less language bias than BM25, with XLM-R performing best
- LaKDA improves fairness (MRC@5) substantially without sacrificing retrieval performance (MRR@100)
- LaKDA proves more effective than naive MSE baseline and enhances parallel query similarity
- MRC@5 fairness improvements range from 3.7% to 19.8% across different language pairs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of LaKDA stems from its targeted alignment of relevance distributions across languages through KL-divergence minimization. By explicitly encouraging the model to produce consistent relevance scores for semantically equivalent queries regardless of language, the method directly addresses the source of language bias. The KL-divergence formulation is particularly well-suited for this task as it naturally handles probability distributions and penalizes divergence in a way that preserves ranking quality. The neural retrievers' superior performance likely results from their cross-lingual pre-training objectives, which provide better language-agnostic representations compared to the bag-of-words approach in BM25.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mean Rank Correlation (MRC)**: Measures consistency of rankings for parallel queries across languages; needed to quantify language fairness objectively
- **KL-divergence alignment**: Statistical measure for comparing probability distributions; required for encouraging consistent relevance scoring across languages
- **Parallel query-document pairs**: Semantically equivalent queries and documents in different languages; essential for training and evaluating multilingual models fairly
- **DPR architecture**: Dense passage retrieval framework using dual-encoder models; provides foundation for neural retrieval with cross-lingual capabilities
- **Language-agnostic representations**: Embeddings that capture meaning independent of specific language; crucial for fair multilingual retrieval
- **Retrieval quality metrics (MRR, Recall)**: Standard IR evaluation measures; needed to ensure fairness improvements don't compromise effectiveness

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** LaKDA Loss -> DPR Dual-Encoder -> Query Encoder / Document Encoder -> Similarity Scoring

**Critical path:** Query encoding → Document encoding → Similarity scoring → LaKDA alignment → Training update

**Design tradeoffs:** The KL-divergence formulation balances fairness improvement against retrieval quality, while the choice between mBERT and XLM-R involves cross-lingual generalization versus model capacity considerations.

**Failure signatures:** Language bias manifests as inconsistent rankings for parallel queries, with certain languages systematically receiving lower-quality results despite semantic equivalence.

**First experiments to run:**
1. Evaluate MRC@5 across all language pairs to establish baseline fairness
2. Compare LaKDA against MSE baseline on a subset of languages
3. Test LaKDA's impact on MRR@100 to verify retrieval quality preservation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Major uncertainties remain around the scalability of LaKDA to non-European languages and whether the MRC metric captures all relevant fairness dimensions. The dataset construction process, while detailed, relies on human annotation that may introduce subtle biases in query-document relevance judgments. Additionally, the study focuses primarily on static neural retrievers, leaving open questions about fairness in generative or hybrid IR systems. The experiments do not fully explore the impact of training data composition on language bias, nor do they address potential trade-offs between fairness and other retrieval quality metrics beyond MRR@100.

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for LaKDA to non-European language families
- Potential biases in human-annotated relevance judgments
- Focus on static neural retrievers, excluding generative or hybrid IR systems
- Limited exploration of training data composition effects on language bias

## Confidence
- High confidence in the observation that neural retrievers show less language bias than BM25
- Medium confidence in the effectiveness of LaKDA across all tested languages
- Low confidence in generalizability to non-European language families and broader IR paradigms

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LaKDA on a dataset including Asian and African languages to test cross-family generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of pre-training vs. fine-tuning data on language bias
3. Test LaKDA in a generative IR setting where query expansion and document summarization could affect fairness outcomes
