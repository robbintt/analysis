# Are Video Models Ready as Zero-Shot Reasoners? An Empirical Study with the MME-CoF Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.26802
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26802
- Reference count: 40
- Video generation models show promise in spatial coherence but struggle with long-horizon causal reasoning

## Executive Summary
This empirical study evaluates whether state-of-the-art video generation models can serve as zero-shot visual reasoners through Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Focusing on Veo-3, the authors examine reasoning performance across 12 dimensions including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic. Through the MME-COF benchmark comprising 59 curated tasks, the study reveals that while video models demonstrate strong short-horizon spatial coherence and locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. The findings suggest video models are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners but show potential as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic evaluation framework using Veo-3 as the primary model under investigation. Researchers curated the MME-COF benchmark by selecting 59 tasks from multiple reasoning-oriented datasets, standardizing evaluation through unified prompt styles. Performance assessment utilized qualitative evaluation across three tiers (Good, Moderate, Bad) with success rate calculations. The evaluation examined reasoning across 12 distinct dimensions including spatial reasoning, geometric constraints, physical dynamics, temporal consistency, and embodied logic. Zero-shot prompting was used throughout, without fine-tuning or adaptation, to assess inherent model reasoning capabilities.

## Key Results
- Video models demonstrate strong short-horizon spatial coherence and fine-grained visual grounding
- Current models struggle with long-horizon causal reasoning and strict geometric constraints
- Performance shows promise in locally consistent dynamics but limitations in abstract logical reasoning
- Overall, video models are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot visual reasoners

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Video models can generate temporally consistent sequences that capture basic spatial relationships and local dynamics. The Chain-of-Frame reasoning approach leverages the model's inherent ability to maintain coherence across frames for short time horizons. However, the models lack the structured reasoning capabilities needed for complex logical inference and long-term causal understanding. The visual grounding capabilities work well for concrete, observable phenomena but break down when abstract reasoning or strict mathematical constraints are required.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Chain-of-Frame reasoning** - Sequential frame generation for logical inference; needed to evaluate temporal consistency in reasoning; quick check: frame-to-frame coherence metrics
2. **Spatial reasoning evaluation** - Assessment of object relationships and positioning; needed to measure geometric understanding; quick check: spatial alignment accuracy
3. **Physical dynamics modeling** - Evaluation of realistic motion and interaction; needed to test physics comprehension; quick check: motion trajectory consistency
4. **Temporal logic assessment** - Analysis of event sequencing and causality; needed to evaluate reasoning over time; quick check: causal chain validity
5. **Embodied logic evaluation** - Assessment of object interactions and agency; needed to test real-world reasoning; quick check: interaction plausibility scores
6. **Abstract reasoning measurement** - Evaluation of conceptual and logical inference; needed to test non-visual reasoning; quick check: logical consistency metrics

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Prompt Generator -> Video Model (Veo-3) -> Frame Sequence Output -> Qualitative Evaluator -> Performance Tiers
**Critical Path**: Standardized prompt → video generation → frame extraction → human/AI evaluation → performance classification
**Design Tradeoffs**: Zero-shot evaluation vs. fine-tuned performance; qualitative assessment vs. quantitative metrics; single model focus vs. cross-model comparison
**Failure Signatures**: Spatial incoherence in long sequences, geometric constraint violations, physically impossible dynamics, temporal causality breaks
**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test short-horizon spatial reasoning tasks with varying object counts
2. Evaluate geometric constraint satisfaction in simple shape manipulation
3. Assess temporal causality in two-step action sequences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single model evaluation (Veo-3) limits generalizability to other video generation systems
- Qualitative assessment framework introduces subjectivity in performance evaluation
- Zero-shot only approach doesn't explore potential through fine-tuning or adaptation
- Benchmark derived from existing datasets may inherit source limitations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Short-horizon spatial coherence findings, locally consistent dynamics observations, limitations in geometric constraints
- **Medium Confidence**: Embodied logic reasoning capabilities, abstract reasoning assessment, relative performance across reasoning dimensions
- **Low Confidence**: Comparative claims between video models and dedicated reasoning models without direct empirical comparison

## Next Checks
1. Cross-model validation: Evaluate additional state-of-the-art video generation models (Sora, Runway, Luma) on the MME-COF benchmark
2. Fine-tuning impact assessment: Compare zero-shot performance with fine-tuned models on reasoning-oriented tasks
3. Longitudinal benchmark evolution: Track model performance across successive model generations and updates
