core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE),
  which seeks to identify and extract novel relational facts between named entities
  from unlabeled data without pre-defined relation schemas. Existing OpenRE methods
  typically assume that the unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is
  pre-divided into known and novel instances.

# Towards a More Generalized Approach in Open Relation Extraction

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22801
- Reference count: 15
- Proposes MixORE, a two-phase framework that achieves high F1 scores for both known relation classification and novel relation clustering on multiple benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) by proposing MixORE, a two-phase framework that can handle both known and novel relations in unlabeled data without requiring pre-divided datasets. Unlike existing methods that assume data contains only novel relations or is pre-divided into known and novel instances, MixORE operates on realistic scenarios where novel relations are arbitrarily distributed within unlabeled data. The framework employs a Semantic Autoencoder-based relation detection module to identify potential novel relations and generate weak labels, followed by an open-world semi-supervised joint learning approach with contrastive learning to progressively refine the model. Experimental results on FewRel, TACRED, and Re-TACRED datasets demonstrate that MixORE consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving strong performance in both known relation classification and novel relation clustering tasks.

## Method Summary
MixORE is a two-phase framework designed to address the challenge of Open Relation Extraction in realistic scenarios where novel relations are mixed within unlabeled data. The first phase employs a Semantic Autoencoder (SAE) to detect potential novel relations by identifying instances with high reconstruction errors, generating weak labels for these instances. The second phase implements an open-world semi-supervised joint learning approach that combines known relation classification with novel relation clustering, enhanced by contrastive learning to progressively refine the model's understanding of both relation types. This unified approach allows MixORE to handle the coexistence of known and novel relations without requiring pre-divided datasets, making it more applicable to real-world scenarios where novel relations appear arbitrarily within unlabeled data.

## Key Results
- Achieves F1 scores of 0.8328, 0.8833, and 0.9156 on FewRel, TACRED, and Re-TACRED datasets for known relations
- Achieves B3 F1 scores of 0.9585, 0.8973, and 0.9779 for novel relations on the same datasets
- Consistently outperforms competitive baselines in both known relation classification and novel relation clustering tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its two-phase approach that first identifies novel relations through reconstruction errors using a Semantic Autoencoder, then jointly learns both known and novel relations through semi-supervised learning with contrastive objectives. The Semantic Autoencoder can effectively distinguish novel relations from known ones by leveraging the reconstruction error patterns, while the contrastive learning component helps the model better understand the semantic boundaries between different relations, both known and novel.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic Autoencoder (SAE)**: A neural network architecture that learns to reconstruct input data, where high reconstruction errors indicate novel or out-of-distribution instances; needed to identify potential novel relations without labeled data, quick check: verify reconstruction error distributions differ significantly between known and novel relations.
- **Contrastive Learning**: A training approach that learns representations by contrasting similar and dissimilar pairs, pulling similar instances closer while pushing dissimilar ones apart; needed to refine relation representations and improve clustering quality, quick check: measure embedding similarity distributions before and after contrastive training.
- **Open-World Learning**: A learning paradigm that handles both known and unknown classes simultaneously, unlike closed-world settings that assume all classes are known during training; needed to address the coexistence of known and novel relations in real-world data, quick check: validate model performance degrades gracefully when novel relations are introduced.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> Semantic Autoencoder (Relation Detection) -> Weak Label Generation -> Semi-Supervised Joint Learning (Known Classification + Novel Clustering) -> Contrastive Learning Refinement -> Output

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from input data through the Semantic Autoencoder for relation detection, then through the semi-supervised joint learning framework with contrastive refinement, as this sequence enables both novel relation discovery and known relation classification.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for accuracy by using a two-phase approach rather than a single unified model, which increases training time but enables more effective handling of both known and novel relations. The Semantic Autoencoder adds overhead for relation detection but provides more accurate weak labels compared to heuristic-based approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when novel relations have semantic similarities to known relations (confusing the SAE), when the unlabeled data contains significant noise or ambiguity, or when the dataset size is too small for effective contrastive learning. The model may also struggle with highly imbalanced distributions between known and novel relations.
