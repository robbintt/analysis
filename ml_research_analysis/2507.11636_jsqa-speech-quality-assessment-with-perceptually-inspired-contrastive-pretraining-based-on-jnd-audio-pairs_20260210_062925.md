# JSQA: Speech Quality Assessment with Perceptually-Inspired Contrastive Pretraining Based on JND Audio Pairs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.11636
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11636
- Authors: Junyi Fan; Donald Williamson
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: JSQA achieves 18% lower RMSE and 15% higher PCC than training from scratch for speech quality assessment

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces JSQA, a two-stage framework for speech quality assessment (SQA) that leverages perceptually-guided contrastive pretraining. The method addresses the challenge of limited labeled SQA data by pretraining an audio encoder using just noticeable difference (JND) pairs generated from clean speech and background noise. The framework demonstrates significant improvements over training from scratch, achieving 18% reduction in RMSE and 19% reduction in MAE while increasing Pearson correlation coefficient by 15% and Spearman correlation coefficient by 17%.

## Method Summary
JSQA employs a two-stage training approach for speech quality assessment. First, it pretrains an audio encoder using contrastive learning on JND pairs - audio samples that are perceptually indistinguishable from each other. These pairs are generated by adding background noise to clean speech at different signal-to-noise ratios within the just noticeable difference range. In the second stage, the pretrained encoder is fine-tuned for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction using limited labeled data. The method uses HuBERT as the base encoder, processes 30-second audio clips, and incorporates a dropout rate of 0.1 to prevent overfitting during fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- JSQA achieves 18% reduction in RMSE and 19% reduction in MAE compared to training from scratch
- Pearson correlation coefficient increases by 15% and Spearman correlation coefficient by 17%
- The model remains compact with only 26M parameters and requires 33GB of pretraining data
- Perceptually-pretrained model outperforms the same network trained from scratch on the NISQA test set

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The JSQA framework works by leveraging perceptual similarity information during pretraining. By training on JND pairs - audio samples that are just barely distinguishable to human listeners - the model learns to focus on perceptually relevant features rather than artifacts that humans don't notice. This perceptual guidance helps the model develop better representations for speech quality assessment, which transfers effectively to the downstream MOS prediction task. The contrastive pretraining objective ensures that perceptually similar audio pairs have similar embeddings, while dissimilar pairs are pushed apart, creating a representation space that aligns with human perception.

## Foundational Learning

**Contrastive Learning**: A self-supervised learning approach that trains models to distinguish between similar and dissimilar pairs of data points. Why needed: Enables learning meaningful representations without labels. Quick check: Verify model pulls similar samples together and pushes dissimilar samples apart in embedding space.

**Just Noticeable Difference (JND)**: The smallest change in a stimulus that can be detected by a human observer. Why needed: Provides perceptual ground truth for pretraining. Quick check: Confirm noise levels stay within perceptual thresholds using established psychoacoustic models.

**Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: The ratio of signal power to noise power, usually expressed in decibels. Why needed: Controls the perceptual similarity of JND pairs. Quick check: Validate SNR calculations produce expected perceptual differences.

**HuBERT Architecture**: A self-supervised speech representation model that uses masked prediction objectives. Why needed: Provides strong audio representations for downstream tasks. Quick check: Ensure HuBERT layers are properly initialized and frozen during pretraining.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Clean speech -> Noise addition (controlled SNR) -> JND pair generation -> HuBERT encoder -> Contrastive loss -> Pretrained encoder -> MOS prediction head -> SQA output

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are the JND pair generation process and the contrastive pretraining stage. The quality of JND pairs directly determines how well the model learns perceptually meaningful representations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational cost of pretraining on synthetic JND pairs for improved performance on limited labeled SQA data. The choice of HuBERT as the base encoder balances representation quality with model size.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may result from JND pairs that aren't truly perceptually similar, insufficient diversity in pretraining noise types, or inadequate fine-tuning on the target MOS prediction task.

**First Experiments**:
1. Generate JND pairs at varying SNR ranges to find optimal perceptual thresholds
2. Train with different noise types to assess generalization
3. Compare contrastive pretraining with supervised pretraining on limited labeled data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the JSQA framework maintain performance when applied to non-additive distortions such as codec artifacts or room reverberation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 5: "We will... investigate whether the current framework works well beyond additive noise."
- Why unresolved: The current methodology generates JND pairs exclusively by adding background noise at different SNRs, leaving the efficacy of this perceptual pretraining strategy untested for complex, non-linear, or convolutional distortions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results benchmarking JSQA on datasets containing codec degradations (e.g., TCD-VoIP) or reverberant speech (e.g., ReverbMC), showing correlation metrics comparable to the additive noise results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the model's performance scale relative to large self-supervised models when the volume of pretraining data is significantly increased?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 notes: "In the future, we may further extend the scale of the experiments, like the size of the training data to investigate how it compares with other models on similar scales."
- Why unresolved: The current study uses only 33GB of data (0.5% of wav2vec 2.0's pretraining data), leaving the potential benefits of larger-scale perceptual pretraining unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study tracking Pearson and Spearman correlation improvements as the JND pretraining dataset scales from 33GB to sizes comparable to modern self-supervised speech models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does incorporating a wider variety of background noise types during pretraining improve the model's generalization to unseen acoustic environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list "consider additional noise types" as a specific objective for future work in Section 5.
- Why unresolved: The pretraining relies solely on CHiME-3 noise, which may introduce a domain bias that limits robustness when assessing speech quality in environments with different acoustic characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies showing performance deltas on the NISQA test set when pretraining noise sources are expanded to include diverse datasets (e.g., AudioSet, DEMAND) versus the CHiME-3 baseline.

## Limitations

- Relies on synthetic JND pairs that may not capture the full complexity of real-world perceptual differences
- Performance improvements, while significant, still leave room for enhancement in absolute performance metrics
- Computational efficiency during inference is not thoroughly examined despite claims of model compactness

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The effectiveness of contrastive pretraining using JND pairs for improving MOS prediction performance is well-supported by experimental results and ablation studies.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that perceptual pretraining specifically contributes more to SQA than general audio pretraining is supported by comparative experiments, though the relative contribution could benefit from more extensive ablation.

**Medium Confidence**: The assertion that the model remains compact while achieving significant improvements is supported by parameter counts, though computational efficiency during inference is not thoroughly examined.

## Next Checks

1. Test the JSQA model on out-of-domain speech quality datasets (different languages, accents, or real-world degradation types) to assess generalization beyond synthetic noise conditions.

2. Conduct a comprehensive ablation study varying the number and quality of JND pairs used in pretraining to determine the optimal pretraining strategy.

3. Evaluate the model's performance when pretrained on real human-perceived difference pairs (rather than synthetically generated JND pairs) to validate whether the perceptual guidance is as effective as claimed.
