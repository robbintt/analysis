# Histogram-based Parameter-efficient Tuning for Passive Sonar Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.15214
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15214
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Achieves 91.8% accuracy on VTUAD dataset versus 89.8% for adapters

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a histogram-based parameter-efficient tuning (HPT) method for passive sonar classification that captures feature distributions through specialized histogram layers. The approach provides an alternative to conventional adapter-based methods by incorporating distribution-aware tuning that better preserves semantic relationships between features. HPT demonstrates improved performance on three underwater acoustic datasets while using fewer parameters than traditional fine-tuning approaches.

## Method Summary
The HPT method employs histogram layers that capture and utilize the distributional properties of feature representations during transfer learning. Unlike conventional adapters that apply simple linear transformations, HPT constructs histograms of feature activations across different layers of a pretrained model. These histograms encode the statistical distribution of features, enabling more informed parameter updates during adaptation. The method integrates these histogram layers into the model architecture, allowing for distribution-aware tuning that maintains semantic relationships between features while reducing the total number of parameters that need to be trained.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91.8% accuracy on VTUAD dataset versus 89.8% for conventional adapters
- Demonstrates faster convergence compared to adapter-based methods
- Shows better feature space alignment with fully fine-tuned models according to layer-wise similarity analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HPT captures the statistical distribution of features rather than just their individual values, enabling more informed parameter updates during transfer learning. By encoding distributional properties through histogram layers, the method preserves semantic relationships between features while reducing parameter count. This distribution-aware approach allows for more efficient use of limited training data by focusing on the most relevant statistical patterns in the feature space.

## Foundational Learning
- **Feature Distribution Analysis**: Understanding how features are distributed across the model's representation space; needed to capture statistical patterns that inform parameter updates; quick check: verify histogram layer captures meaningful statistical variations in features
- **Parameter-efficient Transfer Learning**: Techniques for adapting pretrained models with minimal parameter updates; needed to reduce computational cost while maintaining performance; quick check: confirm parameter savings compared to full fine-tuning
- **Semantic Feature Relationships**: Preserving meaningful connections between features during adaptation; needed to maintain model performance on target tasks; quick check: validate that semantic relationships are preserved through distribution encoding

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Feature Extractor -> Histogram Layer -> Parameter Update -> Output

**Critical Path**: The histogram layer serves as the core innovation, transforming raw feature distributions into parameters for efficient tuning. This layer sits between feature extraction and parameter update stages, acting as a bridge that encodes distributional information.

**Design Tradeoffs**: HPT trades computational overhead from histogram computation against reduced parameter count and improved performance. The method balances distribution capture fidelity with computational efficiency, potentially introducing latency that must be weighed against accuracy gains.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate inadequate histogram resolution, leading to loss of critical distributional information. Alternatively, overfitting to histogram statistics rather than true feature patterns could degrade generalization. Failure to capture meaningful distributional differences between classes would also manifest as reduced accuracy.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate HPT against conventional adapters on VTUAD dataset
2. Parameter efficiency test: Measure parameter count reduction versus full fine-tuning
3. Convergence analysis: Compare training dynamics and convergence speed against adapter methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions for future research.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to underwater acoustic datasets; performance on other domains untested
- Improvement margin over adapters is incremental (1-2% accuracy) rather than revolutionary
- Histogram layer introduces additional computational overhead compared to simpler adapter architectures

## Confidence
- HPT outperforms conventional adapters on underwater acoustic datasets: High
- HPT achieves faster convergence: Medium
- HPT provides better feature space alignment: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test HPT on non-acoustic domains to assess generalizability beyond underwater sound classification
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of individual histogram layer components to overall performance
3. Evaluate HPT's robustness to dataset size variations, particularly on smaller datasets where parameter efficiency is most critical
