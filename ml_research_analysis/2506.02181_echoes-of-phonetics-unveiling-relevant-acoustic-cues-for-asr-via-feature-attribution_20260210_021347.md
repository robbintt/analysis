# Echoes of Phonetics: Unveiling Relevant Acoustic Cues for ASR via Feature Attribution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02181
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02181
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: ASR model relies on vowels' full time spans and formants, with greater emphasis in male speech and less on cues when they are less distinctive.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates which acoustic cues a modern Conformer-based ASR model relies on by applying feature attribution analysis to plosives, fricatives, and vowels. The study uses SPES (Saliency Perturbation for Explanation of Spectrograms) to identify which acoustic properties—like formants for vowels, spectral peaks for fricatives, and burst characteristics for plosives—are most important for model predictions. Results show the model heavily relies on vowels' full time spans and their first two formants, with greater emphasis in male speech. For fricatives, it focuses more on well-defined spectral cues in sibilants than non-sibilants. In plosives, it prioritizes the release phase and burst characteristics. These findings reveal that the model aligns with human speech perception patterns but relies less on cues when they are less distinctive, highlighting potential robustness gaps.

## Method Summary
The study applies SPES feature attribution to a 12-layer Conformer encoder + 6-layer Transformer decoder ASR model trained on CommonVoice, LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM v3, and VoxPopuli. Input features are 80-channel log mel-filterbanks (25ms windows, 10ms stride) with CMVN normalization and 4× downsampling via 1D conv layers. SPES runs for 20,000 iterations with 0.5 masking probability, retaining the top 3% salient elements. Analysis is performed on TIMIT SX subset (3,150 utterances), focusing only on error-free predictions (2,191 sentences). Time coverage (TC) and spectral match (SM) metrics quantify model attention to phoneme time spans and formant/spectral peak alignment respectively.

## Key Results
- Model attends to nearly 100% of vowel duration, prioritizing release phases over closures in plosives, and shows variable attention to fricatives based on spectral distinctiveness.
- Spectral match scores are high for F1/F2 in vowels (avg. 68-74%) and sibilant fricatives (48-76%), but low for non-sibilants (8-29%) and labial plosives (22-48%).
- SM scores for vowel F1/F2 are consistently lower for female speakers across most vowels, with stronger formant-saliency alignment for male speech.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The ASR model allocates attention proportionally to acoustic information density within phoneme time spans.
- Mechanism: Time coverage (TC) scores show the model attends to nearly 100% of vowel duration (rich in formant information), prioritizes plosive release phases over closures (which are often silent), and shows variable attention to fricatives based on their spectral distinctiveness.
- Core assumption: Saliency maps derived from perturbation-based attribution reflect actual model decision-making rather than artifacts of the explanation method.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "model heavily relies on vowels' full time spans... for plosives, it prioritizes the release phase and burst characteristics"
  - [section 4.1] "For vowels, the TC scores are highly concentrated near 100%... closure tends to have lower TC scores than release"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; related work (Trinh & Mandel 2021, referenced in paper) shows similar high-energy region focus in neural models.
- Break condition: If saliency maps don't generalize to other attribution methods (e.g., integrated gradients), this pattern may be SPES-specific.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The model's frequency-domain reliance correlates with spectral cue distinctiveness, matching human speech perception patterns.
- Mechanism: Spectral match (SM) scores are high for F1/F2 in vowels (avg. 68-74%) and sibilant fricatives (48-76%), but low for non-sibilants (8-29%) and labial plosives (22-48%), indicating the model depends more on well-defined acoustic cues and struggles when cues are diffuse.
- Core assumption: Assumption: Lower SM scores for less distinctive phonemes reflect compensatory processing rather than attribution method limitations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "focuses more on well-defined spectral cues in sibilants than non-sibilants"
  - [section 4.2] "sibilants consistently yield higher scores... non-sibilant fricatives lack clear peaks in their saliency distributions"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus corroboration for this specific finding; neighboring papers focus on prosody/speaker identity, not spectral cue analysis.
- Break condition: If model performance on non-sibilants and labial plosives is equivalent to sibilants/alveolars, low SM may indicate attribution noise rather than genuine processing differences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Gender-based differences in saliency alignment suggest the model encodes male speech patterns more effectively.
- Mechanism: SM scores for vowel F1/F2 are consistently lower for female speakers across most vowels, with formant-saliency alignment stronger for male speech despite similar overall WER.
- Core assumption: Assumption: Lower spectral alignment reflects representational bias rather than attribution sensitivity to fundamental frequency differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "greater emphasis in male speech"
  - [section 4.2] "SM scores for F1 and F2 are consistently lower for women... the model more effectively captures acoustic patterns in vowels produced by men"
  - [corpus] Attanasio et al. (EMNLP 2024, cited as [37]) documents gender performance gaps in multilingual ASR models.
- Break condition: If formant extraction parameters (different ceilings for M/F) introduced measurement bias rather than model bias.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Acoustic phonetics (formants, spectral peaks, burst characteristics)
  - Why needed here: Understanding what F1-F4 represent, why sibilants have defined spectral peaks, and what burst characteristics are is essential to interpret SM scores and saliency distributions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why F1 and F2 are more important than F3/F4 for vowel identification?

- Concept: Perturbation-based feature attribution
  - Why needed here: SPES works by masking spectrogram clusters and measuring output change; understanding this helps interpret what saliency scores actually represent.
  - Quick check question: How does perturbation-based attribution differ from gradient-based methods like integrated gradients?

- Concept: Mel-spectrogram representation
  - Why needed here: The model operates on 80-channel mel-filterbanks; saliency maps are in this domain, not raw audio, affecting which cues can be analyzed.
  - Quick check question: Why might mel-scale frequency resolution affect saliency alignment for high-frequency cues like fricative spectral peaks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input features → encoder → CTC/attention heads → decoder tokens → SPES perturbation loop (20K iterations) → saliency map → binary threshold (top 3%)
- Critical path: Input features → encoder → CTC/attention heads → decoder tokens → SPES perturbation loop (20K iterations) → saliency map → binary threshold (top 3%)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - 3% threshold chosen via manual inspection; higher thresholds include noise, lower thresholds miss cues
  - Token-to-phoneme alignment uses max-pooling across subword tokens, which may smooth over phoneme-specific saliency
  - Analysis restricted to error-free predictions (2,191/3,150 utterances) to avoid alignment noise but excludes failure mode analysis
- Failure signatures:
  - Non-sibilant fricatives (/f/, /v/, /T/, /D/): Low SM (8-29%), diffuse saliency—model may use non-spectral cues or context
  - Labial plosives (/p/, /b/): Low burst SM (22-48%) despite high release TC—spectral cues less distinctive
  - Close vowels (/i/, /u/, /1/, /0/): Lower F1 alignment—possible F0/F1 confusion in high-pitched or close vowel contexts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate SPES on same checkpoint with alternative thresholds (1%, 5%) to verify robustness of TC/SM patterns
  2. Apply SPES to a different Conformer checkpoint (e.g., different random seed or training data mix) to assess attribution consistency
  3. Analyze failed predictions (the excluded 960 utterances) to determine if low SM phonemes correlate with errors on non-sibilants and labial plosives

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Do the observed gender-related differences in saliency alignment (e.g., lower alignment for female vowels) correlate with gender-based performance gaps in ASR?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 4.2 that "Future research could investigate whether gender-related differences in saliency maps align with observed gender performance gaps in ASR."
  - Why unresolved: The study identifies that spectral match scores are consistently lower for women than men for vowels, but it does not measure if this discrepancy causes higher Word Error Rates (WER) for female speakers.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A correlation analysis between the spectral match scores (alignment) and WER across male and female speakers in the same dataset.

- Question: What specific compensatory mechanisms does the model activate when distinctive acoustic cues are absent, such as in non-sibilant fricatives?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 4.2, regarding non-sibilant fricatives lacking dominant frequency ranges, the authors note "it may activate compensatory mechanisms that warrant further investigation."
  - Why unresolved: The analysis shows low saliency in the spectral peaks for non-sibilants, implying the model ignores standard cues, but the paper does not identify what alternative features or contexts the model relies upon instead.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Extending the attribution analysis to contextual frames (coarticulation) or temporal dynamics to identify which non-spectral features drive the prediction of non-sibilants.

- Question: Are these acoustic cue alignment findings generalizable to other ASR architectures (e.g., Transducers) and languages other than English?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section states that "the generalizability of our findings to other models and languages requires verification."
  - Why unresolved: The experiment is restricted to a single Conformer-based encoder-decoder architecture and the English language (using the TIMIT dataset), leaving the behavior of other systems unknown.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the SPES attribution methodology on diverse architectures (e.g., Whisper, Wav2Vec 2.0) and across phonetically distinct languages (e.g., tonal languages).

## Limitations

- Single model dependency: All findings are derived from one Conformer checkpoint trained on specific datasets, limiting generalizability to other architectures or training regimes.
- Attribution method constraints: SPES relies on perturbation-based saliency, which may not capture all model decision pathways, and the 3% threshold is manually determined.
- Error case exclusion: By analyzing only error-free predictions, the study cannot characterize model behavior on challenging inputs where robustness gaps might be most pronounced.

## Confidence

- High: The model relies on vowels' full time spans and their first two formants, with greater emphasis in male speech.
- Medium: The model focuses more on well-defined spectral cues in sibilants than non-sibilants.
- Medium: Gender-based differences in saliency alignment indicate encoding bias.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate SPES with alternative attribution methods (e.g., integrated gradients) on the same model to verify TC/SM patterns are not SPES-specific artifacts.
2. Analyze the excluded 960 error-containing utterances to determine if low SM phonemes (non-sibilants, labial plosives) correlate with higher error rates.
3. Apply SPES to a different Conformer checkpoint or architecture (e.g., RNN-T) to assess whether TC/SM patterns generalize beyond the original model.
