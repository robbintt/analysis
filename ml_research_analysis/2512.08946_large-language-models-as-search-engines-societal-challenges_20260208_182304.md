# Large Language Models as Search Engines: Societal Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08946
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08946
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: The paper identifies 15 societal challenges arising from LLMs replacing search engines, focusing on Content Creators, End Users, LLM Providers, and Society, with novel risks including Web "cannibalization" and bias amplification.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically examines the societal challenges that arise when Large Language Models replace traditional search engines. The authors identify 15 distinct challenges across four actor categories - Content Creators, End Users, LLM Providers, and Society - including copyright infringement, content cannibalization, bias amplification, overreliance on AI answers, and environmental impact. They propose mitigation strategies spanning technical solutions (opt-out mechanisms, watermarking, differential privacy), legal frameworks (AI Act, GDPR), and user education (LLM literacy). The most novel and concerning risk identified is the potential Web "cannibalization," where LLMs could reduce content creation incentives, threatening both the Web ecosystem and the LLMs themselves.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a qualitative synthesis approach, drawing from 32 references including technical papers, legal frameworks, and news articles. The authors categorize risks into 15 specific challenge types across four actor groups, supported by concrete examples from existing literature and case studies. The methodology involves literature review, legal analysis, and systematic categorization rather than empirical experimentation or quantitative risk modeling.

## Key Results
- Identification of 15 societal challenges from LLMs replacing search engines across four actor categories
- Novel risk of Web "cannibalization" where reduced content creation could starve LLMs of training data
- Analysis of legal frameworks (AI Act, GDPR) and technical mitigations (RAG, differential privacy) for identified risks
- Emphasis on LLM literacy as critical for users to navigate AI-generated content safely

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Web Content Cannibalization
- **Claim:** LLMs replacing search engines could reduce incentives for content creation, potentially harming both the Web and LLMs.
- **Mechanism:** Users get direct answers from LLMs -> Traffic to original content creators declines -> Ad revenue, donations, and paywall subscriptions for creators decline -> Incentives to produce new, high-quality content diminish -> LLMs have less fresh human data for training and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -> The quality of LLM outputs may degrade or stagnate.
- **Core assumption:** A significant portion of content creation is sustained by traffic-driven revenue or recognition, which is disrupted when an intermediary (the LLM) synthesizes the answer instead of referring the user.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: Identifies "potential Web 'cannibalization,' where LLMs could reduce content creation incentives, threatening both the Web and LLMs themselves."
  - [section 3.3]: "This, in turn, may remove any incentive for them to produce any content at all... This, in turn, would starve the LLMs that feed on that content, and lead to an implosion of both the Web and the LLMs."
  - [corpus]: Corpus evidence is weak; related papers on "LLM vs Search" focus on learning tensions, not the economic cannibalization mechanism.
- **Break condition:** A sustainable exchange of value (e.g., monetary compensation, prominent attribution that drives traffic) is established between LLM providers and content creators.

### Mechanism 2: Bias Amplification Loop
- **Claim:** LLMs risk mirroring and amplifying societal biases present in their training corpora.
- **Mechanism:** LLM is trained on vast, uncurated Web data containing hate speech, stereotypes, and misinformation (e.g., Common Crawl) -> The model learns and internalizes these statistical patterns -> It generates outputs that reflect or amplify these biases -> Users are exposed to skewed or discriminatory information, reinforcing societal inequalities.
- **Core assumption:** The training data is not neutral but reflects historical and systemic biases, and the model's objective (predicting the next word) causes it to reproduce these patterns faithfully.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 6.1]: "The danger is that the LLM thus mirrors mainly whatever content is found on the Web... an LLM can absorb these opinions and reflect them in its answers, which in turn might amplify stereotypes and discrimination for the End User."
  - [section 6.1, Example 6]: Provides a concrete example of ChatGPT using gendered language (e.g., "expert" for men, "beauty" for women).
  - [corpus]: "Social and Political Framing in Search Engine Results" supports the broader concept of bias in information systems, though not the LLM-specific training mechanism.
- **Break condition:** LLM developers implement effective bias mitigation techniques during training (e.g., data filtering) or inference (e.g., fairness-guided prompting).

### Mechanism 3: Intellectual Impoverishment via Cognitive Offloading
- **Claim:** Overreliance on LLMs for answers can lead to a decline in critical thinking and learning.
- **Mechanism:** An LLM provides a synthesized, authoritative-sounding answer to a user's query -> The user accepts the answer without the cognitive effort of searching, comparing multiple sources, and synthesizing the information themselves -> Long-term, this lack of practice reduces the user's ability to critically evaluate information and perform complex tasks independently.
- **Core assumption:** The act of information seeking and synthesis is a critical exercise for developing and maintaining cognitive skills, which is bypassed by the LLM's direct answer.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.2.1]: "LLMs give a processed answer to the user, which discourages the user from looking up different sources... the use of LLMs could thus result in a dip in critical thinking skills."
  - [section 4.2.1]: "Using LLMs increases productivity and performance, but once LLMs are taken away, LLM users perform worse on text generation tasks than those who didn't have access to an LLM."
  - [corpus]: "Mitigating Societal Cognitive Overload..." discusses cognitive load in the AI age, providing a related conceptual anchor.
- **Break condition:** Users develop strong "LLM literacy," treating model outputs as starting points for verification rather than final answers.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **Why needed here:** It is the primary technical mitigation for hallucinations and the "source barrier" problem. The paper notes it allows models to cite sources, though imperfectly.
- **Quick check question:** How does appending retrieved documents to a prompt before generation affect the model's ability to provide a verifiable citation versus a standard language model?

**Concept: The EU AI Act (General Purpose AI Models)**
- **Why needed here:** This is the key regulatory framework cited for obligations around transparency, copyright compliance, and risk mitigation for "systemic risk" models.
- **Quick check question:** According to the paper, what are the specific transparency obligations for a "general purpose AI model" under the AI Act, and what triggers the "systemic risk" classification?

**Concept: Model Collapse**
- **Why needed here:** This is a critical failure mode where training on LLM-generated data degrades model quality, directly related to the content cannibalization risk.
- **Quick check question:** What happens to the quality and diversity of a language model's output if it is iteratively trained on a corpus increasingly composed of text generated by other language models?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Content Creators -> Produce web text/data.
LLM Developer -> (Architecture Design + Corpus Collection + Training + Pre-prompt Design) = Trained LLM.
LLM Provider -> Deploys the LLM via interface/app.
End User -> Sends Prompt -> LLM -> Generates Answer.
Regulatory Bodies -> (e.g., EU) Impose rules on Provider/Developer.

**Critical path (for LLM-as-Search-Engine risk):**
1. **Data:** LLM Developer crawls web content (risk: ingesting copyrighted/biased/personal data).
2. **Training:** Model learns patterns from data (risk: memorization, absorbing bias).
3. **Deployment:** LLM Provider offers access (risk: jailbreak, privacy leak from user prompts).
4. **Usage:** User asks query -> Model synthesizes answer from training/RAG (risk: hallucination, no attribution).
5. **Systemic Effect:** User traffic shifts from Content Creators to LLM Provider (risk: Web cannibalization, content creator de-incentivization).

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Privacy vs. Utility:** Applying differential privacy to training can protect personal data but may reduce model accuracy (Section 3.4.1).
- **Performance vs. Environment:** The "bigger is better" paradigm improves capability but has a massive and growing carbon footprint (Section 6.3).
- **Openness vs. Security:** Releasing model details aids research but can empower malicious actors for jailbreaking or data poisoning.

**Failure signatures:**
- **Verbatim Regurgitation:** Model outputs large, copyrighted text blocks, signaling over-memorization (e.g., NYT lawsuit example).
- **Jailbreak via Prompt Injection:** A cleverly crafted user prompt bypasses safety pre-prompts, causing the model to emit harmful content.
- **Degraded Output Diversity:** Model outputs become homogenized and less creative, a symptom of training on synthetic data or model collapse.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **RAG Attribution Audit:** Implement a RAG pipeline and measure its citation accuracy. Prompt the model with queries whose answers are known to be behind paywalls and verify if it respects copyright or attempts to paraphrase restricted content.
2. **Jailbreak Robustness Testing:** Systematically apply a suite of known jailbreak prompts (e.g., "Do-Anything-Now") against the model's safety filters to quantify the attack surface.
3. **Bias Benchmarking:** Probe the model with the gender and political bias examples from the paper (Section 6.1) and measure if the outputs still reflect the described stereotypes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- **Question:** How can a scalable and equitable compensation mechanism be established for Content Creators in the LLM ecosystem?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 3.2 states, "the problem of how to remunerate Content Creators in the LLM ecosystem remains open."
- **Why unresolved:** Current licensing deals are limited to large publishers and do not cover small creators or real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) usage.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A functional technical-legal prototype (e.g., a micropayment system or adaptation of the Brave browser model) that tracks content usage in answers and distributes revenue without requiring individual contracts for every creator.

**Open Question 2**
- **Question:** Will the replacement of search engines by LLMs cause a "cannibalization" of the Web that leads to model collapse?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 3.3 notes, "It is too early to judge whether this cannibalization will come about, and whether it will be catastrophic or not."
- **Why unresolved:** The feedback loop is speculative: if LLMs divert traffic, creators may stop producing content, which would eventually starve the LLMs of training data, but this dynamic has not yet fully played out.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal data showing a causal link between decreased Web traffic to creators and a measurable subsequent drop in the quality or freshness of LLM outputs.

**Open Question 3**
- **Question:** How should legal liability be assigned for "careless speech" or harmful outputs generated by LLMs?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 5.1 notes that current laws are unadapted and it "took courts over a decade to define the appropriate contours of liability for search engines."
- **Why unresolved:** Providers currently disclaim liability in terms of of service, but this may conflict with user safety expectations, leaving a gap in accountability for systematic defamation or dangerous advice.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** New jurisprudence or regulatory frameworks (such as the EU AI Act Code of Practice) that clearly define the boundary between user responsibility and provider negligence for AI-generated content.

## Limitations
- Qualitative synthesis approach without quantitative risk modeling or empirical validation of identified challenges
- Many examples cited are dated or may have been patched in current LLM versions, making reproducibility difficult
- Web cannibalization mechanism lacks empirical evidence of scale or economic impact
- Assumes LLMs will directly replace search engines, which remains a contested future scenario

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Legal framework analysis (AI Act, GDPR) and technical mitigation strategies (RAG, differential privacy) are well-grounded in established literature
- **Medium confidence:** Bias amplification and intellectual impoverishment mechanisms are supported by multiple references and logical reasoning, though empirical validation is limited
- **Low confidence:** Web cannibalization scenario is the most speculative claim, relying on economic assumptions about content creator incentives that haven't been empirically measured in the LLM era

## Next Checks
1. **Economic Impact Audit:** Survey content creators across different verticals (news, tutorials, academic) to quantify traffic loss and revenue impact from LLM usage versus traditional search
2. **Model Collapse Experiment:** Iteratively train a small language model on increasingly synthetic data (starting with human-written text, then adding LLM-generated text) to empirically measure degradation in output quality and diversity
3. **Bias Persistence Test:** Reproduce the specific gender and political bias examples from the paper on current production LLM models to determine if described biases persist or have been mitigated through recent training/fine-tuning approaches
