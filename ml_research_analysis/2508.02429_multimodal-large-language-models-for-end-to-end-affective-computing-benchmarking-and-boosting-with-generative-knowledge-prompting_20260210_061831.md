# Multimodal Large Language Models for End-to-End Affective Computing: Benchmarking and Boosting with Generative Knowledge Prompting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.02429
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02429
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: MLLMs show significant performance variability across affective computing tasks; generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning improves accuracy and F1 scores, especially in multi-class classification

## Executive Summary
This paper benchmarks state-of-the-art open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on six datasets covering sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and humor detection. The evaluation reveals significant performance variability across tasks and datasets when compared to traditional methods. To address performance gaps, the authors propose a hybrid approach combining generative knowledge prompting—using zero-shot extraction of audio/video descriptions—with supervised fine-tuning. This strategy yields notable improvements in accuracy and F1 scores across multiple tasks, particularly for multi-class classification. The study also provides insights into the influence of dataset balance and modality dominance, with text generally proving most effective.

## Method Summary
The authors benchmark open-source MLLMs on six multimodal affective computing datasets spanning sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and humor detection. They compare MLLM performance with traditional methods and observe substantial variability across tasks. To boost performance, they propose a hybrid approach that combines generative knowledge prompting—using zero-shot extraction of audio and video descriptions—with supervised fine-tuning. This method aims to leverage the generative capabilities of MLLMs to extract richer contextual information from multimodal inputs, thereby improving classification accuracy and F1 scores across multiple affective computing tasks.

## Key Results
- MLLMs exhibit significant performance variability across the six affective computing datasets
- Generative knowledge prompting combined with supervised fine-tuning improves accuracy and F1 scores across tasks
- Text modality is generally most effective, with dataset balance and modality dominance influencing overall performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the generative capabilities of MLLMs to extract detailed audio and video descriptions in a zero-shot manner, enriching the contextual information available for affective computing tasks. By combining this extracted knowledge with supervised fine-tuning, the model learns to better integrate multimodal cues, leading to improved classification performance. The hybrid strategy effectively bridges the gap between raw multimodal inputs and high-level semantic understanding required for tasks like sentiment analysis and emotion recognition.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal fusion strategies** (why needed: to integrate diverse input modalities; quick check: evaluate fusion effectiveness via ablation)
- **Generative knowledge extraction** (why needed: to enrich context from audio/video; quick check: compare with baseline feature extraction)
- **Supervised fine-tuning** (why needed: to adapt pre-trained MLLMs to specific tasks; quick check: assess overfitting via validation curves)
- **Dataset balancing** (why needed: to prevent class bias; quick check: compare performance on balanced vs. imbalanced splits)
- **Modality dominance analysis** (why needed: to identify most informative inputs; quick check: measure performance when modalities are isolated)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Modalities -> Generative Knowledge Extraction -> Feature Fusion -> Supervised Fine-tuning -> Output Classification

**Critical Path**: Generative knowledge extraction from audio/video → Multimodal feature fusion → Supervised fine-tuning → Classification

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach balances zero-shot knowledge extraction (flexible but potentially noisy) with supervised fine-tuning (task-specific but data-hungry). Modality dominance and dataset balance are key considerations affecting performance.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on underrepresented classes, failure to integrate multimodal cues, overfitting on small datasets, and sensitivity to noisy or ambiguous audio/video descriptions.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate performance of each modality (text, audio, video) in isolation to identify modality dominance
2. Conduct ablation study removing generative knowledge extraction to measure its contribution
3. Test supervised fine-tuning with varying dataset sizes to assess data efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance claims are based on six datasets without explicit discussion of their relative sizes or representativeness
- Lack of detailed error analysis to explain modality dominance or failure modes
- Ablation studies do not explore prompt engineering variations or model hyperparameters

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: MLLM performance varies significantly across affective computing tasks
- **Medium confidence**: Generative knowledge prompting improves accuracy and F1 scores, but lacks statistical significance testing
- **Medium confidence**: Text modality is most effective, though confounding factors like dataset imbalance are not fully ruled out

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive error analysis to identify failure modes, especially for underrepresented classes
2. Perform statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests) on reported performance improvements
3. Evaluate approach robustness on additional datasets with varying domain characteristics and class distributions
