# From Representation to Enactment: The ABC Framework of the Translating Mind

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16811
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16811
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Proposes a non-representational ABC framework modeling translation as enactive process integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions through predictive processing and active inference

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the ABC framework (Affective-Behavioral-Cognitive) for understanding translation as an enactive process rather than symbolic manipulation. Drawing on predictive processing and active inference, the framework positions translation as dynamic brain-body-environment interaction where affect regulates precision, behavior executes routines, and cognition maintains belief states. The authors illustrate their approach through simulation of translation strategies, comparing linear and reverse-order approaches using entropy reduction dynamics. Key findings show that affective states modulate precision weighting, influencing decision-making and strategy selection, while behavioral correlates include gaze patterns and typing dynamics. The model challenges classical cognitivism by positioning translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice.

## Method Summary
The authors simulate translation decision-making using an enactive inference model structured as a hierarchical Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The model includes two levels (word and chunk) and an affective layer that modulates precision to regulate the balance between epistemic (information-seeking) and pragmatic (action-executing) policies. Using a single sentence segment decomposed into 4 English chunks and 6 candidate Japanese translations, they compare "head-starter" and "large-context planner" strategies by tuning precision parameters. The simulation aims to reproduce behavioral patterns (OHRF states: Orientation, Hesitation, Revision, Flow) and entropy reduction curves observed in human translation process data, though the exact parameterization of POMDP matrices remains unspecified in the current paper.

## Key Results
- Affective states regulate how strongly prediction errors influence behavior by modulating precision weights across the ABC hierarchy
- Translators reduce uncertainty through two complementary strategies: head-starters resolve entropy through action (incremental typing), while large-context planners resolve entropy through model refinement (pre-comprehension before production)
- The ABC layers self-organize through reciprocal message passing, where activity at one level modulates readiness, salience, and action tendencies at other levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Affective Precision Modulation
Affective states regulate how strongly prediction errors influence behavior by modulating precision (confidence) weights across the ABC hierarchy. When affective states encode high precision in predictions (calm/confident), prediction errors are dampened, promoting stable behavioral routines. When affect encodes low precision (anxious/uncertain), sensory errors amplify, triggering re-evaluation and information-seeking. Core assumption: Affect functions as a domain-general precision-tuning mechanism rather than merely representing emotional content. Break condition: If experimental manipulations of translator affect show no measurable effect on decision speed, revision rates, or entropy trajectories, precision-modulation claims are falsified.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Message Passing Across ABC Layers
The ABC layers self-organize through reciprocal message passing, where activity at one level modulates readiness, salience, and action tendencies at other levels. Behavioral patterns embody priors, cognitive layer maintains belief states and reorganizes coupling when routines fail, and affective layer provides precision-weighted signals that bias which predictions dominate. These messages continuously minimize free energy across the nested Markov blanket structure. Core assumption: ABC layers are sufficiently coupled that interventions at one layer propagate to others; the system maintains integrity through nested Markov blankets. Break condition: If perturbations to one layer show no measurable effects on cognitive/affective measures, or if layers can be shown to operate independently with no cross-influence, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3: Entropy Reduction via Action vs. Model Refinement (Two Translation Strategies)
Translators reduce uncertainty through two complementary strategies: head-starters resolve entropy through action (incremental typing), while large-context planners resolve entropy through model refinement (pre-comprehension before production). For head-starters, placing a chunk translation immediately drops entropy but risks later revision. For large-context planners, entropy drops before action through scanning, enabling stable predictions at higher memory cost. Precision modulation biases which strategy dominates—high precision on sensory-action loops favors head-starting; high precision on model-based priors favors planning. Core assumption: The head-starter vs. large-context planner distinction reflects a continuum of precision assignment rather than categorical types. Break condition: If keystroke/gaze data show no systematic entropy reduction patterns as translators advance through chunks, or if strategy assignment shows no correlation with precision-weighting manipulations, the mechanism is challenged.

## Foundational Learning

- **Predictive Processing / Active Inference**: The entire ABC framework rests on PP's core idea that brains minimize prediction error (free energy) through perception-action loops. Without this, the precision-modulation and entropy-reduction mechanisms are unintelligible. Quick check: Can you explain why "action" in active inference changes the environment and thus enables perception, rather than being merely output?

- **Extended Mind (Three Waves) + Enactivism**: The paper explicitly positions ABC as "third-wave" enactivist, rejecting representationalism. Understanding the move from parity → complementarity → dynamic entanglement clarifies why "mind" is emergent rather than located. Quick check: What is the Dynamic Entanglement Thesis (DEUTS), and why does it reject the "fixed-properties view" of internal vs. external elements?

- **Markov Blankets**: Markov blankets define system boundaries (internal vs. external states, mediated by sensory/active states) and enable hierarchical nesting of ABC layers. This is the formal architecture underlying message passing. Quick check: In Figure 2, what four state types compose the closed perception–action loop, and how do they separate internal ABC states from the environment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Internal States (Affective: precision/evaluative, Behavioral: action/sensation routines, Cognitive: belief-updating, sense-making) -> External States (Source text, target text, tools, dictionaries, cultural norms) -> Sensory States (Input from environment: text on screen, fuzzy matches, feedback) -> Active States (Motor output: typing, gaze shifts, resource consultation) -> Boundary (Markov blanket separating internal from external; nested MBs within ABC layers)

- **Critical path**: Orientation phase → Translator scans ST, calibrates precision, establishes provisional expectations (affective-behavioral-cognitive reconfiguration) → Production phase → Behavioral routines (typing/gaze) execute; prediction errors generated when ST/TT mismatch expectations → Regulation phase → Affective precision-modulation determines whether errors are ignored (high precision on predictions) or trigger re-evaluation (low precision) → Reorganization phase → Cognitive layer updates beliefs, potentially consulting resources or revising TT; new action-perception loop begins

- **Design tradeoffs**: Head-starter strategy: Faster throughput, lower initial memory load, higher revision risk. Good for routine texts. Large-context planner strategy: Slower onset, higher memory load, fewer revisions, more coherent TT. Good for complex reordering or high-stakes texts. Precision tuning: High precision on predictions = efficient but rigid; low precision = exploratory but slower. Context-dependent optimal settings.

- **Failure signatures**: Decoupled layers: If affective states do not modulate precision (e.g., translator ignores anxiety signals), behavioral routines may persist despite prediction errors → maladaptive perseveration. Stuck in orientation: Excessive information-seeking without production → precision chronically low on predictions, high on sensory evidence. Fluent but wrong: High precision on predictions + low-quality priors → confident errors, no revision. Revision spirals: Excessive re-evaluation without stabilization → precision never consolidates.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Precision-modulation validation: Induce affective states (confidence vs. anxiety via feedback manipulation) and measure effects on decision speed, revision rates, and entropy trajectories in keystroke/gaze data. 2) Strategy classification replication: Classify translators as head-starters vs. large-context planners using orientation duration and chunk-order entropy reduction; validate against behavioral markers (pause patterns, revision frequency). 3) Layer-interaction perturbation: Impose motor constraints (e.g., delayed keystroke feedback) and measure whether cognitive/affective markers shift, testing whether message passing across layers is observable.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does the ABC framework account for lexical selection ambiguity, which was excluded in the current simulation? The current model only simulates syntactic reordering; real-world translation involves resolving high lexical entropy (choosing between synonymous or culturally distinct alternatives) which the present enactive simulation does not address. What evidence would resolve it: An updated simulation where candidates vary lexically, correlated with human data showing how affective precision modulates lexical uncertainty reduction.

- **Open Question 2**: Do affective states (e.g., stress, confidence) causally modulate precision weighting in behavioral policies, as the framework claims? While the paper theoretically links affect to precision (confidence dampens error signals; anxiety amplifies them), it acknowledges the need for empirical verification to establish scientific credibility. What evidence would resolve it: Experimental manipulation of translator affect (e.g., time pressure, emotional texts) combined with analysis of changes in decision speed and policy selection.

- **Open Question 3**: Can the interaction between the ABC layers be empirically observed as a unified system in real-time translation? The paper illustrates the layers separately (simulation for behavior/cognition, theoretical description for affect) but lacks a comprehensive model showing their simultaneous, dynamic coupling during a task. What evidence would resolve it: Multi-modal data collection (e.g., physiological sensors for affect, eye-tracking for behavior, and concurrent verbalization for cognition) analyzed to test for the predicted reciprocal message passing.

## Limitations
- The precision-modulation hypothesis lacks direct experimental evidence from translation process data, relying instead on theoretical analogies to predictive processing
- The simulation of translation strategies uses a single sentence example without systematic validation against larger human data sets
- The distinction between head-starters and large-context planners may represent a continuum rather than discrete types, though the framework currently treats them categorically

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The general move from representationalism to enactivism in translation studies is well-supported and aligns with broader cognitive science trends. The hierarchical structure of ABC layers reflects established psychological distinctions.
- **Medium confidence**: The precision-modulation mechanism as domain-general affect-regulation has theoretical support from predictive processing literature but lacks direct translation-specific evidence. The simulation demonstrates conceptual feasibility but not empirical validity.
- **Low confidence**: The specific entropy reduction patterns for head-starter vs. large-context planner strategies are based on limited examples and require systematic validation. The nested Markov blanket implementation details remain underspecified.

## Next Checks
1. **Precision-modulation validation**: Manipulate translator affective states (stress/confidence induction) and measure effects on decision speed, revision rates, and entropy trajectories in keystroke/gaze data to test whether affect genuinely modulates precision-weighted prediction errors.
2. **Strategy classification replication**: Use larger translation process corpora to systematically classify translators as head-starters vs. large-context planners based on orientation duration and chunk-order entropy reduction patterns, validating against behavioral markers like pause patterns and revision frequency.
3. **Layer-interaction perturbation**: Conduct experimental manipulations that constrain one ABC layer (e.g., motor constraints on typing or sensory manipulations) and measure cascading effects on cognitive and affective measures to test whether message passing across layers is empirically observable.
