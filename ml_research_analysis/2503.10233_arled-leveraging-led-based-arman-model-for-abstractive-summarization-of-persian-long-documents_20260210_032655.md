# ARLED: Leveraging LED-based ARMAN Model for Abstractive Summarization of Persian Long Documents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.10233
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10233
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Novel ARLED model achieves F1 score of 0.734 on Persian long document summarization, outperforming ARMAN and competing with ChatGPT

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ARLED, a novel abstractive summarization model for Persian long documents that combines the ARMAN and LED architectures. ARMAN performs semantic sentence selection and reordering, while LED handles long text sequences efficiently using the Longformer. The authors constructed a new dataset of 300,000 Persian research papers from Ensani.ir and fine-tuned their model using it. Experimental results show that ARLED outperforms the original ARMAN model and is competitive with ChatGPT, achieving precision of 0.752, recall of 0.716, and F1 score of 0.734. These results demonstrate ARLED's effectiveness in generating informative, concise summaries for Persian long texts, addressing the gap in Persian abstractive summarization for lengthy documents.

## Method Summary
The ARLED model is a fusion of ARMAN and LED architectures, designed specifically for Persian long document summarization. The LED encoder uses Longformer attention to process up to 8192-token input sequences, while ARMAN's pre-trained weights provide semantic sentence selection capabilities. The model is trained on a newly constructed dataset of 300,000 Persian research papers from Ensani.ir, with abstracts serving as reference summaries. Training uses Hugging Face's Seq2SeqTrainer with Adafactor optimizer, gradient checkpointing, and a batch size of 1 due to memory constraints. The model generates summaries using beam search with beam size of 2, and performance is evaluated using BERTScore metrics (Precision, Recall, F1).

## Key Results
- ARLED achieves F1 score of 0.734 on the Persian long document summarization task
- Outperforms original ARMAN model across all evaluation metrics (Precision: 0.752 vs 0.724, Recall: 0.716 vs 0.684)
- Competitive with ChatGPT while being specifically optimized for Persian language and long documents
- Demonstrates effectiveness of combining semantic selection (ARMAN) with long-range attention (LED)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ARLED works by addressing two key challenges in long document summarization: handling extended context and maintaining semantic coherence. The LED encoder's sparse attention mechanism (Longformer) allows processing of 8192 tokens efficiently, overcoming the quadratic complexity limitation of standard transformers. ARMAN's pre-trained weights contribute semantic understanding and sentence selection capabilities, enabling the model to identify and prioritize important information. The decoder then generates coherent summaries that preserve the key points from the lengthy input. This combination allows ARLED to maintain context over long distances while producing semantically meaningful summaries specific to the Persian language and academic domain.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transformer Attention Mechanisms**: Why needed - Standard self-attention scales quadratically with input length, making it infeasible for long documents; Quick check - Can you explain why the computational cost of standard self-attention scales quadratically with input length?
- **Encoder-Decoder (Seq2Seq) Models**: Why needed - Summarization is framed as sequence-to-sequence generation requiring understanding of encoder (input processing) and decoder (summary generation) roles; Quick check - In the LED model, which part uses the Longformer attention pattern—the encoder, the decoder, or both?
- **Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning**: Why needed - The entire ARLED approach relies on adapting pre-trained models (ARMAN, LED) to a specific task with new data; Quick check - Why is it more effective to start with a pre-trained model like ARLED instead of training a summarization model from scratch on the Ensani.ir dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Data Preprocessing Pipeline (crawling, PDF-to-text, cleaning) -> ARLED Model (LED Encoder with ARMAN weights -> LED Decoder)
- **Critical path**: The interaction between LED encoder's long-range attention and domain-specific knowledge from Ensani.ir dataset is most critical for performance
- **Design tradeoffs**: Memory vs. Sequence Length (8192-token limit requires gradient checkpointing and batch size=1, slowing training); Pre-trained vs. Custom Data (leverage existing models vs. potential task-specific optimization)
- **Failure signatures**: OOM errors with increased input length or batch size; Hallucination (generating factually incorrect information); Loss of Detail (overly generic summaries)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline Validation: Run inference with pre-trained ARMAN and LED models; 2) Ablation Study on Input Length: Train with different max lengths (1024, 4096, 8192); 3) Comparison with ChatGPT: Use same BERTScore metrics for fair comparison

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How effectively can the ARLED architecture be adapted for abstractive summarization of long documents in other non-English languages?
- To what extent do the high BERTScore metrics correlate with human judgments of fluency and factual consistency?
- How does the model's performance vary when applied to Persian text domains outside of academic research papers?
- Does the ARLED model outperform other sparse-attention architectures like BigBird or ETC specifically for Persian summarization?

## Limitations
- Lack of complete architectural specification for how ARMAN and LED components are integrated
- Problematic comparison with ChatGPT using different evaluation metrics
- Dataset construction lacks detail about filtering criteria beyond token counts
- Missing comparisons to other established long-document models like LongT5 or Longformer2Seq

## Confidence
- **High Confidence** in technical approach and dataset creation
- **Medium Confidence** in experimental results due to unclear architectural integration
- **Low Confidence** in claimed novelty and state-of-the-art positioning without comprehensive comparisons

## Next Checks
1. Request or reconstruct exact model architecture specification showing how ARMAN weights are integrated into LED framework
2. Implement comprehensive comparison including ARLED, LED-only, LongT5, and Longformer2Seq on same dataset with identical BERTScore evaluation
3. Re-run ChatGPT comparison using BERTScore on same test set for fair, apples-to-apples comparison of summary quality
