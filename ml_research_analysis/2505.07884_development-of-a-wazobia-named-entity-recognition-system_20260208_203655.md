# Development of a WAZOBIA-Named Entity Recognition System

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.07884
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07884
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Developed NER system for Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo with Precision 0.9511, Recall 0.9400, F1-Score 0.9564, Accuracy 0.9301

## Executive Summary
This paper presents WAZOBIA-NER, a Named Entity Recognition system for three major Nigerian languages: Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. The system addresses the lack of NER tools for under-resourced African languages by compiling annotated datasets and training machine learning models including Conditional Random Fields, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks, and BERT-RNN. The system supports both text and image inputs through OCR integration. Evaluation across the three languages demonstrates robust performance, establishing a foundation for further development of NLP tools for African languages.

## Method Summary
The system uses 20 annotated news articles per language (60 total) with 80:20 train-test split. Three models were compared: CRF, BiLSTM, and BERT fine-tuned with RNN. Preprocessing included tokenization, normalization, and punctuation removal. Word2Vec embeddings and POS tagging were used as features. OCR (Tesseract) enabled image input processing. The BERT-RNN architecture achieved the best results, leveraging transfer learning from multilingual transformers to overcome data scarcity. Python 3.8, Flask, NLTK, SpaCy, and SQLite were used for implementation.

## Key Results
- Achieved Precision 0.9511, Recall 0.9400, F1-Score 0.9564 across all three languages
- BERT-RNN model outperformed CRF and BiLSTM baselines
- System successfully handles both text and image inputs via OCR integration
- Demonstrated that robust NER tools for under-resourced African languages are achievable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Fine-tuning multilingual transformers (BERT) with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) likely bridges the data scarcity gap for Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.
- **Mechanism:** The system leverages pre-trained linguistic representations from BERT, which contain generalized structural knowledge, and specializes them using a task-specific RNN layer. This allows the model to achieve high performance even with a relatively small, curated dataset (20 articles per language) by transferring learned features rather than learning from scratch.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-trained BERT model possesses sufficient embedded knowledge of the target languages' structures to be effectively fine-tuned, despite these languages being "under-resourced."
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] Mentions "Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (Bert) and fine-tune with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)."
  - [conclusion] States "integration of BERT and RNN... achieved substantial improvements."
  - [corpus] "Revisiting Projection-based Data Transfer..." confirms data-based transfer methods are effective for low-resource NER.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Utilizing BiLSTM allows the system to capture bidirectional context, improving entity boundary detection.
- **Mechanism:** By processing text in both forward and backward directions, the BiLSTM layer accesses both past and future input features simultaneously. This reduces ambiguity in entity classification compared to unidirectional models or simple CRFs.
- **Core assumption:** Named entities in these languages rely on local sequential context that can be captured by the LSTM gates.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3] Describes "Deep Learning advanced models like Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)... for better multilingual entity recognition support."
  - [corpus] "OpenNER 1.0" discusses standardizing datasets which enables such models to be benchmarked effectively across languages.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** OCR integration extends system utility by converting non-digital text sources into processable inputs.
- **Mechanism:** Tesseract OCR transforms textual images into machine-readable strings, which are then normalized and fed into the NER pipeline. This creates an end-to-end extraction capability for physical documents.
- **Core assumption:** The OCR engine (Tesseract) is sufficiently accurate for the specific scripts of Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo; OCR noise does not significantly degrade downstream NER performance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The system utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert textual images..."
  - [section 3.2] Lists "Tesseract is an OCR tool... suitable for languages."
  - [corpus] Evidence is weak/missing regarding Tesseract's specific efficacy on these languages in the provided neighbors, though "Noise-Aware Named Entity Recognition" suggests OCR noise is a common challenge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core task—locating and classifying named entities (Persons, Organizations, Locations) in text.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between "Lagos" (Location) and "Lagos Food Bank" (Organization) in a raw text string?

- **Concept: Transfer Learning**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on this to overcome the "under-resourced" nature of the target languages. Understanding how a pre-trained model (BERT) adapts to a new task is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** Explain why a model pre-trained on English might still provide a useful starting point for Nigerian languages.

- **Concept: Feature Engineering (Word Embeddings & POS Tagging)**
  - **Why needed here:** The architecture explicitly extracts "Word Embedding" and "POS Tagging" before feeding data into the models.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would knowing the Part-of-Speech (e.g., Noun vs. Verb) help a computer decide if a word is a named entity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - User Interface (Text/Image input) -> OCR (Tesseract) if image -> Tokenization -> Normalization -> Punctuation Removal -> Word2Vec Embeddings -> POS Tagging -> CRF | BiLSTM | BERT-RNN -> Entity Disambiguation -> Database Storage

- **Critical path:** The **Data Annotation** and **Fine-tuning** phase. The paper notes that 20 articles per language were manually annotated. The model's high precision (0.9511) is contingent on this specific dataset quality. If the incoming data drifts from this "news article" domain, performance is predicted to drop.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **CRF vs. Deep Learning:** CRFs are faster and simpler but may miss complex contextual relationships compared to BiLSTM/BERT.
  - **Dataset Size:** Using only 20 articles per language allows for rapid prototyping but risks overfitting compared to the larger datasets mentioned in [corpus] neighbors like "OpenNER."

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Entity Ambiguity:** The system struggles to differentiate "Lagos" (Location) from "Lagos Food Bank" (Organization) without robust post-processing.
  - **OCR Noise:** If input images are blurry, Tesseract errors propagate through the NER model, resulting in "UNK" (unknown) tokens or misclassified entities.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Train a CRF model on the 20-article dataset to establish a baseline Precision/Recall against the paper's reported 0.93/0.94 metrics.
  2. **Ablation Study:** Remove the OCR component and test raw text inputs to isolate the performance degradation caused by OCR noise.
  3. **Cross-Language Stress Test:** Feed the Hausa model Yoruba text (and vice versa) to verify the language-specific adaptability of the fine-tuned BERT-RNN and confirm the system is not merely memorizing cross-lingual loanwords.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** How does the WAZOBIA-NER system perform when applied to domain-specific texts, such as legal, health, or agricultural documents, compared to the general news articles used in training?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The abstract states the work lays the foundation to "incorporate more domain-specific data (e.g., legal, health, education, Agriculture)."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study utilized a dataset derived primarily from "online news articles, journals, and academic papers," leaving robustness in specialized technical domains untested.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation of the trained models on annotated corpora specifically from the legal, health, and agricultural sectors in Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba.

- **Open Question 2:** To what extent does the small size of the training dataset (20 articles per language) affect the model's ability to generalize to the diverse linguistic structures of Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 3.1 states that "A total of 20 articles were selected for each of the languages," which is a very low-resource sample for training deep learning models like BiLSTM and BERT-RNN.
  - **Why unresolved:** The reported high performance (0.9564 F1-score) may reflect overfitting to the limited vocabulary of the 60 total articles rather than true language understanding, a common issue in low-resource NLP.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Cross-validation results using a significantly larger corpus or an ablation study showing performance curves as dataset size increases.

- **Open Question 3:** Does the system exhibit significant performance disparities across the three languages (Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba) despite the aggregated high accuracy?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The Results section provides aggregate metrics (Precision 0.9511, etc.) but does not provide a breakdown of F1-scores for each specific language.
  - **Why unresolved:** Aggregated scores can mask poor performance on one language (e.g., due to morphological complexity) if another language performs exceptionally well, hiding potential bias in the "Wazobia" model.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A detailed classification report presenting precision, recall, and F1-scores separately for Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba test sets.

## Limitations
- **Dataset Dependency:** High performance based on only 20 manually annotated articles per language raises overfitting concerns and limits generalization to diverse domains or informal language use.
- **OCR Integration Risk:** Lack of empirical validation for Tesseract's accuracy on Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo scripts creates uncertainty about OCR's impact on NER performance, especially with noisy inputs.
- **Hyperparameter Ambiguity:** Critical model configurations (learning rate, batch size, optimizer, BERT variant, RNN architecture) are unspecified, hindering reproducibility and understanding of performance improvements.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The paper's core claim that transfer learning (BERT fine-tuning) is effective for low-resource NER is supported by the broader literature on multilingual transformers and the reported high performance metrics.
- **Medium Confidence:** The integration of OCR is a practical extension, but its effectiveness for the specific scripts and languages in question is uncertain without empirical validation.
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the model to diverse text domains and the robustness of the system to OCR noise are questionable due to the small dataset size and lack of domain diversity in training data.

## Next Checks
1. **OCR Accuracy Assessment:** Evaluate Tesseract's standalone performance on Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo textual images before integrating it into the NER pipeline to isolate OCR's impact on downstream accuracy.
2. **Cross-Domain Performance Test:** Assess the model's performance on a different text domain (e.g., social media posts, legal documents) to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the news article domain used in training.
3. **Ablation Study on Data Size:** Train the BERT-RNN model on incrementally larger subsets of the dataset (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20 articles per language) to quantify the impact of dataset size on performance and identify potential overfitting.
