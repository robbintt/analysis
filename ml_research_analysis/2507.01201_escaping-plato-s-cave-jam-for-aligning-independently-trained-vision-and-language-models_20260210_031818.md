# Escaping Plato's Cave: JAM for Aligning Independently Trained Vision and Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.01201
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01201
- Authors: Lauren Hyoseo Yoon; Yisong Yue; Been Kim
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces JAM, a method for aligning frozen independently trained vision and language models, demonstrating superior performance with multimodal Spread Loss over contrastive methods

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the fundamental challenge of aligning independently trained vision and language models that occupy disjoint representational spaces despite the Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggesting convergence toward shared statistical models of reality. The authors focus on fine-grained contextual distinctions where multiple descriptions share global semantics but differ in subtle compositional details. To address this, they introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM), which aligns frozen unimodal models by jointly training modality-specific autoencoders with coordinated reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. Their approach systematically evaluates JAM across three design axes: alignment objectives (introducing multimodal Spread Loss that outperforms classic contrastive methods), optimal layer depth for alignment, and the role of foundation model scale in representational convergence.

## Method Summary
The Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) is a novel approach for aligning frozen, independently trained vision and language models by jointly training modality-specific autoencoders with coordinated reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. JAM leverages a multimodal Spread Loss that outperforms classic contrastive methods for fine-grained alignment tasks. The method systematically evaluates alignment effectiveness across different layer depths and foundation model scales, demonstrating that JAM can reliably induce alignment between unimodal representations even when trained independently on separate datasets.

## Key Results
- JAM successfully aligns independently trained vision and language models through joint autoencoder training
- Multimodal Spread Loss consistently outperforms baseline contrastive methods across fine-grained vision-language reasoning tasks
- Optimal alignment occurs at specific layer depths, with foundation model scale playing a crucial role in representational convergence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
JAM works by training modality-specific autoencoders jointly while enforcing cross-modal alignment through a novel multimodal Spread Loss. This approach enables the alignment of frozen, independently trained models by creating a shared representational space that preserves fine-grained semantic distinctions. The joint training process allows for coordinated reconstruction across modalities while the Spread Loss specifically addresses the challenge of distinguishing between representations that share global semantics but differ in subtle compositional details.

## Foundational Learning

### Contrastive Learning
- Why needed: Understanding the baseline alignment methods that JAM improves upon
- Quick check: Review standard contrastive loss formulations and their limitations for fine-grained alignment

### Autoencoder Architectures
- Why needed: JAM builds on autoencoder principles for modality-specific feature reconstruction
- Quick check: Examine standard autoencoder objectives and how they're adapted for cross-modal scenarios

### Multimodal Representation Learning
- Why needed: JAM operates in the space of aligning vision and language representations
- Quick check: Review current state-of-the-art in multimodal representation learning and the challenges of cross-modal alignment

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Frozen Vision Model -> Vision Autoencoder -> Shared Representation Space <- Language Autoencoder <- Frozen Language Model

### Critical Path
Input (Vision/Text) → Frozen Backbone → Autoencoder → Reconstruction + Cross-modal Alignment → Output (Aligned Representation)

### Design Tradeoffs
JAM trades computational efficiency (training additional autoencoders) for the flexibility of aligning frozen, independently trained models without requiring full fine-tuning or joint pretraining from scratch.

### Failure Signatures
Alignment failure manifests as poor performance on fine-grained distinction tasks, with the model unable to differentiate between representations sharing global semantics but differing in compositional details.

### First Experiments
1. Verify baseline performance of frozen vision and language models on fine-grained distinction tasks
2. Test JAM with contrastive loss vs. Spread Loss to confirm performance differences
3. Evaluate alignment quality at different layer depths to identify optimal alignment points

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability to truly large-scale models remains uncertain, as evaluations focus on moderate-sized frozen unimodal backbones
- Layer-wise alignment findings may not fully capture complex interplay between early and late representations in deeper architectures
- Theoretical reasons for Spread Loss's consistent advantage over contrastive methods remain incompletely characterized

## Confidence

### High
- JAM successfully aligns independently trained vision and language models
- Spread Loss outperforms standard contrastive methods in fine-grained alignment tasks

### Medium
- Layer depth findings about optimal alignment points
- Foundation model scale effects on convergence

### Low
- Theoretical explanations for Spread Loss performance
- Scalability to largest foundation models

## Next Checks

1. Test JAM's performance when applied to state-of-the-art large-scale frozen vision and language models (e.g., CLIP ViT-L/14, GPT-4V) to verify scalability claims

2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the individual contributions of reconstruction loss versus cross-modal alignment loss in the joint autoencoder objective

3. Evaluate JAM's alignment quality on out-of-distribution datasets and under distribution shift to test robustness beyond the studied benchmarks
