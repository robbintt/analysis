# Narrative Consolidation: Formulating a New Task for Unifying Multi-Perspective Accounts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.18041
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18041
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: TAEG guarantees perfect temporal ordering (Kendall's Tau = 1.000) and achieves +357.2% ROUGE-L improvement over semantic similarity baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Narrative Consolidation as a new NLP task focused on unifying multi-perspective narrative accounts into a single, chronologically coherent, and comprehensive text. Unlike standard Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) that prioritizes conciseness, Narrative Consolidation aims to capture all relevant events in their correct temporal order while selecting the most representative versions from multiple accounts. The authors propose the Temporal Alignment Event Graph (TAEG), which uses a pre-defined canonical timeline to enforce chronological order and LexRank centrality within event clusters to select representative versions. Experiments on the four Biblical Gospels demonstrate perfect temporal ordering by design and significant improvements in content quality metrics.

## Method Summary
The TAEG method builds a graph structure where nodes represent event versions from different documents, connected by BEFORE edges (intra-document temporal sequence) and SAME_EVENT edges (cross-document event alignment). The method iterates through a pre-ordered canonical timeline, applying LexRank centrality within each SAME_EVENT cluster to select the most representative version at each chronological position. This ensures perfect temporal ordering by construction while maintaining content quality through version selection. The approach is extractive-only, selecting sentences from source documents rather than generating new text.

## Key Results
- Perfect temporal ordering guaranteed by design: Kendall's Tau = 1.000
- ROUGE-L F1 score improved by +357.2% compared to semantic similarity baseline
- BERTScore F1 maintained near-perfect score (0.995)
- Method outperforms baseline in all content quality metrics while enforcing chronological integrity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Enforcing an external temporal backbone guarantees perfect chronological ordering by construction, not learning. The TAEG iterates through a pre-ordered canonical timeline T = {e₁, e₂, ..., eₘ}, selecting content at each position. Since output order is determined by iteration order over T, chronological integrity becomes an architectural invariant rather than a learned prediction. Core assumption: A reliable external timeline exists for the domain. Without this, the mechanism cannot enforce ordering.

### Mechanism 2
Repurposing LexRank from global sentence selection to local version selection dramatically improves content quality. SAME_EVENT edges create localized clusters containing all versions of a canonical event. LexRank centrality is computed within each cluster independently, selecting the most representative version rather than the most globally salient sentence. This decouples "what to include" (governed by T) from "which version" (governed by centrality). Core assumption: Event versions within a cluster are comparable and a "most representative" version exists.

### Mechanism 3
ROUGE-L gains (+357.2%) emerge from ordering alignment, not just content selection. ROUGE-L measures longest common subsequence. A correctly ordered output shares sequential structure with the reference, amplifying scores beyond what content overlap alone would produce. Chronological integrity and metric design interact synergistically. Core assumption: The golden sample reference follows the same canonical timeline T.

## Foundational Learning

- **LexRank centrality algorithm**: Core selection mechanism. Understanding how PageRank-style random walks identify central nodes is essential before repurposing for version selection. Quick check: Can you explain why a sentence connected to many semantically similar sentences receives higher LexRank score?

- **Temporal graph representations**: TAEG's dual-edge design (BEFORE + SAME_EVENT) builds on temporal graph concepts. Distinguishing learned vs. imposed temporal structure clarifies design choices. Quick check: What's the difference between a temporal graph that learns chronology vs. one that enforces it?

- **Rank correlation metrics (Kendall's Tau)**: Primary evaluation metric for temporal coherence. Interpreting τ = 1.000 vs. τ = 0.320 requires understanding ordinal association. Quick check: If Kendall's Tau = 0.5, what proportion of event pairs are correctly ordered?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Documents (D) + Canonical Timeline (T) → [Node Creation] → [Edge Construction] → [LexRank Computation] → [Sequential Selection] → Consolidated Output

- **Critical path**: Canonical timeline quality → SAME_EVENT edge accuracy → LexRank computation → Sequential iteration over T. Errors in timeline or event alignment propagate directly.

- **Design tradeoffs**: External timeline guarantees ordering but limits applicability to domains with established chronologies. Extractive only approach is reliable but cannot fuse complementary details into enriched versions. Single representative version avoids redundancy but may lose unique details from non-selected accounts.

- **Failure signatures**: Missing events in output (SAME_EVENT cluster empty), temporal violations despite TAEG (timeline T itself is incorrect), low BERTScore with high Kendall's Tau (selection mechanism choosing low-quality versions).

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Timeline degradation test: Randomly remove 10%, 20%, 30% of events from T and measure robustness
  2. Edge ablation: Run with ONLY temporal edges (no SAME_EVENT) and ONLY SAME_EVENT edges (no BEFORE)
  3. Baseline comparison with temporal MDS: Add Timeline Summarization baseline to contextualize gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the Narrative Consolidation framework be adapted to automatically induce a timeline from source documents rather than relying on a pre-defined external chronology? The current TAEG architecture functions by mapping text to a fixed set of canonical events; it does not possess a mechanism for discovering or establishing temporal order independently. Evidence: Successful implementation of TAEG that derives the temporal backbone T dynamically from D without manual annotation, while maintaining high Kendall's Tau scores.

### Open Question 2
Does the TAEG framework generalize to other multi-perspective narrative domains, such as legal testimonies or journalistic reports? The model has only been validated on the four Biblical Gospels, which possess a unique structure and specific canonical alignment. Evidence: Successful application of the proposed method on a distinct multi-document corpus (e.g., witness statements), demonstrating performance improvements over baselines.

### Open Question 3
Can the TAEG structure be effectively utilized as a backbone for abstractive neural models to generate coherent narratives rather than extracting sentences? The current study focuses on an extractive approach (LexRank centrality) to select representative sentences. Evidence: Development of a Graph Neural Network model using the TAEG structure that outputs an abstractive consolidation, evaluated against the Golden Sample with high BERTScore and temporal coherence.

### Open Question 4
How robust is the TAEG framework to incomplete or noisy temporal information in the external timeline? The current experiment assumes the availability of a perfect canonical timeline (Kendall's Tau = 1.000). Evidence: Quantitative results showing the relationship between the percentage of missing/noisy temporal links in T and the degradation of ROUGE-L and Kendall's Tau scores in the output.

## Limitations

- Domain constraint: Requires reliable external timeline, limiting applicability to domains without established chronologies
- Extractive-only approach cannot fuse complementary details into enriched versions
- Single representative version selection may lose unique details from non-selected accounts
- Validation limited to Biblical Gospels; generalization to other domains unknown

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims**:
- TAEG guarantees perfect temporal ordering by design through canonical timeline iteration
- The approach differs fundamentally from standard MDS by prioritizing comprehensiveness over conciseness
- Temporal backbone is necessary for narrative consolidation (validated by significant performance gains)

**Medium Confidence Claims**:
- LexRank centrality within SAME_EVENT clusters effectively selects representative versions
- ROUGE-L gains primarily result from ordering alignment rather than content selection
- The 357.2% ROUGE-L improvement reflects consolidation quality rather than just ordering effects

## Next Checks

1. **Timeline Degradation Analysis**: Systematically remove 10%, 20%, and 30% of events from the canonical timeline and measure performance degradation to quantify sensitivity to incomplete external knowledge.

2. **Edge Contribution Isolation**: Run experiments with only temporal edges (no SAME_EVENT) and only SAME_EVENT edges (no BEFORE) to isolate the contribution of each edge type to final quality metrics.

3. **Temporal MDS Baseline Comparison**: Implement a Timeline Summarization baseline that applies standard MDS techniques to provide context for the reported gains and validate whether improvements stem from the temporal backbone versus general MDS improvements.
