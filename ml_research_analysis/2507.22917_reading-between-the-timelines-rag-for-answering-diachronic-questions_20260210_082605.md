# Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.22917
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917
- Reference count: 40
- Standard RAG systems fail on questions requiring temporal trend analysis across extended periods.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the problem of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems failing to answer diachronic questions—those requiring analysis of trends or changes across extended time periods. Standard RAG methods focus on semantic relevance but often neglect temporal coherence, missing crucial information spread over the entire queried duration. To address this, the authors propose TA-RAG, a framework that enhances RAG with explicit temporal awareness at each stage. It disentangles query semantics from temporal constraints, employs a specialized retriever that balances semantic and temporal relevance, and structures retrieved context chronologically for coherent synthesis. To evaluate this capability, they introduce ADQAB, a benchmark for diachronic questions grounded in real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show TA-RAG significantly outperforms standard RAG, achieving up to 27% higher accuracy in answering complex, time-based questions. This work provides a validated pathway toward RAG systems capable of nuanced, evolutionary analysis for real-world queries.

## Method Summary
The authors propose TA-RAG, a framework that enhances RAG with explicit temporal awareness at each stage to handle diachronic questions. The method disentangles query semantics from temporal constraints, employs a specialized retriever that balances semantic and temporal relevance, and structures retrieved context chronologically for coherent synthesis. To evaluate this capability, they introduce ADQAB, a benchmark for diachronic questions grounded in real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show TA-RAG significantly outperforms standard RAG, achieving up to 27% higher accuracy in answering complex, time-based questions. This work provides a validated pathway toward RAG systems capable of nuanced, evolutionary analysis for real-world queries.

## Key Results
- TA-RAG achieves up to 27% higher accuracy on diachronic questions compared to standard RAG.
- The proposed ADQAB benchmark provides a challenging dataset for evaluating temporal reasoning in RAG systems.
- Chronological ordering of retrieved context is critical for coherent synthesis of diachronic information.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TA-RAG works by explicitly modeling the temporal dimension of queries and documents. It first decomposes questions into semantic and temporal components, then uses a specialized retriever that balances both semantic and temporal relevance. The retrieved documents are ordered chronologically before being passed to the LLM for generation. This approach ensures that the model considers the full temporal span of the query and can synthesize information across time periods coherently.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Diachronic Question Answering**: Understanding questions that require analysis across extended time periods is crucial for real-world applications like financial trend analysis. This is needed to move beyond simple factoid retrieval to more complex reasoning tasks. Quick check: Can the system handle questions like "How has company X's stock price changed over the past decade?"

2. **Temporal Embeddings**: Creating hypothetical temporal query embeddings by sampling different time points within the query's temporal range allows the retriever to balance semantic and temporal relevance. This is needed to overcome the limitation of standard semantic embeddings that ignore temporal context. Quick check: Does varying the granularity of temporal sampling affect retrieval precision?

3. **Chronological Context Ordering**: Sorting retrieved documents by publication date before LLM generation ensures coherent temporal synthesis. This is needed because standard RAG systems often return documents in arbitrary order, making it difficult to reason about trends over time. Quick check: Does the accuracy drop significantly if the retrieved documents are not ordered chronologically?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Question Decomposition -> Time Extraction -> Hypothetical Embedding Generation -> Temporal Interval Filtering -> Vector Retrieval -> Chronological Sorting -> LLM Generation

**Critical Path**: The most time-consuming steps are the hypothetical embedding generation (due to multiple synthetic queries) and the vector retrieval. Optimizing these steps could significantly improve inference speed.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The use of synthetic data for creating hypothetical embeddings trades off computational cost for improved temporal awareness. While this improves accuracy, it increases inference time. An alternative approach using heuristic time anchors could reduce computation but might sacrifice some accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- If the time extraction LLM fails to identify implicit dates, the interval filter will return zero documents.
- If the hypothetical embedding generation is too coarse-grained, the retriever might miss relevant documents that are temporally distant from the sampled anchors.
- If the chronological sorting is incorrect, the LLM might synthesize information incoherently.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify that the time extraction LLM can correctly identify both explicit and implicit dates in a sample of financial news articles.
2. Test the retrieval performance with varying numbers of synthetic time anchors to find the optimal balance between accuracy and speed.
3. Compare the performance of TA-RAG against standard RAG on a subset of ADQAB questions to confirm the expected accuracy improvement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness is contingent on the accuracy of the temporal extraction model, which may fail to identify implicit dates or misinterprets temporal references.
- The reliance on synthetic data augmentation for constructing hypothetical temporal embeddings introduces a dependency on the quality of synthetic queries.
- The system assumes that chronological ordering of retrieved chunks is sufficient for coherent synthesis, which may not hold for questions requiring nuanced temporal reasoning beyond simple aggregation.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core methodology of disentangling semantic and temporal query components and the empirical performance improvement on ADQAB (up to 27% accuracy gain) are well-supported by the results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The generalizability of TA-RAG to domains beyond financial news is plausible but untested; the synthetic data pipeline for creating hypothetical embeddings is described but implementation details (e.g., anchor sampling logic) are underspecified.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the robustness of the time extraction stage are limited by the lack of ablation studies isolating its impact on overall performance.

## Next Checks
1. **Temporal Extraction Coverage**: Measure the proportion of document chunks where LLaMA-3.1-7B-Instruct successfully extracts event intervals. Flag cases where extraction fails and assess their impact on retrieval completeness.
2. **Hypothetical Embedding Sampling**: Experiment with varying the number and granularity of synthetic time anchors used to construct temporal query embeddings. Evaluate whether finer temporal resolution consistently improves retrieval precision.
3. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Apply TA-RAG to a non-financial dataset (e.g., news about technology or politics) and compare performance against a standard RAG baseline to test domain robustness.
