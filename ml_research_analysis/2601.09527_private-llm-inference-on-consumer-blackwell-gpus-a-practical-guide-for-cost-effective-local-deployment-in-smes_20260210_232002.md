# Private LLM Inference on Consumer Blackwell GPUs: A Practical Guide for Cost-Effective Local Deployment in SMEs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09527
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09527
- Authors: Jonathan Knoop; Hendrik Holtmann
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Consumer Blackwell GPUs (RTX 5090) deliver 3.5-4.6x higher throughput than budget models for RAG workloads, with self-hosted inference costing 40-200x less than cloud APIs.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates whether consumer NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs can serve production LLM inference workloads for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The authors benchmark four open-weight models across 79 configurations spanning quantization formats, context lengths, and three workloads: RAG, multi-LoRA agentic serving, and high-concurrency APIs. Key findings show NVFP4 quantization provides 1.6x throughput over BF16 with only 2-4% quality loss, while context length is the primary cost driver. The RTX 5090 enables sub-second latency for interactive RAG, but budget GPUs achieve highest throughput-per-dollar for API workloads. Self-hosted inference costs $0.001-0.04 per million tokens, breaking even in under four months at moderate volume.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate four open-weight models (Qwen3-8B, Gemma3-12B, Gemma3-27B, GPT-OSS-20B) on three NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs using vLLM 0.12 with CUDA 12.9. They test four quantization formats (BF16, W4A16, NVFP4, MXFP4) across context lengths from 8k to 64k tokens, measuring throughput, latency, and energy consumption via AIPerf 0.3.0 and DCGM telemetry. The study includes three workloads: RAG with varying context lengths, multi-LoRA agentic serving with three adapter types, and high-concurrency API requests. They also validate quality degradation using MMLU, GSM8K, and HellaSwag benchmarks.

## Key Results
- RTX 5090 delivers 3.5-4.6x higher throughput than RTX 5060 Ti with 21x lower latency for RAG workloads
- NVFP4 quantization provides 1.6x throughput over BF16 with 41% energy reduction and only 2-4% quality loss
- Self-hosted inference costs $0.001-0.04 per million tokens (electricity only), 40-200x cheaper than budget-tier cloud APIs
- Hardware breaks even in under four months at moderate volume (30M tokens/day)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: NVFP4 quantization delivers 1.6× throughput over BF16 with only 2–4% quality degradation because Blackwell Tensor Cores provide native hardware acceleration for 4-bit floating-point operations.
- Mechan: Native FP4 hardware support eliminates software dequantization overhead; E2M1 representation with dual-level scaling preserves dynamic range while halving memory bandwidth requirements.
- Core assumption: Models have sufficient parameter redundancy that 4-bit precision captures >96% of representational capacity for evaluated tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "NVFP4 quantization provides 1.6× throughput over BF16 with 41% energy reduction and only 2–4% quality loss"
  - [Section 4.4, Table 7] Shows 411 TPS vs 260 TPS for BF16, with 239 vs 403 Wh/MTok energy
  - [corpus] TokenWeave paper notes distributed inference overheads up to 20%, suggesting hardware-native quantization avoids software overhead

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Context length is the primary cost driver—doubling context approximately halves throughput—because KV-cache scales linearly with sequence length and competes with model weights for limited VRAM.
- Mechan: Longer contexts require proportionally larger KV-caches, reducing available memory for batched requests. Memory bandwidth becomes the bottleneck as prefill must process more tokens sequentially before decoding begins.
- Core assumption: Workload involves meaningful context (not synthetic padding); memory bandwidth, not compute, is the limiting factor.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.6] "Doubling context length approximately halves throughput and doubles energy cost per token: 8k→16k: 1.8–2.3× energy increase"
  - [Figure 3] Shows throughput dropping from ~500 TPS (8k) to ~125 TPS (32k) on RTX 5090
  - [corpus] MatKV paper confirms "prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors" dominates RAG costs

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dual-GPU tensor parallelism helps latency-sensitive RAG workloads (11× TTFT reduction on budget GPUs) but hurts short-context agentic workloads on high-end GPUs due to synchronization overhead exceeding compute benefits.
- Mechan: Tensor parallelism partitions weight matrices across GPUs with all-reduce communication per layer. For long-context workloads, compute time dominates communication; for short-context, inter-GPU coordination costs exceed parallelism benefits.
- Core assumption: PCIe bandwidth is sufficient; workloads are compute-bound enough to amortize communication overhead.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.5] "RTX 5090 2x underperforms 1x: dual-GPU achieves lower throughput (1,492 vs. 1,683 TPS at c64) with 3.8× higher latency"
  - [Table 12] RTX 5070 Ti 2x reduces Agentic TTFT from 7,004ms to 604ms
  - [corpus] TokenWeave paper discusses compute-communication overlap techniques that could mitigate this overhead

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Quantization formats (BF16, W4A16, NVFP4, MXFP4)
  - Why needed here: Selecting the wrong format wastes either quality (over-aggressive) or memory (under-aggressive). NVFP4 requires Blackwell hardware; W4A16 is portable; MXFP4 targets cross-vendor compatibility.
  - Quick check question: If you must deploy on AMD or Intel GPUs, which quantization format should you avoid?

- Concept: KV-cache memory scaling
  - Why needed here: Context length decisions directly constrain concurrency. A 32k-context request may consume 4× the KV-cache of an 8k request, blocking other users.
  - Quick check question: For a 16GB GPU serving 8 concurrent requests, what happens to feasible context length if you switch from FP16 to FP8 KV-cache?

- Concept: Tensor parallelism vs. pipeline parallelism
  - Why needed here: vLLM recommends tensor parallelism for single-node multi-GPU because pipeline parallelism poorly suits autoregressive decoding where tokens cycle through stages.
  - Quick check question: Why does tensor parallelism achieve lower per-request latency than pipeline parallelism for LLM inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: vLLM 0.12 -> PagedAttention KV-cache -> NVFP4/W4A16 quantization -> Tensor parallelism (if dual-GPU) -> AIPerf benchmarking -> DCGM energy telemetry

- Critical path:
  1. Profile workload type (RAG vs. API vs. agentic) and latency requirements
  2. Select GPU tier based on TTFT thresholds (sub-second requires RTX 5090 for RAG)
  3. Choose quantization: NVFP4 default for Blackwell; validate quality on MMLU/GSM8K
  4. Configure context length: prefer ≤16k; use semantic chunking to avoid 32k+ costs
  5. Decide single vs. dual-GPU: dual helps budget GPUs for RAG; single preferred for API/agentic on RTX 5090

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Throughput vs. latency: Higher concurrency increases aggregate TPS but degrades per-user TTFT
  - Context vs. concurrency: Longer contexts reduce max concurrent requests due to KV-cache limits
  - Quality vs. efficiency: NVFP4 wins on throughput/energy; W4A16 preserves quality better for sensitive tasks
  - Cost vs. capability: RTX 5060 Ti offers 4,228 TPS/$1k but fails interactive RAG; RTX 5090 costs more but enables sub-second TTFT

- Failure signatures:
  - OOM errors when context length + concurrency exceeds VRAM (switch to FP8 KV-cache or reduce concurrency)
  - TTFT >10s on budget GPUs with 16k+ context (add second GPU or reduce context)
  - Throughput plateau despite increased concurrency (GPU saturated; scale horizontally or upgrade tier)
  - Quality degradation >5% on domain-specific tasks (switch from NVFP4 to W4A16 or BF16)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline throughput test: Deploy Qwen3-8B NVFP4 on target GPU with AIPerf at c32, c64, c128; measure TPS, TTFT, and Wh/MTok. Compare against Table 16 benchmarks.
  2. Context length stress test: Increment context from 8k→16k→32k at fixed concurrency (c8); identify OOM threshold and throughput cliff. Validate against Table 15.
  3. Quality validation: Run MMLU 5-shot and GSM8K on NVFP4 vs. BF16 (if memory permits); confirm degradation <4%. If unavailable, use W4A16 as quality reference.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How do comparable FP4/MXFP4 quantization formats on AMD and Intel consumer GPUs compare to NVIDIA's NVFP4 in throughput, energy efficiency, and quality preservation for LLM inference?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "Our evaluation focuses on NVIDIA consumer GPUs; while NVFP4 is Blackwell-specific, similar FP4/MXFP4 formats are emerging across vendors (AMD, Intel), and our methodology transfers directly to comparable hardware."
  - Why unresolved: The authors limited their study to NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs and did not benchmark competing vendor hardware.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Running the same 79-configuration benchmark suite on AMD Radeon and Intel Arc GPUs with their native low-precision formats, using identical models and workloads.

- Question: What quantization quality degradation occurs in domain-specific SME tasks (legal, medical, financial) beyond what standard benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, HellaSwag) capture?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "Our quality evaluation uses three standard benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, HellaSwag), which may not capture domain-specific degradation patterns."
  - Why unresolved: The authors used general-purpose benchmarks; SMEs often deploy LLMs for specialized verticals where quantization error may manifest differently.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on domain-specific benchmarks (e.g., legal contract analysis, medical QA, financial summarization) comparing BF16 baselines to NVFP4/W4A16 quantized variants.

- Question: How do cold-start effects, variable request patterns, and burst traffic impact the throughput and latency findings from synthetic steady-state benchmarks?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "We measure steady-state performance under synthetic workloads; production exhibits variable request patterns and cold-start effects."
  - Why unresolved: Production traffic is heterogeneous; the Poisson arrivals and fixed concurrency levels may not reflect real-world burstiness or model-loading delays.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking with trace-driven workloads from actual SME deployments, measuring cold-start latency and throughput under bursty arrival patterns.

## Limitations

- Limited to NVIDIA Blackwell consumer GPUs, restricting generalizability to AMD, Intel, or enterprise GPU architectures
- Quality assessment relies on standard benchmarks that may not capture domain-specific degradation patterns for specialized SME applications
- Cost analysis assumes stable electricity pricing and does not account for cooling infrastructure or GPU depreciation schedules

## Confidence

- High confidence: NVFP4 quantization performance claims and RAG workload findings for RTX 5090 are directly supported by benchmark data
- Medium confidence: Dual-GPU tensor parallelism conclusions for budget GPUs are supported, but RTX 5090 dual configuration underperformance is based on limited configuration points
- Low confidence: Extrapolations to long-term cost savings assume consistent usage patterns and do not account for hardware failures or evolving cloud pricing

## Next Checks

1. **Quality degradation validation**: Run the same NVFP4 vs. BF16 comparison on a domain-specific SME dataset (e.g., customer support tickets, technical documentation) to verify that 2-4% degradation holds for task-specific accuracy metrics beyond standard benchmarks.

2. **Real-world workload testing**: Deploy the benchmark configurations in a production SME environment with actual user traffic for 2-4 weeks, measuring sustained throughput, latency percentiles, and failure rates under concurrent multi-tenant usage patterns.

3. **Multi-node scaling validation**: Test whether the observed single-node GPU limitations (context length scaling, dual-GPU synchronization overhead) persist when using multiple physical servers connected via InfiniBand or high-speed networking, particularly for the RAG workloads that currently require RTX 5090 for sub-second latency.
