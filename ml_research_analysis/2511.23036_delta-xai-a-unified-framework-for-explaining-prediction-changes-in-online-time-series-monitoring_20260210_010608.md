## Executive Summary
Delta-XAI addresses a critical gap in XAI for online time series monitoring by explaining why predictions change between adjacent time steps rather than just attributing to single predictions. The framework adapts 14 existing XAI methods through a wrapper function that transforms single-time explanations into direct quantification of prediction changes. Building on this foundation, the authors propose SWING, an extension of Integrated Gradients that incorporates historical context through retrospective baseline selection and piecewise-linear integration paths, achieving superior faithfulness, sufficiency, and coherence across diverse clinical and activity recognition datasets.

## Method Summary
Delta-XAI introduces a wrapper function g(X) = f(X_T2) − f(X_T1) that transforms prediction-difference explanation into a single-attribution problem, theoretically decomposing attributions into components representing newest features, delayed effects, and removed features. The framework evaluates 14 existing XAI methods through this wrapper, revealing that naive subtraction fails while the wrapper preserves theoretical guarantees. SWING extends this by using retrospective baselines (immediate past windows) instead of zero baselines, and piecewise-linear historical integration paths that follow realistic feature evolution trajectories. The framework introduces comprehensive evaluation metrics including faithfulness (CPD, AUPD), sufficiency (CPP, AUPP), correlation, coherence, and efficiency, validated across MIMIC-III, PhysioNet 2019, and activity recognition datasets.

## Key Results
- SWING achieves 23.87 correlation score on MIMIC-III with LSTM backbone vs 13.73 for GradSHAP and 13.42 for IG
- Piecewise-linear integration with retrospective baselines (SWING) outperforms all 14 adapted methods on faithfulness and sufficiency metrics
- For 24-hour prediction intervals, SWING maintains performance advantage while other methods converge toward similar scores
- Computational efficiency remains comparable to baseline IG despite added complexity of piecewise integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The prediction-difference wrapper enables any single-step XAI method to explain temporal prediction changes by transforming the problem into a single-attribution problem. Theorem 1 proves that for linear and complete methods (IG, DeepLIFT, SHAP), this yields decomposition into addition of newest features, delayed effects of intermediate features, and removal of oldest features. Core assumption: The XAI method satisfies completeness and linearity. Evidence shows naive subtraction yields implausible negative correlation (-0.19) vs. wrapper (0.04).

### Mechanism 2
Retrospective baseline selection mitigates out-of-distribution artifacts from standard IG's zero baseline. Using immediate past windows (X_{T−W:T−1}) for input X_{T−W+1:T} keeps integration trajectory anchored to realistic patient states. Core assumption: Immediate past represents valid counterfactual baseline. Evidence shows zero substitution yields OOD score 0.840 vs. forward-fill 0.093. Break condition: If immediate past contains imputed/missing values.

### Mechanism 3
Piecewise-linear historical integration maintains data-manifold proximity during gradient computation. Rather than single straight path from baseline to target, PHI constructs piecewise path through intermediate historical windows, approximating actual feature evolution. Core assumption: True trajectory lies near manifold of historically observed windows. Evidence shows without PHI, AUPD drops from 50.58 to 40.85. Break condition: For very sparse time series with large gaps between observations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Integrated Gradients (IG) and line integral formulation
  - Why needed: SWING extends IG by modifying integration path; understanding base method is prerequisite
  - Quick check: Can you explain why IG satisfies completeness (attributions sum to prediction difference from baseline)?

- Concept: Out-of-distribution (OOD) effects in gradient-based attribution
  - Why needed: Core motivation is zero-baseline IG creates OOD artifacts; recognizing this is essential
  - Quick check: When computing gradients along path from zero to patient vitals, which regions are likely OOD?

- Concept: Temporal windowing in online time series models
  - Why needed: Framework assumes fixed lookback windows; understanding prediction updates as windows shift is foundational
  - Quick check: If window size W=48 and we compare T1=100 to T2=101, which time indices overlap between input windows?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Wrapper function g → RBS (baseline selection) → DPI (dual-path averaging) → PHI (piecewise path construction)
- Critical path: Implement wrapper g first (validates framework on existing methods) → Add RBS to IG → Add DPI for completeness guarantee → Add PHI for stability on large time gaps
- Design tradeoffs: PHI adds computation but improves manifold proximity; DPI doubles computation vs. single-path IG; forward-fill reduces OOD artifacts but may underestimate sparse feature importance
- Failure signatures: Negative correlation scores indicate naive subtraction without wrapper; high CPP/AUPP with low CPD/AUPD means method identifies salient features but attributions don't match prediction magnitude; runtime blowup from PHI segment count scaling with T2-T1
- First 3 experiments: 1) Replicate Table 5 comparison with Dynamask naive subtraction vs. wrapper on MIMIC-III subset 2) Ablation on baseline distance d ∈ {0,1,3,5,10} on held-out patients 3) Cross-architecture validation on both LSTM and Transformer backbones

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can XAI methods that rely on probability outputs or internal model representations be properly adapted to the prediction-difference wrapper framework without compromising theoretical guarantees? The paper notes some methods need minor adjustments but leaves specifics unspecified. What evidence would resolve it: Formal adaptation procedures for probability-dependent methods with theoretical analysis of preserved guarantees.

### Open Question 2
Can Delta-XAI framework be extended to explain prediction changes over time gaps larger than the lookback window (T₂ − T₁ ≥ W)? The problem setup restricts to T₂ − T₁ < W as larger gaps yield non-overlapping windows with no common temporal context. What evidence would resolve it: A principled extension handling non-overlapping windows via intermediate anchor points or alternative baseline selection strategies.

### Open Question 3
Does SWING's performance advantage persist for time intervals substantially longer than 24 steps, or do all methods continue to converge? Experiments only tested gaps up to 24 steps; behavior at longer horizons remains unexplored. What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation across extended time gaps (48, 72, 100 steps) showing whether SWING maintains advantages or alternative approaches become preferable.

## Limitations
- Theoretical foundation applies rigorously only to linear and complete methods; non-linear methods' guarantees under wrapper function remain unproven
- RBS baseline selection assumes immediate past windows are representative and valid, which may not hold for highly irregular time series with missing observations
- PHI's piecewise-linear integration assumes historical windows represent true trajectory of feature evolution, potentially violated by non-smooth temporal dynamics or large time gaps

## Confidence

**Confidence: Medium** - Theoretical foundation sound for linear and complete methods, but Theorem 1's applicability to non-linear XAI methods not rigorously proven. The wrapper function approach assumes valid transformation of prediction-difference explanation into single-attribution problem under specific completeness and linearity assumptions.

**Confidence: Medium** - RBS baseline selection assumes immediate past windows are representative and valid, but this may not hold for highly irregular time series with missing observations or sudden physiological transitions.

**Confidence: Low** - PHI's piecewise-linear integration assumes historical windows represent true trajectory of feature evolution, but this may be violated in cases of non-smooth temporal dynamics or when T2-T1 gaps are large relative to underlying physiological processes.

## Next Checks

1. **Wrapper Method Robustness Test**: Apply Delta-XAI wrapper to non-complete XAI methods (e.g., LIME, GradCAM) and verify whether Theorem 1's decomposition properties still hold, documenting any violations of faithfulness or sufficiency metrics.

2. **Baseline Quality Assessment**: For datasets with known irregular sampling patterns, systematically evaluate how RBS performance varies with baseline window quality, particularly comparing forward-fill imputation against other imputation strategies for missing retrospective data.

3. **PHI Segment Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct controlled experiments varying the number of PHI segments and window shift parameters across datasets with different temporal resolutions to identify optimal configuration ranges and failure modes for sparse vs. dense time series.
