# Interpret Policies in Deep Reinforcement Learning using SILVER with RL-Guided Labeling: A Model-level Approach to High-dimensional and Multi-action Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19244
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19244
- Reference count: 40
- Method extends SILVER to high-dimensional, multi-action RL environments using RL policy outputs for boundary point labeling

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an extension of the SILVER method for interpreting deep reinforcement learning policies in complex, high-dimensional environments with multiple discrete actions. The approach addresses a key limitation of the original SILVER method, which was restricted to binary action spaces. By leveraging trained RL policies to label boundary points in feature space and using SHAP analysis on compact state representations, the method enables the use of interpretable models like decision trees and logistic regression to explain policies in visually complex environments such as Atari games. Human subject evaluations demonstrate that these interpretable models significantly improve user understanding and trust in RL policies compared to the original black-box networks.

## Method Summary
SILVER with RL-guided labeling extends the original SILVER method by incorporating the trained RL policy's output to label boundary points in high-dimensional state spaces. The approach first compresses the state representation using feature extraction techniques, then applies SHAP analysis to identify important features. Instead of using the original method's boundary point sampling for binary actions, the RL policy's predicted action probabilities are used to assign labels to boundary points, enabling multi-action interpretation. This allows the construction of interpretable surrogate models (decision trees, logistic regression) that maintain high fidelity to the original RL policy while providing transparent decision boundaries. The method is evaluated on Atari games (MsPacman, RoadRunner) using DQN, PPO, and A2C algorithms.

## Key Results
- SILVER with RL-guided labeling achieved task performance close to original RL policies while providing interpretable explanations
- Human-subject study showed significantly improved policy comprehension and trust compared to black-box RL policies
- Decision trees provided the clearest explanations among interpretable model types, with high fidelity scores across evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the trained RL policy's action probabilities as labels for boundary points in feature space, effectively bridging the gap between the original SILVER method's binary action limitation and real-world multi-action environments. By using SHAP analysis on compact state features, the approach identifies the most influential factors in decision-making while maintaining computational efficiency. The RL policy serves as an oracle for labeling, ensuring that the interpretable surrogate models learn from high-quality examples that reflect the true policy behavior. This creates a pipeline where complex visual inputs are transformed into interpretable decision structures without sacrificing task performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **SHAP analysis**: Required for identifying important features in compressed state representations; quick check involves verifying SHAP values correctly rank feature importance
- **Decision tree learning**: Needed for constructing interpretable models; quick check involves validating tree depth and accuracy on labeled boundary points
- **RL policy inference**: Essential for generating action labels from boundary points; quick check involves confirming policy outputs match expected behavior
- **Feature compression**: Critical for handling high-dimensional inputs; quick check involves validating compressed features retain decision-relevant information
- **Boundary point sampling**: Required for identifying decision boundaries; quick check involves verifying sample distribution covers relevant state space
- **Multi-class labeling**: Needed for extending beyond binary actions; quick check involves confirming correct label assignment across all action classes

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: State Compression -> SHAP Analysis -> Boundary Point Generation -> RL Policy Labeling -> Interpretable Model Training -> Fidelity Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The method follows a sequential pipeline where state compression reduces dimensionality, SHAP identifies important features, boundary points are generated and labeled using the RL policy, and interpretable models are trained on these labeled examples. Performance is then validated through task completion and human evaluation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational overhead (SHAP analysis + RL inference) for interpretability and user trust. While decision trees offer clarity, they may sacrifice some fidelity compared to more complex models. The method assumes the RL policy is well-trained and generalizes properly to boundary points.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor SHAP analysis may lead to missing important features, causing interpretable models to miss key decision factors. If the RL policy is not well-trained, boundary point labeling will be incorrect, propagating errors to the interpretable model. Overly aggressive feature compression may lose critical information needed for accurate interpretation.

**First Experiments**: 1) Validate SHAP analysis on compressed features from Atari game states; 2) Test RL policy labeling accuracy on sampled boundary points; 3) Compare decision tree vs logistic regression fidelity on multi-action labeling tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions, focusing instead on demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach for the specific Atari game environments tested.

## Limitations
- Computational overhead from SHAP analysis and RL policy inference may limit scalability to more complex environments
- Reliance on decision tree and logistic regression models may constrain explanation fidelity in highly non-linear scenarios
- Evaluation on only two Atari games may not generalize to other domains with different state representations

## Confidence
- Task performance claims: High (directly measured against standard RL benchmarks)
- Interpretability claims: Medium (based on relatively small human-subject sample size of 10 participants)
- Generalization claims: Medium (limited to two specific Atari games)

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization Testing**: Evaluate SILVER with RL-guided labeling on a broader set of RL environments, including non-visual domains and continuous control tasks, to assess robustness across different state and action spaces.

2. **Scalability Analysis**: Measure computational overhead and scalability limits when applying the method to environments with larger state spaces or more complex action hierarchies, such as multi-agent systems or procedurally generated levels.

3. **Long-term Interpretability**: Conduct longitudinal studies to assess whether the interpretability of policies degrades over time as RL policies continue to learn or adapt to changing environments, and whether explanations remain faithful under such conditions.
