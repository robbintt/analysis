# DOGMA: Weaving Structural Information into Data-centric Single-cell Transcriptomics Analysis
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01839
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01839
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Deterministic graph construction using biological priors outperforms heuristic-based methods in scRNA-seq analysis

## Executive Summary
DOGMA is a data-centric framework for single-cell transcriptomics that integrates multi-level biological priors—Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and Phylogenetic Trees—into deterministic graph construction, replacing heuristic-based structure discovery. By combining statistical anchors (e.g., MNN) with ontology-guided semantic masking and phylogenetically stratified edges, DOGMA generates robust, biologically-grounded cell-cell topologies. Feature enhancement via GO pathways bridges the semantic gap in raw expression data. Evaluated on cross-species and multi-organ benchmarks, DOGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in supervised classification, zero-shot generalization, and unsupervised clustering, while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude compared to large transformer models. Its deterministic, knowledge-anchored approach proves superior to expanding model complexity for handling noisy scRNA-seq data.

## Method Summary
DOGMA integrates Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and Phylogenetic Trees into deterministic graph construction for single-cell transcriptomics. The framework uses statistical anchors like MNN for initial alignment, then applies ontology-guided semantic masking and phylogenetically stratified edges to create biologically-grounded cell-cell topologies. GO pathways enhance features by bridging semantic gaps in raw expression data. This deterministic approach replaces heuristic-based structure discovery, achieving superior performance across supervised classification, zero-shot generalization, and unsupervised clustering tasks while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to transformer-based methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in supervised classification, zero-shot generalization, and unsupervised clustering
- Reduces computational cost by orders of magnitude compared to large transformer models
- Demonstrates superior robustness through cross-species and multi-organ benchmark evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DOGMA works by replacing heuristic-based structure discovery with deterministic graph construction that leverages multi-level biological priors. The integration of Cell Ontology, Gene Ontology, and Phylogenetic Trees provides structured scaffolding that guides the creation of biologically-grounded cell-cell topologies. This approach addresses the fundamental challenge in single-cell transcriptomics where raw expression data contains semantic gaps that obscure meaningful biological relationships. By using statistical anchors like MNN for initial alignment and then applying ontology-guided semantic masking, DOGMA creates more interpretable and robust representations of cellular states. The phylogenetically stratified edges capture evolutionary relationships that enhance cross-species generalizability, while GO pathway-based feature enhancement bridges the semantic gap in raw expression data, making the learned representations more biologically meaningful and easier to interpret.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cell Ontology**: Hierarchical classification of cell types and states
  - Why needed: Provides structured framework for cell type relationships
  - Quick check: Verify ontology coverage matches experimental cell types
- **Gene Ontology**: Functional annotation of genes and gene products
  - Why needed: Bridges semantic gaps in raw expression data
  - Quick check: Assess pathway coverage completeness
- **Phylogenetic Trees**: Evolutionary relationships between species
  - Why needed: Enables cross-species generalization and stratification
  - Quick check: Validate phylogenetic distance metrics
- **MNN (Mutual Nearest Neighbors)**: Statistical method for batch correction
  - Why needed: Provides initial alignment anchor for graph construction
  - Quick check: Compare alignment quality across batch correction methods
- **Deterministic Graph Construction**: Rule-based topology generation
  - Why needed: Replaces computationally expensive heuristic searches
  - Quick check: Verify reproducibility across runs with same priors
- **Semantic Masking**: Ontology-guided feature filtering
  - Why needed: Reduces noise by focusing on biologically relevant signals
  - Quick check: Evaluate information loss vs. noise reduction tradeoff

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: scRNA-seq Data -> MNN Alignment -> Cell Ontology Masking -> GO Feature Enhancement -> Phylogenetic Edge Stratification -> Final Graph
**Critical Path**: The deterministic graph construction pipeline processes data through MNN alignment, then sequentially applies Cell Ontology masking, GO pathway enhancement, and phylogenetic stratification to generate the final topology
**Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritizes computational efficiency and biological interpretability over model complexity, sacrificing potential gains from large transformer architectures for deterministic, knowledge-anchored approaches
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate incomplete ontology coverage, phylogenetic distance mismatches, or insufficient statistical anchors for initial alignment
**3 First Experiments**:
1. Validate graph construction determinism by running identical inputs through the pipeline multiple times
2. Compare performance with and without each biological prior (Cell Ontology, GO, Phylogenetic Trees) to assess individual contributions
3. Benchmark computational runtime against transformer-based baselines on identical datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to diverse scRNA-seq experimental designs remains uncertain
- Performance on highly fragmented or low-quality datasets not fully characterized
- Deterministic nature may limit adaptability to novel biological contexts with incomplete ontological structures

## Confidence
- High: Computational efficiency claims are logically sound given deterministic approach
- Medium: Biological interpretability gains depend on quality and completeness of integrated ontologies
- Low: Long-term scalability and maintenance concerns due to rapidly evolving biological knowledge bases

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark DOGMA on datasets with varying sequencing depths and technical qualities to assess robustness across experimental conditions
2. Evaluate performance on datasets from organisms with less comprehensive ontology coverage to test adaptability beyond well-annotated systems
3. Conduct longitudinal studies comparing DOGMA's cell type classifications against emerging biological discoveries to assess potential ontology-driven blind spots
