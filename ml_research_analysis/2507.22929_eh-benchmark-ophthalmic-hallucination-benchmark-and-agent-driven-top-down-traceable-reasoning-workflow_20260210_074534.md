- Primary result: Multi-agent framework with RAG and tool-based validation significantly reduces hallucinations in medical LLMs for ophthalmic diagnosis

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EH-Benchmark, a new benchmark with over 27K questions designed to evaluate hallucinations in Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) for ophthalmology. The benchmark targets two primary hallucination types—Visual Understanding and Logical Composition—across multiple error subtypes. To address these issues, the authors propose a three-stage multi-agent framework comprising Knowledge-Level Retrieval, Task-Level Case Studies, and Result-Level Validation. The framework uses specialized agents to retrieve clinical guidelines, select and sequence appropriate diagnostic tools, and validate results through iterative self-correction. Experimental results demonstrate the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EH-Benchmark, significantly reducing hallucination rates while improving accuracy, interpretability, and reliability compared to baseline MLLMs.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework is a three-stage multi-agent system designed to mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs for ophthalmic diagnosis. It begins with a Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage where a RAG Agent queries clinical knowledge sources to provide evidence-based context. The Task-Level Case Studies stage employs a Decision Agent that orchestrates specialized tools (e.g., lesion detection, diagnosis classification) based on the query and retrieved context. Finally, the Result-Level Validation stage uses an Evaluation Agent to critique the output for correctness, completeness, and adherence to the planned workflow, triggering retries if needed. The framework is evaluated on EH-Benchmark, a new dataset of 27K questions spanning Color Fundus Photography, Optical Coherence Tomography, and text modalities.

## Key Results
- The three-stage multi-agent framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EH-Benchmark, significantly reducing hallucination rates
- The system improves accuracy, interpretability, and reliability compared to baseline MLLMs
- Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the knowledge retrieval, tool-based reasoning, and iterative validation approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Externalized Knowledge Retrieval to Ground Reasoning
- Claim: Retrieving external, authoritative ophthalmic knowledge before task execution reduces hallucinations arising from the model's parametric knowledge gaps.
- Mechanism: A RAG Agent queries predefined clinical URLs, chunks content into a vector database, and retrieves contextually relevant documents. This context is injected into the prompt for subsequent agents, providing evidence-based grounding instead of relying solely on the model's internal weights.
- Core assumption: The model can effectively integrate retrieved non-parametric information into its reasoning chain.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states framework includes "Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage"; section 4.1.2 notes "evidence-based approach provides a rich and reliable foundation"; related work discusses multi-source hallucinations.

### Mechanism 2: Modular Tool Use for Verification
- Claim: Decomposing complex visual diagnostic tasks into specialized, tool-based operations and forcing the model to orchestrate these tools improves accuracy and interpretability over end-to-end black-box inference.
- Mechanism: A central Decision Agent interprets the query and selects a sequence of pre-trained, specialized tools (e.g., Lesion Detection Tool, DR Severity Diagnose Tool). These tools perform deterministic or independently verifiable operations, shifting the model's role from direct visual interpretation to reasoning about tool outputs.
- Core assumption: The individual tools are sufficiently accurate and robust; the Decision Agent can correctly map queries to appropriate tool sequences.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "Task-Level Case Studies... specialized agents and tools"; section 4.2.1 describes structured tool selection sequence; related work discusses fine-grained detection.

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Self-Correction via Critique
- Claim: An explicit validation and retry loop, where an agent critiques the output of other agents against a plan, can detect and correct incomplete or incorrect workflows, enhancing reliability.
- Mechanism: An Evaluation Agent reviews tool outputs against correctness, completeness, and adherence to the planned workflow. If validation fails, a retry mechanism is triggered for specific tools or steps, creating an iterative refinement process.
- Core assumption: The Evaluation Agent's judgment is accurate and trustworthy; the failure is detectable via defined dimensions.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states framework "significantly improves accuracy, interpretability, and reliability"; section 4.3.2 describes validate-retry loop; related work discusses self-verification.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: The framework's first stage relies entirely on RAG to provide clinical context required for accurate reasoning.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a retrieved document chunk is transformed into a prompt and what happens if the retriever returns a document that is topically similar but factually incorrect?

- **Concept: Multi-Agent Orchestration**
  - Why needed here: The proposed system isn't a single model but a coordinator (Decision Agent) and a set of executors (Tools/Agents).
  - Quick check question: How would you represent a state (e.g., current tool sequence, outputs so far) that is passed between the Decision Agent and the Tool Agents?

- **Concept: Hallucination in MLLMs (Visual vs. Logical)**
  - Why needed here: This work specifically targets two types of hallucinations; understanding their root causes is key to understanding why this architecture is proposed.
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between a model claiming a lesion exists that isn't there (Visual Understanding Hallucination) versus making a diagnostic leap inconsistent with visual evidence (Logical Composition Hallucination)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  User Interface -> RAG Agent (Vector DB + GPT-4.1) -> Decision Agent (GPT-4.1) -> Tool Board (specialized models) -> Tool Executor -> Evaluation Agent (GPT-4.1) -> Response Generator (GPT-4.1)

- **Critical path:** Query -> RAG Context Retrieval -> Decision Agent (Plan) -> Tool Execution -> Evaluation Agent -> (Retry or Finalize) -> Final Answer

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Latency vs. Accuracy: The retry loop can significantly increase response time.
  - Flexibility vs. Control: Hard-coded tools are reliable but inflexible; this system chooses reliability and control via tools, sacrificing some flexibility.
  - Complexity vs. Interpretability: A multi-agent system is harder to debug than a single model, but the paper argues explicit tool calls and validation steps increase interpretability for clinicians.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Infinite Loop in Validation: Evaluation Agent repeatedly rejects output; check prompt and success criteria.
  - Tool Mismatch: Decision Agent calls non-existent or inappropriate tools; verify tool selection logs.
  - RAG Poisoning: RAG agent retrieves irrelevant/misleading text, leading Decision Agent astray.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. End-to-End Latency Breakdown: Measure time for each stage (RAG, Decision, Tool Execution, Eval) on 100 queries; identify bottlenecks.
  2. Tool Accuracy Audit: Run each tool independently on held-out validation set; establish baseline performance.
  3. Ablation on Retry Limit: Compare performance with max_retries=0, 1, and 3 to quantify gain from retry loop.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does the inclusion of cross-modal inputs, specifically combining brain CT scans with Color Fundus Photography (CFP), affect the diagnostic accuracy and hallucination rates for complex ophthalmic diseases?
  - Basis: Authors state in Future Work: "For example, we will consider using brain CT and CFP as combined inputs for complex ophthalmic disease diagnosis."
  - Why unresolved: Current EH-Benchmark and framework focus on standard ophthalmic modalities and have not been validated on cross-modal inputs involving brain CTs.

- **Open Question 2:** To what extent does integrating real-time clinician feedback (expert-in-the-loop) improve the clinical accuracy and interpretability of the system compared to the current autonomous self-correction loop?
  - Basis: Authors note in Future Work: "Clinician feedback will be incorporated into the model's learning process to improve clinical accuracy, interpretability, and overall trustworthiness."
  - Why unresolved: Current framework relies on automated agents for self-correction; quantitative benefit of adding human expert intervention has not been measured.

- **Open Question 3:** Can the proposed multi-agent framework maintain reliable performance when extended to ophthalmic modalities characterized by scarce data, such as Lens Photographs, Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (SLO), and Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)?
  - Basis: Authors state in Limitations: "The scarcity of high-quality, domain-specific ophthalmology data limits the current work's ability to address multimodal questions adequately."
  - Why unresolved: Current benchmark and tool set do not support these specific modalities, and it's unclear if the framework can function effectively without sufficient domain-specific training data.

## Limitations
- The paper provides limited quantitative evidence of individual tool accuracy, making it unclear whether performance gains come from orchestration or underlying models
- Reliance on GPT-4.1 (potentially unreleased) creates ambiguity in reproducing agent reasoning behavior
- Benchmark construction lacks details on inter-annotator agreement or bias mitigation, raising questions about result robustness

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The framework's three-stage architecture (RAG, tool use, validation) is clearly defined and technically feasible. The claim that grounding reasoning in external knowledge reduces parametric hallucinations is well-supported by prior RAG literature.
- **Medium Confidence:** The assertion that modular tool orchestration improves interpretability and reliability is plausible but depends on assumed high tool performance, which is not empirically validated.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on EH-Benchmark is weakly supported without independent verification of baseline comparisons or tool accuracy.

## Next Checks
1. **Tool Accuracy Audit:** Independently evaluate each specialized tool (Diagnose, Lesion Detection, Localization) on a held-out validation set to establish baseline performance before integration.
2. **RAG Relevance Analysis:** Measure the precision and recall of the RAG agent's retrieved documents against a manually annotated relevance set to quantify the grounding quality.
3. **Ablation on Retry Logic:** Run the system with `max_retries=0` (no evaluation agent) and compare F1/accuracy to `max_retries=1` and `max_retries=3` to isolate the contribution of the self-correction loop.
