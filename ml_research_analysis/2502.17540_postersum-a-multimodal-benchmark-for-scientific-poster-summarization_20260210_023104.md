# PosterSum: A Multimodal Benchmark for Scientific Poster Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.17540
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17540
- Reference count: 35
- POSTER SUM introduces 16,305 poster-abstract pairs for multimodal summarization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces POSTER SUM, a large-scale dataset of 16,305 academic posters paired with their abstracts, designed to advance multimodal scientific poster summarization. The dataset captures complex visual elements like charts, tables, and dense text, presenting unique challenges for vision-language models. The authors benchmark several state-of-the-art MLLMs on this task, showing their limitations in accurately interpreting and summarizing scientific posters. They propose SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE, a hierarchical method that segments posters into regions, summarizes each locally, and then composes a global summary. This approach achieves a 3.14% improvement in ROUGE-L over existing models, setting a new benchmark for the task. The dataset and methods will facilitate future research in multimodal scientific understanding.

## Method Summary
The authors developed POSTER SUM by collecting 16,305 academic posters from various conferences and pairing them with their corresponding abstracts. They employed a SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE approach that first divides posters into meaningful regions (title, abstract, figures, tables, text blocks), then uses vision-language models to generate local summaries for each region, and finally composes these into a comprehensive global summary. The evaluation framework uses ROUGE-L to measure n-gram overlap between generated summaries and reference abstracts, providing quantitative benchmarks for multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs including BLIP-2, LLaVA, and GPT-4V.

## Key Results
- POSTER SUM dataset contains 16,305 poster-abstract pairs from scientific conferences
- State-of-the-art MLLMs show significant limitations in poster summarization tasks
- SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE method achieves 3.14% improvement in ROUGE-L over baseline models
- Visual elements (charts, tables, diagrams) remain challenging for current multimodal models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE approach works by breaking down the complex multimodal input into manageable components that can be processed independently before integration. By segmenting posters into logical regions, the model can apply specialized processing to each type of content - textual blocks can be handled with standard language models while visual elements require vision-language understanding. The hierarchical composition then ensures that local insights are properly integrated into a coherent global summary. This mirrors how humans process complex documents by first understanding individual components before synthesizing the whole.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision-Language Models (VLMs): Why needed - to process combined visual and textual information in posters; Quick check - can the model identify text within images and understand visual elements like charts
- Multimodal Scientific Understanding: Why needed - posters contain specialized scientific content beyond general images; Quick check - can the model interpret scientific notation, graphs, and domain-specific terminology
- Region Segmentation: Why needed - posters have heterogeneous layouts requiring different processing strategies; Quick check - can the model accurately identify and separate title, figures, tables, and text blocks
- Hierarchical Summarization: Why needed - local summaries must be coherently integrated into global context; Quick check - does the final summary maintain logical flow and preserve key information from all regions
- ROUGE Evaluation Metrics: Why needed - standard quantitative measure for text summarization quality; Quick check - does n-gram overlap correlate with human judgment of summary quality

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input Posters -> Region Segmentation -> Local Summarization -> Global Composition -> Output Summary
Critical path: Region Segmentation is the bottleneck - errors here propagate through all subsequent stages
Design tradeoffs: Segmentation accuracy vs. processing speed, local detail vs. global coherence
Failure signatures: Missing visual elements in summaries, incoherent transitions between regions, over-reliance on textual content
First experiments: 1) Test segmentation accuracy on diverse poster layouts, 2) Compare local summarization quality across different VLM models, 3) Evaluate global composition coherence with human annotators

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset may contain significant content overlap between posters and paired abstracts, potentially inflating performance metrics
- ROUGE-L evaluation may not fully capture multimodal understanding, focusing primarily on text-based n-gram overlap
- Limited ablation studies make it difficult to assess which components of SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE drive performance improvements

## Confidence
- Dataset composition concerns: Medium
- Evaluation methodology validity: Medium
- Reported performance improvements: Medium
- Model architecture contributions: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation study where annotators assess whether summaries capture information unique to posters but absent from abstracts
2. Perform content overlap analysis between posters and abstracts to quantify potential ceiling effects in performance metrics
3. Implement cross-modal retrieval tests requiring models to identify which visual elements correspond to summary content
