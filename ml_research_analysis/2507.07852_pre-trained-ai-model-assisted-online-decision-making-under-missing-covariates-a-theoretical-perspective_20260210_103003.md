# Pre-Trained AI Model Assisted Online Decision-Making under Missing Covariates: A Theoretical Perspective

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Regret bounds for online decision-making with pre-trained AI model imputation under missing covariates

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses sequential decision-making under missing covariates when leveraging a pre-trained AI model for imputation. The key insight is that both missing data and model inaccuracies can degrade decision quality, necessitating theoretical guarantees. The authors introduce "model elasticity" as a novel measure of how sensitive rewards are to imputation errors. They establish regret bounds for both Missing Not At Random (MNAR) and Missing At Random (MAR) settings, with the MAR case benefiting from a calibration procedure that reduces regret to near-optimal rates.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a framework for online decision-making under missing covariates using pre-trained imputation models. For MNAR settings, it introduces model elasticity to quantify the impact of imputation errors on rewards, deriving regret bounds that scale as √T plus a term proportional to T times the elasticity. For MAR settings, it employs orthogonal statistical learning to calibrate the pre-trained model and correct bias, achieving improved regret bounds. The calibration procedure leverages a clean separation between nuisance and target parameters to reduce the impact of model inaccuracies on decision quality.

## Key Results
- For MNAR settings, regret scales as √T plus a term proportional to T times the model elasticity
- Under MAR, calibration using orthogonal statistical learning reduces regret to near-optimal rates up to small irreducible noise
- The calibration procedure theoretically improves regret bounds polynomially in the pre-trained model's accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by quantifying and controlling the sensitivity of rewards to imputation errors through model elasticity. In MNAR settings, the regret bound explicitly captures this sensitivity, showing that worse imputation models lead to higher regret. For MAR settings, the calibration procedure leverages orthogonality conditions to correct bias without introducing additional variance, effectively removing the impact of model inaccuracies on decisions while preserving the benefits of using the pre-trained model.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Model Elasticity**: A measure of how sensitive rewards are to imputation errors. Needed to quantify the cost of using imperfect imputation models. Quick check: bounded by problem-specific constants that characterize the relationship between covariate values and rewards.

2. **Orthogonal Statistical Learning**: A framework for separating nuisance parameters from target parameters in estimation. Needed to enable calibration without introducing additional variance. Quick check: requires correct specification of orthogonality conditions between imputation error and reward function.

3. **Missing Not At Random (MNAR) vs Missing At Random (MAR)**: Different missingness mechanisms with distinct statistical properties. Needed to determine appropriate theoretical treatment. Quick check: MAR allows for calibration-based improvements while MNAR does not.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Pre-trained Imputation Model -> Decision Maker -> Reward Estimator -> Regret Bound Calculator

**Critical Path**: Covariates with missing values → Pre-trained model imputation → Decision selection → Reward observation → Regret calculation → Model elasticity assessment

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity (calibration in MAR) for improved regret bounds, accepting the assumption of bounded model elasticity for theoretical guarantees in MNAR settings.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor imputation quality leads to high model elasticity in MNAR, while violation of orthogonality assumptions in MAR causes calibration to fail and regret bounds to degrade.

**First Experiments**:
1. Synthetic data generation with controlled missingness patterns and known ground truth
2. Varying imputation model accuracy to test sensitivity of regret bounds
3. Comparison of calibrated vs uncalibrated performance under different missingness mechanisms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The MNAR regret bound depends on an unknown model elasticity parameter that may not be bounded in practice
- The calibration procedure assumes access to orthogonal statistical learning tools without addressing implementation complexity
- No empirical validation is provided to confirm theoretical bounds translate to practical improvements

## Confidence

- Regret bounds for MNAR: High confidence in theoretical derivation, Medium confidence in practical applicability
- Calibration procedure for MAR: High confidence in theoretical framework, Low confidence in practical implementation
- Model elasticity as a useful metric: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of regret bounds on synthetic and real-world datasets with varying missingness patterns
2. Experimental evaluation of the calibration procedure's sensitivity to violations of orthogonality assumptions
3. Analysis of computational complexity and implementation challenges of the calibration step in practical settings
