- Primary result: Rubric-based rewards refined with great and diverse response pairs significantly improve win-rates (34.4% vs 21.7% in health domain) and delay over-optimization compared to Bradley-Terry baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses reward over-optimization in reinforcement fine-tuning of language models, showing that errors in high-reward regions dominate downstream performance degradation. The proposed method uses rubric-based rewards, leveraging off-policy examples from stronger models and an iterative refinement workflow to distinguish among excellent, diverse responses. Empirically, rubrics refined with great and diverse candidate pairs significantly improve win-rates over baselines and delay over-optimization. Key findings include: (1) reward misspecification in the high-reward tail is the primary source of alignment failure, and (2) refining rubrics to differentiate excellent from great responses yields more sophisticated, effective criteria. The method is validated across generalist and health domains using GPT-4.1 for rubric generation and scoring, demonstrating robust improvements over Bradley-Terry reward models trained on off-policy data.

## Method Summary
The method generates initial rubrics via GPT-4.1 from prompt templates, then iteratively refines them using Refinement-through-Differentiation (RTD). RTD scores candidate responses, selects top-2, and prompts the proposer to identify distinguishing features and update rubrics. The refined rubrics use GPT-4.1-mini verifier to compute weighted binary criterion satisfaction scores as rewards during GRPO training. The workflow leverages off-policy exemplars while remaining insensitive to their artifacts through explicit criteria filtering.

## Key Results
- Rubric-based rewards with great & diverse pairs achieve 34.4% win-rate vs 21.7% for Bradley-Terry in health domain
- Iterative refinement delays over-optimization onset from ~60 to ~160 training steps
- High-reward tail accuracy drives alignment quality more than global reward accuracy
- Rubric refinement with great responses produces more sophisticated criteria than with good responses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Errors in the high-reward tail dominate downstream alignment failure, not global reward accuracy.
- Mechanism: RFT solution (π_r ∝ π_0 · exp(r/β)) exponentially upweights high-reward responses. When proxy misspecifies in this region, policy concentrates on misspecified outputs, causing win-rate collapse as KL increases.
- Core assumption: Gold reward R_x^0 follows uniform distribution under base policy, matching best-of-n sampling behavior.
- Evidence: [abstract] identifies tail misspecification as primary failure source; [Section 3, Theorem 2] shows KL invariant to misspecification pattern but expected reward depends on f^(-1) weighted by exp(u/β); [Figure 2a] shows top 25% wrong causes win-rate collapse.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Rubric-based rewards leverage off-policy exemplars without inheriting artifacts because explicit criteria filter for task-relevant features.
- Mechanism: Rather than learning black-box reward from response pairs, rubrics encode verifiable criteria (e.g., "mentions urgent imaging required"). Explicit decomposition prevents reward hacking via style-matching off-policy artifacts.
- Core assumption: Proposer LLM generates criteria that are both discriminative and genuinely task-relevant.
- Evidence: [Section 4] states rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to artifacts; [Appendix D, Table 5] shows rubric-based methods reach 34.4% win-rate vs 22.4% for BT reward model.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Iterative refinement comparing great, diverse responses produces rubrics that distinguish excellent from merely great outputs.
- Mechanism: RTD workflow presents pairs of high-quality responses to proposer, which identifies distinguishing features and encodes as new criteria. Each iteration scores candidates, selects top-2, and refines—progressively concentrating on performance frontier.
- Core assumption: Stronger models produce responses with genuinely differentiating features.
- Evidence: [Section 4.1, Algorithm 1] describes iterative rubric refinement; [Table 1] shows "4 Great & Diverse Pairs" achieves 39.7% win-rate vs 33.5% for "1 Good Pair"; [Figure 4] shows iteratively refined rubrics delay over-optimization onset.

## Foundational Learning

- **KL-constrained reward optimization (RFT objective)**: Understanding the closed-form RFT solution π_r ∝ π_0 · exp(r/β) is essential for the theoretical analysis of why KL divergence is invariant to misspecification patterns.
  - Quick check: If β increases, does the policy become more or less conservative in shifting from π_0?

- **Bradley-Terry preference modeling**: Understanding how BT models learn from preference pairs clarifies why they fail with off-policy data compared to rubric-based approaches.
  - Quick check: What does a BT model learn from a preference pair (y_w ≻ y_l)?

- **Reward over-optimization (Goodhart's Law in RLHF)**: Understanding that proxy rewards diverge from true objectives under optimization is crucial for motivating the tail-focused approach.
  - Quick check: Why does increasing training steps sometimes decrease win-rate despite increasing proxy reward?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Candidate Pool Generator -> Rubric Proposer (GPT-4.1) -> Rubric Verifier (GPT-4.1-mini) -> RFT Trainer (GRPO on Qwen3-8B-Base)
- **Critical path**: 1. Generate candidate responses → 2. Initial rubric generation → 3. Iterative RTD refinement (score top-2 → extract distinctions → update rubrics) → 4. Train policy with refined rubrics → 5. Evaluate via held-out prompts and judge comparison
- **Design tradeoffs**: Verifier model choice balances cost vs reliability; number of RTD iterations adds compute with diminishing returns; simple weighted average aggregation used but non-linear alternatives may improve
- **Failure signatures**: Early win-rate peak followed by rapid decline indicates over-optimization; high training reward but low win-rate suggests reward hacking; low rubric agreement with ground-truth judge in high-reward region indicates refinement needs stronger/diverse candidates
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Ablation on candidate quality: compare rubrics refined with "good" vs "great" pairs on 500 prompts; 2) Over-optimization timing: train with initial vs iteratively-refined rubrics for 200 steps and plot win-rate curves; 3) BT baseline comparison: train Bradley-Terry reward model on identical off-policy responses and compare downstream win-rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can non-linear aggregation methods for rubric criteria outperform the simple weighted average used in this work? The authors acknowledge aggregation is a central component and leave it for future work.
- How robust are rubric-based rewards when the rubric proposer model is weaker than or comparable to the policy model being trained? All experiments use GPT-4.1 as proposer while training Qwen3-8B, leaving this dependency untested.
- What is the minimum quantity and diversity of off-policy exemplars needed before Bradley-Terry reward models become competitive with rubric-based rewards in specialized domains? The paper shows rubric advantages with limited data but doesn't establish the crossover point.
- Does the theoretical finding—that high-reward region accuracy dominates alignment quality—hold under distributional assumptions beyond the uniform prior on base-reward values? The analysis assumes R_x^0 ~ U(0,1), but real-world reward distributions may differ.

## Limitations

- Unknown base-policy reward distribution may not follow uniform assumption, potentially altering over-optimization dynamics
- Off-policy candidate quality dependence assumes stronger models produce genuinely differentiating responses
- Verifier reliability calibration without systematic inter-rater reliability data leaves actual reward accuracy uncertain

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Over-optimization manifests as win-rate collapse despite rising proxy rewards; initial rubrics fail to discriminate in high-reward tail; great response pairs drive more sophisticated criteria than good pairs
- **Medium confidence**: Tail misspecification dominates alignment failure across diverse tasks; rubric-based rewards are less susceptible to off-policy artifacts than preference models; iterative refinement delays over-optimization onset
- **Low confidence**: Uniform base-policy reward assumption holds generally; GPT-4.1-mini verifier performance matches human raters in all domains; RTD workflow scales to tasks requiring hundreds of criteria

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on candidate quality**: Compare rubrics refined with "good" vs "great" pairs on 500 prompts; measure high-reward accuracy to confirm candidate quality drives rubric sophistication
2. **Over-optimization timing**: Train with initial vs iteratively-refined rubrics for 200 steps; plot win-rate and proxy reward curves to confirm delayed collapse with refined diverse rubrics
3. **BT baseline comparison**: Train Bradley-Terry reward model on identical off-policy responses; compare downstream win-rates against rubric-based approach to validate off-policy insensitivity claims
