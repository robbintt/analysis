core_contribution: This paper proposes a novel method to decompose epistemic uncertainty
  in causal effect estimation from finite observational data. The core idea is to
  distinguish between uncertainty due to fundamental non-identifiability (nonID uncertainty)

# Decomposing Epistemic Uncertainty for Causal Decision Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22736
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22736
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Novel method to decompose epistemic uncertainty into fundamental non-identifiability and sample uncertainty for causal effect estimation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in causal inference: distinguishing between uncertainty that can be reduced by collecting more data versus uncertainty that is fundamentally irreducible due to unmeasured confounding. The authors propose a framework that decomposes epistemic uncertainty into two components - non-identifiable uncertainty arising from unmeasured variables and sample uncertainty that diminishes with more observations. By using a confidence set around the empirical distribution and computing intersections of causal effect bounds, the method provides practitioners with actionable guidance on whether to collect more samples or seek additional variables. This decomposition is particularly valuable for safety-critical applications where understanding the limits of causal knowledge is essential for responsible decision-making.

## Method Summary
The core approach uses a confidence set construction around the empirical distribution to capture epistemic uncertainty in causal effect estimation. For each distribution in this confidence set, the method computes the tightest possible bounds on the causal effect using existing bounding techniques. The intersection of these bounds across all distributions in the confidence set represents the final uncertainty characterization. The authors employ deep causal models to approximate solutions to min-max and max-min optimization problems that arise in computing these intersections. This decomposition allows practitioners to distinguish between uncertainty that stems from fundamental non-identifiability (which cannot be resolved without additional variables) and uncertainty due to finite samples (which can be reduced through more data collection).

## Key Results
- Demonstrates that decomposing epistemic uncertainty into non-identifiability and sample components provides actionable guidance for data collection strategies
- Shows the method can identify when additional samples won't reduce uncertainty, indicating fundamental non-identifiability
- Validates the approach on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing practical utility for safety-critical decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the fundamental distinction between two sources of uncertainty in causal inference. When causal effects are non-identifiable due to unmeasured confounding, the uncertainty is irreducible regardless of sample size - this is the non-identifiable uncertainty component. However, when the causal effect is identifiable but estimation is based on finite samples, the uncertainty decreases with more data - this is the sample uncertainty component. By constructing a confidence set around the empirical distribution and computing bounds for each distribution within this set, the method captures both sources of uncertainty simultaneously. The intersection of these bounds reveals the irreducible uncertainty, while the difference between individual bounds and this intersection quantifies the reducible sample uncertainty.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal effect identification and bounds**: Understanding when causal effects can be identified from observational data and how to compute bounds when they cannot is fundamental to this work. Why needed: The entire method relies on bounding causal effects under uncertainty. Quick check: Can identify when backdoor criterion applies versus when only bounds are possible.
- **Confidence set construction for distributions**: The method uses confidence sets to represent epistemic uncertainty about the true data-generating distribution. Why needed: This provides the mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty about the underlying distribution. Quick check: Can construct valid confidence sets for empirical distributions under different metrics.
- **Min-max and max-min optimization**: The computational approach requires solving optimization problems to find bounds that hold across all distributions in the confidence set. Why needed: These optimization problems arise naturally when computing intersections of bounds. Quick check: Can solve these problems approximately using deep causal models with reasonable computational resources.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data -> Empirical distribution estimation -> Confidence set construction -> Bound computation for each distribution -> Intersection of bounds -> Decomposition into nonID and sample uncertainty

**Critical path**: The most computationally intensive step is computing bounds for each distribution in the confidence set, as this requires solving min-max or max-min optimization problems. The accuracy of the final uncertainty decomposition depends critically on the quality of these bound computations and the coverage properties of the confidence set.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity for more nuanced uncertainty quantification. While simpler methods might only provide aggregate uncertainty estimates, this approach provides actionable decomposition at the cost of solving multiple optimization problems. The choice of confidence set construction method and bound computation technique involves balancing coverage guarantees against computational tractability.

**Failure signatures**: The method may fail when the confidence set is too large (leading to vacuous bounds) or when the bound computation approximations are poor (leading to incorrect uncertainty decomposition). Computational failure can occur for high-dimensional problems where the number of distributions in the confidence set becomes intractable.

**3 first experiments**: 1) Verify decomposition on synthetic data with known non-identifiable and identifiable components, 2) Test sensitivity to confidence set size and coverage level, 3) Evaluate computational scalability with increasing dimensionality of the causal graph.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational intractability for high-dimensional problems due to the need to compute bounds across many distributions in the confidence set
- Approximation error introduced by using deep causal models to solve the optimization problems, which isn't fully characterized
- Reliance on correct specification of the causal graph structure and availability of reasonable empirical distribution estimates

## Confidence
- High confidence in the theoretical framework for decomposing epistemic uncertainty
- Medium confidence in the computational tractability of the proposed optimization approach
- Medium confidence in the practical utility of the method for real-world decision-making
- Low confidence in the robustness of the method to model misspecification

## Next Checks
1. Test scalability and performance on high-dimensional datasets with complex causal structures
2. Evaluate robustness when the assumed causal graph structure is partially misspecified
3. Compare with alternative uncertainty quantification methods on benchmark causal inference datasets
