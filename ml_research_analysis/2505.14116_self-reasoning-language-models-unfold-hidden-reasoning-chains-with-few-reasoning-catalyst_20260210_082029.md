core_contribution: Self-Reasoning Language Models (SRLM) address the challenge of
  generating longer, higher-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning chains for large
  language models by enabling the model to self-unfold and refine its own reasoning.
  The core idea is to use a small set of "reasoning catalyst" examples (1,000 samples)
  that demonstrate how to enrich shorter CoT rationales with meta-reasoning skills
  such as reflection, decomposition, and alternative thinking.

# Self-Reasoning Language Models: Unfold Hidden Reasoning Chains with Few Reasoning Catalyst

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.14116
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14116
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: +2.5 to +7.89 points improvement over baselines in Chain-of-Thought reasoning tasks

## Executive Summary
Self-Reasoning Language Models (SRLM) addresses the challenge of generating longer, higher-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning chains for large language models. The approach enables models to self-unfold and refine their own reasoning through iterative expansion and selection processes. By fine-tuning on a small set of "reasoning catalyst" examples that demonstrate meta-reasoning skills, SRLM learns to generate more comprehensive and stable reasoning chains. Experiments across five reasoning tasks demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to strong baselines.

## Method Summary
SRLM introduces a novel approach to enhance Chain-of-Thought reasoning by using a small catalyst dataset (1,000 samples) that shows how to enrich shorter CoT rationales with meta-reasoning skills like reflection, decomposition, and alternative thinking. The model is fine-tuned on both original instruction-tuning data and this catalyst data, learning to iteratively expand and select better reasoning chains. The method employs different reasoning selectors (length-based, off-policy, and on-policy) to choose the best reasoning rationale at each iteration, with the process continuing until convergence or maximum iterations. This self-reasoning mechanism allows the model to generate higher-quality training data than GPT-4o while requiring fewer computational resources than traditional approaches.

## Key Results
- SRLM achieves an average absolute improvement of more than +2.5 points compared to strong baselines across five reasoning tasks
- Performance gains increase to +7.89 points with 64 sampling times
- Small SRLMs can generate higher-quality training data than GPT-4o
- Different reasoning selectors offer complementary benefits depending on the task
- The method demonstrates improved stability over iterations compared to traditional approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SRLM works by leveraging the model's inherent reasoning capabilities and enhancing them through targeted fine-tuning on meta-reasoning examples. The catalyst dataset teaches the model how to expand and refine its reasoning chains by demonstrating techniques like reflection on previous steps, decomposition of complex problems into simpler subproblems, and generation of alternative solution paths. This self-reasoning capability allows the model to iteratively improve its output by selecting the most promising reasoning chains through various selectors. The approach capitalizes on the observation that even well-trained models can benefit from iterative refinement and that high-quality reasoning chains can be developed through careful selection and expansion rather than requiring massive datasets or compute resources.

## Foundational Learning
- **Chain-of-Thought reasoning**: Sequential reasoning process that breaks down complex problems into intermediate steps - needed for transparent problem-solving; quick check: verify step-by-step logical progression
- **Meta-reasoning skills**: Higher-order reasoning about reasoning itself, including reflection, decomposition, and alternative thinking - needed for reasoning chain refinement; quick check: assess quality of reasoning expansion
- **Iterative refinement**: Process of repeatedly improving outputs through multiple passes - needed for stability and quality enhancement; quick check: monitor convergence and performance trends
- **Reasoning selectors**: Mechanisms for choosing optimal reasoning chains from multiple candidates - needed for efficient iteration; quick check: validate selector effectiveness across tasks
- **Catalyst dataset**: Small curated examples demonstrating reasoning enhancement techniques - needed for targeted fine-tuning; quick check: ensure catalyst diversity and representativeness
- **Self-reasoning**: Model's ability to evaluate and improve its own reasoning output - needed for autonomous refinement; quick check: measure consistency between initial and final outputs

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Original model -> Fine-tuning on catalyst data -> Iterative reasoning expansion -> Selector evaluation -> Final output

Critical path: Fine-tuning phase → Iterative expansion phase → Selection phase → Performance evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Small catalyst dataset vs. performance (1,000 samples chosen); computational cost vs. quality improvement (up to 64 sampling times); different selector types vs. task-specific effectiveness; self-reasoning vs. external supervision

Failure signatures: 
- Inconsistent reasoning chains across iterations
- Selector bias toward length over quality
- Overfitting to catalyst examples
- Computational inefficiency with excessive iterations
- Poor generalization beyond catalyst task types

3 first experiments:
1. Baseline performance comparison without catalyst fine-tuning across all five tasks
2. Single iteration vs. multi-iteration performance analysis to measure convergence
3. Selector ablation study comparing length-based, off-policy, and on-policy selection methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to only five reasoning tasks, potentially restricting generalizability
- Computational costs increase significantly with multiple sampling passes (up to 64 times)
- Lack of detailed ablation studies on catalyst dataset size and composition requirements
- Insufficient methodological transparency in comparing SRLM data quality against GPT-4o
- Potential domain bias as all tested tasks may not represent diverse reasoning challenges

## Confidence

| Major Claim Clusters | Confidence Level |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Performance improvement claims | Medium |
| SRLM data quality vs GPT-4o | Low |
| Generalization across reasoning tasks | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies varying catalyst dataset size (50, 100, 500, 1000 samples) to determine minimum effective catalyst requirements
2. Test SRLM across broader reasoning domains including mathematical proofs, scientific reasoning, and logical deduction to assess generalizability
3. Implement runtime efficiency benchmarks comparing single-pass vs multi-pass sampling to quantify computational trade-offs against performance gains
