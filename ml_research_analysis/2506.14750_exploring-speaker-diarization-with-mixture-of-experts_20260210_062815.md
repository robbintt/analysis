# Exploring Speaker Diarization with Mixture of Experts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14750
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14750
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel neural speaker diarization system (NSD-MS2S) with memory-aware multi-speaker embedding module and Shared and Soft Mixture of Experts (SS-MoE) achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets including CHiME-6, DiPCo, Mixer 6, and DIHARD-III.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of speaker diarization in complex acoustic environments with unknown speaker counts and overlapping speech. The authors propose a novel neural speaker diarization system (NSD-MS2S) that integrates a memory-aware multi-speaker embedding module with a sequence-to-sequence architecture, enhancing speaker embeddings through a memory module and efficiently mapping acoustic features to speaker labels. To further improve performance and mitigate model bias, they introduce a Shared and Soft Mixture of Experts (SS-MoE) module, extending the model to NSD-MS2S-SSMoE. Experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and generalization, with the proposed methods achieving state-of-the-art results, particularly on the DIHARD-III evaluation set.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a neural speaker diarization system (NSD-MS2S) that combines a memory-aware multi-speaker embedding module with a sequence-to-sequence architecture. The memory module enhances speaker embeddings by leveraging historical information, while the sequence-to-sequence component maps acoustic features to speaker labels. To further improve performance and reduce model bias, the authors introduce a Shared and Soft Mixture of Experts (SS-MoE) module, creating the extended NSD-MS2S-SSMoE framework. This approach addresses the challenges of speaker diarization in complex acoustic environments with unknown speaker counts and overlapping speech.

## Key Results
- Proposed NSD-MS2S-SSMoE framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on DIHARD-III evaluation set
- Significant improvements in robustness and generalization across CHiME-6, DiPCo, Mixer 6, and DIHARD-III datasets
- Enhanced speaker embeddings through memory-aware multi-speaker embedding module demonstrate superior performance in overlapping speech scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed approach works by integrating multiple complementary modules that address different challenges in speaker diarization. The memory-aware multi-speaker embedding module enhances speaker representations by leveraging historical context, which is crucial for handling overlapping speech and unknown speaker counts. The sequence-to-sequence architecture provides an efficient mapping from acoustic features to speaker labels. The Shared and Soft Mixture of Experts (SS-MoE) module further improves performance by dynamically selecting and combining expert networks, reducing model bias and improving generalization across diverse acoustic conditions.

## Foundational Learning

### Mixture of Experts (MoE)
- **Why needed**: To dynamically select and combine specialized networks for handling diverse acoustic conditions and speaker characteristics
- **Quick check**: Verify that the gating mechanism effectively routes inputs to appropriate expert networks and that the shared expert provides robust baseline performance

### Memory-Augmented Neural Networks
- **Why needed**: To enhance speaker embeddings by leveraging historical information and context across time frames
- **Quick check**: Ensure the memory module effectively captures and utilizes temporal dependencies in speaker representations

### Sequence-to-Sequence Architectures
- **Why needed**: To provide an efficient mapping from variable-length acoustic feature sequences to fixed-length speaker label sequences
- **Quick check**: Validate that the architecture handles variable-length inputs and maintains temporal consistency in speaker assignments

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Audio Input -> Feature Extraction -> Memory-Aware Multi-Speaker Embedding Module -> Sequence-to-Sequence Architecture -> Speaker Label Output

### Critical Path
The critical path involves feature extraction from audio input, enhancement through the memory-aware multi-speaker embedding module, processing via the sequence-to-sequence architecture, and final speaker label prediction. The SS-MoE module operates as an enhancement layer that can be integrated at multiple points along this path.

### Design Tradeoffs
The memory-aware module adds computational overhead but provides significant improvements in handling overlapping speech and unknown speaker counts. The SS-MoE module introduces additional complexity but offers better generalization and reduced model bias. The tradeoff between model complexity and performance gains must be carefully evaluated for real-time applications.

### Failure Signatures
Potential failure modes include memory overflow when handling very long audio sequences, expert network collapse in the MoE module leading to poor generalization, and sequence-to-sequence misalignment causing incorrect speaker boundaries. The model may also struggle with speakers not well-represented in the training data.

### First Experiments
1. Ablation study comparing performance with and without the memory-aware module to quantify its individual contribution
2. Evaluation of the SS-MoE module's gating mechanism to ensure proper expert selection and combination
3. Scalability test with increasing numbers of speakers to assess memory module performance limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for memory-aware module with many more speakers than training data
- Lack of extensive ablation studies to isolate contributions of individual modules
- Computational overhead and efficiency not thoroughly discussed for real-time applications
- Evaluation limited to specific challenging datasets without broader testing across diverse conditions

## Confidence
- **Medium**: Results demonstrate significant improvements on evaluated datasets, but lack of detailed ablation studies and computational efficiency analysis introduces uncertainty about relative importance and practical applicability of proposed modules

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate and quantify the contributions of the memory-aware multi-speaker embedding module and the SS-MoE module to overall performance
2. Evaluate the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed system in real-time or resource-constrained environments
3. Test the generalizability of the NSD-MS2S-SSMoE framework on additional diverse datasets, including those with varying acoustic conditions, languages, and larger speaker counts
