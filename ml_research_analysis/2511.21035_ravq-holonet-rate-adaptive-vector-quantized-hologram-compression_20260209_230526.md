# RAVQ-HoloNet: Rate-Adaptive Vector-Quantized Hologram Compression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21035
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21035
- Authors: Shima Rafiei; Zahra Nabizadeh Shahr Babak; Shadrokh Samavi; Shahram Shirani
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: RAVQ-HoloNet achieves -33.91% BD-Rate improvement and 1.02 dB BD-PSNR gains over DPRC for rate-adaptive hologram compression

## Executive Summary
RAVQ-HoloNet presents a rate-adaptive vector quantization framework for hologram compression that enables multiple bitrates from a single trained model. The framework integrates a Seq2seq-based rate-adaptive vector quantization module into the VQ-HoloNet architecture, addressing the high data demands of holography for AR/VR applications. By compressing complex-valued holographic data into discrete latent representations through a hierarchical VQ-VAE structure with multi-scale encoders and decoders, the method achieves competitive reconstruction quality at significantly lower bitrates compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
RAVQ-HoloNet combines hierarchical vector quantization with rate-adaptive capabilities for hologram compression. The framework uses a multi-scale encoder-decoder architecture with discrete latent representations, where codebooks of varying sizes are learned during training to enable dynamic bitrate control at inference time. The Seq2seq-based rate-adaptive vector quantization module allows the model to generate and compress codebooks of different sizes without requiring separate models for different compression levels. The method specifically targets complex-valued holographic data, which poses unique challenges due to its high dimensionality and the need to preserve both amplitude and phase information for accurate reconstruction.

## Key Results
- Achieves -33.91% BD-Rate improvement compared to best existing method (DPRC)
- Demonstrates 1.02 dB BD-PSNR improvement over DPRC
- Maintains competitive reconstruction quality while operating at significantly lower bitrates
- Successfully enables multiple bitrate support from a single trained model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The rate-adaptive capability stems from learning codebooks of varying sizes during training, allowing the model to dynamically adjust compression levels at inference without retraining. The hierarchical VQ-VAE structure with multi-scale encoders and decoders effectively captures both local and global features of holographic data, while the discrete latent representation enables efficient compression of complex-valued holograms. The Seq2seq-based rate-adaptive vector quantization module learns to allocate bits efficiently across different spatial regions and frequency components.

## Foundational Learning

**Vector Quantization (VQ)**: Discretizing continuous latent representations into finite codebooks for efficient compression. Needed to transform high-dimensional holographic data into manageable discrete representations while preserving essential information.

**Hierarchical VQ-VAE**: Multi-scale encoding and decoding with separate codebooks at different resolutions. Required to capture both fine details and coarse structures in holographic data effectively.

**Seq2seq Rate-Adaptive**: Sequence-to-sequence models that learn to compress and decompress codebooks of varying sizes. Enables dynamic bitrate control without separate models for each compression level.

**Complex-Valued Processing**: Handling real and imaginary components of holographic data simultaneously. Essential for preserving both amplitude and phase information critical for accurate hologram reconstruction.

**BD-Rate/BD-PSNR**: Bjøntegaard Delta metrics for comparing compression efficiency. Standard metrics for evaluating rate-distortion performance in compression algorithms.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Hologram input -> Multi-scale Encoder -> Vector Quantization -> Rate-Adaptive Seq2seq -> Multi-scale Decoder -> Reconstructed hologram

**Critical Path**: Encoder -> Vector Quantization -> Rate-Adaptive Compression -> Decoder

**Design Tradeoffs**: Single model for multiple bitrates vs. separate specialized models; discrete representations vs. continuous latent spaces; computational complexity vs. compression efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Artifacts in phase information, loss of fine spatial details, poor reconstruction at extreme compression levels, failure to preserve occlusion boundaries.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test reconstruction quality at minimum and maximum supported bitrates
2. Verify rate-distortion curve smoothness across different compression levels
3. Validate complex-valued reconstruction accuracy by comparing amplitude and phase preservation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can gaze-driven or saliency-aware compression strategies improve perceptual quality and compression efficiency by allocating more code vectors to perceptually important regions?
- Basis: Future work section mentions incorporating salient or gaze-driven regions to guide reconstruction
- Why unresolved: Current framework treats all spatial regions uniformly
- Evidence needed: Rate-distortion comparisons showing improved perceptual metrics at equivalent bitrates

**Open Question 2**: Does joint compression of RGB channels outperform separate per-channel models, and what architecture best exploits cross-channel redundancy?
- Basis: Future work notes RGB channels share similar structural components
- Why unresolved: Current implementation trains three independent models
- Evidence needed: Quantitative comparison (BD-Rate, BD-PSNR) between joint and separate models

**Open Question 3**: Can the RAVQ-HoloNet framework be extended to 3D holography modalities while maintaining rate-adaptive capabilities?
- Basis: Future work mentions extending to 3D holography including RGB-D and full 3D representations
- Why unresolved: Current method focuses on 2D holography
- Evidence needed: Successful compression and reconstruction of 3D holographic content with depth planes

**Open Question 4**: How well do simulated reconstructions correlate with real-world holographic display quality?
- Basis: Paper evaluates only numerical reconstructions via ASM simulation
- Why unresolved: Simulated propagation may not capture SLM non-idealities and optical aberrations
- Evidence needed: Physical holographic display experiments comparing simulated and camera-captured reconstructions

## Limitations

- Evaluation limited to synthetic hologram datasets that may not capture real-world complexity
- Claims of real-time suitability lack performance measurements on actual edge devices
- No perceptual quality assessment studies with human observers in AR/VR contexts
- Phase information preservation not thoroughly validated under extreme compression

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Technical description of hierarchical VQ-VAE structure is well-defined and internally consistent
- **Medium confidence**: BD-Rate and BD-PSNR improvements are reported but lack independent validation
- **Low confidence**: Claims about suitability for bandwidth-constrained real-time applications lack supporting performance data

## Next Checks

1. Validate BD-Rate improvement on at least two additional hologram datasets with different characteristics (depth complexity, occlusion patterns, object diversity)
2. Measure inference latency and memory usage on representative edge devices (mobile GPU or embedded system) to confirm real-time feasibility
3. Conduct subjective quality assessment studies comparing RAVQ-HoloNet reconstructions against existing methods using human observers in AR/VR contexts
