# Automatic Labelling with Open-source LLMs using Dynamic Label Schema Integration

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.12332
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12332
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** RAC improves F1 scores by up to 20 absolute points compared to naive approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method for automatically labeling high-cardinality text classification datasets using open-source large language models while addressing privacy and cost concerns. The Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC) approach iteratively classifies samples against semantically relevant categories by leveraging label descriptions for both retrieval and binary classification. The method demonstrates significant improvements in classification performance, achieving up to 20 absolute points higher F1 scores compared to naive approaches, while providing flexibility to trade between label quality and coverage through truncation.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC) as a zero-shot labeling method that combines semantic retrieval with iterative binary classification. The approach works by first retrieving the most semantically relevant categories using label descriptions, then performing binary classification against these candidates. RAC leverages label schema information to enhance classification accuracy, particularly effective for high-cardinality classification tasks. The method includes a truncation mechanism that allows trade-offs between label quality and coverage, making it adaptable to different use cases and quality requirements.

## Key Results
- RAC with label descriptions improves F1 scores by up to 20 absolute points compared to naive approaches
- On banking dataset, truncated RAC achieves 61.5% micro-F1 with 70.7% coverage
- The method enables efficient zero-shot labeling with open-source models while minimizing privacy and cost concerns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RAC works by integrating detailed label schema information into the classification process through semantic retrieval and iterative binary classification. By using label descriptions for both retrieving relevant categories and subsequent classification, the method creates a more informed classification pipeline that leverages the semantic richness of the label schema. The iterative approach allows the model to focus on the most relevant categories for each sample, reducing confusion in high-cardinality classification tasks. The truncation mechanism provides flexibility in balancing coverage and accuracy by allowing users to control how aggressively the model applies labels.

## Foundational Learning
**Semantic retrieval with label descriptions** - Needed to identify the most relevant categories before classification; Quick check: Verify that retrieved categories align with expected semantic content for sample texts.
**Iterative binary classification** - Required to handle high-cardinality classification by breaking it into manageable binary decisions; Quick check: Ensure binary classifiers maintain consistent accuracy across different category pairs.
**Label schema integration** - Essential for leveraging domain knowledge embedded in label descriptions; Quick check: Validate that label descriptions provide sufficient semantic context for accurate retrieval.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input text -> Semantic retrieval (using label descriptions) -> Binary classification (against candidates) -> Output labels -> (Optional) Truncation for quality/coverage trade-off

**Critical path:** The semantic retrieval step is critical as it determines which categories are considered for each sample, directly impacting classification accuracy.

**Design tradeoffs:** The paper trades computational efficiency for accuracy by using iterative binary classification rather than direct multi-class classification, but this approach scales better for high-cardinality problems.

**Failure signatures:** Poor retrieval quality due to inadequate label descriptions will cascade through the entire pipeline, resulting in incorrect classifications even if the binary classifier is accurate.

**First experiments:** 1) Test retrieval accuracy with different label description qualities, 2) Evaluate binary classification performance on retrieved candidates, 3) Measure coverage-quality trade-off across different truncation thresholds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, though the limitations section suggests areas for future work including validation across different domain contexts and more thorough analysis of privacy implications for production deployment.

## Limitations
- Comparisons primarily against naive baselines rather than state-of-the-art approaches may overstate relative improvements
- Lack of comparison with specialized banking classification approaches limits confidence in the 61.5% micro-F1 result
- Superficial analysis of privacy implications for deploying open-source models in production environments

## Confidence
- **20 absolute point F1 improvements:** Medium - methodologically sound but comparisons may be inflated
- **61.5% micro-F1 on banking dataset:** Medium - notable achievement but lacks comparison context
- **Privacy and cost benefits:** Low - claims made but analysis is superficial

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments comparing RAC against modern few-shot learning approaches and specialized text classification models, not just naive baselines
2. Test the method's robustness across different domain contexts beyond banking, including domains with different label distribution characteristics
3. Conduct a detailed analysis of privacy and security implications when deploying open-source LLMs in production environments, including model hosting and access control considerations
