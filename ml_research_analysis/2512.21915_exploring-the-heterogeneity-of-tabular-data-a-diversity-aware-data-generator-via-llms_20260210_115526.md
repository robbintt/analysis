# Exploring the Heterogeneity of Tabular Data: A Diversity-aware Data Generator via LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.21915
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21915
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: DATE reduces error rates by 23.75% on average with 100 generated samples on heterogeneous tabular datasets

## Executive Summary
DATE is a framework that addresses the challenge of generating diverse, high-quality synthetic tabular data by first partitioning data into heterogeneous distributions using Distribution-Guiding Rules (DGRs), then leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate data tailored to each distribution. The framework discovers DGRs through model sharing and top-down searching, refines them iteratively using decision tree reasoning as feedback, and employs a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm to balance diversity and quality in the final selection. Experiments across 10 datasets show DATE significantly outperforms GAN-based and standard LLM-based methods, improving both data utility and downstream model performance.

## Method Summary
DATE operates by first discovering DGRs that partition the data into coherent distributions, using model sharing to reduce computational complexity. For each partition, it generates synthetic data guided by LLMs, with decision tree reasoning providing interpretable feedback for iterative refinement of the DGRs. Finally, a Multi-Arm Bandit sampling algorithm selects the most diverse and high-quality synthetic examples to augment the original dataset, addressing the non-greedy selection problem inherent in heterogeneous data.

## Key Results
- DATE reduces error rates by 23.75% on average with just 100 generated samples
- Improves Direct Preference Optimization accuracy by 10.88%
- Outperforms GAN-based and LLM-based methods on heterogeneous tabular data generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Distribution-Guiding Rule (DGR) Discovery via Model Sharing
Heterogeneous tabular data can be partitioned into coherent distributions by discovering DNF-structured rules that satisfy an error threshold ρ, using model sharing to avoid redundant retraining. A top-down search constructs conjunctions of predicates from decision tree splits, reusing previously trained models when new DGRs share prefixes, reducing complexity from O(|domain| × |Φ|^d) to O(|T|² log|T|). Core assumption: data following the same distribution share predicate patterns expressible as conjunctions, and models trained on overlapping subsets generalize within error tolerance. Evidence anchors: [abstract], [Section III-B, Algorithm 1, Proposition 2], [corpus]. Break condition: when ρ is set too strictly (≤0.025), excessive partitioning causes overfitting and runtime explosion (Section V-D, Figure 6).

### Mechanism 2: Iterative DGR Refinement via Decision Tree Reasoning
LLMs can generate distribution-specific tabular data when guided by iteratively refined DGRs derived from decision tree prediction paths as interpretable feedback. For each partitioned subset, generated data is grouped by decision tree path, high-quality groups become new DGR-based examples, and an LLM optimizer proposes refined DGRs that would improve validation scores (bi-level optimization approximated via LLM reasoning). Core assumption: decision tree paths capture meaningful feature dependencies that LLMs can translate into improved generation rules. Evidence anchors: [abstract], [Section IV-A, Algorithm 2, Lines 7-19], [corpus]. Break condition: when iteration count I is excessive, synthetic data volume decreases (Figure 7b), suggesting diminishing returns from over-refinement.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Arm Bandit Sampling for Diversity-Quality Balance
Greedy selection of validation-best data fails for heterogeneous settings because it lacks the greedy-choice property; MAB-based sampling provably balances diversity and quality. Each DGR is treated as an "arm" with utility combining validation performance and diversity, measured via predicate overlap. The SAR algorithm selects arms iteratively with UCB-based exploration. Core assumption: diversity measured via DGR predicate overlap correlates with coverage of heterogeneous distributions. Evidence anchors: [abstract], [Section IV-B, Theorem 2, Algorithm 3, Definition 5], [corpus]. Break condition: when budget n is exhausted or best score bs stops improving (Algorithm 3 termination).

## Foundational Learning

- **Decision Tree Rule Extraction**
  - Why needed here: DGRs are derived from decision tree paths; understanding how predicates form conjunctions and how Gini impurity guides splits is essential for debugging DGR quality.
  - Quick check question: Given a trained decision tree, can you trace the path from root to leaf and express it as a conjunction of predicates?

- **Multi-Arm Bandit (Upper Confidence Bound)**
  - Why needed here: MDS uses UCB-style exploration to balance exploiting high-validation arms and exploring diverse DGRs. The regret bound in Proposition 5 relies on MAB theory.
  - Quick check question: Why does UCB add a confidence bonus to estimated rewards, and how does this prevent premature convergence?

- **In-Context Learning with LLMs**
  - Why needed here: DATE uses prompt-based generation without fine-tuning. DGR-based examples condition the LLM to generate distribution-aligned data.
  - Quick check question: How does the quality and relevance of in-context examples affect LLM output distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: DGR Discovery (Algorithm 1) -> Prompt Constructor -> Iterative Generator (Algorithm 2) -> MDS Selector (Algorithm 3) -> Final augmented data
- **Critical path**: Error threshold ρ → controls partition granularity → directly affects DGR quality and downstream generation; Decision tree model quality → determines predicate relevance → affects LLM guidance quality; Weight α in MDS → balances diversity vs quality → determines final data utility
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - ρ (error threshold): Lower → finer partitions, better coverage, but more model retraining and overfitting risk. Default: ρ=0.05 (classification), ρ=10 (regression)
  - Iteration count I: More iterations → potentially better DGRs, but synthetic data volume may decrease. Default: I=3
  - Quality weight α: Higher → prioritizes validation performance; lower → prioritizes diversity. Default: α=0.8
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Over-partitioning: Too many small subsets with ρ too strict → runtime explosion, overfitting (Figure 6)
  - Mode collapse: Using greedy selection instead of MDS → discards diverse iterations (Theorem 2, Table III shows BGS/FGS underperform MDS)
  - Catastrophic forgetting: Excessive iterations in baseline methods cause performance degradation (EPIC-III worse than EPIC-II on some datasets in Table I)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate DGR Discovery: Run Algorithm 1 on a single heterogeneous dataset (e.g., Credit or California). Measure: (a) number of partitions, (b) average partition error rate, (c) runtime with vs without model sharing. Compare to Table I "DATE (w/ examples)" baseline.
  2. Ablate Generation Strategies: On 2-3 datasets, compare DATE variants: (a) w/o decision tree reasoning, (b) w/o DGR optimization, (c) full DATE. Use Table II error rates as reference targets.
  3. Validate MDS vs Greedy: On a heterogeneous dataset with high class imbalance, compare MDS against FGS, BGS, and Top-5 greedy selection. Measure final test error and diversity (using Definition 5's overlap metric). Target: MDS should achieve >1% error reduction over greedy methods (per Table III).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The heterogeneity assumption (data follows distinct distributions identifiable via DNF rules) is strong and may not hold for smoothly varying or high-dimensional continuous features
- Model sharing optimization assumes predicate reuse patterns are common, but this may fail in sparse or irregular data
- Decision tree paths as LLM guidance may not generalize well when features are highly correlated or when the tree is deep and paths become brittle
- The MAB diversity metric (predicate overlap) is simplistic and may not capture semantic diversity in high-cardinality categorical features

## Confidence
- **High**: Error reduction (23.75%) and LLM reasoning improvement (10.88%) are directly measurable and well-supported by ablation studies
- **Medium**: Model sharing complexity claims (O(|T|² log|T|) vs O(|domain| × |Φ|^d)) are mathematically sound but rely on ideal DGR structure assumptions
- **Low**: Decision tree reasoning + LLM refinement mechanism is innovative but lacks strong external validation; the bi-level optimization approximation via LLM reasoning is not rigorously proven

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness to ρ Sensitivity**: Systematically vary ρ across [0.01, 0.15] on 5 heterogeneous datasets. Measure: (a) number of partitions, (b) average partition error, (c) final test accuracy, (d) runtime. Confirm whether default ρ=0.05 is near-optimal or dataset-dependent.
2. **Cross-Dataset Transfer of DGRs**: Train DGRs on one dataset (e.g., Credit) and use them to guide generation on a different dataset (e.g., Electricity). Measure: (a) generation quality degradation, (b) diversity coverage. This tests whether DGRs capture generalizable feature patterns or dataset-specific artifacts.
3. **Decision Tree Path Interpretability**: For each DGR in DATE, extract the decision tree path used for refinement. Manually inspect 10 paths per dataset to verify: (a) paths are meaningful (e.g., "age > 40 AND income > 50k"), (b) paths avoid spurious correlations, (c) paths align with domain knowledge. Quantify the fraction of paths that are interpretable vs arbitrary.
