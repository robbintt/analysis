# OPTIC-ER: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Real-Time Emergency Response and Equitable Resource Allocation in Underserved African Communities

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.12943
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12943
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 100.00% optimal action selection rate on 500 unseen incidents using attention-guided actor-critic architecture with precomputed Travel Time Atlas.

## Executive Summary
OPTIC-ER is a reinforcement learning framework designed to optimize emergency response and resource allocation in underserved African communities, particularly in Rivers State, Nigeria. The core innovation is an attention-guided actor-critic architecture that uses a Context-Rich State Vector to encode dispatch sub-optimality and a Precision Reward Function to penalize inefficiency. The system leverages a precomputed Travel Time Atlas built from real road networks to enable rapid, real-time dispatch decisions. Evaluations on 500 unseen incidents showed a 100.00% optimal action selection rate, meaning the agent consistently selected the facility with the minimum travel time. Additionally, the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring Dashboards to support proactive governance. Built under the TALS framework, OPTIC-ER demonstrates how context-aware AI can deliver measurable impact in low-resource settings while advancing equitable public service delivery.

## Method Summary
The system uses a single-step emergency dispatch task modeled as episodic MDP with discrete action space over 184 facilities. The agent takes incident category and precomputed travel times from a Travel Time Atlas as input, encoded in a Context-Rich State Vector that includes normalized travel times and inefficiency deltas. An attention-based actor-critic architecture (A2C with GAE) processes this state to select the optimal facility. The Precision Reward Function penalizes sub-optimal dispatch times. Training used 2,000 incidents (60% clustered, 40% random) over 3,500 epochs with a NVIDIA T4 GPU. The Travel Time Atlas was precomputed via multi-source Dijkstra on OSM road networks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100.00% optimal action selection rate on 500 held-out challenge incidents
- Outperformed nearest-neighbor heuristic (62.94%) and standard MLP RL (2.54%) baselines
- Successfully generated Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring Dashboards for governance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Attention-based architectures resolve the credit assignment problem in large, sparse dispatch action spaces where standard Deep RL fails.
- **Mechanism**: The model computes relevance scores between incident embeddings and facility embeddings. By weighting facility features based on their relevance to the specific incident, the attention layer directs gradient updates toward high-probability actions, preventing the signal dilution observed in standard MLPs.
- **Core assumption**: The optimal dispatch decision can be represented as a learned mapping from incident context to facility features, rather than requiring combinatorial search.
- **Evidence anchors**: Section 4.3 shows MLP-based agent achieved only 2.54% optimality vs 100% for attention model; Section 3.4 describes attention layer computing relevance scores.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Explicitly encoding "inefficiency deltas" (relative sub-optimality) in the state vector transforms a reinforcement search problem into a guided pattern recognition task.
- **Mechanism**: The Context-Rich State Vector includes $\delta_{norm}(t_{ij}, t^*_i)$ for every facility. Instead of the agent discovering the concept of "shortest path" via trial-and-error, it learns to recognize the feature pattern corresponding to a zero-delta, significantly reducing sample complexity.
- **Core assumption**: The precomputed "optimal" time ($t^*_i$) is a stable and reliable ground truth that does not fluctuate wildly during the training window.
- **Evidence anchors**: Section 3.3 states it transforms the agent's task from a complex search problem into a more tractable pattern recognition challenge; Abstract mentions encoding sub-optimality of dispatch actions.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Decoupling graph computation from the inference loop via a Travel Time Atlas enables real-time decision-making in low-resource settings (TALS framework).
- **Mechanism**: By precomputing an $N \times M$ matrix of all-pairs shortest paths offline, the system replaces expensive runtime Dijkstra calculations with $O(1)$ lookups. This ensures the "Thin computing" constraint is met for deployment on limited hardware.
- **Core assumption**: The road network topology and average speeds remain sufficiently static to justify a precomputed approach over live routing API calls.
- **Evidence anchors**: Section 3.2 describes Travel Time Atlas as core tenet of Thin computing pillar; Section 1 explains it enables rapid evaluation based on actual travel time.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Credit Assignment Problem**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper explicitly claims standard RL fails because it cannot trace the reward (fast response) back to the specific facility choice among 184 options in a sparse vector.
  - **Quick check question**: If the agent picks Facility 5 and gets a good reward, how does it know it wasn't just because the incident happened to be close to Facility 5 by chance?

- **Concept: Actor-Critic (A2C) with GAE**
  - **Why needed here**: The agent uses an Actor (to pick the facility) and a Critic (to estimate value), stabilized by Generalized Advantage Estimation to reduce variance in gradient updates.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does the system need a Critic if we already have a precise "Precision Reward Function" telling the agent how well it did?

- **Concept: Action Masking**
  - **Why needed here**: The system uses action masking to prevent the agent from selecting unreachable facilities or incorrect facility types (e.g., sending a fire truck to a clinic).
  - **Quick check question**: How does masking differ from a negative reward penalty in terms of learning efficiency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw OSM Data → Graph Processing → Travel Time Atlas → Incident + Atlas Lookup → Context-Rich State Vector → AttentionActorCritic → Softmax → Facility Selection → Dispatch + Infrastructure Deficiency Map

- **Critical path**: The correct construction of the Context-Rich State Vector. If the "inefficiency delta" is calculated incorrectly relative to the oracle, the "pattern" the agent learns will be distorted.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Static vs. Dynamic: The system trades real-time traffic awareness (dynamic) for computational speed and deployability on low-cost hardware (static Atlas).
  - RL vs. Optimization: Instead of solving a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with a solver, the system learns the policy, which allows for generalization to unseen incidents but requires high-fidelity simulation data.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Data Disconnection: If OSM data contains disconnected subgraphs, the Atlas will return `np.nan`, triggering Action Masking; if not handled, the agent may learn to avoid entire regions.
  - Overfitting to Atlas: The agent achieves 100% optimality on the Atlas's logic, which may not match real-world driving conditions (e.g., informal shortcuts not in OSM).

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation on State Vector: Retrain the agent using only geometric distance (Euclidean) instead of the Travel Time Atlas features to quantify the performance drop (should drop from 100% toward the 63% heuristic baseline).
  2. Noise Injection in Atlas: Add random noise to the Travel Time Atlas lookup to simulate real-time traffic variance and observe the degradation in "Optimal Action %" (robustness test).
  3. Capacity Constraints: Modify the simulation to mark facilities as "busy" (unavailable) and observe if the single-agent policy collapses or adapts (stress test for future multi-agent requirements).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How can the static Travel Time Atlas be replaced with dynamic inputs to handle stochastic real-time traffic conditions?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 5.5 identifies "Dynamic Routing with Real-Time Data" as the most critical future enhancement.
  - **Why unresolved**: The current agent relies on a precomputed matrix assuming constant average speeds, which ignores congestion and temporary road closures.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Integration with a live traffic API (e.g., Google Maps) and the successful formulation of the problem as a Partially Observable MDP (POMDP).

- **Open Question 2**: How can the framework be extended to model finite facility capacity and limited ambulance availability?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 5.4 lists the assumption of "unlimited resource capacity" as a primary limitation.
  - **Why unresolved**: The current simulation assumes facilities always have resources available, which does not reflect real-world constraints like bed shortages.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Evolution of the architecture to a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) system capable of coordinating fleet resources.

- **Open Question 3**: Does the agent's simulated 100% optimality rate persist during live "shadow mode" trials compared to human dispatchers?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 5.5 outlines a deployment pathway beginning with a "shadow mode" trial to validate recommendations.
  - **Why unresolved**: Current results are simulation-based; real-world performance may degrade due to data gaps (e.g., missing roads in OSM) not present in the model.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Quantitative results from field trials measuring the agent's recommendation acceptance rate and actual response times against human experts.

## Limitations

- The 100.00% optimal action selection is based on a single run on a precomputed Travel Time Atlas, not real-world routing data.
- The system assumes static travel times and does not account for dynamic factors like traffic congestion, weather, or real-time road closures.
- The single-agent design handles only one incident at a time and cannot manage competing resource demands.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core architectural claims (attention-based actor-critic outperforming MLP baseline from 2.54% to 100%) and the Travel Time Atlas concept for real-time dispatch are well-supported by ablation results and computational reasoning.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about state vector design improving sample efficiency and the TALS framework enabling deployment on low-resource hardware are plausible but lack direct empirical validation beyond single-run results.
- **Low Confidence**: The 100.00% optimality claim requires replication, as it may reflect overfitting to the static Atlas rather than generalizable policy learning.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Retrain with Euclidean distance instead of Travel Time Atlas features; expect performance to drop from 100% toward the 63% heuristic baseline, confirming the Atlas's contribution.
2. **Dynamic Robustness**: Inject random noise into Atlas travel times to simulate real-time traffic variance; measure degradation in optimal action percentage to assess policy robustness.
3. **Scalability Test**: Increase facility count by 10× and measure attention computation time and policy performance to identify bottlenecks in the attention mechanism.
