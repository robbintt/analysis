- This study introduces a gamified XAI system that supports ethically aware consumer decision-making in the coffee domain using dual symbolic engines with a meta-explanation framework.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a gamified XAI system that supports ethically aware consumer decision-making in the coffee domain. The system employs two symbolic engines: a Kantian module that flags deontic rule violations (e.g., child labor, deforestation risk, opaque supply chains) and a utilitarian module that scores options using weighted multi-criteria aggregation over normalized ethical attributes. A meta-explainer, operating with a 0.2 regret bound, detects and resolves conflicts between Kantian and utilitarian recommendations by switching to a deontically clean option when welfare loss is small.

Across six coffee rounds with three options each, the combined Kantian-utilitarian meta-explanation condition achieved 75% violation-free selections and preserved near-utilitarian welfare (0.702 vs. price baseline), resolving 25% of Kantian-utilitarian conflicts. This demonstrates a tunable trade-off: Kantian-only ensured 100% deontic compliance at some welfare cost, while utilitarian-only maximized welfare but tolerated rule breaches. The dual-logic XAI approach makes normative tensions explicit and actionable for consumers.

## Method Summary
The study employed a gamified XAI system where participants selected coffee options across six rounds, each presenting three choices. Two symbolic engines operated in parallel: a Kantian module flagging deontic violations (child labor, deforestation, opaque supply chains) and a utilitarian module scoring options via weighted multi-criteria aggregation over normalized ethical attributes. A meta-explanation component with 0.2 regret bound resolved conflicts between the two approaches by switching to deontically clean options when welfare loss was minimal. The system used 11 coffee attributes, with five considered "violation-prone" (organic, fair-trade, child-labor, deforestation, supply-chain transparency) and six additional ethical dimensions (animal-welfare, packaging, water-usage, carbon-footprint, farmers-welfare, charity-contribution).

## Key Results
- Combined Kantian-utilitarian meta-explanation condition achieved 75% violation-free selections across six coffee rounds
- Preserved near-utilitarian welfare (0.702 vs. price baseline of 0.691) while resolving 25% of Kantian-utilitarian conflicts
- Demonstrated tunable trade-off: Kantian-only ensured 100% deontic compliance at some welfare cost, while utilitarian-only maximized welfare but tolerated rule breaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by providing dual ethical reasoning frameworks that complement each other's blind spots. The Kantian module enforces categorical rules that protect fundamental ethical principles, while the utilitarian module optimizes for overall welfare across multiple dimensions. The meta-explainer acts as a conflict resolution layer that can identify when rule violations are minor enough to tolerate for significant welfare gains, or when rule compliance should override marginal utility improvements. This architecture makes explicit the trade-offs between absolute ethical principles and consequentialist optimization, allowing consumers to understand both the rules being broken and the overall welfare implications of their choices.

## Foundational Learning
- **Deontic Logic**: Needed to formally represent ethical rules and violations; quick check: can the system correctly identify child labor as a violation regardless of other benefits
- **Multi-criteria Decision Analysis**: Required for weighted attribute aggregation in utilitarian scoring; quick check: do attribute weights reflect actual consumer preferences
- **Regret Minimization**: Essential for the meta-explainer's conflict resolution strategy; quick check: does the 0.2 regret bound prevent catastrophic ethical compromises
- **Symbolic AI Reasoning**: Core to both Kantian and utilitarian engines for transparent rule application; quick check: are explanations understandable to non-expert consumers
- **Gamified Decision Support**: Framework for engaging consumers in ethical reasoning; quick check: does the game format maintain user engagement across multiple rounds

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Interface -> Dual Symbolic Engines (Kantian + Utilitarian) -> Meta-Explainer -> Decision Output
**Critical Path**: User selects option → Both engines evaluate → Meta-explainer resolves conflicts → Final recommendation with explanation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Absolute rule compliance (Kantian) vs. flexible optimization (utilitarian); transparency vs. cognitive load; simplicity vs. ethical nuance
**Failure Signatures**: Meta-explainer deadlock when both options have equal regret; user disengagement due to complexity; attribute weighting mismatches with actual preferences
**First Experiments**: 1) Test conflict resolution with synthetic coffee options spanning the ethical spectrum 2) Validate meta-explainer regret bound with human evaluators 3) Measure user comprehension of dual-logic explanations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Controlled lab setting with 33 participants limits generalizability to real-world purchasing contexts
- Domain-specific focus on coffee ethics may not translate to other product categories
- Binary violation framing of Kantian rules may oversimplify nuanced ethical considerations

## Confidence
- Meta-explainer regret bound and conflict resolution effectiveness: High
- Combined Kantian-utilitarian performance superiority over single-logic approaches: Medium (based on limited participant sample)
- Real-world applicability of gamified XAI framework: Low (requires field validation)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct field studies with actual consumers making coffee purchases to verify lab findings hold in naturalistic settings
2. Test the meta-explanation approach across multiple product categories (e.g., electronics, clothing) to assess domain transferability
3. Implement adaptive weight-learning for the utilitarian engine to capture individual preference variation rather than fixed weights
