# AdInject: Real-World Black-Box Attacks on Web Agents via Advertising Delivery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.21499
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21499
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Presents AdInject, a real-world black-box attack method targeting VLM-based Web Agents through internet advertising delivery, achieving success rates exceeding 60% and approaching 100% in certain cases

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AdInject, a novel black-box attack method that exploits internet advertising delivery systems to inject malicious static content into web pages, thereby deceiving Vision-Language Model (VLM) based Web Agents. Unlike prior attacks, AdInject operates under a realistic threat model with no access to agent internals, static content constraints, and no knowledge of user intent. The method leverages advertising platforms to deliver deceptive ads that frame clicking as necessary for task completion, using VLM-based optimization to infer potential user intents and make ads appear relevant. Experimental evaluations on VisualWebArena and OSWorld benchmarks demonstrate attack success rates exceeding 60% in most scenarios and approaching 100% in certain cases.

## Method Summary
AdInject operates by exploiting advertising delivery systems to inject malicious static content (text, images, links) into web pages viewed by VLM-based Web Agents. The attack method includes strategies for designing deceptive ad content that frames clicking as necessary for task completion. A VLM-based optimization technique infers potential user intents from the target website context to make ads appear more relevant. The attack works under a realistic black-box threat model with no access to agent internals or user intent, using only static content injection through advertising platforms.

## Key Results
- Attack success rates exceeding 60% in most scenarios
- Success rates approaching 100% in certain cases
- Demonstrated effectiveness on both VisualWebArena and OSWorld benchmarks
- Operates under realistic black-box threat model with no agent internals access

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AdInject exploits the fundamental vulnerability of VLM-based Web Agents: their reliance on visual and textual cues for decision-making without deeper semantic understanding of user intent. By injecting deceptive advertising content that appears contextually relevant to the task at hand, the attack manipulates the agent's perception of what actions are necessary for task completion. The VLM-based optimization component infers potential user intents from the website context, allowing the attacker to craft ads that align with what the agent expects to see, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful deception.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision-Language Models (VLMs): Why needed - Core technology enabling Web Agents to process visual and textual web content; Quick check - Understanding how VLMs combine image and text processing for decision-making
- Black-box attack methodology: Why needed - Represents realistic threat model without requiring agent internals access; Quick check - Analyzing attack effectiveness without privileged information
- Advertising delivery systems: Why needed - Real-world vector for content injection; Quick check - Understanding how ads are served and displayed on web pages
- Static content injection: Why needed - Exploits limitations of VLM processing; Quick check - Assessing impact of injected content on agent decision-making
- Intent inference through VLMs: Why needed - Enables contextually relevant ad generation; Quick check - Evaluating how well inferred intents match actual user goals

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: AdInject -> Advertising Platform -> Web Page -> VLM-based Web Agent
Critical path: Attacker creates deceptive ads -> Ads delivered through advertising platform -> Ads appear on target web pages -> Web Agent processes page content -> Agent makes decisions based on injected content
Design tradeoffs: Static content vs. dynamic content injection, content relevance vs. detectability, attack stealth vs. effectiveness
Failure signatures: Agent fails to complete tasks, agent takes unexpected actions, agent ignores injected content
First experiments: 1) Baseline effectiveness test on simple web pages, 2) Intent inference accuracy evaluation, 3) Cross-platform attack success rate comparison

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Scalability across diverse advertising platforms remains unclear
- Real-world deployment feasibility may be limited by platform-specific restrictions
- Focus on static content may not capture dynamic web environment complexity

## Confidence
- Real-world deployment feasibility: Medium
- Attack success rates generalization: Medium
- VLM-based optimization effectiveness: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct real-world deployment tests on multiple advertising platforms to assess scalability and feasibility across different environments
2. Evaluate AdInject effectiveness against web agents with advanced defensive mechanisms like content verification and user interaction monitoring
3. Test VLM-based optimization technique robustness on diverse and dynamically changing web environments to assess generalizability
