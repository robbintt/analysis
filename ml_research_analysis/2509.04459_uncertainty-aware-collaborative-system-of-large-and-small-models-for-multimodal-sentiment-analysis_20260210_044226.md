# Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System of Large and Small Models for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.04459
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04459
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves SOTA multimodal sentiment analysis performance with up to 67% runtime reduction through uncertainty-aware routing between lightweight and MLLM models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces U-ACS, a novel uncertainty-aware collaborative system that combines a lightweight Uncertainty-aware Baseline Model (UBM) with powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for multimodal sentiment analysis. The system addresses the performance-efficiency trade-off by routing samples based on uncertainty estimates, with the UBM handling confident predictions and escalating uncertain samples to MLLMs for deeper analysis. To overcome the challenge of uncertainty estimation in regression tasks, the authors innovatively convert continuous sentiment prediction to a classification problem using entropy-based uncertainty quantification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-ACS achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while significantly reducing computational costs.

## Method Summary
U-ACS employs a three-stage progressive processing pipeline. First, a lightweight UBM with dual regression/classification heads processes all samples and computes classification entropy as uncertainty. Samples with uncertainty below threshold τ₁ are accepted directly. Samples exceeding τ₁ are escalated to MLLM for refinement, which applies its own uncertainty threshold τ₂. When both models are uncertain and disagree on polarity, a third stage performs cross-verification through enhanced prompts. The system uses weighted averaging for similar polarity predictions and MLLM reasoning for conflicting ones. Thresholds are calibrated via Gaussian fitting on validation uncertainty distributions.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MOSI, MOSEI, and CH-SIMS benchmark datasets
- Reduces inference runtime by up to 67% compared to standalone MLLMs
- Maintains or improves classification accuracy (Acc2, F1) while accepting minor regression metric trade-offs
- Demonstrates effective uncertainty-based routing with low escalation rates to expensive MLLM processing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Uncertainty-based cascade routing reduces computational overhead while preserving accuracy.
- Mechanism: The UBM computes entropy-based uncertainty for each sample. Samples below threshold τ₁ are accepted immediately; uncertain samples escalate to MLLM. The MLLM applies a second threshold τ₂ for further filtering. Only samples failing both thresholds receive full Stage 3 processing.
- Core assumption: High predictive entropy correlates with sample difficulty, and easy samples can be reliably identified by a lightweight model.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "routing samples based on uncertainty estimates, with the UBM handling confident predictions and escalating uncertain samples to MLLMs"; [section III-E] "Stage 1: UBM processing... If the uncertainty is below the adaptive validation-calibrated threshold τ₁, accept this prediction directly. Otherwise, proceed to the MLLM Refinement Stage"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Converting regression to classification enables tractable uncertainty estimation.
- Mechanism: Instead of directly estimating uncertainty on continuous sentiment scores, the UBM discretizes labels into three classes (negative, neutral, positive) via Eq. 6. A shared multimodal representation feeds both a regression head and a classification head (Eq. 7). Uncertainty is computed as Shannon entropy over the 3-class softmax distribution (Eq. 8).
- Core assumption: Classification entropy meaningfully reflects regression-task uncertainty; hard samples for classification correlate with hard samples for intensity prediction.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "innovatively convert continuous sentiment prediction to a classification problem using entropy-based uncertainty quantification"; [section III-C-4] "To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we propose a classification-based entropy approach... enabling the estimation of predictive uncertainty by computing the entropy of the output probability distribution"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-verification with prior predictions resolves high-uncertainty, conflicting outputs.
- Mechanism: When UBM and MLLM agree on polarity but both are uncertain, perform uncertainty-weighted averaging (Eq. 15). When polarity disagrees, construct an enhanced prompt embedding both prior predictions and uncertainties, then invoke a second MLLM pass (Eq. 16).
- Core assumption: Prior predictions provide informative context; MLLM can leverage contradictory signals to refine reasoning.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "weighted averaging for predictions of similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting predictions"; [section IV-K] Ablation: "W/o Cross-Verification" drops Acc2 by 1.4 points on MOSI and 0.7 points on SIMS

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Predictive Entropy as Uncertainty**
  - Why needed here: The entire routing logic depends on interpreting softmax entropy as a reliability signal.
  - Quick check question: For a 3-class distribution [0.8, 0.1, 0.1] vs. [0.4, 0.3, 0.3], which has higher entropy and what does that imply about confidence?

- Concept: **Cascade/Deferral Systems**
  - Why needed here: U-ACS is a deferral system where a cheap model handles easy cases and escalates hard cases.
  - Quick check question: If 80% of samples have low uncertainty and τ₁ is set conservatively, what happens to overall inference cost?

- Concept: **MLLM Prompt Engineering for Numeric Tasks**
  - Why needed here: Stage 3 injects prior predictions into prompts; formatting affects whether the model reasons or mimics.
  - Quick check question: How should prior predictions be presented—in numeric form, text descriptions, or both—to maximize corrective reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - UBM (BERT + LSTM encoders) -> dual heads (regression + classification) -> uncertainty = entropy
  -> Threshold τ₁ -> accept or escalate to MLLM
  - MLLM (HumanOmni/VideoLLaMO2 + LoRA) -> uncertainty -> Threshold τ₂ -> accept, weighted average, or cross-verification
  - Cross-verification -> enhanced prompt with prior predictions/uncertainties -> final MLLM pass

- Critical path:
  1. All samples → UBM → compute uˢ
  2. If uˢ ≤ τ₁: accept ŷˢ, done
  3. Else → MLLM Stage 2 → compute uₗ
  4. If uₗ ≤ τ₂: accept ŷₗ, done
  5. Else → check polarity agreement: if same → weighted average (Eq. 15); if different → Stage 3 cross-verification (Eq. 16)
  6. Concatenate outputs from all stages (Eq. 17)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Lower τ values → more samples to MLLM → higher accuracy, higher cost
  - Higher τ values → more UBM reliance → faster, but potential accuracy drop on edge cases
  - The paper explicitly trades MAE/Corr for Acc2/F1 and efficiency (Section IV-E discussion)

- Failure signatures:
  - **Over-escalation**: Runtime approaches standalone MLLM; check τ calibration
  - **Under-escalation**: Acc2 drops significantly; τ may be too high or UBM uncertainty estimator is miscalibrated
  - **Stage 3 stagnation**: Cross-verification predictions match prior outputs without correction; prompt design may be inducing copy behavior

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Threshold sensitivity sweep**: Vary λ ∈ [0.1, 0.9] (Eq. 19) on validation set; plot Acc2 vs. runtime to identify Pareto frontier
  2. **Uncertainty calibration check**: On validation data, compute correlation between entropy uˢ and absolute regression error |ŷˢ − y|; if weak, CBE assumption may not hold
  3. **Stage-wise ablation**: Disable Stage 3 cross-verification and measure Acc2/MAE change; quantify how many samples reach Stage 3 and their correction rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS) be modified to better optimize regression metrics (MAE, Corr) alongside classification accuracy, rather than accepting the current trade-off where precision in sentiment intensity is sacrificed for efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly acknowledges in Section IV.E that the framework creates a "deliberate trade-off." While U-ACS improves binary accuracy (Acc2) and F1-scores, it notes that the standalone MLLM "naturally excels at metrics like MAE and Corr," and U-ACS accepts a "minor, and acceptable, cost of precision in sentiment intensity prediction."
- Why unresolved: The current design optimizes for discrete polarity (positive/negative/neutral) to calculate entropy for routing. This routing logic naturally prioritizes getting the category right rather than the exact continuous value, creating a ceiling for regression performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modification to the loss function or routing mechanism that incorporates continuous-value error bounds into the uncertainty estimation, demonstrating improved MAE/Corr scores compared to the current U-ACS baseline while maintaining efficiency gains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the Classification-based Entropy (CBE) method accurately capture the true uncertainty of the original continuous sentiment regression task, particularly for samples located near the artificial discretization boundaries?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper proposes converting regression to a 3-class classification task (Eq. 6) to calculate entropy because "continuous outputs... hinder the calculation of corresponding uncertainty." This assumes that the uncertainty of a coarse classification (positive/negative) serves as a sufficient proxy for the uncertainty of a fine-grained regression score.
- Why unresolved: A sample with a true score of +0.1 (weak positive) might be classified as "Positive" with high confidence by the classifier, despite being very close to the "Neutral" boundary in the regression space. The paper does not verify if classification entropy correlates perfectly with regression difficulty.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis comparing the correlation between the CBE uncertainty scores and the actual regression errors (MAE) of the baseline model, specifically focusing on samples near the y=0 discretization boundaries to see if "confident" classification predictions mask high regression errors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the Gaussian-fitting threshold selection strategy (τ₁, τ₂) when the system encounters significant domain shifts or out-of-distribution (OOD) data where the validation set statistics may not apply?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section III.F describes the threshold determination as relying on the mean uncertainty of correctly vs. incorrectly predicted samples on the validation set. The paper assumes the test data follows a similar uncertainty distribution, which is a common assumption that often fails in real-world, dynamic deployment scenarios.
- Why unresolved: If the test data is significantly harder or different from the validation data, the "correct" vs. "incorrect" uncertainty distributions will shift, potentially rendering the fixed τ₁ and τ₂ values suboptimal (e.g., routing too many easy samples to the MLLM or accepting too many hard samples from the UBM).
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments involving cross-dataset testing (e.g., training/tuning thresholds on CMU-MOSI and evaluating on CH-SIMS without retuning thresholds) to observe the stability of the performance-efficiency trade-off under distribution shift.

## Limitations
- The framework accepts a trade-off between regression precision (MAE/Corr) and classification accuracy/efficiency
- Classification-to-regression uncertainty correlation may not hold uniformly across diverse datasets
- Cross-verification mechanism adds computational cost when triggered frequently
- Three-stage complexity may impact real-world deployment beyond controlled benchmarks

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Computational efficiency gains (67% runtime reduction) are well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: State-of-the-art performance claims on benchmark datasets are supported but may have limited generalizability
- **Medium Confidence**: Classification-to-regression uncertainty correlation assumption is reasonable but requires validation on diverse datasets

## Next Checks
1. **Uncertainty Calibration Validation**: On a held-out validation set, compute the correlation coefficient between UBM classification entropy (uˢ) and absolute regression error (|ŷˢ − y|) to verify the foundational assumption that classification uncertainty predicts regression difficulty.

2. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the routing threshold λ parameter (Eq. 19) across its full range and plot the Pareto frontier of Acc2 vs. inference time to identify optimal operating points for different deployment scenarios.

3. **Cross-Verification Effectiveness Test**: Measure the Stage 3 correction rate by tracking how many samples actually receive updated predictions after cross-verification, and whether these corrections improve metrics compared to simple weighted averaging.
