# Composite Data Augmentations for Synthetic Image Detection Against Real-World Perturbations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.11490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11490
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Composite augmentations (JPEG compression, Gaussian blur, color inversion) achieved +22.53% mAP gain for synthetic image detection under real-world perturbations.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses synthetic image detection under real-world perturbations through composite data augmentations. The authors propose a dual-criteria optimization framework combining classification accuracy with feature similarity regularization. Using a greedy search approach with genetic algorithm exploration, they identify optimal augmentation combinations that improve detection robustness against compression, blurring, and noise. The best-performing model achieves 22.53% mAP improvement over baseline models without augmentations, demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted augmentation strategies for synthetic image forensics.

## Method Summary
The method employs ResNet-50 backbone with binary classification head for synthetic image detection. Training uses ProGAN dataset (720K samples, 20 LSUN categories) with composite data augmentations selected through greedy search and genetic algorithm exploration. The dual-criteria loss combines binary cross-entropy classification loss with feature similarity regularization between perturbed and unperturbed image pairs. Key augmentations include JPEG compression, Gaussian blur, and color inversion, each applied with 0.5 probability. The approach is evaluated on ForenSynths benchmark plus StyleGAN2 and Which Face Is Real datasets under five perturbation scenarios.

## Key Results
- Best-performing model (JPEG + Gaussian blur + color inversion) achieved +22.53% mAP gain over baseline without augmentations
- Dual-criteria approach improved accuracy by 1.39%-4.08% while maintaining mAP performance
- Optimal augmentation subset size identified as 3 augmentations; additional augmentations degraded performance
- Combined perturbations (JPEG + blur + noise) caused 6%-18% absolute mAP drop compared to unperturbed images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Exposing models to perturbation-mimicking augmentations during training improves detection robustness under real-world distortions. Training with JPEG compression, Gaussian blur, and color inversion forces the model to learn features that remain discriminative even after images undergo similar transformations during online sharing. Core assumption: augmentations sufficiently approximate real-world perturbations. Evidence: 22.53% mAP gain with optimal augmentation combination. Break condition: if augmentations fundamentally alter forensic artifacts that distinguish synthetic from real images.

### Mechanism 2
Feature similarity regularization between perturbed and unperturbed image pairs stabilizes predictions without sacrificing discriminability. The dual-criteria loss (L_tot = λ₁L_cls + λ₂L_ft) jointly optimizes classification accuracy and feature consistency, enforcing perturbation-invariant representations. Core assumption: feature extractor can maintain class-discriminative information while minimizing perturbation-induced variance. Evidence: 1.39%-4.08% accuracy improvement with dual-criteria approach. Break condition: if λ₂ is too high, model may over-prioritize feature matching at expense of classification sharpness.

### Mechanism 3
A small, strategically selected augmentation subset outperforms both individual augmentations and larger augmentation sets. Greedy search identifies complementary augmentations that address different perturbation types without excessively distorting original image features. Core assumption: augmentations have diminishing or negative returns beyond optimal subset size due to cumulative feature distortion. Evidence: 3 augmentations optimal; more than this reduced effectiveness. Break condition: if deployment perturbations differ qualitatively from training augmentations, selected subset may not transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss for Binary Classification
  - Why needed here: Primary classification objective (L_cls) uses BCE to distinguish synthetic from real images
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why BCE is preferred over MSE for binary classification tasks?

- Concept: Feature-Level Contrastive/Consistency Learning
  - Why needed here: Second loss criterion (L_ft) requires understanding how minimizing feature distance between perturbed/unperturbed pairs enforces invariance
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between using MSE vs. Cosine Similarity for measuring feature consistency?

- Concept: Genetic Algorithm for Hyperparameter/Search Space Exploration
  - Why needed here: Paper uses GA to explore combinatorial augmentation space; understanding fitness functions, selection, crossover, and mutation is required
  - Quick check question: How does tournament selection differ from roulette wheel selection in genetic algorithms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input Layer (ProGAN images) -> Augmentation Module (JPEG, Gaussian Blur, Color Invert + Random Flip/Crop) -> ResNet-50 Backbone -> Classification Head (binary output) -> Loss Module (BCE + optional Cosine/MSE similarity)

- Critical path:
  1. Load image → Apply augmentation pipeline (training only)
  2. Forward pass through ResNet-50 → Extract feature vector
  3. Classification head → Binary logits → Sigmoid → Prediction
  4. Compute L_cls (BCE); if dual-criteria, also compute L_ft between perturbed/unperturbed feature vectors
  5. Backpropagate L_tot = λ₁L_cls + λ₂L_ft

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Greedy vs. Genetic Algorithm search: Greedy achieved higher mAP (78.31%) with less compute; GA showed marginal improvement (71.42% → 71.53%) but may scale better with more resources
  - Augmentation count: 3 augmentations optimal; beyond this, cumulative distortion degrades features
  - λ₁/λ₂ balance: λ₂=0.2 improved accuracy (1.39%-4.08%) but did not increase mAP—useful when prediction stability matters more than ranking

- Failure signatures:
  - Combined perturbations (JPEG + Blur + Noise): 6%-18% absolute mAP drop vs. unperturbed
  - High-resolution datasets under resizing: 28.26%-42.11% mAP drop (e.g., Seeing in the Dark, WFIR)
  - AutoAugment: Improved unperturbed mAP (96.15%) but reduced robustness under perturbations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline reproduction: Train ResNet-50 on ProGAN without augmentations, evaluate on ForenSynths to establish mAP baseline
  2. Single augmentation ablation: Train separate models with JPEG, Gaussian Blur, and Color Invert individually; compare mAP gains to identify best starting augmentation for greedy search
  3. Dual-criteria validation: Train with optimal augmentation set (JPEG + Blur + Color Invert) and dual-criteria loss (λ₁=1, λ₂=0.2, Cosine Loss); compare accuracy and mAP against greedy-only model to verify stability gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Do the optimal augmentation combinations identified for GAN-generated images (specifically JPEG compression, Gaussian blur, and Color Invert) generalize effectively to diffusion-generated images given their distinct frequency artifacts? Basis: authors state applicability on diffusion-generated images remains open question due to different frequency traces. Why unresolved: study primarily trained and evaluated on ProGAN/GAN datasets; diffusion models not included. Evidence needed: experiments applying same augmentation pipeline to datasets composed of diffusion-generated imagery.

### Open Question 2
Can a scaled-up genetic algorithm search with higher population sizes and more generations identify augmentation strategies that significantly outperform the greedy search approach? Basis: authors note GA performance gains were marginal compared to greedy approach, but full potential may not have been realized due to compute limitations. Why unresolved: reported GA restricted to 8 generations and population of 5. Evidence needed: comparative study allowing GA to run for significantly more generations and population sizes on equivalent hardware.

### Open Question 3
Can alternative feature similarity loss functions beyond MSE and Cosine Similarity improve the dual-criteria optimization strategy to increase mAP rather than just accuracy? Basis: authors suggest future work should focus on exploring additional loss functions to further refine augmentation strategies and stability. Why unresolved: current study only tested MSE and Cosine Similarity, finding they improved accuracy but not mAP. Evidence needed: ablation study testing various loss functions (e.g., contrastive losses, perceptual losses) within dual-criteria framework.

## Limitations

- Core uncertainty about whether greedy/genetic algorithm augmentation searches scale to more diverse or complex perturbation sets beyond the three tested (JPEG, Gaussian blur, color inversion)
- Optimal augmentation subset size (3) is dataset-dependent and may not generalize to other synthetic image domains or forensic tasks
- Lack of specification for StepLR scheduler parameters and exact evaluation perturbation settings creates reproducibility risks

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Perturbation-mimicking augmentations improve detection robustness under real-world distortions (+22.53% mAP gain) aligns with established domain adaptation principles
- **Medium Confidence**: Dual-criteria optimization improving stability (1.39%-4.08%) is demonstrated but feature extraction layer and loss function details are underspecified
- **Medium Confidence**: Small, strategically selected augmentation subset outperforming larger sets is supported by ablation results, but diminishing returns beyond 3 augmentations only tested on ProGAN/ForenSynths setup

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Apply greedy augmentation search to different synthetic image dataset (e.g., StyleGAN2) and evaluate robustness under new perturbation set (e.g., diffusion-specific artifacts) to test scalability

2. **Ablation of λ₂ Impact**: Systematically vary λ₂ in dual-criteria loss (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, 1.0) to quantify trade-off between stability and mAP, confirm feature extraction layer used for L_ft

3. **Scheduler Parameter Sensitivity**: Reproduce baseline model with varying StepLR step sizes and gamma values to assess impact on mAP and convergence, addressing unspecified scheduler configuration
