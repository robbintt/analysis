# Communication is All You Need: Persuasion Dataset Construction via Multi-LLM Communication

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.08896
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08896
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces multi-LLM communication framework for generating high-quality persuasive dialogues with distinct agent roles

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to constructing persuasive dialogue datasets using a multi-LLM communication framework. By assigning distinct roles to multiple language agents, the system generates persuasive exchanges that demonstrate high naturalness, linguistic diversity, and strategic coherence. The framework shows particular strength in handling complex persuasion scenarios and multi-party dialogues, offering a robust platform for computational persuasion research.

## Method Summary
The framework employs multiple specialized LLM agents, each assigned distinct persuasive roles, to engage in structured dialogues. These agents communicate through controlled interactions, with the system managing turn-taking, role adherence, and strategic persuasion elements. The architecture supports both controlled persuasion strategies and dynamic multi-party conversations, with evaluation focusing on linguistic diversity, naturalness, and strategic effectiveness through both automated metrics and human assessment.

## Key Results
- Generated data demonstrates superior naturalness and linguistic diversity compared to baseline approaches
- Framework successfully handles complex persuasion scenarios and maintains logical coherence across exchanges
- Shows strong flexibility in supporting controlled persuasion strategies and multi-party dialogue generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-LLM communication framework works by leveraging specialized agents that each embody distinct persuasive roles and strategies. By creating structured interactions between these role-specific agents, the system generates more nuanced and strategically coherent dialogues than single-agent approaches. The framework's strength lies in its ability to simulate realistic persuasive exchanges through controlled agent interactions, with each agent contributing specialized persuasive elements that combine to create natural, diverse, and strategically sound conversations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent dialogue systems**: Understanding how multiple specialized agents can collaborate to generate coherent conversations - needed for grasping the core framework architecture; quick check: can explain how agent roles contribute to overall dialogue quality
- **Persuasive communication strategies**: Knowledge of how persuasion works in human dialogue - needed to evaluate the framework's effectiveness in generating realistic persuasive exchanges; quick check: can identify strategic elements in generated dialogues
- **LLM role specialization**: Understanding how different prompts and constraints can shape LLM behavior - needed to comprehend how distinct agent roles are implemented; quick check: can describe how role assignments affect dialogue outcomes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Controller -> Role Assigner -> Multiple LLM Agents -> Dialogue Manager -> Output Evaluator

**Critical Path**: The framework's critical path involves initializing agent roles, managing turn-taking through the dialogue manager, and ensuring strategic coherence across exchanges. The Role Assigner and Dialogue Manager are particularly crucial as they coordinate the specialized agents' contributions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for enhanced dialogue quality, requiring multiple LLM calls and careful coordination. While this increases resource requirements, it enables more sophisticated and realistic persuasive exchanges compared to single-agent approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include role confusion between agents, loss of strategic coherence in longer dialogues, and potential bias amplification through repeated agent interactions. The system may also struggle with maintaining natural flow when handling highly complex persuasion scenarios.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test single-agent vs. multi-agent dialogue generation with identical prompts to quantify quality improvements
2. Evaluate role adherence by having agents generate dialogues with intentionally conflicting persuasion strategies
3. Measure linguistic diversity across different agent combinations and persuasion scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Heavy dependence on LLM-generated data raises concerns about bias, hallucination, and real-world grounding
- Lack of external validation against authentic human persuasive dialogues questions ecological validity
- Computational resource requirements may limit scalability as agent numbers increase

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Technical implementation of multi-LLM communication framework and structured dialogue generation
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about naturalness and linguistic diversity supported by internal evaluations
- **Low Confidence**: Effectiveness in real-world persuasion dynamics remains speculative without human validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluation comparing generated dialogues against authentic human-to-human persuasive conversations, focusing on naturalness and strategic effectiveness

2. Implement longitudinal study tracking transfer of generated persuasion strategies to real-world applications with measurable outcomes

3. Perform comprehensive bias analysis across demographic and cultural contexts to assess societal bias reflection or amplification
