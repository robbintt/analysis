# No Translation Needed: Forecasting Quality from Fertility and Metadata

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05425
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05425
- Reference count: 21
- XGBoost achieves R²=0.66 for XX→English and R²=0.72 for English→XX translation quality prediction without running translation systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that translation quality can be predicted without running any translation system, using only token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic metadata. Gradient boosting models (XGBoost) achieve strong performance with R²=0.66 for XX→English and R²=0.72 for English→XX translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Feature importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse target languages. This approach offers new insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation, showing that translation quality is shaped by both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology.

## Method Summary
The study predicts translation quality by training XGBoost regressors on linguistic metadata (Joshi class, region, language family, script, ISO code) and fertility metrics (tokens per word for reference and candidate texts) calculated using the o200k_base tokenizer. The model learns to forecast ChrF scores from GPT-4o translations in the FLORES-200 benchmark without requiring actual translation system execution. The approach compares against linear models, Lasso, MLP, and Random Forest to demonstrate the superiority of tree-based methods for capturing non-linear relationships between linguistic features and translation quality.

## Key Results
- XGBoost achieves R²=0.66 for XX→English and R²=0.72 for English→XX translation quality prediction
- Typological factors (Joshi Class, region) dominate feature importance for English→XX translations
- Fertility ratios are more important predictors for translations into diverse target languages
- Linear models perform substantially worse (R²≈0.25-0.31) than tree-based models, indicating strong non-linear relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Linguistic Typology as a Performance Prior
Translation quality can be forecasted by treating linguistic metadata as proxies for resource availability and model competency. The model learns that high-resource clusters (Indo-European family, Latin script) correlate with higher ChrF scores, while low-resource clusters (Niger-Congo, script diversity) correlate with lower scores. This allows prediction without analyzing specific translation output.

### Mechanism 2: Fertility as a Morphological Complexity Signal
Token fertility ratios serve as a proxy for morphological complexity and tokenization efficiency. High fertility indicates aggressive sub-word fragmentation in morphologically rich languages, which degrades context utilization and increases error propagation. The model uses this signal to forecast lower quality scores for diverse target languages.

### Mechanism 3: Non-Linear Interaction of Resource and Geography
Quality is determined by the interaction of geography, script, and resource class, which tree-based models capture better than linear models. XGBoost captures interactions like "Region=Africa" AND "Script=Latn" performing differently than "Region=Africa" AND "Script=Arab", explaining the substantial performance gap between linear (R²≈0.25-0.31) and tree-based models (R²≈0.66-0.72).

## Foundational Learning

- **ChrF (Character n-gram F-score)**
  - Why needed: This is the target variable the paper predicts. Unlike BLEU, ChrF operates at character level, making it better suited for morphologically rich languages where fertility varies.
  - Quick check: Why would a fertility-based predictor perform better when evaluating with ChrF compared to BLEU? (Answer: ChrF is more tolerant of tokenization differences but still sensitive to character-level morphological correctness).

- **Token Fertility**
  - Why needed: It is the primary numeric input feature measuring "expansion rate" of text through the tokenizer.
  - Quick check: If a tokenizer splits every word into characters, what happens to fertility, and how might the model interpret this? (Answer: Fertility increases; the model forecasts lower quality due to context fragmentation).

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) vs. Linear Regression**
  - Why needed: Explains why forecasting works. Linear models failed (R²≈0.25), implying "being an African language" isn't a simple linear penalty but interacts with script and resource class.
  - Quick check: Why does the paper prefer XGBoost over Linear Regression for this task? (Answer: To capture complex/non-linear dependencies between linguistic metadata and quality outcomes).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer (FLORES-200 metadata + Fertility Ratios) -> Feature Engineering (encoding + scaling) -> XGBoost Regressor -> Output (Predicted ChrF Score)

- **Critical path:** 1) Tokenize reference and candidate texts using o200k_base. 2) Calculate fertility ratios (Tokens/Words). 3) Join with linguistic metadata (Joshi Class, Region). 4) Feed into XGBoost model to predict ChrF.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Black-box vs. Interpretability (XGBoost provides feature importance but is less transparent than linear coefficients); Static vs. Dynamic (model is specific to GPT-4o, not universal); Corpus Evidence (fertility metrics can be "noisy" or "obscuring" across domains).

- **Failure signatures:** Cold Start for New Languages (requires manual imputation for missing Joshi Class); Tokenizer Mismatch (different tokenizer degrades accuracy); Data Leakage via language code (memorizes language patterns).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Replication: Train XGBoost on FLORES-200 data using only metadata (drop fertility features) to quantify marginal value added by tokenization metrics.
  2. Cross-Model Validation: Calculate fertility for NLLB-200 translations and test if XGBoost model trained on GPT-4o data transfers.
  3. Ablation on Low-Resource Languages: Filter for Joshi Class 5/6 languages and re-run feature importance to verify fertility becomes more important than typology.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- Limited to single LLM (GPT-4o) without cross-model validation, making generalization uncertain
- Joshi Class imputation methodology not detailed, potentially introducing systematic bias
- Feature distribution skew may cause overfitting on rare language-script-region combinations
- Fertility metrics can be "noisy" or "obscuring" across domains, potentially over-relying on this signal

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Fertility ratios and linguistic metadata can predict translation quality (R²=0.66-0.72) without running translation systems
- **Medium Confidence:** Typological factors dominate predictions into English while fertility is more important for diverse target languages (feature importance difference not statistically tested)
- **Low Confidence:** XGBoost model is a universal quality forecaster for any translation system (no cross-model validation provided)

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Model Generalization Test: Train XGBoost on GPT-4o data and evaluate predictions on NLLB-200 or different GPT model translations to measure R² drop.
2. Formal Ablation Study: Systematically remove high-cardinality features (language code, family) and retrain to quantify marginal value versus fertility.
3. Out-of-Distribution Validation: Hold out typologically unique languages (isolates, rare scripts), train on remaining data, and test on held-out languages to assess generalization to unseen linguistic profiles.
