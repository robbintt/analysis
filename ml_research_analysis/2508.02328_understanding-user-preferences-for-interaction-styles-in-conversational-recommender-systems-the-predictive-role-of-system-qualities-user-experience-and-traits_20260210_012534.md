# Understanding User Preferences for Interaction Styles in Conversational Recommender Systems: The Predictive Role of System Qualities, User Experience, and Traits

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.02328
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02328
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Preference for exploratory CRS interaction is associated with higher ratings of novelty, conversation quality, enjoyment, usefulness, and perceived effectiveness, not accuracy or response quality

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how users prefer different interaction styles in conversational recommender systems, contrasting task-oriented and exploratory dialogues. Through a within-subjects study with 139 participants experiencing scripted CRS dialogues in apparel shopping, the research reveals that preference for exploratory interaction is driven by novelty, conversation quality, enjoyment, usefulness, and perceived effectiveness—challenging the assumption that instrumental attributes favor task-oriented interactions. Five distinct user profiles emerged from clustering analysis, each showing different interaction style preferences. The study also found that age, gender, and control preference significantly moderate how CRS qualities influence interaction preferences.

## Method Summary
The study employed a within-subjects design where 139 participants experienced both task-oriented and exploratory CRS dialogues in a scripted apparel-shopping context. Participants rated system qualities and user experience dimensions after each interaction. Binary logistic regression was used to identify predictors of interaction style preference, while clustering analysis identified five latent user profiles based on CRS quality priorities. Moderation analyses examined how demographic and personality factors influenced the relationship between CRS qualities and preferences.

## Key Results
- Exploratory interaction preference significantly associated with higher ratings of novelty, conversation quality, enjoyment, usefulness, and perceived effectiveness
- Accuracy and response quality did not predict task-oriented preference
- Five latent user profiles identified, each showing distinct interaction style preferences
- Age, gender, and control preference significantly moderated how CRS qualities affected interaction preferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying user preferences for CRS interaction styles is rooted in how different qualities and experiential dimensions align with users' cognitive and affective needs. Rather than purely instrumental attributes driving task-oriented preferences, qualities like novelty, conversation quality, and enjoyment create a richer exploratory experience that users find more satisfying. The moderation effects of demographic and personality factors suggest that preferences are shaped by individual differences in how users process and value different interaction qualities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs):** AI systems that use natural language dialogue to help users find products or information, why needed: form the core technology being studied; quick check: system supports multi-turn dialogue with recommendation capabilities
- **Task-oriented vs Exploratory Interaction:** Two distinct dialogue styles, why needed: central research distinction; quick check: task-oriented focuses on goal completion, exploratory on discovery and learning
- **System Quality Dimensions:** Novelty, accuracy, conversation quality, response quality, why needed: key predictors of user preference; quick check: each dimension can be independently measured and evaluated
- **User Experience Dimensions:** Enjoyment, usefulness, perceived effectiveness, why needed: experiential factors influencing preference; quick check: can be reliably measured through self-report
- **User Profiling:** Clustering analysis to identify distinct user types, why needed: enables personalization; quick check: profiles are stable and distinguishable across users
- **Moderation Analysis:** Examining how factors like age and gender influence relationships, why needed: accounts for individual differences; quick check: significant interaction effects between moderators and predictors

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** User Input -> Dialogue Manager -> Recommendation Engine -> Response Generator -> User Output
- **Critical Path:** User expresses preference → System interprets intent → Dialogue manager selects interaction style → Recommendation engine generates options → Response generator produces natural language → User evaluates experience
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Scripted dialogues provide experimental control but limit ecological validity; within-subjects design controls for individual differences but may introduce carry-over effects; apparel context is relatable but may not generalize to other domains
- **Failure Signatures:** If accuracy and response quality don't predict preferences, may indicate users value conversational richness over technical precision; if moderation effects are weak, individual differences may be less important than assumed
- **First Experiments:** 1) Test live CRS interactions across multiple domains to validate findings, 2) Examine longitudinal preference changes over repeated use, 3) Implement and evaluate real-time system adaptation based on the predictive framework

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scripted dialogues may not capture real-time CRS dynamics
- Apparel-shopping context may not generalize to other domains
- Self-reported measures may be subject to response bias
- Sample from Prolific may not represent all potential CRS users
- Stability and replicability of five user profiles across different datasets uncertain

## Confidence
- **High:** Association between exploratory preference and higher ratings of novelty, conversation quality, enjoyment, usefulness, and perceived effectiveness
- **Medium:** Claim that instrumental attributes like usefulness and effectiveness are perceived in terms of informational completeness and clarity
- **Low:** Generalizability of five user profiles to other contexts or CRS implementations

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with live CRS interactions across multiple domains to assess generalizability
2. Conduct longitudinal studies to examine how user preferences and profiles evolve over repeated CRS use
3. Validate the predictive framework by testing its effectiveness in guiding real-time system adaptation and measuring impact on user satisfaction and engagement
