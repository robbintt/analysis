# A Systematic Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Gene-Disease Association Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.08445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08445
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Link prediction methods outperform node-pair classification for gene-disease association prediction, with semantic matching excelling at disease prediction and translational models better for gene prediction.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a systematic framework comparing link prediction and node-pair classification tasks for gene-disease association prediction using knowledge graph embeddings. The framework integrates biomedical ontologies, logical definitions, and ontology mappings to create enriched knowledge graphs. Results demonstrate that link prediction methods outperform node-pair classification, with semantic matching models excelling at predicting diseases from genes, while translational distance models are superior for predicting genes from diseases.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates knowledge graph embedding methods for predicting gene-disease associations using DisGeNET data integrated with Gene Ontology, Human Phenotype Ontology, and Human Disease Ontology. Two tasks are compared: link prediction using TransE, TransD, TransH, DistMult, HolE, and ComplEx; and node-pair classification using RDF2Vec embeddings with XGBoost classifiers. Knowledge graphs are constructed with varying combinations of ontologies and logical definitions, then evaluated using filtered hits@k metrics on 70/30 train/test splits.

## Key Results
- Link prediction methods consistently outperform node-pair classification across all knowledge graph configurations
- Semantic matching models (HolE, ComplEx) are superior at predicting diseases from genes
- Translational distance models (TransE, TransD, TransH) are better at predicting genes from diseases
- Additional ontology links (logical definitions and mappings) significantly improve method performance compared to disease-specific ontologies alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study leverages the semantic richness of biomedical ontologies to capture complex relationships between genes and diseases. Link prediction methods directly utilize the graph structure and learn embeddings that preserve these relationships, while node-pair classification treats entities as isolated pairs. The integration of logical definitions and ontology mappings creates additional semantic connections that enhance the predictive power of embedding methods.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graph Embeddings: Vector representations of entities and relations that preserve graph structure; needed to enable machine learning on relational data
- Link Prediction vs Classification: Link prediction predicts missing edges in graphs, while classification assigns labels to node pairs; needed to compare different problem formulations
- Ontology Enrichment: Adding logical definitions and mappings between ontologies to increase semantic connectivity; needed to create richer representations of gene-disease relationships
- Filtered Evaluation: Ranking evaluation that excludes already-known positive edges from consideration; needed to measure true predictive performance
- Hits@k Metric: Measures the rank of correct predictions within top k results; needed to evaluate ranking quality of embedding methods

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Data Preparation -> Knowledge Graph Construction -> Embedding Training -> Evaluation

### Critical Path
1. DisGeNET associations loaded
2. Ontologies and mappings integrated
3. Knowledge graphs built with 10 different configurations
4. Link prediction and node-pair classification models trained
5. Hits@k metrics computed on test sets

### Design Tradeoffs
- Shallow embeddings (TransE, HolE) vs deep learning approaches: Computational efficiency vs potential performance gains
- Link prediction vs node-pair classification: Direct graph structure utilization vs flexibility in feature engineering
- Complete vs filtered evaluation: Stricter evaluation vs computational efficiency

### Failure Signatures
- Low Hits@k scores: Incorrect KG construction, improper evaluation filtering, or model convergence issues
- Inconsistent results across runs: Lack of fixed random seeds or unstable training procedures
- Node-pair classification failing to rank all pairs: Classifier not outputting probabilities or aggregation method issues

### First Experiments to Run
1. Build and serialize a basic knowledge graph (G+H) using RDFLib
2. Train a single link prediction model (TransE) on the basic KG for 10 epochs
3. Generate RDF2Vec embeddings for the same KG and test XGBoost classification on a small subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How do graph neural networks compare to shallow knowledge graph embedding methods in gene-disease association tasks within this framework?
2. Does the integration of protein-protein interaction networks into the knowledge graph improve gene-disease association prediction?
3. Can advanced negative sampling strategies improve the performance and reliability of node-pair classification methods?
4. To what extent does the inclusion of the Sequence Ontology or other specialized ontologies enhance prediction accuracy compared to the Disease Ontology?

## Limitations
- Relies on completeness and accuracy of external biomedical ontologies
- Filtered evaluation metrics may inflate performance estimates
- Different training data protocols between link prediction and node-pair classification may bias comparisons
- 70/30 split and random negative sampling may introduce unaccounted variability

## Confidence
- High confidence: Link prediction outperforming node-pair classification; semantic matching vs translational model performance differences
- Medium confidence: Specific ontology combinations yielding optimal performance; impact of additional ontology links
- Low confidence: Absolute magnitude of performance differences across all experimental conditions

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the 10 KG variants with different random seeds and verify stability of performance rankings
2. Test alternative negative sampling strategies to assess sensitivity to sampling bias
3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual ontology components to quantify their specific contributions
