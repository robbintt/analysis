# Time Series Generation Under Data Scarcity: A Unified Generative Modeling Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20446
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20446
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed diffusion model achieves over 55% improvement in Discriminative Score and contextFID compared to baselines in few-shot time series generation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating time series data under extreme scarcity, where only a handful of samples are available. The authors introduce a unified diffusion-based generative framework that is pre-trained on a large, heterogeneous corpus of time series datasets and then fine-tuned on target domains with minimal data. The model employs dynamic convolutions (DyConv) to handle varying channel counts and dataset-specific token conditioning to generate samples tailored to each domain. Evaluated across 168 data-limited settings, the approach significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating the value of cross-domain pre-training and fine-tuning for few-shot time series generation.

## Method Summary
The method centers on a diffusion model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of ~300,000 time series samples from 19 datasets. The model transforms time series into 2D images using delay embedding, enabling the use of image-based diffusion backbones. Key innovations include DyConv, which dynamically adapts convolutional kernels to varying channel counts via bicubic interpolation, and dataset token conditioning, which allows the model to generate domain-specific samples. During fine-tuning, a new token is initialized for the target dataset and the entire model is adapted using the few available samples. The approach is evaluated using Discriminative Score, Predictive Score, and Context-FID, showing substantial improvements over baselines in few-shot scenarios.

## Key Results
- The proposed model achieves over 55% improvement in Discriminative Score and contextFID compared to baselines in few-shot settings.
- Even when fine-tuned on only 5% of the data, the model outperforms all baselines on full datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of pre-training and cross-domain generalization.
- Ablation studies confirm the importance of DyConv and dataset token conditioning for efficiency and sample fidelity, with full fine-tuning yielding the best performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Domain Pre-training for Transferable Temporal Representations
- Claim: Unified pre-training on heterogeneous time series datasets enables a single generative model to learn domain-agnostic temporal structures, which transfer effectively to new domains under few-shot conditions.
- Mechanism: During pre-training, the model is exposed to diverse temporal dynamics from ~300,000 time series, encouraging the learning of generalizable temporal representations. When fine-tuned on a new, data-scarce domain, the model leverages these pre-learned structures, requiring fewer domain-specific examples to approximate the new distribution.
- Core assumption: Temporal patterns are partially shared or structurally analogous across seemingly disparate domains, enabling positive transfer.
- Evidence anchors: The abstract and Section 5 highlight that pre-training on a large, heterogeneous collection enables the model to learn transferable temporal representations, improving its ability to generate high-quality samples even when only a few training examples are available.
- Break condition: Transfer effectiveness degrades if the target domain's temporal dynamics are fundamentally novel or lack structural analogues in the pre-training corpus.

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic Convolutions (DyConv) for Unified Multi-Channel Handling
- Claim: DyConv allows a single model to flexibly process and generate time series with varying channel counts, eliminating the architectural rigidity that hampers few-shot adaptation.
- Mechanism: DyConv uses a single learnable canonical kernel, resized via bicubic interpolation to match the actual input and output channel dimensions of each dataset. The model thus maps datasets with different channel structures to and from a shared latent space without re-architecting.
- Core assumption: Bicubic interpolation of convolutional kernels preserves enough semantic information across interpolated channel dimensions to maintain generative fidelity.
- Evidence anchors: Section 5 and Section 6.4 show that DyConv outperforms a padding-based baseline across all few-shot settings, with Table 3 and Appendix C.1 supporting the need for adequate canonical kernel capacity.
- Break condition: Performance may degrade for channel counts far outside the range seen during pre-training, or for channel structures where interpolation cannot meaningfully map relationships.

### Mechanism 3: Dataset Token Conditioning for Domain-Specific Sampling
- Claim: A learned dataset token, injected via adaptive group normalization, conditions the diffusion process to generate samples from a specific target distribution, resolving ambiguity in multi-domain models.
- Mechanism: Each dataset is assigned a unique token, embedded into a learnable vector, and injected into the denoising UNet through AdaGN layers. This conditions the intermediate features on domain identity, guiding the reverse diffusion process. During few-shot fine-tuning, a new token is initialized for the target dataset and learned jointly, anchoring the model to the new domain's distribution.
- Core assumption: Domain-specific conditioning via tokens is sufficient to disentangle distributions learned during multi-domain pre-training and to anchor the model to a new, data-scarce domain.
- Evidence anchors: Section 5 and Section 6.4 show that conditioning improves performance, with Table 4 and Appendix C.4 demonstrating the conditional model's superiority over the unconditional model, especially without fine-tuning.
- Break condition: Conditioning fails if the dataset token embedding space is under-optimized, leading to poor disentanglement and samples that blend characteristics from multiple domains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion Models (Denoising Probabilistic Models)**: Why needed here: The entire framework is built on a diffusion backbone. Understanding the forward noising and reverse denoising process, noise schedules, and preconditioning is essential to grasp how the model learns to generate time series via image representations. Quick check: Can you explain the role of the weighting function λ(σ) and the preconditioning functions in the loss function during training?

- **Delay Embedding for Time-Series-to-Image Transformation**: Why needed here: The model does not operate on raw time series directly. It transforms 1D/2D time series into 2D images using a delay embedding, enabling the use of powerful image diffusion backbones. Understanding this invertible transform is critical for data preprocessing and interpreting outputs. Quick check: Given a time series of length L, how does the delay embedding with parameters m and n construct the trajectory matrix X, and what are the resulting image dimensions before padding?

- **Few-Shot Learning and Fine-Tuning Paradigms**: Why needed here: The paper's core problem is few-shot generation. Grasping the distinction between training from scratch vs. pre-training + fine-tuning, and understanding why data augmentation may be harmful in time series, frames the motivation for the unified pre-training approach. Quick check: Why might standard data augmentation techniques be problematic for time series, and how does the pre-training + fine-tuning paradigm proposed here serve as an alternative solution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw Time Series → Delay Embedding → Square Padding → Dynamic Binary Mask → Image Tensor → UNet Backbone (with DyConv Layers, Dataset Token Embedding + AdaGN, Residual Blocks, Downsampling/Upsampling, Attention Layers, Noise-level Embedding) → Generated Time Series

- **Critical path**:
  1. Pre-training Phase: Jointly train the UNet with DyConv and dataset tokens on the diverse corpus to establish transferable temporal representations.
  2. Fine-tuning Phase: For a new few-shot dataset, initialize a new dataset token embedding and fine-tune the entire model to adapt the pre-trained knowledge to the target domain.
  3. Inference: Sample from the diffusion model using the fine-tuned dataset token to produce synthetic time series for the target domain.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - DyConv vs. Padding: DyConv offers flexibility and constant computational cost but introduces interpolation overhead. Padding is simpler but has linearly increasing cost and may introduce artifacts. Paper strongly favors DyConv.
  - Full Fine-tuning vs. PEFT (LoRA/Bias-Only): Full fine-tuning yields best performance but requires updating all parameters. PEFT methods offer parameter efficiency but result in significant performance drops.
  - Model Scale: Larger models generally perform better, but show diminishing returns compared to smaller models without pre-training. Pre-training mitigates scale sensitivity.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Catastrophic Performance Drop on Few-Shot Target: Model generates garbage or mode-collapses. Diagnosis: Pre-training data was insufficiently diverse, or fine-tuning learning rate was too high/low.
  - Inability to Handle Target Channel Count: Runtime error or poor quality for datasets with channel counts far from pre-training distribution. Diagnosis: DyConv interpolation is failing or canonical kernel capacity is too low.
  - Samples Blend Multiple Domains: Generated time series show mixed characteristics. Diagnosis: Dataset token conditioning is ineffective; model is sampling from a mixed distribution.
  - Length Generalization Failure: Poor performance on sequence lengths not seen during pre-training. Diagnosis: Model overfitted to fixed pre-training lengths.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce Core Ablation: Re-run the few-shot benchmark on a small subset of evaluation datasets with the pre-trained model. Compare full fine-tuning vs. LoRA and vs. a from-scratch baseline to validate the paper's main claims.
  2. DyConv Stress Test: Evaluate the model on a held-out dataset with a channel count significantly outside the range of pre-training datasets. Compare performance with a statically padded baseline to quantify DyConv's benefit and failure boundary.
  3. Token Ablation Visualization: Train two models: one with dataset tokens, one without. For a multi-domain pre-training dataset, use t-SNE to visualize the learned token embeddings. For a few-shot fine-tuning task, visualize the trajectory of the new token's embedding during fine-tuning to understand how it anchors to the new domain.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Cross-domain transfer effectiveness remains largely theoretical; the paper asserts shared temporal structures across domains but does not empirically verify which patterns transfer or under what conditions transfer fails.
- DyConv interpolation fidelity is not rigorously validated; there is no ablation showing how interpolation quality degrades with channel count distance from pre-training ranges.
- Dataset token conditioning scope is unclear; the paper does not investigate whether tokens generalize across semantically similar domains or if they memorize dataset-specific noise.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core empirical result that pre-training + fine-tuning outperforms training from scratch in few-shot settings.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that pre-training provides transferable representations, inferred from performance gains but not directly validated.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that DyConv interpolation preserves semantic information across channel dimensions, and that dataset tokens effectively disentangle distributions.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain transfer mechanism validation**: Select two semantically related domains from the pre-training corpus and ablate the dataset token during fine-tuning on one. Measure whether fine-tuning with the other domain's token accelerates convergence or improves sample quality.
2. **DyConv interpolation stress test**: Evaluate the model on a dataset with channel count far outside the pre-training distribution. Compare performance with a statically padded baseline and with a DyConv kernel resized via learned interpolation.
3. **Dataset token disentanglement analysis**: Train the model on a multi-domain pre-training corpus, then use t-SNE to visualize the learned token embeddings. For a few-shot fine-tuning task, track the trajectory of the new token's embedding during training to verify it anchors to the target domain and does not drift toward unrelated domains.
