# EnDive: A Cross-Dialect Benchmark for Fairness and Performance in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.07100
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07100
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: LLM performance consistently drops on non-standard English dialects, revealing significant fairness gaps in current NLP systems

## Executive Summary
EnDive introduces a cross-dialect benchmark that evaluates large language models on 12 reasoning and natural language understanding tasks translated into five underrepresented English dialects: African American Vernacular English, Indian English, Jamaican English, Chicano English, and Colloquial Singaporean English. Translations were generated using few-shot prompting informed by native speaker examples and filtered to ensure dialectal diversity. Human evaluations confirmed high translation quality (6.02/7+ on fluency, faithfulness, and formality). Comprehensive testing of five LLMs revealed consistent performance disparities between Standard American English and dialectal inputs, with models underperforming on non-standard dialects across zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings.

## Method Summary
The benchmark translates 12 NLU/reasoning datasets from SAE into five dialects using few-shot GPT-4o prompting with eWAVE exemplars. Translations undergo BLEU filtering (excluding those with ≥0.7 similarity to SAE) to ensure dialectal diversity. Five LLMs are evaluated under zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings on both original SAE and dialectal versions. Performance is measured through accuracy metrics, with human evaluations confirming translation quality across fluency, faithfulness, and formality dimensions.

## Key Results
- LLM performance consistently drops on dialectal inputs compared to SAE across all five tested models
- Models show significant accuracy gaps in both zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings
- Human evaluations confirmed high translation quality (6.02/7+) across fluency, faithfulness, and formality metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to capturing real-world dialectal variation that standard benchmarks typically overlook. By using few-shot translation with dialect-specific exemplars, the methodology ensures that semantic meaning is preserved while introducing authentic dialectal features. The BLEU-based filtering creates a clear boundary between standard and non-standard language, making performance disparities visible. The evaluation across multiple LLMs and settings demonstrates that these fairness gaps are systematic rather than model-specific anomalies, revealing fundamental limitations in how current NLP systems handle linguistic diversity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-dialect evaluation**: Comparing model performance across linguistic variations reveals fairness gaps
  - Why needed: Standard benchmarks often ignore dialectal variation, masking performance disparities
  - Quick check: Verify that performance differences exist between SAE and dialectal inputs

- **Few-shot translation methodology**: Using exemplar-based prompting for dialect generation
  - Why needed: Ensures translations maintain dialectal characteristics while preserving semantic meaning
  - Quick check: Confirm retained translations show appropriate dialectal features

- **BLEU-based filtering**: Removing translations too similar to SAE to ensure dialectal diversity
  - Why needed: Prevents trivial translations that don't capture dialectal variation
  - Quick check: Verify filtering threshold appropriately balances retention and diversity

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: SAE datasets -> Few-shot GPT-4o translation -> BLEU filtering -> LLM evaluation -> Performance comparison

**Critical path**: Translation generation → Filtering → Evaluation → Analysis of performance gaps

**Design tradeoffs**: BLEU filtering ensures dialectal diversity but may be too aggressive for some dialects (e.g., ChcE); human evaluation provides quality assessment but uses small sample sizes

**Failure signatures**: Near-zero retained translations for certain dialect/dataset pairs; inconsistent evaluation scores across different LLM evaluators

**First experiments**:
1. Translate a small subset of data using few-shot prompting and verify dialectal characteristics
2. Apply BLEU filtering and examine retention rates across dialects
3. Run initial LLM evaluations on both SAE and dialectal versions of a single task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several critical open questions: How can we develop models that perform equitably across all English dialects? What specific linguistic features contribute most to performance degradation? Can we design training approaches that better capture dialectal variation? The work also questions whether current evaluation methodologies adequately capture the full spectrum of dialectal variation and how to balance dialectal diversity with semantic preservation in translation processes.

## Limitations
- Translation quality assessment relies entirely on GPT-4o evaluations, potentially introducing bias
- BLEU filtering threshold may not optimally capture dialectal diversity, particularly for Chicano English
- Human evaluation sample sizes are small (10-12 per dialect) and may not represent full dialectal variation
- The benchmark focuses only on English dialects, limiting generalizability to other languages
- Performance gaps may reflect dataset bias rather than fundamental model limitations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Existence of performance disparities; methodology for few-shot translation; overall fairness gap pattern
- **Medium confidence**: Specific translation quality scores; magnitude of performance gaps for individual combinations; effectiveness of BLEU filtering
- **Low confidence**: Representativeness of human evaluation samples; claims about which dialect has most/least impact without significance testing

## Next Checks
1. Apply statistical significance testing to performance differences between SAE and dialectal inputs across tasks
2. Compare BLEU-based filtering against alternative diversity metrics to assess optimal capture of dialectal variation
3. Repeat fluency and preference evaluations using different LLM evaluators to assess consistency and potential bias
4. Conduct ablation studies on translation methodology to isolate impact of different dialectal features
5. Test whether fine-tuning on dialectal data reduces performance gaps
