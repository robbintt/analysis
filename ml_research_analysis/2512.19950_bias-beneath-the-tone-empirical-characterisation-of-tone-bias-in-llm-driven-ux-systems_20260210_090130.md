# Bias Beneath the Tone: Empirical Characterisation of Tone Bias in LLM-Driven UX Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19950
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19950
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Even "neutral" LLM prompts produce consistently polite/positive framing, detectable via weak supervision and ensemble classification (macro-F1 up to 0.92)

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a scalable pipeline for detecting tonal bias in LLM-generated conversational assistant responses. By combining controllable dialogue synthesis with weak supervision using a pretrained sentiment model, the authors demonstrate that even prompts requesting neutrality systematically produce polite or positive framing. The approach uses ensemble classifiers (LR+SVM) achieving high macro-F1 scores, providing an interpretable diagnostic tool for auditing conversational AI fairness. Results reveal that tonal bias is a measurable, systematic trait arising from the model's conversational style rather than explicit emotional content.

## Method Summary
The authors generated two synthetic dialogue datasets: tone-neutral prompts (no emotional instructions) and tone-conditioned prompts (positive/negative sentiment). A pretrained DistilBERT model fine-tuned on SST-2 provided weak sentiment labels for assistant responses. Multiple classifiers (MNB, LR, SVM, ensemble, and neural variants) were trained on TF-IDF or Word2Vec features to detect tone patterns. The best performance came from ensemble methods combining Logistic Regression and SVM with macro-F1 scores up to 0.92, particularly at higher confidence thresholds (τ=0.85).

## Key Results
- Even "neutral" LLM prompts produce consistently polite/positive framing
- Ensemble classifiers (LR+SVM) achieve macro-F1 scores up to 0.92 at τ=0.85
- Higher confidence thresholds improve separation and reduce noise
- Linear models outperform neural variants in stability for this task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pretrained sentiment models can surface systematic tonal biases in LLM-generated dialogue even when explicit emotional prompts are absent.
- Mechanism: A DistilBERT model fine-tuned on SST-2 assigns soft sentiment probabilities to each assistant response. When aggregated across a corpus of "neutral" dialogues, consistent positive skew emerges—revealing implicit model stylistic tendencies rather than user-driven emotional content.
- Core assumption: The pretrained sentiment model's definitions of positive/negative/neutral tone align sufficiently with human perceptions of conversational tone to serve as a valid proxy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labelled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns."
  - [Section 3] "Each assistant reply is then assigned a sentiment tone using a pretrained DistilBERT model fine-tuned on SST-2, which provides weak labels for positive, negative, or neutral tone depending on confidence thresholds."
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for this specific weak supervision mechanism; neighboring papers focus on emotional dialogue benchmarks rather than weak labeling for bias detection.
- Break condition: If the sentiment model's training distribution (SST-2: movie reviews) diverges significantly from conversational assistant dialogue, label validity degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ensemble combinations of linear classifiers (LR + SVM) achieve more stable cross-dataset tone detection than neural variants when operating on sparse TF-IDF features.
- Mechanism: Logistic Regression provides calibrated probability estimates; Linear SVM contributes max-margin decision boundaries. Soft voting averages these posteriors, reducing individual model variance while preserving interpretability.
- Core assumption: Tone signals in short assistant responses are largely lexical rather than requiring deep contextual reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Linear models (MNB, LR, SVM) and ensemble methods (LR+SVM) achieve macro-F1 scores up to 0.92, outperforming neural variants in stability."
  - [Section 4] "Among classifiers, the ensemble of Logistic Regression and Linear SVM achieved the best overall balance between precision and recall."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation for this specific ensemble configuration; neighboring work uses varied architectures without comparative stability analysis.
- Break condition: If tonal cues depend heavily on discourse-level context (sarcasm across turns, hedging patterns), TF-IDF representations will fail to capture them.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Confidence threshold tuning during weak labeling controls a precision-recall tradeoff that directly affects bias measurement granularity.
- Mechanism: Lower thresholds (τ=0.60) retain ambiguous/borderline samples, capturing subtle tonal variation but introducing label noise. Higher thresholds (τ=0.85) isolate clearer polarity cases, improving macro-F1 but potentially missing nuanced bias manifestations.
- Core assumption: Ambiguous cases represent measurement noise rather than a distinct tonal category worth analyzing separately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Stricter confidence thresholds (τ=0.85) improve separation and reduce noise, confirming tonal bias as a systematic, measurable trait."
  - [Section 4] "At the lower threshold (τ=0.60), the models captured more borderline or ambiguous cases but at the cost of reduced precision... Increasing the threshold to τ=0.85 produced clearer separations between classes, yielding macro-F1 values between 0.84 and 0.92."
  - [corpus] No corpus papers specifically validate threshold-dependent bias quantification approaches.
- Break condition: If legitimate subtle biases systematically fall below τ=0.85, the diagnostic will undercount meaningful tonal skew.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Weak Supervision**
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on automated labeling rather than human annotation to scale tone detection across large synthetic datasets. Understanding the tradeoffs (label noise, bias propagation from the labeling model) is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model trained on movie reviews (SST-2) might mislabel polite hedging in assistant dialogue?

- **Concept: Confidence Thresholding for Classification**
  - Why needed here: The τ parameter directly controls what counts as "detected bias." Engineers need to understand that this isn't a neutral technical choice—it shapes what biases are visible in the audit.
  - Quick check question: If you increase τ from 0.60 to 0.85, what happens to false positives and what happens to subtle-but-real bias cases?

- **Concept: Ensemble Soft Voting**
  - Why needed here: The paper's best-performing model combines LR and SVM through probability averaging. Understanding why this works (variance reduction, complementary inductive biases) informs whether to replicate this approach.
  - Quick check question: Why might soft voting outperform stacking when training data is limited or noisy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** LLM Dialogue Generation → Preprocessing (lowercase, lemmatize, token filtering) → Weak Labeling (DistilBERT + threshold τ) → Feature Encoding (TF-IDF or Word2Vec) → Classification (MNB / LR / SVM / Ensemble / Neural) → Evaluation (macro-F1, cross-dataset stability)

- **Critical path:** The weak labeling stage determines downstream classifier performance. A poorly calibrated labeling model or inappropriate τ will propagate errors through the entire pipeline.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - TF-IDF vs. Word2Vec: TF-IDF is interpretable (inspect feature weights) but misses semantic similarity; Word2Vec captures context but obscures which words drive predictions.
  - Linear vs. Neural: Linear models are stable and interpretable; neural models (NSE, DMN) capture nuanced patterns (sarcasm, hedging) but are sensitive to label noise and harder to debug.
  - τ=0.60 vs. τ=0.85: Inclusive threshold surfaces more bias cases but with lower confidence; strict threshold isolates clear cases but may miss subtle bias.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High accuracy with low macro-F1 → class imbalance or label confusion between neutral/mild-positive.
  - Neural models underperforming linear → label noise from weak supervision overwhelming learning signal.
  - Cross-dataset performance drop → overfitting to lexical artifacts of synthetic generation rather than generalizable tone patterns.
  - Sarcasm/hedging misclassified → current feature representation insufficient for non-lexical tonal cues.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Threshold sweep:** Run the full pipeline at τ ∈ {0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90}. Plot macro-F1 vs. τ and inspect the confusion matrices at each point to identify where neutral/positive confusion peaks.
  2. **Feature ablation:** Compare TF-IDF-only vs. Word2Vec-only vs. concatenated representations on the neural models (NSE, DMN). Document which representation better captures the failure cases identified (sarcasm, hedging).
  3. **Cross-LLM generalization:** Generate dialogues using a different LLM not in the original training mix. Apply the trained classifiers without retraining. Performance drop indicates overfitting to generation artifacts rather than general tone patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does replacing weak supervision (DistilBERT sentiment labeling) with expert human annotation affect the detection and quantification of tonal bias patterns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "In the future, we plan to replace weak supervision with an expert-annotated bias rubric and a calibrated gold-standard dataset to enable finer-grained, context-aware detection."
- Why unresolved: Current weak labels may conflate sentiment with tone and cannot reliably capture nuanced categories like hedging, sarcasm, or context-dependent neutrality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study of classifier performance and bias patterns between weakly-labeled and expert-annotated datasets, particularly on borderline cases where τ=0.60 versus τ=0.85 thresholds produce divergent label assignments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do tonal bias patterns identified in synthetic LLM-generated dialogues transfer to real-world human-assistant interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We will evaluate the framework on real personal-assistant interactions." [inferred] The entire methodology relies on synthetic data without validating whether findings generalize to deployed systems.
- Why unresolved: LLM-generated dialogues may not reflect actual user query distributions, response styles in production assistants, or domain-specific tonal expectations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the same diagnostic pipeline to authentic conversation logs from deployed voice assistants and comparing tonal bias distributions with synthetic dataset benchmarks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can adversarial prompting or targeted fine-tuning interventions measurably reduce tonal bias in LLM outputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future work will include "adversarial and transfer tests" and develop a "diagnose → intervene → remeasure dashboard." [inferred] The paper establishes detectability but offers no mitigation evidence.
- Why unresolved: Detection does not imply correctability; it remains unclear whether systematic tonal skew can be reduced without degrading response quality or fluency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Pre/post intervention experiments measuring macro-F1 on tone neutrality and response utility metrics after applying constrained decoding, RLHF with neutrality rewards, or counterfactual data augmentation.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does tonal bias manifest across languages and cultural contexts in LLM-driven conversational systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future work will "extend the analysis to multilingual and counterfactual dialogue data." [inferred] Politeness, positivity norms, and acceptable formality levels vary substantially across cultures.
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to English; findings may not hold in languages where indirectness, honorifics, or emotional expression follow different conventions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the synthetic dialogue generation and classification pipeline across typologically diverse languages with native speaker validation of tone label appropriateness.

## Limitations

- Weak labeling mechanism assumes SST-2 sentiment definitions align with conversational assistant tone perception, which may not hold for polite hedging or context-dependent neutrality.
- Focus on lexical tone detection using TF-IDF representations may miss context-dependent cues like sarcasm and hedging patterns.
- Synthetic datasets may not reflect real-world conversational diversity, risking overfitting to generation artifacts.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The weak supervision + ensemble classification pipeline reliably detects systematic tonal bias in synthetic data. The τ=0.85 threshold demonstrably improves macro-F1 by reducing noise from ambiguous cases.
- **Medium confidence**: The specific macro-F1 scores (0.84-0.92) are reproducible with similar datasets and models. The finding that even "neutral" prompts produce consistent positive framing is robust across LLMs tested.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that these results generalize to real-world conversational AI systems. The weak labeling mechanism's validity across different conversational domains and the neural models' limited performance require further validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain adaptation validation**: Test the weak labeling pipeline on non-synthetic conversational data (human-human dialogues, real assistant logs). Compare sentiment model predictions against human annotations to quantify label misalignment.
2. **Cross-LLM generalization**: Apply the trained classifiers to dialogues generated by LLMs not in the original training mix. Performance drop indicates overfitting to generation artifacts rather than generalizable tone patterns.
3. **Feature representation ablation**: Systematically compare TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and contextual embeddings (BERT-base) on the neural models (NSE, DMN). Document which representation better captures sarcasm and hedging failures.
