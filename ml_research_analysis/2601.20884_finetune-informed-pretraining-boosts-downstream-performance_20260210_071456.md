core_contribution: This paper introduces Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a method
  that improves multimodal pretraining by focusing representation learning on the
  modality most used during downstream fine-tuning. Instead of treating all modalities
  equally, FIP uses asymmetric masking (more aggressive masking for the target modality),
  deeper decoders for the target modality, and higher loss weighting for it.

## Executive Summary
Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP) is a method that improves multimodal pretraining by focusing representation learning on the modality most used during downstream fine-tuning. Instead of treating all modalities equally, FIP uses asymmetric masking (more aggressive masking for the target modality), deeper decoders for the target modality, and higher loss weighting for it. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signal tasks, FIP improves downstream classification accuracy, particularly in low-signal-to-noise regimes. Specifically, at -10 dB SNR, FIP-DenoMAE achieved 69.2% accuracy versus 68.4% for the baseline and 55.4% for a standard ViT, showing improved noise robustness and better feature separation in t-SNE visualizations. The approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and requires no extra data or supervision.

## Method Summary
FIP modifies multimodal MAE pretraining by biasing representation learning toward the target modality that will be used for downstream fine-tuning. It applies asymmetric masking (higher ratio for target), assigns deeper decoders to the target modality, and weights the target-modality reconstruction loss higher. Applied to constellation diagram-based automatic modulation classification, FIP uses 80% masking for constellation diagrams versus 60% for other modalities, 8-layer decoder for target versus 4-layer for others, and loss weights of 1.0 for target versus 0.5 for others. Pretrained on 10K unlabeled multimodal samples and fine-tuned on 1K labeled constellation diagrams, FIP improves classification accuracy by 0.8% absolute at low SNR levels.

## Key Results
- FIP-DenoMAE achieves 69.2% accuracy at -10 dB SNR versus 68.4% for baseline DenoMAE
- FIP shows improved noise robustness and better feature separation in t-SNE visualizations
- FIP provides consistent gains across SNR range (-10 dB to 10 dB) compared to standard ViT (55.4%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Asymmetric Masking-Induced Encoder Specialization
Higher masking ratios on the target modality force the shared encoder to learn more robust structural representations for that modality. When p_target = 0.80 vs p_other = 0.60, the encoder must infer target-modality structure from sparser visible patches while leveraging richer contextual information from less-masked auxiliary modalities. This asymmetric difficulty creates stronger feature representations for the modality that will dominate downstream use.

### Mechanism 2: Decoder Capacity Asymmetry Preserving Encoder Generality
Assigning deeper decoder capacity to the target modality improves reconstruction quality without requiring the shared encoder to specialize prematurely. The MAE design principle pairs lightweight encoders with heavier decoders. FIP applies this asymmetrically—L_d,target = 8 vs L_d,other = 4—so the target modality benefits from more reconstruction capacity while the encoder remains cross-modally useful.

### Mechanism 3: Loss-Weighted Gradient Prioritization
Explicitly weighting the target-modality reconstruction loss higher biases gradient updates toward representations that serve the downstream-critical modality. With w_target = 1.0 vs w_other = 0.5, backpropagation allocates more optimization pressure to minimizing target-modality error. Over many epochs, the shared encoder's weights shift toward features that minimize target-modality reconstruction loss while still benefiting from auxiliary-modality gradients.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining**
  - Why needed here: FIP modifies the MAE objective; understanding baseline MAE (mask → encode → decode → reconstruct) is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why MAE uses high masking ratios (e.g., 75%+) and how reconstruction loss trains the encoder?

- Concept: **Multimodal representation learning**
  - Why needed here: FIP operates on 4 modalities (constellation diagrams, scalograms, raw signals, noise) sharing one encoder.
  - Quick check question: How does a shared encoder learn representations useful across modalities with different statistical properties?

- Concept: **Vision Transformer (ViT) patch embeddings**
  - Why needed here: The backbone uses 16×16 patches with d_model = 768; masking operates at patch level.
  - Quick check question: What happens to positional embeddings when patches are masked and removed from the encoder input?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: 4 modalities → separate patch embeddings → asymmetric masking → shared encoder → separate decoders → weighted MSE loss
- Critical path: Identify downstream target modality → configure asymmetric masking ratios → assign decoder depths → set loss weights → pretrain on unlabeled multimodal data → fine-tune encoder + classification head on labeled target-modality data only
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher p_target improves target representations but increases reconstruction difficulty; may require longer training
  - Deeper target decoder adds parameters but only affects pretraining compute (discarded at fine-tuning)
  - Higher w_target focuses learning but risks ignoring useful auxiliary signals
- Failure signatures:
  - Reconstruction quality degrades for target modality: check if p_target is too high for dataset complexity
  - Auxiliary modalities contribute nothing: w_other may be too low; try 0.3-0.7 range
  - No improvement over baseline: verify target modality is actually used at fine-tuning; FIP assumes downstream alignment
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation on masking ratio: Hold decoder depth and loss weight constant; sweep p_target ∈ [0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85] to find saturation point.
  2. Ablation on decoder depth: Fix masking and loss; test L_d,target ∈ [4, 6, 8, 12] to verify diminishing returns.
  3. Modality swap test: Designate a different modality as target (e.g., scalograms) to confirm FIP is target-agnostic and not constellation-specific.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Does FIP generalize to other multimodal domains beyond constellation diagram-based AMC, such as vision-language, audio-visual, or other signal processing tasks?
- Question: How sensitive is FIP's performance to the specific hyperparameter choices (masking ratios, decoder depth, loss weights), and what principles guide their selection for new domains?
- Question: Does prioritizing the target modality during pretraining degrade representation quality for non-target modalities or harm cross-modal transfer capabilities?
- Question: Can FIP be extended to scenarios where multiple modalities are important for downstream fine-tuning rather than a single target modality?

## Limitations

- Evidence is based on a single multimodal MAE application (constellation diagrams) on one downstream task (AMC)
- Modest improvements (0.8% absolute accuracy gain at -10 dB SNR) may not justify added complexity
- Lack of ablation studies to isolate contribution of each FIP component
- Claim that "FIP is architecture-agnostic" remains untested, as only ViT-based DenoMAE was evaluated

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: FIP improves downstream classification accuracy in the tested constellation-diagram AMC task, with measurable gains in low-SNR regimes.
- **Medium confidence**: The three proposed mechanisms (asymmetric masking, decoder depth, loss weighting) contribute to improved representations, but their relative importance is unknown.
- **Low confidence**: FIP generalizes across architectures, tasks, and modality combinations without modification.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation study to systematically disable each FIP component and quantify individual contributions to the 0.8% accuracy improvement.
2. Apply FIP to a non-ViT multimodal MAE architecture (e.g., Swin Transformer or ConvMAE) to verify the claimed architecture-agnostic benefits.
3. Replace auxiliary modalities with random noise or unrelated data to determine whether FIP's gains depend on meaningful cross-modal complementarity or simply on the asymmetric training configuration.
