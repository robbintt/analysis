# Mitigating Self-Preference by Authorship Obfuscation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05379
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05379
- Authors: Taslim Mahbub; Shi Feng
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Simple two-word synonym replacements significantly reduce harmful self-preference in LLM judges while increasing judge accuracy in harmful cases from 40% to 48% for DeepSeek-V3

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether harmful self-preference in LLM judges stems from their ability to recognize their own outputs. The authors hypothesize that self-recognition drives self-preference and test this by applying black-box perturbations (synonym replacement) to evaluation candidates to obfuscate authorship. Their approach shows promising results: simple perturbations reduce self-preference while paradoxically improving judge accuracy in harmful cases. However, they discover that complete mitigation is challenging - when perturbations fully neutralize stylistic differences, self-preference recovers through semantic channels as judges rely on shared beliefs. The findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference operate at multiple semantic levels, making complete elimination difficult through simple obfuscation techniques.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a black-box perturbation approach to test whether reducing judge self-recognition mitigates harmful self-preference. They apply synonym replacement perturbations to evaluation candidates, with varying perturbation strengths (1 to 4 word replacements). The perturbations are applied at the token level using LLM-based synonym replacement without requiring access to judge parameters. They validate their approach across two tasks: long-document QA and coding, using DeepSeek-V3 as the primary judge model. The study compares performance against human evaluators and examines how perturbation strength affects both self-recognition rates and judgment accuracy.

## Key Results
- Two-word synonym replacements significantly reduce harmful self-preference in LLM judges
- Perturbations increase judge accuracy in harmful cases from 40% to 48% for DeepSeek-V3
- Complete mitigation remains challenging: when perturbations fully neutralize stylistic differences, self-preference recovers through semantic differences and shared beliefs
- Results validated across both long-document QA and coding tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying self-preference appears to operate at multiple levels. When stylistic differences between candidate responses are preserved, judges can recognize their own outputs and exhibit self-preference. However, when perturbations neutralize these stylistic differences, judges shift to relying on semantic content and shared beliefs to identify their outputs, leading to recovered self-preference. This suggests that self-recognition occurs not just at the surface stylistic level but also at deeper semantic levels where judges share implicit assumptions and beliefs with their own outputs.

## Foundational Learning

**Self-preference in LLM judges**: Why needed - understanding how judges favor their own outputs is crucial for reliable evaluation; Quick check - measure preference rates when judges evaluate their own vs. others' outputs

**Authorship obfuscation**: Why needed - techniques to prevent judges from identifying their own outputs; Quick check - apply perturbations and measure recognition rates

**Black-box perturbations**: Why needed - methods that work without access to model internals; Quick check - implement synonym replacement and measure effectiveness

**Semantic vs. stylistic differences**: Why needed - understanding multiple channels of self-recognition; Quick check - analyze which differences judges rely on under different perturbation conditions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Evaluation pipeline -> Judge model -> Perturbation application -> Preference measurement -> Accuracy calculation

**Critical path**: Input generation → Perturbation (optional) → Judge evaluation → Preference detection → Accuracy measurement

**Design tradeoffs**: Simple synonym replacement offers black-box applicability but may not fully eliminate semantic-level self-recognition; more sophisticated perturbations could improve mitigation but require more complexity

**Failure signatures**: Self-preference persists despite perturbations; accuracy drops significantly; perturbations introduce unintended semantic changes

**Three first experiments**: 1) Baseline: measure self-preference without perturbations, 2) Simple perturbation: apply two-word synonym replacements and measure changes, 3) Full neutralization: apply maximum perturbations and observe semantic recovery of self-preference

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Complete mitigation of self-preference remains elusive when perturbations fully neutralize stylistic differences
- Findings primarily validated on DeepSeek-V3, limiting generalizability to other model families
- The mechanism of semantic-level self-recognition is not fully characterized

## Confidence
- Core finding that authorship obfuscation reduces self-preference: High
- Complete mitigation claim: Medium
- Broader implications for LLM evaluation practices: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test perturbation approach across a wider range of model families (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google models) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate which types of perturbations (syntactic vs. semantic) most effectively reduce self-preference
3. Implement approach in real-world evaluation pipelines to measure impact on downstream task performance and judge reliability
