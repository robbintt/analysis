# Advancing climate model interpretability: Feature attribution for Arctic melt anomalies

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.07741
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07741
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Unsupervised anomaly detection with counterfactual feature attribution reveals temperature and radiation as key drivers of Arctic melt anomalies in ERA5 and GEMB climate models.

## Executive Summary
This research addresses the challenge of interpreting Arctic melt anomalies in climate models by combining unsupervised anomaly detection with feature attribution. The authors develop a Cluster-LSTM-VAE framework to detect anomalous melt events in ERA5 and GEMB models, then apply counterfactual reasoning to identify which climate variables most strongly contribute to each anomaly. The method successfully captures the physics of each model—ERA5's energy imbalance approach versus GEMB's complex cryospheric processes—while providing interpretable explanations for detected anomalies. Results show both models detecting significant increases in melt anomalies over the past six decades, with attribution revealing model-specific drivers.

## Method Summary
The study employs a Cluster-LSTM-VAE (CLV) framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate climate time series. Climate variables are first clustered by correlation using k-means, then processed through an LSTM-based VAE to learn normal patterns. Anomalies are identified through reconstruction loss exceeding dynamic thresholds. Feature attribution uses counterfactual reasoning: for each detected anomaly, individual features are replaced with their yearly medians, and the resulting change in reconstruction loss identifies the most influential drivers. The approach is validated against benchmark datasets using Random Forest, XGBoost, and SHAP methods.

## Key Results
- ERA5 detects more extreme melt events than GEMB due to its simpler energy imbalance model
- Both models show significant decadal increases in melt anomalies (1951-2020)
- ERA5 anomalies driven primarily by temperature-related features (t2m, strd, ssrd)
- GEMB highlights broader factors including cloud cover and solar radiation
- Attribution method successfully reflects distinct model physics and cryospheric processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the reconstruction error of a VAE trained on normal climate patterns as an anomaly score. When the model encounters data that deviates from learned patterns, the reconstruction loss increases. The counterfactual attribution then identifies which features contribute most to this deviation by measuring how much the anomaly score changes when each feature is perturbed. This approach is particularly effective for climate data because it can capture complex multivariate relationships and temporal dependencies inherent in Arctic melt dynamics.

## Foundational Learning
- **VAE reconstruction loss as anomaly score**: Needed to quantify deviation from normal patterns; quick check: plot anomaly scores vs. reconstruction loss distribution
- **Counterfactual feature perturbation**: Needed to isolate individual feature contributions; quick check: verify top features change when masking different features
- **Dynamic thresholding for anomaly detection**: Needed to adapt to changing climate patterns over decades; quick check: validate threshold sensitivity on held-out data
- **Correlation-based feature clustering**: Needed to capture physical relationships between variables; quick check: verify clusters align with known climate variable groupings
- **5-day aggregation**: Needed to match GEMB temporal resolution; quick check: confirm both datasets have same temporal spacing after preprocessing
- **Z-score normalization with IQR filtering**: Needed to handle outliers and ensure stable model training; quick check: verify no extreme values remain after preprocessing

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: ERA5/GEMB data -> Preprocessing (aggregation, normalization, filtering) -> Correlation clustering -> CLV model (training and detection) -> Counterfactual attribution
- **Critical path**: Data preprocessing → CLV training → Anomaly detection → Attribution analysis
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simpler ERA5 model vs. complex GEMB model creates different anomaly detection sensitivities; the attribution method must work across both architectures
- **Failure signatures**: If attribution yields near-zero differences across all features, the VAE reconstruction loss is not sensitive enough to perturbations
- **First experiments**:
  1. Implement correlation-based k-means clustering and verify clusters match expected climate variable groupings
  2. Train CLV on preprocessed data and visualize reconstruction loss distribution to confirm anomalies are separable
  3. Test attribution method on synthetic anomalies with known drivers to validate sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Attribution method assumes yearly median replacement is a valid counterfactual, which may not capture complex multivariate interactions
- CLV hyperparameters (layers, units, latent dimension, learning rate) are not specified, creating uncertainty in model optimization
- Dynamic thresholding window size for anomaly detection is unspecified, potentially affecting event detection consistency

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Decadal increase in melt anomalies and broad agreement on climate variables as drivers
- **Medium Confidence**: Specific ranking of feature importance within each model
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that ERA5 detects more extreme events due to simpler energy model

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture Verification**: Reproduce CLV using standard VAE/LSTM hyperparameters and verify correlation clustering improves detection on held-out test data
2. **Attribution Sensitivity**: For detected anomalies, vary perturbation method (zero-masking vs. median-masking) and quantify stability of top-3 ranked features
3. **Temporal Consistency**: Apply trained model to held-out year (2021) and assess temporal consistency of attribution rankings with 1951-2020 training period
