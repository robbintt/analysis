# Conformal Inference for Open-Set and Imbalanced Classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.13037
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13037
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Conformal Good-Turing classification addresses open-set scenarios by introducing conformal p-values to detect unseen classes, achieving valid marginal coverage while producing more informative prediction sets than existing methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of classification when test data may contain previously unseen classes. Standard conformal prediction methods fail in open-set scenarios by becoming overly conservative, typically defaulting to a "joker" symbol that represents all unseen classes. The authors propose conformal Good-Turing classification, which uses conformal p-values connected to the Good-Turing estimator to test whether a test point belongs to a new class. By incorporating a selective sample splitting strategy based on label frequency, the method improves efficiency under class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate that this approach maintains valid coverage while producing smaller, more informative prediction sets compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces conformal Good-Turing classification, which extends conformal prediction to open-set scenarios by testing whether test points belong to previously unseen classes. The method computes conformal p-values that are connected to the classical Good-Turing estimator for species probability. To address class imbalance, the approach uses selective sample splitting where samples with frequent labels are used for fitting and prediction, while samples with rare labels are used only for prediction. This strategy improves efficiency when dealing with imbalanced class distributions. The conformal p-values allow the method to make predictions without defaulting to a joker symbol for all unseen classes, resulting in more informative prediction sets while maintaining valid marginal coverage.

## Key Results
- Valid marginal coverage is achieved in open-set settings through the conformal Good-Turing approach
- Prediction sets are more informative with reduced use of joker symbols compared to baseline methods
- The selective sample splitting strategy improves efficiency under class imbalance conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the connection between conformal p-values and the Good-Turing estimator. In open-set classification, when encountering a test point that may belong to an unseen class, the conformal p-value tests whether the point is more likely to belong to a known class or represents a new class. This is mathematically connected to estimating the probability of unseen species in the Good-Turing framework. By computing these p-values and incorporating selective sample splitting based on label frequency, the method can distinguish between rare known classes and truly unseen classes, leading to more nuanced predictions that maintain coverage while reducing over-conservatism.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal Prediction:** A framework for providing uncertainty quantification in predictions; needed to understand the base methodology being extended; quick check: does the method maintain valid coverage under exchangeability?
- **Good-Turing Estimator:** A classical method for estimating probabilities of unseen events in species sampling problems; needed to connect the unseen class problem to established statistical theory; quick check: does the number of unseen classes assumption hold in the data?
- **Open-Set Classification:** The problem setting where test data may contain classes not present in training; needed to frame the motivation and problem definition; quick check: what proportion of test data represents truly unseen classes?
- **Class Imbalance:** The phenomenon where class distributions are skewed, with some classes having far fewer samples; needed to understand the efficiency challenges; quick check: what is the imbalance ratio across classes?
- **Selective Sample Splitting:** A strategy that uses different subsets of data for different purposes based on sample characteristics; needed to understand the efficiency improvement mechanism; quick check: how does the split affect variance in predictions?
- **Conformal P-values:** Values computed from conformity scores that provide probabilistic guarantees; needed to understand the core mechanism for open-set detection; quick check: are the p-values uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Training data → Label frequency analysis → Sample splitting → Conformity score computation → Good-Turing-based p-value calculation → Prediction set construction

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves computing label frequencies, performing selective sample splitting, calculating conformity scores for each test point, computing Good-Turing-based conformal p-values, and constructing prediction sets that balance coverage with informativeness.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational complexity for improved prediction quality by introducing the Good-Turing estimator connection and selective sample splitting. While these additions increase computational overhead compared to standard conformal methods, they enable detection of unseen classes without defaulting to a joker symbol, resulting in more informative predictions.

**Failure Signatures:** The method may fail when the Good-Turing estimator assumptions are violated, particularly when the number of unseen classes is not properly accounted for. Performance may degrade under extreme class imbalance where rare known classes are difficult to distinguish from unseen classes. The method may also struggle when test data contains multiple unseen classes simultaneously.

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Synthetic data experiment varying the number of unseen classes to test sensitivity to Good-Turing assumptions
2. Class-imbalance experiment with varying imbalance ratios to evaluate selective sample splitting effectiveness
3. Real-world benchmark experiment comparing prediction set sizes against standard conformal methods with joker symbols

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees depend on Good-Turing estimator assumptions, particularly regarding the number of unseen classes
- Performance in highly imbalanced scenarios with many rare classes requires further investigation
- Empirical validation relies on relatively small-scale experiments that may not capture real-world complexity

## Confidence

**Major claim clusters:**
- Theoretical validity of conformal Good-Turing approach (Medium confidence)
- Improved efficiency under class imbalance (Medium confidence)
- Superior empirical performance (Low-Medium confidence)

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate performance on larger-scale datasets with more classes and higher class imbalance ratios to assess scalability and robustness
2. Test the method under varying assumptions about the number of unseen classes to understand sensitivity to Good-Turing estimator requirements
3. Compare against additional open-set classification baselines, particularly methods that explicitly model class uncertainty or use hierarchical approaches
