# Explaining GNN Explanations with Edge Gradients

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.01048
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01048
- Reference count: 40
- This paper analyzes Graph Neural Network (GNN) explainability methods by establishing theoretical connections between different approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a theoretical analysis of Graph Neural Network (GNN) explainability methods, particularly focusing on GNNExplainer. The authors establish that under certain conditions, GNNExplainer's optimization is governed by edge gradients, showing that it approximates a simple heuristic based on the sign of edge gradients. Through a path decomposition approach of the computation graph, the paper reinterprets AMP-ave and connects it to other decomposition methods like GOAt. The work provides a unified theoretical perspective on GNN explainability methods and validates these theoretical findings through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes theoretical connections between GNN explainability methods through three main approaches. First, it analyzes when GNNExplainer's optimization is governed by edge gradients, showing conditions where it approximates a gradient-based heuristic. Second, it proves that for linear GNNs, layerwise edge gradients are equivalent to layerwise occlusion. Third, using path decomposition of the computation graph, it reinterprets AMP-ave and connects it to other decomposition methods. The authors validate their theoretical claims through experiments comparing explanations from different methods across various architectures and tasks.

## Key Results
- GNNExplainer's optimization is governed by edge gradients under certain conditions, approximating a simple heuristic based on the sign of edge gradients
- For linear GNNs, layerwise edge gradients are mathematically equivalent to layerwise occlusion
- GNNExplainer produces explanations similar to positive gradients across various architectures and tasks
- AMP-ave can be reinterpreted through path decomposition and connected to other decomposition methods like GOAt

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's mechanism works by establishing theoretical connections between different GNN explainability approaches through mathematical analysis. The core insight is that edge gradients can serve as a proxy for importance in certain GNN architectures, particularly linear ones. The path decomposition technique allows the authors to break down the computation graph into interpretable components, revealing relationships between seemingly different explanation methods. By proving these theoretical connections, the paper provides a unified framework for understanding how different explainability methods relate to each other.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Neural networks that operate on graph-structured data - needed to understand the models being explained, quick check: can you describe message passing in GNNs?
- **Explainability methods**: Techniques for interpreting ML model predictions - needed to understand the context, quick check: can you name two gradient-based vs perturbation-based explainability methods?
- **Edge gradients**: Gradients with respect to graph edges - needed for the theoretical analysis, quick check: can you explain how gradients propagate through graph edges?
- **Path decomposition**: Breaking computation graphs into paths - needed for the AMP-ave analysis, quick check: can you describe how a path decomposition would work for a 2-layer GNN?
- **Linear vs non-linear GNNs**: Different activation functions affect theoretical properties - needed to understand the limitations, quick check: can you explain why linearity simplifies the theoretical analysis?
- **Occlusion**: Masking parts of input to measure importance - needed for the equivalence proof, quick check: can you describe how occlusion would work on a graph structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input graph -> GNN layers (with non-linearities) -> Prediction -> Explanation method (GNNExplainer, AMP-ave, etc.)

Critical path: Graph edges → Message passing → Node representations → Prediction → Explanation generation

Design tradeoffs: The paper focuses on theoretical analysis rather than proposing new architectures. The key tradeoff is between theoretical tractability (favoring linear GNNs) and practical applicability (where non-linear GNNs dominate).

Failure signatures: The theoretical results may not hold for deep GNNs with complex architectures, or when the conditions for edge gradient dominance are not met. Non-linear activations can break the equivalence between gradients and occlusion.

First experiments:
1. Verify gradient-based explanation methods on a simple linear GNN with synthetic data
2. Compare GNNExplainer explanations with positive gradient heuristics on a small real dataset
3. Test the path decomposition approach on a toy graph to visualize AMP-ave computation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical analysis primarily focuses on linear GNNs, which are less common in practice than non-linear architectures
- The conditions under which GNNExplainer approximates positive gradients may not hold for all graph structures and model architectures
- The experimental validation, while extensive, could benefit from larger-scale real-world datasets to validate the theoretical findings across more diverse scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence: The theoretical proofs for linear GNNs and the equivalence between layerwise edge gradients and occlusion
- Medium confidence: The approximation claims for non-linear GNNs and the relationship between AMP-ave and other decomposition methods
- Medium confidence: The experimental validation results showing similarity between GNNExplainer and positive gradients

## Next Checks
1. Test the theoretical equivalence between edge gradients and occlusion on a linear GNN with controlled synthetic data
2. Experimentally validate the approximation of GNNExplainer by positive gradients on a non-linear GNN architecture
3. Apply the path decomposition technique to analyze a new explainability method not covered in the paper
