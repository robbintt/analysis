# SALT-KG: A Benchmark for Semantics-Aware Learning on Enterprise Tables

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.07638
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07638
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Metadata-derived features yield modest predictive improvements but consistently expose models' limitations in exploiting semantic alignment

## Executive Summary
SALT-KG extends the SALT relational prediction benchmark by integrating structured operational business knowledge from a metadata knowledge graph, enabling semantics-aware learning on enterprise tables. This graph layer captures field-level descriptions, business object types, and declarative relationships, allowing models to reason over both tabular data and contextual semantics. Empirical evaluation shows that metadata-derived features yield only modest improvements in classical prediction metrics but consistently reveal gaps in models' ability to exploit semantic alignment and contextual relationships. The benchmark highlights the need for architectures that integrate relational structure with declarative schema semantics to advance tabular foundation models grounded in enterprise knowledge.

## Method Summary
SALT-KG augments multi-table enterprise transactional data with semantic context extracted from an Operational Business Knowledge Graph (OBKG). For each table/field, text descriptions are concatenated (CDS View + Fields + objNodeTypes), embedded using TEXT-EMBEDDING-3-LARGE, reduced via PCA to 16-64 components, and early-fused with tabular features. Eight baselines (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, CARTE, AutoGluon, GraphSAGE, plus random/majority classifiers) are trained on 8 missing-field prediction tasks, measuring Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) changes with vs. without KG features.

## Key Results
- Metadata-derived features provide only modest improvements in MRR across prediction tasks
- Tree-based methods show stable performance while neural models exhibit greater sensitivity to semantic alignment
- Performance degrades when PCA dimensions exceed 64 due to noise amplification
- The benchmark reveals fundamental limitations in models' ability to leverage semantic context beyond statistical correlations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Concatenating metadata-derived semantic vectors with raw tabular features allows models to condition statistical predictions on declarative business context.
- **Mechanism:** Early fusion strategy where textual descriptions of CDS Views, Fields, and Object Node Types are encoded into vector space and concatenated to raw numerical/categorical row vectors.
- **Core assumption:** Semantic information required to resolve ambiguous field values is captureable in static text descriptions of the schema.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3 describes early fusion approach; Abstract states benchmark enables evaluation of models that jointly reason over tabular evidence and contextual semantics.
- **Break condition:** If semantic vector dimensionality is too high or textual descriptions lack distinctiveness, fusion adds noise that degrades model convergence.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Structuring enterprise metadata as a Knowledge Graph (OBKG) explicitly exposes hierarchical and relational dependencies that are implicit in raw database schemas.
- **Mechanism:** OBKG construction where nodes represent tables, fields, and business object types, with SPARQL queries retrieving "one-hop" context.
- **Core assumption:** The "meaning" of a data point is partially encoded in its relationship to higher-level business objects rather than just its column name.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 2 describes OBKG modeling ontological concepts; Figure 1 illustrates alignment of relational and knowledge layers.
- **Break condition:** If underlying ontology lacks depth, KG reduces to flat dictionary of labels, failing to provide reasoning leverage.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Semantic grounding primarily modifies the inductive biases of neural models rather than guaranteeing immediate accuracy gains over classical baselines.
- **Mechanism:** Forcing models to ingest "what entities mean" alongside "what values they have" shifts learning from pure correlation memorization to semantics-conditioned reasoning.
- **Core assumption:** Neural architectures possess capacity to utilize semantic priors better than tree-based models.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3 reports metadata features yield modest improvements but modify inductive biases; tree-based methods remain stable while neural baselines show greater sensitivity.
- **Break condition:** If model architecture cannot effectively read or attend to semantic vector, inductive bias shift will not occur.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Early Fusion vs. Late Fusion**
  - **Why needed here:** SALT-KG relies on concatenating semantic vectors with tabular data before model processes them (Early Fusion).
  - **Quick check question:** Are semantic features combined with raw data at input layer (Early) or predictions combined at output layer (Late)?

- **Concept: Inductive Bias**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper explicitly claims OBKG value lies in modifying inductive bias.
  - **Quick check question:** Does adding semantic feature make model prefer solutions that align with business logic, or just give it more data columns?

- **Concept: Knowledge Graph Triple Patterns**
  - **Why needed here:** OBKG is queried using SPARQL triple patterns to fetch context for tables and fields.
  - **Quick check question:** If field lacks direct link to business object type in graph, will query return null, and how does pipeline handle missing semantic context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Source Data (SALT tables + RDF Metadata) -> Extractor (SPARQL queries) -> Encoder (TEXT-EMBEDDING-3-LARGE + PCA) -> Fusion Layer (Concatenation) -> Predictor (XGBoost, CARTE, GraphSAGE, etc.)

- **Critical path:** Alignment between `fieldName` in OBKG and column header in SALT tables. If mapping breaks, semantic context applied to wrong features.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Dimensionality vs. Noise: >64 PCA components lead to noise amplification; <16 loses semantic nuance
  - Model Selection: Tree-based models are robust but "semantically blind"; Neural models are sensitive but capable of leveraging semantic context

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Performance Degradation: LightGBM/CatBoost showing significant drops indicates feature leakage or noise in semantic vector
  - Static Results: Random classifiers improving but advanced models not indicates semantic features acting as weak signal only trivial models benefit from

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Run XGBoost and LightGBM on SALT data without KG features to verify reproduction of original SALT benchmark metrics
  2. Sensitivity Analysis: Train AutoGluon with varying PCA components (16, 32, 64) on KG embeddings to identify noise amplification threshold
  3. Ablation Study: Remove "Object Node Types" from text concatenation to test specific contribution of hierarchical business context vs. simple field definitions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How effective are specific embedding representations used for OBKG metadata in conveying semantic context? (Explicit in conclusion; unresolved due to single baseline method used)
- **Open Question 2:** Does introducing deeper ontological structure and cross-entity abstraction enable models to better internalize higher-order semantic context? (Explicit in conclusion; unresolved due to existing enterprise schema limitations)
- **Open Question 3:** What architectures can successfully unify relational, semantic, and linguistic understanding beyond simple early feature fusion? (Explicit call for future work; unresolved due to insufficient gains from current early fusion approach)

## Limitations
- SPARQL query design for OBKG extraction is critical but unspecified in the paper
- Choice of PCA dimension (16-64) lacks clear rationale for specific value used in reported results
- Empirical evidence for inductive bias modification is weak, relying on observed sensitivity differences without deeper ablation or interpretability analysis

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (Early Fusion):** Medium confidence - well-specified architecturally but sensitive to embedding quality and dimensionality choices
- **Mechanism 2 (OBKG Construction):** High confidence - standard KG methodology with clear structural benefits, though depth limitations acknowledged
- **Mechanism 3 (Inductive Bias Shift):** Low confidence - empirical observation without robust theoretical or experimental validation

## Next Checks

1. **SPARQL Template Validation:** Implement and test multiple SPARQL query patterns to verify semantic context extraction quality
2. **Dimensionality Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically evaluate MRR across PCA dimensions (16, 32, 48, 64) to identify optimal trade-off between semantic richness and noise amplification
3. **Inductive Bias Quantification:** Design controlled experiments comparing model predictions with and without semantic features on ambiguous cases where business logic should dominate statistical patterns
