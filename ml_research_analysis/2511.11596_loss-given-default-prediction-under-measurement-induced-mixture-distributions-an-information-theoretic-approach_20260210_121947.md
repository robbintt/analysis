# Loss Given Default Prediction Under Measurement-Induced Mixture Distributions: An Information-Theoretic Approach

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.11596
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11596
- **Reference count:** 8
- **Primary result:** Information-theoretic approach achieves R² = 0.191 and RMSE = 0.284 on corporate LGD prediction when 89.7% of training data consists of proxy estimates

## Executive Summary
This study addresses systematic model failure in Loss Given Default (LGD) prediction caused by extreme mixture contamination in training data. When 89.7% of training samples consist of proxy estimates rather than actual recovery outcomes, traditional machine learning methods like Random Forest catastrophically fail, achieving worse-than-mean performance (R² = -0.664). The paper proposes an information-theoretic framework using Shannon entropy and mutual information that successfully generalizes from proxy-dominated training data to actual outcomes, achieving substantial performance improvements (R² = 0.191, RMSE = 0.284) on 1,218 corporate bankruptcies spanning 1980-2023.

The work demonstrates that recursive partitioning methods fail under these conditions because they optimize splits based on proxy distribution characteristics rather than true recovery outcomes. The information-theoretic approach provides explicit uncertainty quantification that outperforms implicit regularization, offering practical guidance for financial institutions deploying LGD models under Basel III requirements when representative outcome data is unavailable at sufficient scale. The findings have broader implications for any domain where extended observation periods create unavoidable mixture structure in training data.

## Method Summary
The study develops an information-theoretic framework for LGD prediction that addresses systematic model failure under mixture contamination. The approach uses Shannon entropy to quantify uncertainty and mutual information to identify predictive features that maintain their relationship across proxy and actual outcome distributions. The framework explicitly models the mixture structure rather than treating proxy estimates as true observations, enabling better generalization when actual recovery data is sparse. The method was evaluated on a dataset of 1,218 corporate bankruptcies from 1980-2023, where 89.7% of training data consisted of proxy estimates. Performance was compared against traditional Random Forest models using standard regression metrics including R² and RMSE.

## Key Results
- Traditional Random Forest fails catastrophically under mixture contamination, achieving R² = -0.664 (worse than predicting the mean)
- Information-theoretic approach achieves R² = 0.191 and RMSE = 0.284 on 1,218 corporate bankruptcies (1980-2023)
- Leverage-based features contain 1.510 bits of mutual information while size effects contribute only 0.086 bits, contradicting regulatory assumptions about scale-dependent recovery
- The approach provides explicit uncertainty quantification that outperforms implicit regularization methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The information-theoretic approach succeeds because it explicitly models the mixture distribution structure rather than treating proxy estimates as true observations. Traditional ML methods optimize splits based on proxy distribution characteristics, which differ systematically from actual outcome distributions. By using Shannon entropy and mutual information, the framework identifies features and relationships that remain consistent across both proxy and actual outcome distributions, enabling better generalization. The explicit uncertainty quantification captures the inherent measurement error in proxy estimates, while traditional methods' implicit regularization cannot adequately handle the scale and systematic nature of the mixture contamination.

## Foundational Learning
- **Shannon Entropy**: Measures uncertainty in probability distributions; needed to quantify information content in features and predictions under mixture contamination; quick check: verify entropy values decrease appropriately when conditioning on informative features
- **Mutual Information**: Quantifies statistical dependence between variables; needed to identify features maintaining predictive relationships across proxy and actual distributions; quick check: confirm mutual information values are positive and consistent across different feature subsets
- **Mixture Distribution Modeling**: Represents data arising from multiple underlying processes; needed to explicitly model the proxy-actual outcome structure; quick check: verify mixture components capture distinct patterns in proxy vs actual recovery data
- **Information Bottleneck Principle**: Balances compression and prediction in feature selection; needed to optimize feature sets under uncertainty; quick check: confirm selected features achieve high mutual information with outcomes while maintaining low mutual information among themselves
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Explicitly modeling prediction confidence; needed to handle proxy measurement error; quick check: verify uncertainty estimates correlate with actual prediction errors
- **Basel III LGD Requirements**: Regulatory framework for credit risk modeling; needed to contextualize practical implications; quick check: confirm proposed approach meets regulatory standards for model performance and documentation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Proxy Data -> Information Theory Processing -> Feature Selection -> Model Training -> Uncertainty Quantification -> Prediction

**Critical Path:** The core workflow involves transforming proxy-dominated data through information-theoretic processing to identify robust features, then training models that explicitly account for mixture structure uncertainty. The critical path includes entropy calculation, mutual information estimation, feature selection based on information criteria, model training with uncertainty-aware loss functions, and final prediction with confidence intervals.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades computational complexity for robustness to measurement error. Information-theoretic calculations require significant computation compared to standard ML preprocessing, but this investment enables successful learning from contaminated data. The framework sacrifices some predictive accuracy on clean data to maintain performance under extreme mixture contamination. Explicit uncertainty quantification adds overhead but provides valuable risk assessment capabilities required by regulatory frameworks.

**Failure Signatures:** Models trained without accounting for mixture structure show negative R² values and systematic bias toward proxy distribution characteristics. Features selected through standard correlation measures fail to generalize, showing low mutual information with actual outcomes despite high correlation with proxies. Traditional regularization methods cannot compensate for the fundamental mismatch between proxy and actual outcome distributions. Performance degrades severely when proxy contamination exceeds 70-80% of training data.

**First Experiments:** 
1. Compare entropy-based feature selection against standard correlation-based methods on proxy-contaminated data
2. Test model performance across varying levels of proxy contamination (50%, 70%, 89.7%, 95%)
3. Validate uncertainty quantification by comparing predicted confidence intervals with actual prediction errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are based on a specific dataset of 1,218 corporate bankruptcies from 1980-2023, limiting generalizability to other financial contexts
- The approach's performance on different levels of mixture contamination (50-80% proxy estimates) has not been empirically validated
- Alternative feature engineering approaches could yield different information-theoretic properties and performance characteristics
- The framework requires significant computational resources for information-theoretic calculations compared to standard ML methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in core claim that information-theoretic methods outperform traditional ML approaches under mixture contamination (supported by direct empirical comparison with clear performance metrics)
- **Medium confidence** in specific mutual information values (context-dependent and may vary with different data preprocessing or feature selection approaches)
- **Low confidence** in claims about regulatory assumption contradictions (requires broader validation across multiple regulatory frameworks and institutional contexts)

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on alternative datasets with different mixture contamination levels (50-80% proxy estimates) to verify robustness across contamination severity
2. Apply the framework to non-financial domains with similar measurement challenges (e.g., healthcare outcomes with delayed observations) to validate generalizability claims
3. Conduct ablation studies removing individual information-theoretic components to quantify their marginal contribution to performance improvements
