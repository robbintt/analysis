# What the HellaSwag? On the Validity of Common-Sense Reasoning Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.07825
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07825
- Reference count: 35
- This paper shows that the widely used HellaSwag benchmark for commonsense reasoning suffers from severe construct validity issues

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies critical validity problems in the HellaSwag benchmark, a widely-used dataset for evaluating commonsense reasoning in language models. Through systematic analysis of grammatical errors, nonsensical options, and cases where context doesn't meaningfully influence predictions, the authors demonstrate that HellaSwag fails to reliably measure the intended common-sense reasoning capabilities. The study reveals that in over 65% of cases, model predictions remain unchanged even when the question prompt is removed or replaced with generic text, indicating fundamental construct validity issues.

To address these problems, the authors propose specific requirements for valid commonsense reasoning benchmarks and release GoldenSwag, a corrected subset of HellaSwag with significantly reduced validity issues. Their work highlights the importance of rigorous validation in benchmark design and provides practical guidelines for creating more reliable evaluation datasets in natural language processing.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive analysis of HellaSwag's validity through multiple approaches. They performed manual annotations of 1,000 examples to identify issues including grammatical errors, nonsensical options, and context-independent predictions. Using multiple language models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Claude), they evaluated model predictions under different conditions: with original prompts, with prompts removed, and with prompts replaced by generic text. They also developed a scoring system to quantify validity issues and created GoldenSwag by selecting high-quality examples from HellaSwag that meet their proposed validity requirements. The analysis involved both automated scoring and human evaluation to ensure robustness of findings.

## Key Results
- HellaSwag contains significant construct validity issues including grammatical errors, typos, and nonsensical options
- Model predictions remain unchanged in over 65% of cases when question prompts are removed or replaced with generic text
- GoldenSwag, a corrected subset, shows substantially reduced validity problems while maintaining similar task difficulty
- The proposed validity requirements effectively identify and address common benchmark construction issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study works by systematically exposing the disconnect between benchmark design intentions and actual model behavior. By removing or replacing context prompts and observing that model predictions remain largely unchanged, the authors demonstrate that the "reasoning" being measured is not dependent on the commonsense understanding the benchmark claims to test. The mechanism reveals that models are likely relying on superficial patterns in answer options rather than genuinely reasoning about the context provided.

## Foundational Learning

**Construct Validity** - The extent to which a test measures what it claims to measure. Critical for ensuring benchmarks actually evaluate intended capabilities rather than spurious correlations.

**Common-sense Reasoning** - The ability to make inferences about everyday situations using implicit knowledge about the world. Needed to understand what HellaSwag aims to measure and why validity issues matter.

**Benchmark Construction** - The process of creating evaluation datasets that reliably measure specific capabilities. Essential for understanding how validity issues arise and how to prevent them.

**Human Annotation** - The process of having humans review and label data to assess quality and identify issues. Quick check: Are annotators trained and using consistent criteria?

**Model Evaluation** - The process of testing models on benchmarks to assess performance. Quick check: Does the evaluation setup match the intended use case?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data Collection -> Human Annotation -> Model Evaluation -> Validity Scoring -> GoldenSwag Creation

Critical Path: The analysis pipeline moves from identifying specific validity issues (grammatical errors, nonsensical options, context-independent predictions) through systematic evaluation using multiple models and conditions, culminating in the creation of a validated benchmark subset.

Design Tradeoffs: The study balances comprehensive coverage with practical feasibility - analyzing 1,000 examples provides statistical significance while remaining manageable for manual annotation. Using multiple models increases robustness but requires more computational resources.

Failure Signatures: Models that perform well on HellaSwag despite context-independent predictions indicate the benchmark measures superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. Grammatical errors and nonsensical options directly signal data quality issues.

Three First Experiments:
1. Replicate the prompt removal/replacement analysis with additional model families and sampling strategies
2. Apply the validity scoring system to a new commonsense reasoning benchmark during construction
3. Conduct ablation studies on GoldenSwag to identify which validity requirements are most critical

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis covers only a subset of HellaSwag examples (1,000 for initial analysis, 100 for detailed annotation)
- Findings based on specific language models may not generalize to all evaluation approaches
- Focus on English-language benchmarks limits generalizability to multilingual contexts
- Manual annotation process, while thorough, may introduce subjectivity in validity assessments

## Confidence

High:
- Construct validity issues exist in HellaSwag

Medium:
- >65% of examples show context-independent predictions
- Proposed requirements adequately address validity concerns
- GoldenSwag represents a substantial improvement

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the analysis across multiple model families (including open-source models like Llama, Mistral) and varying sampling parameters to assess robustness of findings

2. Conduct systematic analysis of the remaining 90% of HellaSwag examples not covered in the detailed annotation study

3. Test the proposed requirements by applying them to benchmark construction from scratch, measuring their effectiveness in preventing validity issues
