# Context-Aware Pseudo-Label Scoring for Zero-Shot Video Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17501
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17501
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Zero-shot video summarization using rubric-guided LLM prompting with pseudo-labels, achieving F1 scores of 57.58 (SumMe), 63.05 (TVSum), and 53.79 (QFVS)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled prompting framework for zero-shot video summarization, aiming to reduce sensitivity to handcrafted prompts and improve dataset adaptability. The method converts a small set of human annotations into high-confidence pseudo labels, organizes them into structured scoring rubrics, and applies these to guide large language model (LLM) scoring. During inference, boundary scenes are scored using their own descriptions, while intermediate scenes incorporate summaries of adjacent scenes to balance local salience and global coherence. Experiments on three benchmarks (SumMe, TVSum, and QFVS) demonstrate stable performance improvements: F1 scores of 57.58, 63.05, and 53.79, respectively, surpassing the zero-shot baseline by +0.85, +0.84, and +0.37. The approach establishes a training-free, interpretable, and generalizable paradigm for both generic and query-focused video summarization.

## Method Summary
The method uses perceptual hashing to segment videos into scenes, generates descriptions for each scene and the full video using a VideoLLM, and creates dataset-specific scoring rubrics from pseudo-labels derived from a small subset of human annotations. During inference, scenes are scored using these rubrics with context-aware prompts—boundary scenes use only their own and global descriptions, while intermediate scenes also incorporate summaries of adjacent scenes with a ±5 adjustment based on narrative progression. Scene scores are then smoothed using cosine interpolation and converted to frame-level importance scores via consistency and uniqueness weighting.

## Key Results
- F1 scores of 57.58 (SumMe), 63.05 (TVSum), and 53.79 (QFVS) achieved
- Outperforms zero-shot baseline by +0.85, +0.84, and +0.37 F1 points respectively
- Stable performance across diverse video summarization benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured rubrics derived from pseudo-labels reduce LLM scoring variance caused by ad-hoc prompt wording.
- Mechanism: The framework converts a small subset (10%) of human annotations into pseudo-labels via reason mining, which are abstracted into multi-dimensional rubrics (e.g., thematic relevance, action detail). These rubrics constrain LLM scoring to dataset-specific criteria, replacing free-form prompts with standardized evaluation rules and penalties. This grounds scoring in observable data patterns rather than human intuition.
- Core assumption: The selected pseudo-labels accurately capture the dataset's salience criteria and are not biased by the small subset or annotation noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled prompting framework... converts a small subset of human annotations into high-confidence pseudo labels and aggregates them into structured, dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics"
  - [section 3.4.2]: "elevate them into evaluation dimensions with explicit constraints and penalties... formalize a calibration ladder"
  - [corpus]: "Prototype-Guided Pseudo-Labeling... pseudo-labels derived from zero-shot predictions often exhibit significant noise" — highlights that pseudo-label quality is a common concern, supporting the assumption as a critical dependency.
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if the pseudo-labels are noisy, unrepresentative, or if the rubric abstraction process introduces systematic bias.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contextualized prompting for intermediate scenes improves narrative coherence by explicitly comparing each scene to its neighbors.
- Mechanism: Boundary (first/last) scenes are scored using only their own descriptions and global video context. Intermediate scenes receive prompts that include concise summaries of the previous and next scenes, with instructions to apply a conservative ±5 score adjustment based on whether the target adds "new information/progression" or is "largely duplicated." This explicit neighbor comparison acts as a lightweight mechanism to suppress redundancy and reward narrative advancement.
- Core assumption: The LLM can reliably determine "new information" and "duplication" from short summaries and apply the adjustment consistently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "intermediate scenes incorporate summaries of adjacent scenes to balance local salience and global coherence"
  - [section 3.4.3]: "Apply a conservative context adjustment (±5): +5 if the Target clearly adds NEW information/progression vs. both neighbors"
  - [corpus]: "Context-Aware Baseball Highlight Summarization" and "Unsupervised Transcript-assisted Video Summarization" both emphasize context for coherence, indirectly supporting the value of this design.
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if the LLM's "new vs. duplicate" judgment is inconsistent or if the summaries are too vague to provide meaningful context.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temporal smoothing with frame-level representativeness weighting converts scene scores into stable importance curves.
- Mechanism: Raw scene scores are normalized and then mapped to frames. A cosine-based interpolation smooths transitions between scene midpoints to avoid boundary discontinuities. Within each scene, frames are weighted by a combination of "consistency" (cluster membership stability) and "uniqueness" (distance from mean embedding), with mixing rules adapted to video length. This converts discrete scene-level judgments into continuous, noise-resistant frame importance values.
- Core assumption: The chosen combination of consistency and uniqueness, and the length-based parameter rules, are generally applicable across video types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.5]: "The final per-frame score is obtained by combining the smoothed scene score with the frame-level weight."
  - [section 3.5]: Equations 9-17 define normalization, cosine smoothing, and the consistency/uniqueness weighting.
  - [corpus]: Evidence weak; corpus does not provide direct precedent for this specific smoothing/weighting scheme.
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if the smoothing over-smooths genuine short-term importance spikes or if the frame weighting parameters are inappropriate for the video content type.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Pseudo-Labeling for Prompt Engineering**
  - Why needed here: The core innovation uses pseudo-labels not for model training but to distill ground-truth patterns into reusable evaluation rubrics for LLM prompting.
  - Quick check question: How does this use of pseudo-labels differ from their traditional role in semi-supervised learning?

- Concept: **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Rubric-Guided LLM Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on LLM-as-a-Judge style reasoning, using structured rubrics to make scoring interpretable and reduce brittleness.
  - Quick check question: What are the two key stages of the LLM's reasoning process in this framework?

- Concept: **Scene Segmentation in Untrimmed Videos**
  - Why needed here: The entire pipeline depends on partitioning videos into coherent semantic units (scenes) using perceptual hashing and adaptive thresholding.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary signal used to detect scene boundaries, and how is the threshold chosen?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Scenario Division -> Caption Preparation -> Context-Aware LLM Scorer -> Frame-Score Converter
- Critical path: **Scenario Division** -> **Caption Preparation** -> (using pre-built rubrics) **Context-Aware LLM Scorer** -> **Frame-Score Converter**. The Pseudo-Label & Rubric Engine is an offline dependency.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Weak supervision vs. prompt sensitivity**: Uses 10% GT to reduce handcrafted prompt dependency but introduces reliance on pseudo-label quality.
  - **Context detail vs. LLM cost/confusion**: Provides neighbor summaries to intermediate scenes but risks adding noise or confusing the LLM.
  - **Smoothing aggressiveness**: Cosine interpolation ensures stable curves but may blur sharp importance transitions.
- Failure signatures:
  - **Noisy/over-segmented scenes**: Likely due to poor perceptual hash thresholding or failure in short-segment merging.
  - **Inconsistent LLM scores**: May indicate rubric prompts are too abstract or neighbor context summaries are unhelpful/misleading.
  - **Poor alignment with GT on novel video types**: Suggests rubrics are overfitted to the pseudo-label source videos' characteristics.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablate the contextual scoring**: Run inference with *only* the pseudo-label-derived rubric (no neighbor context) on all scenes. Compare F1 scores and stability to the full model to quantify the context contribution.
  2. **Vary pseudo-label percentage**: Test with 5%, 10%, and 15% of videos for pseudo-label generation to analyze the sensitivity of rubric quality and final performance to the amount of supervision.
  3. **Visualize and analyze scene boundaries**: For a sample of videos, manually inspect detected scene boundaries vs. semantic shifts. If alignment is poor, experiment with alternative hash methods or merging thresholds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can lightweight model distillation techniques be applied to the LLM-based scoring mechanism to enable real-time summarization for extremely long videos without significant accuracy loss?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that "inference with large language models remains computationally demanding," explicitly proposing "lightweight model distillation" as a direction to improve scalability for real-time applications.
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies on heavy cloud-based LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, ChatGPT-5) for reasoning, creating a bottleneck that hinders deployment on resource-constrained devices or for long-form content like the QFVS dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring the trade-off between inference latency and F1 scores on long videos (e.g., QFVS) when using a distilled, local model versus the full LLM.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the integration of audio and subtitle features enhance the rubric's ability to capture "narrative progression" and "thematic relevance" in query-focused scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly lists the lack of "multimodal cues such as audio, subtitles, or textual metadata" as a limitation, noting that incorporating these could "further enhance semantic understanding."
- Why unresolved: The current method relies solely on visual descriptors, potentially missing critical context provided by dialogue or sound, which may be necessary for aligning summaries with specific user queries in datasets like QFVS.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on the QFVS benchmark where the scene description module is augmented with audio transcripts/text, showing improved alignment with "oracle" summaries compared to the visual-only baseline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can a confidence-aware pseudo-labeling mechanism be implemented to prevent the propagation of biased or low-consensus ground-truth annotations into the scoring rubrics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in the Limitations that "biased or low-consensus labels may propagate dataset-specific tendencies," and identify "confidence-aware pseudo labeling" as a necessary future improvement.
- Why unresolved: The method currently converts a small subset of annotations into pseudo labels deterministically; if the initial human annotations are noisy or subjective (common in SumMe), the resulting rubric may reinforce those biases rather than correcting them.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study showing that filtering pseudo labels based on an LLM's confidence score (or inter-annotator agreement) results in higher cross-dataset generalization performance compared to using all available annotations.

## Limitations

- Heavy reliance on LLM-based reasoning creates computational bottlenecks for real-time or long-video applications
- Pseudo-label quality and rubric construction depend critically on the representativeness of the small human annotation subset
- Current method ignores multimodal cues like audio and subtitles that could enhance semantic understanding

## Confidence

- **High**: Core claim that rubric-guided pseudo-labeling reduces prompt sensitivity is well-supported by explicit mechanism descriptions and clear performance gains over naive zero-shot baseline
- **Medium**: Contextual scoring improvement for intermediate scenes is well-specified but depends on LLM's consistent interpretation of "new information"
- **Low**: Frame-level smoothing and weighting scheme lacks direct empirical validation in the corpus and depends on untuned parameters

## Next Checks

1. **Ablate the contextual scoring**: Run inference with only the pseudo-label-derived rubric (no neighbor context) on all scenes. Compare F1 scores and stability to the full model to quantify the context contribution.
2. **Vary pseudo-label percentage**: Test with 5%, 10%, and 15% of videos for pseudo-label generation to analyze the sensitivity of rubric quality and final performance to the amount of supervision.
3. **Visualize and analyze scene boundaries**: For a sample of videos, manually inspect detected scene boundaries vs. semantic shifts. If alignment is poor, experiment with alternative hash methods or merging thresholds.
