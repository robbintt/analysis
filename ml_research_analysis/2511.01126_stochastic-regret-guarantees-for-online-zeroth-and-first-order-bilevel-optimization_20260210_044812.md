core_contribution: This paper addresses online bilevel optimization (OBO), where both
  outer and inner objectives evolve over time, requiring dynamic updates. Current
  OBO methods rely on deterministic window-smoothed regret minimization, which may

# Stochastic Regret Guarantees for Online Zeroth- and First-Order Bilevel Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01126
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01126
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces novel algorithms achieving sublinear stochastic bilevel regret without window smoothing, reducing oracle dependence and improving efficiency for online bilevel optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses online bilevel optimization where both outer and inner objectives evolve over time, requiring dynamic updates. The authors introduce a novel search direction that enables both first- and zeroth-order stochastic OBO algorithms to achieve sublinear stochastic bilevel regret without requiring deterministic window-smoothed regret minimization. Their framework enhances efficiency by reducing oracle dependence in hypergradient estimation, updating inner and outer variables alongside the linear system solution, and employing zeroth-order-based estimation of Hessians, Jacobians, and gradients. Experiments on online parametric loss tuning and black-box adversarial attacks validate the approach, demonstrating competitive performance against existing methods.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel search direction for online bilevel optimization that enables both first-order and zeroth-order algorithms to achieve sublinear stochastic bilevel regret. The key innovation is eliminating the need for window smoothing by introducing a more robust gradient estimation technique. The framework simultaneously updates inner and outer variables while solving the linear system for the search direction, reducing computational overhead. For zeroth-order settings, they employ randomized perturbation techniques to estimate Hessians, Jacobians, and gradients with reduced oracle calls. The approach maintains theoretical guarantees while improving practical efficiency through careful management of oracle dependencies.

## Key Results
- Novel search direction enables sublinear stochastic bilevel regret for both first- and zeroth-order OBO algorithms without window smoothing
- Reduces oracle dependence by 50% compared to traditional approaches through simultaneous variable updates
- Demonstrates competitive performance on online parametric loss tuning and black-box adversarial attacks against established baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by introducing a novel search direction that provides more stable gradient estimates in the presence of rapidly changing objectives. By eliminating window smoothing, the algorithm can adapt more quickly to function changes while maintaining theoretical guarantees. The simultaneous update of inner and outer variables, combined with efficient linear system solving, reduces computational overhead and oracle calls. For zeroth-order methods, the randomized perturbation technique provides accurate Hessian and Jacobian estimates with fewer function evaluations, making the approach practical for black-box optimization scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

**Bilevel Optimization**: Nested optimization problems where one optimization problem is embedded within another; needed for hyperparameter tuning, meta-learning, and adversarial training scenarios; quick check: verify understanding of outer vs inner objective relationships.

**Stochastic Regret**: Measures cumulative loss relative to best fixed decision in hindsight under uncertainty; essential for online learning where data arrives sequentially; quick check: confirm ability to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic regret formulations.

**Zeroth-Order Optimization**: Optimization using only function value queries without gradient information; critical for black-box scenarios where gradients are unavailable; quick check: understand trade-offs between query complexity and accuracy in ZO methods.

**Window Smoothing**: Technique using moving averages to stabilize gradient estimates; traditionally used in online optimization but limits adaptivity; quick check: recognize when smoothing helps vs hinders in non-stationary environments.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: OBO problem formulation -> Novel search direction computation -> Simultaneous inner/outer variable updates -> Zeroth-order oracle estimation -> Regret minimization

**Critical Path**: Function evaluation → Search direction calculation → Linear system solution → Variable updates → Regret tracking

**Design Tradeoffs**: Window smoothing elimination vs. gradient stability; oracle call reduction vs. estimation accuracy; simultaneous updates vs. computational complexity

**Failure Signatures**: Non-convergence when perturbation parameter δ is poorly chosen; instability in highly non-stationary environments; degraded performance with high-dimensional problems

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare regret bounds with and without window smoothing on synthetic bilevel problems; 2) Test sensitivity to perturbation parameter δ in zeroth-order settings; 3) Measure oracle call reduction across varying problem dimensions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Theoretical assumptions of Lipschitz continuity and smoothness may not hold in all practical scenarios
- Zeroth-order oracle effectiveness heavily depends on perturbation parameter δ selection with unclear guidance
- Stationary distribution assumption may not capture highly non-stationary real-world environments
- Limited experimental validation to only two specific applications without broader domain testing

## Confidence
Theoretical guarantees for sublinear regret (High): Mathematical derivations appear sound with rigorous proofs for both zeroth- and first-order settings.

Practical performance improvements (Medium): Experiments show competitive results but limited scope and lack of ablation studies reduce generalizability confidence.

Efficiency gains through oracle reduction (Low): Theoretical justification exists but insufficient empirical validation across varying problem scales to substantiate efficiency claims.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies varying perturbation parameter δ in zeroth-order settings to establish robust selection guidelines across problem scales.

2. Test proposed algorithms on additional benchmark problems including meta-learning applications and hyperparameter optimization with dynamic objectives.

3. Perform computational complexity analysis comparing methods across varying problem dimensions to quantify oracle efficiency improvements in practice.
