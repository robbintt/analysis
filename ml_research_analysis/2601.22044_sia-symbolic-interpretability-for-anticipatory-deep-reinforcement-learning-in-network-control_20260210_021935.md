# SIA: Symbolic Interpretability for Anticipatory Deep Reinforcement Learning in Network Control

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.22044
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22044
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: SIA achieves sub-millisecond explanations (0.65 ms mean latency) for forecast-augmented DRL agents, revealing hidden design flaws and enabling 9-25% performance improvements

## Executive Summary
SIA is a novel interpretability framework that enables real-time understanding of how forecast-augmented deep reinforcement learning agents operate in network control. The key innovation is combining symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI knowledge graphs to disentangle the influence of current observations from future predictions, addressing the critical transparency gap in anticipatory network agents. SIA achieves sub-millisecond explanation generation speed (0.65 ms mean latency) - over 200× faster than existing methods like SHAP and LIME. In evaluations across three networking use cases (adaptive bitrate streaming, massive MIMO scheduling, and RAN slicing), SIA revealed hidden design flaws including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward function biases that triggered counter-productive policies. These insights enabled targeted fixes: a redesigned ABR agent achieved 9% higher average bitrate, while SIA's online Action Refinement module improved RAN slicing reward by 25% without retraining. The framework demonstrates that symbolic interpretability can transform opaque, forecast-aware agents into transparent, tunable systems suitable for practical deployment in next-generation mobile networks.

## Method Summary
SIA is a five-module pipeline that interprets forecast-augmented DRL agents through symbolic abstraction. The Forecaster (PatchTST for univariate, MLP-RevIN for multivariate) generates predictions for exogenous KPIs. The Symbolizer converts raw KPIs and forecasts into First-Order Logic predicates using change detection (5% threshold), dynamic categorization (5 percentile buckets via P2 algorithm), and trend incorporation (3 slope categories). Per-KPI Knowledge Graphs maintain directed attributed graphs with up to 45 nodes each, storing empirical action distributions and rewards. The Explainer calculates Influence Scores (IS) via KL-divergence weighted by action alignment to quantify each KPI's contribution. Optionally, the Action Refiner overrides agent decisions when forecast-aware KG queries find better actions with reward margins exceeding 3%. This design achieves O(k) complexity versus O(|S|^k|A|) for monolithic approaches while maintaining real-time performance.

## Key Results
- Sub-millisecond explanation latency (0.65 ms mean) versus 141-159 ms for SHAP/LIME methods
- Revealed temporal misalignment bug in ABR agents causing 9% bitrate loss, fixed to improve performance
- Action Refiner improved RAN slicing reward by 25% without retraining through forecast-aware decision overrides
- Demonstrated across three use cases: ABR streaming, massive MIMO scheduling, and RAN slicing control

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Symbolic abstraction via First-Order Logic (FOL) enables real-time interpretation by converting raw numerical KPIs into human-readable predicates that expose temporal relationships. The Symbolizer applies a three-stage pipeline: (1) change detection using sensitivity threshold θ (default 5%), (2) dynamic categorization via streaming percentile estimators (P2 algorithm), and (3) trend incorporation via linear regression slope categorization. This produces symbolic states like `inc(tput, High, Dropping)` meaning "throughput increased to High level but is forecasted to be Dropping."

### Mechanism 2
Per-KPI knowledge graphs achieve bounded complexity by factorizing the state space, avoiding exponential blowup that plagues monolithic approaches. Instead of one large state-action graph, SIA maintains separate directed attributed graphs per KPI. Each KG contains nodes (symbolic states), edges (actions), and attributes (empirical probabilities, rewards, transition counts). Maximum 45 nodes per graph (3 predicates × 5 categories × 3 trends) yields O(k) update complexity versus O(|S|^k|A|) for monolithic approaches.

### Mechanism 3
The Influence Score (IS) disentangles current-state from forecast influence by measuring KL-divergence from baseline action distribution, weighted by alignment with the KPI's most likely action. IS = D_KL(P_k||P_∅) × δ(a_t, a*_k). Step 1: Extract conditional action distribution P_k(a|s_k) from KG edge counts. Step 2: Compute baseline P_∅ as average across KPIs. Step 3: Measure KL-divergence quantifying how much the KPI reduces uncertainty. Step 4: Apply alignment weighting δ that decays exponentially with distance from most likely action for continuous spaces.

## Foundational Learning

- **Controllable vs. Exogenous KPIs in DRL**: SIA's entire purpose is to disentangle how agents use forecasts of exogenous KPIs (which they cannot influence, like bandwidth) versus controllable KPIs (which they directly affect, like buffer level). Without this distinction, interpretation cannot separate anticipation from reaction. *Quick check*: For an ABR agent, classify these KPIs: buffer level, network bandwidth, selected bitrate, download delay. Which are controllable, which are exogenous?

- **Temporal Myopia in Reactive DRL**: The paper frames anticipatory DRL as the solution to reactive agents' blindness to upcoming exogenous changes. Understanding why standard TD-learning cannot anticipate exogenous shifts motivates the forecast-augmented architecture. *Quick check*: Why can't a standard DQN agent learn to anticipate a bandwidth drop before it happens, even if drops follow a predictable pattern?

- **First-Order Logic Predicates and Symbolic AI**: SIA's Symbolizer outputs FOL-style predicates like `inc(tput, High, Dropping)`. Understanding predicate-argument structure, quantifiers, and connectives is essential to reading SIA explanations and configuring the Symbolizer for new domains. *Quick check*: Write an FOL predicate representing "throughput is VeryLow but forecasted to Spike over the next horizon."

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw KPIs → Symbolizer (predicate extraction) → KG update (edge/node annotation) → IS calculation → local explanation output. For Action Refinement: current state + forecast → Symbolizer → KG query for best action → override check.

- **Critical path**: The five-module pipeline processes raw KPIs through Symbolizer to extract FOL predicates, updates per-KPI Knowledge Graphs with empirical distributions, calculates Influence Scores via KL-divergence, and optionally refines actions based on forecast-aware KG queries.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Category count: fewer than 3 → overly generic; more than 7 → prolonged cold-start. Default: 5 for values, 3 for trends. Change threshold θ: low θ for stable metrics (packet-loss), high θ for bursty signals (CSI). Paper found 5% effective across use cases. Override threshold τ: higher values reduce false overrides but miss improvement opportunities. Default 3% chosen empirically.

- **Failure signatures**: Cold-start sparse KGs: initial explanations unreliable. Mitigation: pre-populate from offline traces. Category boundary crossing from forecast error: if forecast error pushes KPI across percentile boundary, interpretation/refinement may misfire. Mitigation: wider buckets for volatile KPIs. Temporal misalignment: correlated KPIs with inconsistent lookback/horizon structures cause agent to learn relative temporal patterns incorrectly.

- **First 3 experiments**: (1) Validate Symbolizer output: Feed recorded KPI traces through Symbolizer, verify predicate outputs match manual inspection. Check θ sensitivity on volatile metrics. (2) Cold-start characterization: Run SIA on pretrained agent from empty KG. Measure IS stability over time. Identify convergence point where IS values stabilize. Test pre-population from historical traces. (3) IS vs SHAP/LIME comparison on temporal disentanglement: Generate explanations for same decisions using all three methods. Verify SIA produces bimodal IS distribution while SHAP/LIME produce single blended peak. Confirm 0.65ms vs 141-159ms latency gap.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the magnitude of forecast error relative to symbolic bucket width quantitatively impact the fidelity of SIA's Influence Scores and Action Refinement decisions? The authors state performance depends on errors not shifting KPIs across percentile boundaries, but do not characterize the degradation curve near this threshold. An ablation study varying forecast noise variance to measure the drop in Action Refinement reward improvement would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What specific volume and diversity of historical network traces are necessary to robustly pre-populate the Knowledge Graphs for a new network environment? The paper identifies the "cold-start phase" as a key limitation and suggests pre-populating Knowledge Graphs without defining the required data footprint. Experiments measuring explanation stability and coverage after initializing KGs with varying amounts of synthetic or historical data would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
Does the per-KPI graph factorization fail to capture critical causal interactions in environments with strong inter-KPI correlations? SIA relies on the assumption of "KPI independence" to bound complexity, which may abstract away coupled dynamics in complex scenarios like interference-heavy MIMO. Comparative analysis against monolithic XAI methods on synthetic environments with known forced KPI correlations would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Cold-start phase with sparse Knowledge Graphs produces unreliable initial explanations
- Performance degrades when forecast errors shift KPIs across symbolic category boundaries
- Per-KPI factorization may miss critical joint-state interactions in highly correlated KPI environments

## Confidence

- **High**: Sub-millisecond explanation latency (0.65 ms), temporal misalignment discovery, 9% bitrate improvement in fixed ABR agent
- **Medium**: Per-KPI factorization effectiveness, Action Refiner reward improvement, category boundary stability
- **Low**: Reward function bias discovery, generalizabilty to non-network domains, cold-start reliability

## Next Checks

1. **Cold-start characterization**: Run SIA on pretrained agents from empty KGs. Measure IS stability over time, identify convergence points, and test pre-population from historical traces to reduce initial unreliability.

2. **Temporal alignment validation**: Systematically vary temporal structures (past observations vs forecast horizons) across KPIs in controlled experiments. Verify that SIA consistently identifies and quantifies temporal misalignment effects on agent performance.

3. **Cross-domain generalization**: Apply SIA to a non-network DRL agent (e.g., Atari game playing) with forecast augmentation. Test whether per-KPI factorization and influence scoring remain effective when KPI independence assumptions break down.
