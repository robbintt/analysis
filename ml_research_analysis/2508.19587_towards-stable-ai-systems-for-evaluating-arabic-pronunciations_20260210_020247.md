# Towards stable AI systems for Evaluating Arabic Pronunciations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19587
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19587
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: wav2vec 2.0 embeddings with adversarial training achieve 65% accuracy on isolated Arabic letter classification, with only 3% drop under noise

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of recognizing isolated Arabic letter pronunciations, a critical task for language learning, speech therapy, and Quranic recitation that current ASR systems struggle with due to lack of co-articulatory context and subtle phonetic distinctions. The authors build and release a new corpus of diacritized isolated Arabic letter recordings from diverse speakers, and evaluate wav2vec 2.0 on it, finding only 35% accuracy. They then train a lightweight neural network on wav2vec embeddings, achieving 65% accuracy, and further improve robustness via adversarial training (PGD), reducing performance drop under noise from 9% to 3% while maintaining clean-speech accuracy. The study demonstrates that targeted data collection and adversarial training are key to reliable letter-level recognition in Arabic.

## Method Summary
The method extracts 1024-dimensional wav2vec 2.0 embeddings from 16kHz isolated Arabic letter recordings, applies temporal mean-pooling to create utterance vectors, and trains a lightweight MLP classifier. The dataset includes 112 classes (28 letters × 4 diacritics) with expert-verified recordings from diverse speakers. Adversarial training using Projected Gradient Descent improves robustness to input perturbations while preserving clean accuracy. Data augmentation expands the training set from 10K to 30K samples through Gaussian noise, pitch shift, time-stretch, and circular shift.

## Key Results
- wav2vec 2.0 baseline accuracy: 35-37% on isolated Arabic letters
- MLP on wav2vec embeddings: 66% test accuracy
- Adversarial training reduces noise performance drop from 9% to 3%
- Dataset: 10K expert-verified recordings expanded to 30K via augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 embeddings with temporal mean pooling can classify isolated Arabic letters better than end-to-end wav2vec transcription.
- Mechanism: The 1024-dimensional contextualized embeddings from wav2vec2-large-XLSR-53-Arabic capture multilingual phonetic knowledge. Temporal mean-pooling aggregates frame-level features (20ms each) into a fixed utterance vector, discarding timing variability while preserving phonetic content. A lightweight MLP then learns letter-specific decision boundaries on these embeddings.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained embeddings contain sufficient phonetic information to distinguish similar Arabic phonemes (e.g., emphatic vs non-emphatic consonants) despite being trained primarily on continuous speech.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Training a lightweight neural network on wav2vec embeddings raises performance to 65%."
  - "Temporal mean-pooling is a simple yet effective aggregation strategy... preserving phonetic content while discarding timing variability and noise."
  - "State-of-the-art model showed 37% accuracy on the test data" vs "67.84% for the MLP classifier."
- Break condition: If embeddings from continuous-speech pre-training lack discriminative power for isolated phonemes (no co-articulatory context), accuracy ceiling will remain low regardless of classifier complexity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adversarial training with Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) improves robustness to input perturbations while preserving clean-speech accuracy.
- Mechanism: PGD iteratively generates worst-case perturbations within an ε-ball (ε = 0.05) by maximizing loss, then projects back to the constraint. Training on these adversarial examples forces the model to learn representations invariant to small distortions that model noise, microphone variation, and prosodic shifts. The min-max objective: min_θ E[max_{||δ||≤ε} L(f_θ(x+δ), y)].
- Core assumption: Robustness to PGD perturbations generalizes to real-world distortions (noise, time-stretch, pitch-shift, channel effects).
- Evidence anchors:
  - "adding a small amplitude perturbation (epsilon = 0.05) cuts accuracy to 32%. To restore robustness, we apply adversarial training, limiting the noisy-speech drop to 9% while preserving clean-speech accuracy."
  - At ε=0.05: non-robust model drops to 33% vs robust model at 59%; at ε=0.15: non-robust at 1.1% vs robust at 34.7%.
- Break condition: If real-world perturbations fall outside the ε-ball distribution or involve semantic changes (not just acoustic), PGD robustness may not transfer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Expert-verified, diacritized letter recordings with balanced speaker diversity improve model reliability on this underserved task.
- Mechanism: The "Horouf" dataset (≈10K samples, 112 classes = 28 letters × 4 diacritics) includes native and non-native speakers across regions, genders, and ages. Expert annotation rejects 11% of recordings. Data augmentation (Gaussian noise, pitch shift, time-stretch, circular shift) expands training to 30K samples.
- Core assumption: Expert verification ensures phonetic accuracy, and speaker diversity captures real-world pronunciation variability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "data is carefully annotated by linguistic experts... On average, 11% of the data was rejected."
  - "The 80% (around 8K samples) were augmented... final number of samples after augmentation reaches 30K samples."
- Break condition: If expert annotators disagree on "correct" pronunciation (especially for non-native speakers), label noise will limit performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **wav2vec 2.0 self-supervised speech representations**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how pre-trained audio encoders work is essential before using their embeddings for downstream classification.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why wav2vec 2.0 embeddings might struggle with isolated phonemes compared to continuous speech?

- Concept: **Adversarial robustness and the ε-ball constraint**
  - Why needed here: PGD training requires understanding perturbation bounds and the tradeoff between robustness and clean accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What happens to model accuracy if you set ε too large during adversarial training?

- Concept: **Temporal pooling strategies for variable-length audio**
  - Why needed here: Converting frame-level embeddings to utterance-level vectors determines what information is preserved or lost.
  - Quick check question: Why might mean-pooling be insufficient for distinguishing phonetically similar letters with different duration patterns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio (16kHz, 200-500ms) -> wav2vec2-large-XLSR-53-Arabic -> 1024-dim frame embeddings -> Temporal mean-pooling -> 1024-dim utterance vector -> MLP (1024→256→128→112) -> 112-class output

- Critical path: Audio quality → wav2vec embedding extraction → pooling quality → MLP capacity → adversarial training intensity (ε, PGD steps)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Larger MLP vs overfitting risk on small dataset (10K→30K after augmentation)
  - Higher ε improves robustness but reduces clean accuracy (adversarially trained model: 58.96% test vs 66% vanilla)
  - More PGD iterations increase training time and robustness but with diminishing returns

- Failure signatures:
  - Clean accuracy drops significantly after adversarial training → ε too large or PGD steps too aggressive
  - High class-wise accuracy variance → underrepresented phonemes need more samples
  - Confusion between emphatic/non-emphatic pairs (ḥā' vs hā', qāf vs kāf) → embeddings lack phonetic discrimination

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline reproduction**: Load wav2vec2-large-XLSR-53-Arabic, extract embeddings with mean-pooling, train vanilla MLP on Horouf train split. Target: ~65-67% test accuracy.
  2. **Robustness probe**: Apply PGD perturbations (ε=0.05, 0.10, 0.15) to test set without adversarial training. Confirm accuracy drop pattern matches Figure 5 (non-robust curve).
  3. **Adversarial training ablation**: Retrain MLP with PGD adversarial training (ε=0.05, 5-10 PGD steps). Measure clean test accuracy and robust accuracy under perturbation. Target: <10% drop at ε=0.05.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Can the proposed letter-level classification pipeline be effectively integrated with grapheme-level segmenters to evaluate pronunciation in continuous Arabic speech?
- Basis in paper: Section 5 states that future work will focus on "refining this integration across continuous speech, thereby bringing robust letter-level scoring into word- and sentence-level evaluation frameworks."
- Why unresolved: While the paper establishes a robust classifier for isolated letters, it identifies a gap in current end-to-end models which cannot provide the fine-grained phoneme feedback needed for word-level correction.
- Evidence: A successful implementation of a segmenter-coupled system that can accurately score continuous utterances (e.g., distinguishing "abi" from "api") while providing per-letter confidence scores.

## Limitations

- Small base dataset size (10K samples → 30K augmented) constrains generalization despite adversarial training
- wav2vec2-large-XLSR-53-Arabic pre-trained on continuous speech creates uncertainty about embedding quality for isolated phonemes
- PGD adversarial training assumes real-world perturbations follow synthetic distribution, which may not hold
- Expert annotation introduces potential bias, particularly for non-native speaker pronunciations

## Confidence

- High confidence: The wav2vec embedding extraction and MLP architecture design; the PGD training methodology and observed robustness improvements
- Medium confidence: The transferability of adversarial robustness from synthetic to real-world perturbations; the sufficiency of expert-verified labels for capturing pronunciation variation
- Low confidence: The claim that 30K augmented samples provide adequate coverage for 112 phonetic classes; the assumption that wav2vec2 embeddings contain optimal phonetic information for isolated letters

## Next Checks

1. **Corpus expansion validation**: Measure per-class accuracy variance and identify underrepresented phonemes; test whether additional recordings for low-performing classes (emphatic consonants, vowel-consonant distinctions) improve overall accuracy more than general data augmentation.

2. **Adversarial perturbation transfer**: Compare PGD-robustness against real-world noise types (background speech, channel distortion, reverberation) to quantify the gap between synthetic and practical robustness.

3. **Phonetic embedding analysis**: Visualize wav2vec embeddings using t-SNE or UMAP to assess whether similar Arabic phonemes (e.g., emphatic vs non-emphatic pairs) form separable clusters, indicating whether embedding quality or classifier capacity limits performance.
