# Beyond One-Size-Fits-All Summarization: Customizing Summaries for Diverse Users

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.10675
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10675
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-task VBART model achieves stable readability control across YOD levels while maintaining semantic quality

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of controlling readability in Turkish text summarization, an under-explored area critical for effective communication across diverse literacy levels. The authors developed a custom dataset with controlled YOD (Yeni Okunabilirlik Düzeyi) readability scores and trained a multi-task architecture based on VBART. The model simultaneously generates summaries and predicts readability using both regression and classification heads. Evaluation against a supervised fine-tuned baseline showed comparable semantic accuracy (ROUGE-1 scores 0.345-0.666) but superior stability in maintaining target readability levels, particularly in mid-range YOD scores (9-12), with performance gaps of 7-15 percentage points. The custom model achieved 87% success rate at the highest YOD level (16), demonstrating effective readability control while maintaining content quality.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a custom dataset with controlled YOD readability scores and trained a multi-task VBART architecture. The model uses both regression and classification heads to simultaneously generate summaries and predict readability levels. This approach allows for explicit control over the readability of generated summaries while maintaining semantic quality. The model was evaluated against a supervised fine-tuned baseline using ROUGE metrics and YOD score distributions across different readability levels.

## Key Results
- Multi-task VBART model achieved comparable ROUGE-1 scores (0.345-0.666) to baseline while providing superior readability control
- Superior stability in maintaining target readability levels, especially in mid-range YOD scores (9-12), with 7-15 percentage point performance gaps
- Achieved 87% success rate at highest YOD level (16), demonstrating effective readability control across the spectrum

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-task architecture leverages both regression and classification heads to jointly optimize for summary generation and readability control. By training on a custom dataset with controlled YOD scores, the model learns to balance content preservation with readability constraints. The VBART foundation provides strong pre-trained representations for Turkish, while the dual objective encourages the model to internalize readability patterns during generation. This approach enables stable control over summary complexity without sacrificing semantic quality.

## Foundational Learning
- Turkish morphological complexity: Understanding agglutinative structure is crucial for effective readability assessment and generation
- YOD readability framework: Custom metric designed for Turkish; knowing its calculation methodology is essential for dataset creation and evaluation
- Multi-task learning principles: Joint optimization requires understanding of loss balancing and gradient interaction
- VBART architecture: Pre-trained transformer specifically for Turkish; understanding its strengths and limitations is key
- ROUGE evaluation: Automated metric for semantic quality; knowing its limitations helps interpret results

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input text -> VBART encoder -> Shared representation -> Classification head + Regression head + Summary decoder

**Critical path:** Input text flows through VBART encoder, shared representation layer, and then splits to three heads simultaneously: classification for readability level, regression for readability score, and decoder for summary generation.

**Design tradeoffs:** The multi-task approach adds computational overhead but enables explicit readability control. Using both classification and regression heads provides complementary signals but requires careful loss weighting. The VBART foundation ensures strong language understanding but limits flexibility for other languages.

**Failure signatures:** Instability in readability control manifests as wide YOD score distributions around target levels. Poor semantic quality appears as low ROUGE scores. Over-regularization can lead to bland, overly simplified summaries that lose important content.

**First 3 experiments:** 1) Test single-task vs multi-task performance on readability control stability. 2) Vary loss weights between classification, regression, and generation objectives. 3) Compare YOD vs alternative readability metrics for evaluation consistency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to Turkish language due to VBART foundation and YOD-specific framework
- Heavy reliance on automated metrics may not fully capture human perceptions of readability
- No human evaluation reported for the custom model's outputs
- Unclear generalizability to languages with different morphological structures

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Technical implementation and dataset creation | High |
| Readability control effectiveness on YOD scores | Medium |
| Cross-linguistic applicability of approach | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies with diverse literacy-level readers to validate automated YOD score correlations with perceived readability and summary usefulness.
2. Test the multi-task architecture on a non-Turkish language with established readability metrics to assess cross-linguistic generalization.
3. Perform ablation studies to determine the relative contributions of regression versus classification heads in achieving stable readability control across the YOD spectrum.
