# Provable Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Bayesian Inversion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08022
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08022
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces diffusion-based posterior sampling method that avoids heuristic approximations and achieves strong performance on imaging inverse problems

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a theoretically grounded diffusion-based posterior sampling method for Bayesian inverse problems. The key innovation is avoiding heuristic approximations in posterior score estimation by using Langevin dynamics particles to approximate the posterior score through a Monte Carlo estimator. The method achieves strong performance across challenging imaging tasks including Gaussian denoising, Gaussian deblurring, and nonlinear deblurring on the FFHQ dataset, outperforming baselines in both PSNR and SSIM metrics while providing non-asymptotic error bounds in 2-Wasserstein distance.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a probability transport from an easy-to-sample terminal distribution to the target posterior using Langevin dynamics with data-driven prior scores. It implements a Monte Carlo estimator where particles are generated using Langevin dynamics to approximate the posterior score, avoiding heuristic approximations that introduce bias. A warm-start strategy efficiently samples from the terminal distribution, which serves as initialization for the time-reversal process. The algorithm uses pre-trained EDM prior score networks without retraining, and includes smoothed denoiser wrapper for score approximation.

## Key Results
- Achieves PSNR improvements over TV regularization and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) baselines across all tested tasks
- Provides non-asymptotic error bounds in 2-Wasserstein distance, showing convergence even for multi-modal target posteriors
- Demonstrates uncertainty quantification through pixel-wise MAE and standard deviation computed over 24 repeated samples
- Successfully handles nonlinear deblurring on FFHQ dataset with motion kernel

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Score Estimation via Restricted Gaussian Oracle (RGO)
The method avoids heuristic approximations of the posterior score by explicitly simulating the conditional expectation of the posterior denoising density using Langevin dynamics. For a given noisy state $X_t=x$, it defines a "posterior denoising density" $p_t(x_0|x,y)$ and runs Langevin dynamics to sample particles from this density, averaging them to approximate the score via Tweedie's formula. This works under the assumption that the posterior denoising density is log-concave for sufficiently small time $t < \bar{t}$.

### Mechanism 2: Warm-Start via Log-Sobolev Inequality (LSI)
The method enables valid posterior sampling at small terminal time $T$ by explicitly sampling the initialization distribution $q_T(x|y)$ rather than assuming it is Standard Gaussian. Because the score estimator requires small $T$ to maintain log-concavity, the terminal distribution $q_T$ is not purely Gaussian. The method treats $q_T$ as a target distribution satisfying LSI if $T$ is large enough, using outer Langevin loop to draw samples for initialization.

## Foundational Learning

**Bayesian Inverse Problems** - Framework for inferring unknown parameters from noisy observations. Why needed: This is the fundamental problem being solved. Quick check: Verify understanding of posterior distribution formulation.

**Diffusion Models** - Stochastic processes that gradually add noise to data and learn to reverse it. Why needed: Provides the probabilistic framework for posterior sampling. Quick check: Confirm understanding of forward/backward diffusion processes.

**Langevin Dynamics** - Stochastic optimization algorithm for sampling from distributions. Why needed: Core computational engine for both score estimation and warm-start sampling. Quick check: Verify understanding of step size and iteration requirements.

**Restricted Gaussian Oracle (RGO)** - Monte Carlo estimator using particles to approximate posterior score. Why needed: Enables provable score estimation without heuristics. Quick check: Confirm understanding of particle averaging mechanism.

**Log-Sobolev Inequality (LSI)** - Functional inequality ensuring rapid convergence of Langevin dynamics. Why needed: Guarantees warm-start initialization works for non-Gaussian terminal distributions. Quick check: Verify understanding of LSI condition requirements.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Pre-trained EDM Prior -> Smoothed Score Wrapper -> RGO Monte Carlo Estimator -> Langevin Dynamics (Inner) -> Warm-Start Sampler (Outer) -> Reverse Diffusion -> Posterior Samples

**Critical Path:** Warm-start initialization → Reverse diffusion process → Final denoising → Posterior samples generation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational efficiency (multiple particle chains, warm-start loops) for provable guarantees and avoidance of heuristic approximations. This increases computational cost but provides theoretical convergence guarantees.

**Failure Signatures:** Numerical instability in Langevin dynamics (NaN values), OOM errors from particle memory requirements, poor reconstruction quality from incorrect hyperparameter selection (especially T and SNR parameters).

**First Experiments:**
1. Run Gaussian denoising with T=0.2 to verify basic pipeline functionality
2. Test warm-start initialization with varying outer loop iterations (N_out)
3. Compare RGO score estimation with heuristic approximation baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can the framework be extended to infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems where forward models involve computationally expensive PDEs? The paper identifies this as a key direction, suggesting operator learning surrogates may be necessary.

**Open Question 2:** How can the method be adapted for derivative-free Bayesian inference where log-likelihood gradients are unavailable? The current dependence on log-likelihood gradients ∇ℓ_y is noted as a limitation.

**Open Question 3:** Can convergence guarantees be established for multi-modal posteriors that do not satisfy the semi-log-concavity assumption? The conclusion calls for analyzing "other types of multi-modal target posterior distributions."

## Limitations

**Theoretical Assumptions May Not Hold in Practice:** The method relies on strong log-concavity assumptions that may not hold for complex, multi-modal posteriors common in real-world problems.

**Computational Cost:** The Monte Carlo estimator requires running multiple inner Langevin dynamics chains (M=20 particles), significantly increasing computational overhead compared to heuristic approaches.

**Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:** Performance depends critically on careful selection of terminal time T, SNR parameters, and particle counts, with complex interplay across different problem types.

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:** Core algorithmic framework of using Langevin dynamics to avoid heuristic score approximations; warm-start strategy for non-Gaussian initialization; performance improvements on benchmark tasks.

**Medium Confidence Claims:** Theoretical convergence bounds under stated assumptions; plug-and-play nature working well for specified tasks.

**Low Confidence Claims:** Performance on truly out-of-distribution data; practical utility of uncertainty quantification with 24 samples.

## Next Checks

1. **Assumption Validation:** Systematically test log-concavity of posterior denoising density across different problem types and noise levels to identify breaking points.

2. **Computational Scaling Analysis:** Benchmark wall-clock time and memory usage scaling with image resolution and particle count M to quantify practical limitations.

3. **Hyperparameter Robustness:** Conduct ablation studies varying T, SNR parameters, and particle counts across all four task types to map sensitivity landscape.
