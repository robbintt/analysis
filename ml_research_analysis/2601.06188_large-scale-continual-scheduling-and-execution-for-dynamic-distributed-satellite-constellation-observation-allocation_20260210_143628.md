# Large-Scale Continual Scheduling and Execution for Dynamic Distributed Satellite Constellation Observation Allocation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.06188
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06188
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: D-NSS achieves 80-90% satisfaction with 10x less computation and message volume than DDCOP baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of scheduling Earth-observation satellites in large, distributed constellations where real-time response is critical. Traditional centralized scheduling approaches suffer from latency and single-point failures, making them unsuitable for time-sensitive campaigns. The authors formulate this as a Dynamic Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DDCOP), called DCOSP, with a novel optimality condition that rewards task execution rather than just scheduling. They introduce Dynamic Incremental Neighborhood Stochastic Search (D-NSS), an incomplete online decomposition-based algorithm that efficiently handles problem dynamics by repairing and refining sub-problem solutions. Evaluation on realistic constellations (Planet and Walker) with thousands of requests shows that D-NSS achieves near-optimal satisfaction while using an order of magnitude less computation time and message volume compared to DDCOP baselines.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce D-NSS, a distributed algorithm for continual satellite scheduling that decomposes the global problem using Geometric Neighborhood Decomposition (GND) based on orbital geometry. The algorithm operates in two phases: first, it computes sub-problems by partitioning agents and requests into neighborhoods; second, it repairs existing schedules when dynamics occur and refines solutions through stochastic local search. The novelty lies in the execution-aware utility function that rewards actual task completion rather than just scheduling, and the incremental repair mechanism that maintains solution stability during rapid problem changes. The approach is designed for online operation where scheduling and execution horizons overlap, making it suitable for NASA's FAME mission.

## Key Results
- D-NSS achieves 80-90% task satisfaction on large constellations with thousands of requests
- Computation time is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to baseline DDCOP solvers
- Message volume is significantly lower due to efficient neighborhood decomposition
- The algorithm maintains solution quality during problem dynamics through effective repair mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Geometric Neighborhood Decomposition
- Decomposing the global scheduling problem into orbital-geometry-based neighborhoods reduces computational and communication complexity from O(|A|·|R|) to O(|A_N|·|R_N|) while preserving solution quality.
- The Geometric Neighborhood Decomposition (GND) heuristic hierarchically partitions requests to agent neighborhoods by computing "supply" (estimated overflight count per orbital plane) and assigning requests to neighborhoods with the highest supply-to-temporal-conflict ratio.
- Core assumption: Satellite constellation geometry creates natural locality—satellites in similar orbital planes tend to observe overlapping ground target regions.
- Break condition: If request distribution becomes uniformly random across the globe with no orbital correlation, GND's geometric assumptions fail and neighborhood quality degrades.

### Mechanism 2: Incremental Schedule Repair
- Incremental repair of existing schedules when dynamics occur maintains solution stability and reduces recomputation overhead compared to solving from scratch.
- The repair function removes tasks whose requests were deleted, then greedily inserts new valid tasks in random order. D-NSS-Search then refines via stochastic updates with neighbor communication.
- Core assumption: Problem dynamics are localized—most scheduled tasks remain valid between consecutive time steps, so preserving them is efficient.
- Break condition: If volatility parameter v is very high (e.g., >50% of requests change per time step), repair provides little benefit over full recomputation.

### Mechanism 3: Execution-Aware Utility Function
- Rewarding task execution rather than just scheduling produces a more realistic utility measure for online scheduling where the scheduling horizon overlaps execution.
- The executed(x) proposition returns true only if a task was scheduled AND its execution horizon occurred during a static problem interval. The utility function F(X_δ) sums requests with at least one executed task.
- Core assumption: In dynamic environments, a scheduled task may be unscheduled before execution due to subsequent problem changes.
- Break condition: If problem dynamics only occur after all scheduled tasks execute (no overlap), execution-based utility equals scheduling-based utility and provides no advantage.

## Foundational Learning

- **Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP/DDCOP)**: Understanding constraint graphs, agent communication, and local vs global optimization is essential to follow the algorithm design. Quick check: Can you explain why a constraint graph degree of Ω(|A|·|R|) makes standard DCOP solvers that communicate with all neighbors impractical for satellite constellations?

- **Satellite Orbital Geometry**: GND decomposition relies on understanding orbital planes, overflights, visibility windows, and sun-synchronous orbits. Quick check: How does orbital inclination affect which ground targets a satellite can observe, and why does the Planet constellation use 95° and 52° inclination planes?

- **Stochastic Local Search with Probability Pu**: D-NSS uses stochastic updates with probability Pu=0.7 to decide when agents unassign from tasks, balancing exploration vs exploitation. Quick check: Why might probabilistic assignment updates help avoid local optima compared to deterministic greedy approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: computeSubProblem(a, A, R, Sa, Υ) -> repair(sched, R, Sa, Ca) -> D-NSS-Search(sched, RN, AN, Sa, Ca, maxIterations)
- **Critical path**: 1) Problem dynamics detected → computeSubProblem generates new neighborhood for each agent; 2) repair() modifies existing schedule to handle removed/added requests; 3) D-NSS-Search iterates: message exchange → stochastic update → schedule/unschedule tasks; 4) Converged schedule returned for execution horizon
- **Design tradeoffs**: GND(2) creates 2x overlapping neighborhoods for redundancy but increases computation per agent; random repair promotes solution diversity but may miss optimal insertions; maxIterations=20 limits computation time but may sacrifice convergence quality; Pu=0.7 balances exploration vs exploitation
- **Failure signatures**: Sharp satisfaction drops after dynamics → repair not preserving useful tasks; High message volumes → neighborhood sizes too large; Slow convergence → Pu may need tuning; Optimal gap >10% → maxIterations insufficient or GND partitioning poor quality
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce small-scale validation: 500 requests on Planet constellation, compare D-NSS vs branch-and-bound optimal solver; 2) Ablate repair vs recompute: Run D-NSS vs 0-NSS (no repair) on identical dynamic scenarios; 3) Scale test on Walker constellation: Run with 4000-8000 requests, measure satisfaction %, message volume (log scale), and per-agent runtime

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Can D-NSS be extended to a Proactive DCOP (PDDCOP) framework to effectively generate robust solutions when prior models of problem dynamics are available?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states that future work includes extending D-NSS to "reason about future dynamics" and utilizing PDDCOPs to generate robust offline solutions.
- Why unresolved: PDDCOPs require a model of problem dynamics which "may not be obtainable in practice," and the current D-NSS implementation focuses strictly on reactive repair.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified D-NSS algorithm that integrates probabilistic models of future requests and demonstrates improved utility over the reactive baseline in volatile environments.

### Open Question 2
- Can learned or adaptive decomposition heuristics effectively replace the Geometric Neighborhood Decomposition (GND) to better prioritize tasks with high execution probability?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion suggests that while GND is currently used, the framework can accommodate "learned or adaptive" heuristics to prioritize tasks more likely to yield utility.
- Why unresolved: The current GND heuristic relies on fixed orbital geometry; learning heuristics that predict execution utility in a dynamic environment remains an unaddressed challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the convergence speed and solution quality of D-NSS using a learned heuristic versus the static GND heuristic.

### Open Question 3
- Does the D-NSS algorithm maintain its efficiency and solution quality when applied to non-satellite domains such as multi-agent path finding or UAV coordination?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion claims the approach generalizes to many DDCOP problems, specifically listing "multi-agent path finding" and "UAV coordination" as examples.
- Why unresolved: The GND heuristic is specialized for satellite geometry; the paper does not demonstrate how neighborhood decomposition would function for agents operating in continuous spatial domains or different constraint topologies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation results applying D-NSS (with domain-adapted decomposition) to standard multi-agent path finding benchmarks.

## Limitations

- The geometric neighborhood decomposition assumes satellite constellation geometry creates natural locality, which may not hold for uniformly distributed global requests
- The repair strategy's effectiveness depends on problem volatility staying below ~50% request changes per time step
- The execution-aware utility function introduces a novel optimality condition with no direct corpus evidence supporting its superiority

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Algorithm implementation correctness, scalability measurements, and communication complexity reductions are well-supported by systematic experiments
- **Medium confidence**: The 80-90% satisfaction rates and 10x efficiency improvements are demonstrated but rely on specific constellation geometries and request distributions
- **Low confidence**: Claims about execution-aware utility providing "more realistic" measures lack empirical validation against traditional scheduling-based approaches

## Next Checks

1. Test D-NSS on uniformly distributed global requests to validate GND decomposition assumptions break under non-geometric request patterns
2. Evaluate repair effectiveness at 75-90% problem volatility to determine the maximum dynamics threshold before performance degrades
3. Compare satisfaction rates using execution-based vs scheduling-based utility functions on identical problem instances to quantify the practical benefit of the novel optimality condition
