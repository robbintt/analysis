# MedNuggetizer: Confidence-Based Information Nugget Extraction from Medical Documents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15384
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15384
- Reference count: 35
- Experts rated cluster coherence and nugget relevance at 4.0-4.8 out of 5

## Executive Summary
MedNuggetizer addresses LLM output instability in clinical evidence synthesis by performing repeated extraction runs and clustering information nuggets based on confidence scores. The system extracts query-relevant information nuggets from medical documents using LLM-powered extraction, then groups them through repeated runs (n=5) with a confidence threshold (conf=0.8), followed by BERTopic clustering. Domain experts evaluated the system on antibiotic prophylaxis before prostate biopsy using four guidelines and ten recent studies, producing 155 clusters and 406 nuggets with high relevance ratings.

## Method Summary
The system performs repeated LLM extractions of query-relevant information nuggets from medical PDFs, clustering results across runs to filter out unreliable outputs. Using Gemini 2.5 Flash, it extracts nuggets from up to 1000-page documents, performs n=5 extraction runs per file, and applies a confidence threshold of conf=0.8 to identify reliable nuggets. Two-stage BERTopic clustering first deduplicates nuggets within documents, then aggregates semantically similar evidence across documents. A Flask web interface allows clinicians to upload PDFs, specify queries, and adjust extraction parameters without technical expertise.

## Key Results
- Expert ratings averaged 4.0-4.8 out of 5 for both cluster coherence and nugget relevance
- System processed 4 urological guidelines and 10 PubMed articles, producing 155 clusters and 406 nuggets
- urologists reported efficient retrieval of highly relevant information while effectively distinguishing multiple layers of evidence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Repeated sampling with confidence thresholding mitigates LLM output instability for clinical evidence extraction.
- Mechanism: The system performs n extraction runs per document using the same LLM and prompt. Only information nuggets appearing in at least conf proportion of runs (e.g., 4 of 5 runs with conf=0.8) are retained as reliable. This filters out stochastic variations while preserving consistently extracted content.
- Core assumption: Nugget recurrence across independent runs correlates with extraction reliability and factual grounding in the source document.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "performs repeated extractions of information nuggets that are then grouped to generate reliable evidence"
  - [section 2] "n, which defines the number of repeated extraction runs per file, and conf, which defines the proportion of the n runs a nugget must appear in to be considered reliable"
  - [corpus] GINGER framework (cited as foundation) uses similar nugget-based grounding; weak direct corpus evidence on confidence-thresholding specifically.
- Break condition: If source documents contain ambiguous or contradictory statements on the same topic, recurrence may not indicate correctness—only extraction consistency.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-stage BERTopic clustering enables both intra-document deduplication and cross-document evidence aggregation.
- Mechanism: Stage 1 clusters nuggets from repeated runs within a single PDF to generate unified nuggets. Stage 2 clusters unified nuggets across multiple documents to identify semantically similar evidence clusters, indicating stronger supporting evidence. Cluster headings are auto-generated for interpretability.
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity in embedding space correlates with topical equivalence for medical evidence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "To group the extracted nuggets across the n runs, we employ BERTopic-based clustering"
  - [section 2] "The objective is to identify semantically similar groups of nuggets across multiple files, as such clusters indicate stronger supporting evidence"
  - [corpus] GINGER and related nugget-based RAG papers validate clustering for information aggregation, but do not specifically validate the two-stage architecture.
- Break condition: If medical terminology has context-dependent meanings (e.g., "resistance" in antibiotics vs. oncology), semantic clustering may conflate distinct concepts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Query-conditioned extraction focuses LLM attention on clinically relevant content, improving precision over open-ended summarization.
- Mechanism: The user query guides which information nuggets are extracted from the PDF. The LLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash) processes up to 1000 pages and extracts only nuggets relevant to the query, rather than summarizing entire documents.
- Core assumption: Query-driven extraction reduces noise compared to generic summarization; the LLM correctly interprets clinical query intent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "query-driven extraction and clustering of information nuggets from medical documents"
  - [section 2] "Query: The query formulated by the user about the uploaded documents; it guides the information nugget extraction process"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence for query-conditioned extraction specifically; related work focuses on nugget evaluation rather than query conditioning.
- Break condition: If queries are ambiguous or use terminology not matching document language, extraction may miss relevant evidence.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **LLM Non-Determinism**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly addresses output variance from stochastic sampling, temperature settings, and batch variance. Understanding this is essential to grasp why repeated sampling is necessary.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why setting temperature=0 does not guarantee identical outputs across runs?

- Concept: **Information Nuggets**
  - Why needed here: The core extraction unit; defined as minimal, atomic units of relevant information. Understanding this distinguishes the approach from sentence-level or paragraph-level extraction.
  - Quick check question: What makes a nugget "atomic" versus a sentence that contains multiple claims?

- Concept: **BERTopic Clustering**
  - Why needed here: Both clustering stages use BERTopic. Understanding its class-based TF-IDF procedure and embedding-based approach is necessary to interpret cluster quality.
  - Quick check question: How does BERTopic differ from standard k-means clustering on document embeddings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Frontend Flask app -> Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM -> AutoNuggetizer extraction -> BERTopic clustering (intra-document) -> BERTopic clustering (cross-document) -> LLM-generated summaries
- Critical path: 1. User uploads PDFs + query + parameters (n, conf) 2. For each PDF: perform n extraction runs → cluster nuggets → filter by confidence → generate unified nugget per cluster 3. Across all PDFs: cluster unified nuggets → generate cluster headings → display to user
- Design tradeoffs: Higher n increases reliability but multiplies API costs linearly; higher conf threshold improves precision but may filter out valid but inconsistently-extracted nuggets; Gemini 2.5 Flash chosen for cost over potentially more capable but expensive models; BERTopic clustering trades granular control for ease of use
- Failure signatures: Empty or sparse clusters: conf threshold too high for the given n; duplicate/overlapping clusters: BERTopic topic reduction insufficient for domain-specific terminology; undefined abbreviations (noted by domain experts): extraction prompt does not enforce context preservation; method-focused nuggets with limited utility: query not specific enough to clinical recommendations
- First 3 experiments: 1. Vary n and conf systematically: Run (n=3, conf=0.66), (n=5, conf=0.8), (n=10, conf=0.9) on the same document-query pair; measure nugget overlap and cluster stability. 2. Cross-validate with different LLM backends: Swap Gemini 2.5 Flash for another model (e.g., GPT-4) on identical inputs; compare nugget consistency and cluster coherence. 3. Query sensitivity analysis: Run the same documents with broad vs. specific queries (e.g., "antibiotic prophylaxis" vs. "antibiotic prophylaxis before transrectal prostate biopsy"); measure precision/recall against expert-annotated ground truth.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the selection of different backend LLMs or clustering techniques affect the reliability and coherence of the extracted evidence compared to the current Gemini 2.5 Flash and BERTopic configuration?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that "Future work could allow users to select backend methods, such as different clustering techniques or the LLMs driving the extraction process."
- Why unresolved: The study evaluates the tool using a single LLM and clustering method; thus, it is unknown if the high relevance ratings are dependent on Gemini 2.5 Flash's specific pre-training or BERTopic's topic modeling.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative ablation study measuring cluster coherence and nugget relevance across different LLM backends (e.g., GPT-4, Llama) and clustering algorithms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does MedNuggetizer maintain high performance when applied to medical domains with less structured evidence or ambiguous clinical guidelines?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The evaluation relies on a specific use case (antibiotic prophylaxis) using high-quality sources (major guidelines and recent RCTs).
- Why unresolved: The tool's effectiveness may be inflated by the high structure and clarity of the selected urological guidelines; it is uncertain if the approach generalizes to "softer" medical evidence or less standardized documents.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the tool on diverse medical specialties with varying levels of evidence density and document structure to compare expert relevance ratings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the specific extraction errors identified by experts, such as undefined abbreviations and missing contextualization, be mitigated through prompt engineering or post-processing?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The evaluation notes that experts found issues with "undefined abbreviations, missing contextualization... which can hinder clarity and practical applicability."
- Why unresolved: The current pipeline does not appear to have a specific mechanism for resolving abbreviations or ensuring contextual independence of nuggets, relying instead on the base LLM's raw extraction.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified pipeline that includes a context-injection or abbreviation-expansion step, followed by a user study measuring reductions in perceived ambiguity.

## Limitations

- The system relies on a single LLM backend (Gemini 2.5 Flash) without comparative analysis of alternative models
- Evaluation focused on a specific medical domain (urology) using high-quality guidelines and RCTs, limiting generalizability to other specialties
- The exact prompts for nugget extraction and summary generation were not specified, affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using repeated sampling with confidence thresholding to address LLM non-determinism is well-supported by the evaluation results (expert ratings 4.0-4.8/5) and aligns with established practices in the nugget-based RAG literature
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the two-stage BERTopic clustering approach is supported by expert feedback but lacks comparative analysis against alternative clustering methods or single-stage approaches
- **Medium Confidence**: The query-conditioned extraction mechanism's superiority over open-ended summarization is inferred from the focused nature of the extracted nuggets, but direct ablation studies are not provided

## Next Checks

1. **Prompt Variation Study**: Systematically vary the extraction prompts while keeping n and conf constant to quantify the impact of prompt engineering on nugget reliability and cluster coherence
2. **Cross-Domain Evaluation**: Apply MedNuggetizer to a different medical specialty (e.g., oncology or cardiology) with domain experts to assess generalizability beyond urology
3. **Confidence Threshold Calibration**: Conduct a systematic study varying n (3, 5, 10) and conf (0.66, 0.8, 0.9) on the same document-query pairs to identify optimal parameter combinations for balancing recall and precision
