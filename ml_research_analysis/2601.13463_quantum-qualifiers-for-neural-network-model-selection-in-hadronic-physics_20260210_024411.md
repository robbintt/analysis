core_contribution: This work develops a framework for determining when quantum deep
  neural networks (QDNNs) offer advantages over classical deep neural networks (CDNNs)
  in hadronic physics problems. The authors introduce a "quantum qualifier" - a diagnostic
  tool based on complexity and information-theoretic measures (nonlinearity, frequency
  complexity, fractal dimension, mutual information, and Fourier transform complexity)
  - that predicts whether a given data-driven extraction task is better suited for
  CDNNs or QDNNs.

# Quantum Qualifiers for Neural Network Model Selection in Hadronic Physics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.13463
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13463
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: A quantum qualifier framework that predicts when quantum deep neural networks outperform classical ones in hadronic physics applications

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a quantum qualifier framework that determines when quantum deep neural networks (QDNNs) provide advantages over classical deep neural networks (CDNNs) for hadronic physics problems. The framework uses complexity and information-theoretic measures to diagnose data-driven extraction tasks and predict optimal model selection. Tested through controlled classification and regression studies, the approach shows that quantum advantage systematically depends on data complexity, noise levels, and dimensionality. The framework is validated on Compton form factor extraction from Jefferson Lab DVCS data, successfully identifying kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models.

## Method Summary
The quantum qualifier framework combines multiple diagnostic metrics including nonlinearity measures, frequency complexity, fractal dimension, mutual information, and Fourier transform complexity to assess whether a given hadronic physics problem is better suited for CDNNs or QDNNs. The methodology was tested through synthetic classification and regression experiments with controlled complexity and noise parameters, then applied to real DVCS data from Jefferson Lab. The qualifier predicts quantum advantage regions that correlate with observed performance improvements, with sign agreement scores of 0.84-0.90 across different noise conditions.

## Key Results
- QDNN performance depends systematically on data complexity, noise levels, and dimensionality
- Increasing noise levels systematically expand the domain where QDNNs outperform CDNNs
- The quantum qualifier successfully identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models in DVCS data
- Sign agreement scores of 0.84-0.90 across different noise levels demonstrate predictive power

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The quantum qualifier works by leveraging the inherent advantages of quantum neural networks in handling complex, high-dimensional data patterns that classical networks struggle with. QDNNs excel at capturing quantum correlations and non-classical information structures present in hadronic physics data. The framework identifies regimes where these quantum-specific capabilities provide computational advantages over classical approaches, particularly in high-noise environments where quantum-enhanced feature extraction becomes more valuable.

## Foundational Learning
- Quantum advantage metrics: why needed to quantify when QDNNs outperform CDNNs; quick check: verify metric correlates with observed performance
- Information-theoretic complexity measures: why needed to characterize data structure; quick check: ensure measures capture relevant physical features
- Noise-dependent performance scaling: why needed to understand environmental impact; quick check: validate across multiple noise models
- Kinematic domain mapping: why needed to connect theory to experimental observables; quick check: confirm alignment with physical constraints
- Model selection criteria: why needed for practical application; quick check: test on held-out data

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Complexity metrics calculation -> Quantum qualifier evaluation -> Model selection -> Performance prediction
- Critical path: Data complexity assessment → Metric computation → Qualifier decision → Model deployment
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive metric set vs. computational overhead; synthetic validation vs. real-world applicability
- Failure signatures: Poor metric-data alignment, over-reliance on specific noise assumptions, incorrect kinematic mapping
- First experiments: 1) Test qualifier on synthetic datasets with known quantum advantage regions, 2) Validate on alternative hadronic observables, 3) Compare against alternative selection criteria

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Static noise level assumptions don't reflect time-varying experimental uncertainties
- Validation limited to synthetic datasets and DVCS applications
- Binary classification and regression focus limits broader applicability
- No accounting for hardware-specific quantum noise or error correction overhead

## Confidence
- Medium: Quantum qualifier's ability to predict quantum advantage in controlled synthetic experiments
- Medium: Correlation between quantum qualifier metrics and observed quantum advantage in DVCS data
- Low: Extrapolation of quantum qualifier performance to other hadronic physics applications

## Next Checks
1. Test quantum qualifier predictions across multiple experimental facilities with varying systematic uncertainties
2. Validate framework performance on non-DVCS hadronic observables (e.g., parton distribution functions, fragmentation functions)
3. Incorporate realistic quantum hardware noise models to assess practical quantum advantage thresholds
