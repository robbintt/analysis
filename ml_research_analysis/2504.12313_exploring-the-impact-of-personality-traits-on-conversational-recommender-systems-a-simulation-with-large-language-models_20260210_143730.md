# Exploring the Impact of Personality Traits on Conversational Recommender Systems: A Simulation with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.12313
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12313
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: GPT-4o achieves personality consistency F1 ~0.74 in simulated CRS interactions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PerCRS, a novel LLM-based framework for simulating personality-aware conversational recommender systems. The framework uses the Big Five personality model to configure user agents and incorporates six persuasion strategies for system agents. Through extensive experiments across multiple LLMs, the study demonstrates that personality traits significantly influence recommendation success rates and that Emotional Resonance emerges as the most effective persuasion strategy. The work addresses a critical gap in understanding how individual differences affect CRS performance.

## Method Summary
The PerCRS framework simulates CRS interactions using two LLM-based agents: a user agent configured with a 5-dimensional Big Five personality vector, and a system agent equipped with six persuasion strategies. The simulation runs for up to 10 conversational rounds or until user termination. Personality consistency and system performance are evaluated using GPT-4o as an automatic evaluator, measuring metrics including personality simulation consistency (F1), success rate, general success rate, conversational rounds, and persuasiveness. The framework is tested across multiple LLMs (LlaMA-3-8B-instruct, InternLM-2.5-7B, Yi-1.5-9B, Qwen-2.5-7B, GPT-4o, GLM-4-9B) using the DuRecDial 2.0 dataset.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieves highest personality consistency with F1 scores of 0.69-0.74 across different user profiles
- Personality traits significantly impact recommendation success rates (SR ~0.48-0.49)
- Emotional Resonance is the most effective persuasion strategy (14.6% usage), while Credibility and Logical Appeal are least used (2.8% and 1.6%)
- Conscientious users show distinct patterns, with Credibility and Logical Appeal strategies being more effective

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging in-context learning through carefully engineered prompts that condition LLMs to exhibit specific personality traits and persuasion behaviors. The user agent's personality is injected via detailed behavioral instructions in the prompt, while the system agent selects from predefined persuasion strategies based on conversation context. The Big Five model provides a structured framework for representing personality dimensions, and the Elaboration Likelihood Model informs the persuasion strategy design. This combination allows systematic exploration of how personality influences CRS dynamics in a controlled, reproducible environment.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Big Five Personality Traits (OCEAN)**
- Why needed here: This is the foundational model for the entire user simulation
- Quick check question: Which trait would most likely correlate with a user who prefers familiar movies over new releases? (Answer: Low Openness)

**Concept: In-Context Learning & Prompt Engineering**
- Why needed here: The entire PerCRS framework relies on conditioning the LLM to act as a user or system agent through carefully crafted prompts
- Quick check question: How is the user's personality "injected" into the model? Is it via fine-tuning or via the prompt? (Answer: Via the prompt)

**Concept: Persuasion Strategies (from Elaboration Likelihood Model)**
- Why needed here: The system agent's toolkit is defined by these six strategies
- Quick check question: Which strategy relies on "collective behavior influence" by highlighting high ratings? (Answer: Social Proof)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** User Agent (personality vector + profile) -> System Agent (persuasion strategies + target item) -> Evaluation Module (GPT-4o scorer)

**Critical path:**
1. Initialize: Define user profile (ϕu) and system's target item (rt)
2. Generate: User Agent initiates conversation turn; System Agent responds with selected persuasion strategy
3. Iterate: Conversational loop continues until "Goodbye" or max length (Tmax)
4. Evaluate: External LLM processes conversation history to compute success metrics and verify personality consistency

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Simulation vs. Realism: Framework simulates personality via prompt-based instruction, offering control and scalability but trading off nuance of real human behavior
- Control vs. Agency: System agent has fixed target item, ensuring measurable success rate but reducing flexibility compared to real recommenders
- Evaluator Choice: Using GPT-4o as automatic evaluator may introduce model-specific biases despite human evaluation correlation

**Failure signatures:**
- Inconsistent Persona: User Agent drifts from assigned personality, visible as drop in F1 score for longer dialogues
- Persuasion Failure: System Agent repeats same strategy ineffectively or fails to adapt, resulting in long conversations with no success
- Misinterpretation: System Agent recommends item violating user's stated dislikes (low GSR)

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Validate Personality Fidelity: Run User Agent with single dominant trait, generate 50 conversations, classify personality from text, compare against baseline with no personality instructions
2. A/B Test Persuasion Strategies: Configure single User Agent profile, run two conditions for System Agent (no strategy vs. full suite), compare SR and PRS scores
3. Measure Trait-Sensitivity: Pick opposite trait polarities (e.g., AGR+ vs. AGR-), run full CRS simulation, compare SCR required for successful recommendation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: How do alternative personality models (beyond the Big Five) impact CRS performance and interaction dynamics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors state in Limitations: "Future work could explore the impact of different personality models on CRS performance"
- Why unresolved: Current study restricted scope to Big Five theory
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments integrating alternative models (e.g., MBTI, HEXACO) into PerCRS framework

**Open Question 2**
- Question: What mechanisms ensure consistent personality expression in LLM-based agents for extended dialogues?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Limitations note: "Ensuring personality consistency remains an open challenge, as text-based interactions may limit full expression of personality traits"
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation focuses on specific recommendation sessions, not long-term or multi-session interactions
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking personality adherence across multiple conversation sessions

**Open Question 3**
- Question: How well does LLM-based personality simulation align with actual human user decision-making behaviors?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While LLMs generate personality-consistent text, the study relies entirely on synthetic interaction and acknowledges "gap from real-world applications"
- Why unresolved: Validating simulated behaviors against real humans requires empirical human-subject data
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study measuring correlation between PerCRS simulation success rates and live user study with pre-screened personality traits

## Limitations
- Simulation framework operates in controlled environment with fixed target items, limiting real-world applicability
- Big Five model implementation uses simplified ±1 polarity vectors that may not capture complex personality traits
- Persuasion strategy effectiveness based on simulation rather than empirical human validation
- GPT-4o evaluation may introduce model-specific biases in personality consistency assessment

## Confidence
**Major Uncertainty: Real-World Applicability**
Confidence: Low
- Controlled environment with fixed target items
- Success metrics may not translate to real-world effectiveness
- Limited conversational depth compared to real CRSs

**Major Uncertainty: Personality Model Fidelity**
Confidence: Medium
- Big Five model implementation may oversimplify personality traits
- Small human evaluation sample size (10 conversations per trait, 2 evaluators)
- ±1 polarity vectors may not capture trait complexity

**Major Uncertainty: Persuasion Strategy Generalization**
Confidence: Medium
- Strategy effectiveness based on simulation rather than human testing
- Finding that Emotional Resonance is most effective may reflect simulation setup
- Real-world persuasion dynamics may differ from simulated patterns

## Next Checks
1. **External Evaluator Validation**: Run same conversation corpus through different LLM evaluator (e.g., Claude or Gemini) to assess consistency of personality classification scores and identify model-specific biases

2. **Real User Validation**: Conduct small-scale study with actual human participants interacting with system agent, comparing self-reported personality traits against system predictions and measuring actual persuasion effectiveness

3. **Strategy Adaptation Analysis**: Systematically vary persuasion strategy selection mechanism to test whether current approach is optimal or whether dynamic combinations/adaptive strategies based on conversation context would yield better performance
