- This article critically examines how large language models (LLMs) both challenge and extend forensic linguistics, focusing on authorship attribution and text detection.

## Executive Summary
This article examines the dual impact of large language models on forensic linguistics, highlighting both opportunities for enhanced authorship analysis and significant threats to traditional methods. LLMs introduce capabilities for scalable, multilingual text detection and attribution while simultaneously undermining established idiolect-based approaches through style mimicry and synthetic text generation. The review identifies critical challenges including detector bias against non-native writers, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and questions of legal admissibility under Daubert standards.

The article recommends hybrid human-AI workflows and rigorous validation across diverse populations to maintain scientific credibility in forensic applications. Current AI-text detectors show high false-positive rates and are susceptible to manipulation techniques like homoglyph substitution. Legal admissibility of LLM-generated evidence remains uncertain without robust validation frameworks and explainable detection paradigms.

## Method Summary
The article provides a conceptual synthesis of existing literature on LLMs in forensic linguistics without presenting original experimental data. It reviews current challenges and opportunities through analysis of published research on authorship attribution, text detection, bias in AI tools, and legal admissibility considerations. The approach focuses on identifying gaps between traditional forensic methods and emerging AI capabilities while proposing theoretical frameworks for hybrid human-AI workflows.

## Key Results
- LLMs enhance forensic analysis through scalable embedding-based attribution and multilingual detection capabilities
- Traditional idiolect-based methods face challenges from LLM-enabled style mimicry and synthetic text generation
- Current AI-text detectors exhibit high false-positive rates and bias against non-native English writers, with vulnerability to adversarial attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLMs operate through transformer architectures that learn statistical patterns in massive text corpora, enabling them to generate contextually appropriate language that can mimic human writing styles. This same pattern recognition capability allows LLMs to identify subtle linguistic features for authorship attribution through embedding comparisons. The mechanism works because LLMs capture both surface-level patterns and deeper semantic structures that traditional forensic methods may miss, though this same capability creates the threat of undetectable synthetic text generation.

## Foundational Learning
- Authorship attribution fundamentals: Understanding traditional forensic methods based on idiolect analysis is needed to evaluate LLM impacts; quick check: compare traditional feature extraction methods with embedding-based approaches
- Transformer architecture principles: Essential for understanding how LLMs learn and generate text patterns; quick check: trace how attention mechanisms contribute to style mimicry
- Adversarial attack techniques: Critical for evaluating detector vulnerabilities; quick check: test homoglyph substitution effectiveness on different detector models
- Bias in machine learning systems: Necessary for understanding detector performance disparities; quick check: analyze false-positive rates across different language proficiency levels
- Legal admissibility standards: Important for evaluating forensic evidence credibility; quick check: review Daubert criteria application to AI-based forensic tools
- Explainable AI concepts: Needed for developing interpretable detection methods; quick check: assess current transparency levels in text classifier decision processes

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Traditional forensic analysis -> LLM embedding extraction -> Attribution comparison -> Detection classification -> Legal admissibility review

Critical path: Text input → Embedding generation → Feature comparison → Attribution determination → Validation across populations → Legal compliance check

Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. explainability, speed vs. thoroughness, model complexity vs. interpretability, detection sensitivity vs. false-positive rates, generalizability vs. population-specific calibration

Failure signatures: High false-positive rates on non-native writing, vulnerability to style transfer attacks, lack of transparency in decision-making, inconsistent performance across languages, inability to distinguish human-edited AI text

First experiments:
1. Benchmark traditional forensic attribution accuracy against embedding-based LLM approaches using controlled authorship datasets
2. Measure detector false-positive rates specifically on non-native English samples across multiple proficiency levels
3. Test homoglyph substitution effectiveness against leading AI-text detection models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the input.

## Limitations
- Review is primarily conceptual rather than empirical, lacking original experimental validation
- Claims about LLM-driven attribution improvements lack quantitative comparisons with traditional methods
- Discussion of Daubert admissibility implications remains speculative without analysis of actual court cases

## Confidence
- LLM impact on forensic linguistics: Medium
- Claims about detector bias against non-native writers: Medium
- Vulnerability to homoglyph attacks: Medium
- Legal admissibility implications: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies comparing traditional forensic authorship attribution methods with embedding-based approaches across controlled datasets of known authorship
2. Systematically test current AI-text detectors for false-positive rates specifically on non-native English writing samples across multiple proficiency levels
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed hybrid human-AI workflows through blind studies where forensic linguists assess LLM-generated versus human-written texts with and without AI assistance
