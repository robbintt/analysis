# PSG-Agent: Personality-Aware Safety Guardrail for LLM-based Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23614
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23614
- Authors: Yaozu Wu, Jizhou Guo, Dongyuan Li, Henry Peng Zou, Wei-Chieh Huang, Yankai Chen, Zhen Wang, Weizhi Zhang, Yangning Li, Meng Zhang, Renhe Jiang, Philip S. Yu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 79.7% accuracy and 0.744 F1-score on personalized safety guardrail benchmark

## Executive Summary
PSG-Agent introduces a novel two-stage framework for personalized safety guardrails in LLM-based agents. The system extracts user profiles from interaction history to generate personalized safety criteria, then employs specialized guards throughout the agent pipeline to track cross-turn risk accumulation. Evaluated across healthcare, finance, and daily life scenarios, PSG-Agent significantly outperforms existing guardrails while maintaining training-free, plug-and-play compatibility. The approach ensures both user-specific protection and cumulative risk monitoring through its innovative multi-agent architecture.

## Method Summary
PSG-Agent operates through a two-stage framework that first mines user profiles from interaction history to generate personalized safety criteria, then applies specialized guards throughout the agent pipeline. The system extracts key traits including health conditions, psychological states, economic status, and personal preferences to create structured user profiles. These profiles are used to generate context-aware safety criteria that adapt to individual user characteristics. Multiple guards (Input Guard, Plan Monitor, Output Filter, Action Guard) track risk accumulation across conversation turns, providing cumulative risk assessment and ensuring personalized protection.

## Key Results
- Achieves 79.7% accuracy and 0.744 F1-score on comprehensive safety benchmark
- Outperforms existing guardrails significantly across healthcare, finance, and daily life scenarios
- Maintains training-free, plug-and-play compatibility while providing personalized safety decisions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its personalized approach to safety guardrails, recognizing that different users have varying risk tolerances and safety requirements. By mining user profiles from interaction history, PSG-Agent can generate tailored safety criteria that reflect individual user characteristics and preferences. The multi-agent pipeline with specialized guards allows for nuanced risk assessment at different stages of the agent's operation, while the cross-turn risk accumulation tracking ensures that safety violations are caught even when they develop gradually across multiple interactions.

## Foundational Learning
- **User Profile Mining**: Why needed - to understand individual user characteristics and risk preferences; Quick check - verify extraction accuracy across diverse user types
- **Personalized Safety Criteria Generation**: Why needed - one-size-fits-all approaches fail to account for individual differences; Quick check - validate criteria alignment with user expectations
- **Cross-Turn Risk Accumulation**: Why needed - safety violations often develop gradually across interactions; Quick check - test with multi-turn conversation sequences
- **Multi-Guard Architecture**: Why needed - different stages of agent operation require different safety considerations; Quick check - evaluate guardrail effectiveness at each pipeline stage
- **Training-Free Design**: Why needed - enables rapid deployment without extensive retraining; Quick check - verify plug-and-play functionality across different LLM systems
- **Privacy-Preserving Personalization**: Why needed - safety guardrails must protect user data while being effective; Quick check - assess data security and user consent mechanisms

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Interaction History -> Profile Miner -> Safety Criteria Generator -> Input Guard -> Plan Monitor -> Output Filter -> Action Guard -> Final Decision

**Critical Path**: Profile Miner -> Safety Criteria Generator -> Plan Monitor -> Action Guard

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes personalization accuracy over computational efficiency, accepting higher latency for more tailored safety decisions. Training-free design enables rapid deployment but may limit adaptation to new threat patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Profile Miner extraction failures leading to generic safety criteria
- Guardrail component conflicts causing decision paralysis
- Cross-turn risk accumulation tracking missing gradual safety violations
- Privacy protection mechanisms failing to adequately secure user data

**First Experiments**:
1. Test Profile Miner accuracy with varying amounts of interaction history
2. Validate personalized safety criteria against diverse user scenarios
3. Measure cross-turn risk accumulation effectiveness across multi-turn conversations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly identified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Reliance on interaction history may not scale well to new users with limited data
- Personalization effectiveness depends on accurate personality inference from conversation patterns
- Two-stage framework effectiveness tied to training data quality for guardrail components
- Benchmark results may not capture all real-world safety scenarios or edge cases

## Confidence
- Safety performance claims: Medium - Strong benchmark results but limited real-world validation
- Personalization effectiveness: Medium - Based on controlled experiments with predefined user profiles
- Compatibility and scalability: Low - Unverified in production environments with diverse user populations

## Next Checks
1. Deploy PSG-Agent in production environments with real users over extended periods to validate long-term effectiveness and identify potential degradation in safety performance
2. Test the system's ability to handle edge cases and adversarial inputs that attempt to bypass the guardrail mechanisms
3. Evaluate the personality mining accuracy and its correlation with actual user safety preferences through user studies comparing system behavior to user expectations
