# Beyond Tokens in Language Models: Interpreting Activations through Text Genre Chunks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.16540
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16540
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: High accuracy genre prediction from LLM activations using shallow probes

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for interpreting large language model (LLM) activations by predicting text genres from model activations, moving beyond single-token analysis. The authors create two datasets: a synthetic dataset with 3,914 labeled text chunks across five categories (instructional, explanatory, speech, narrative, code), and the CORE dataset with pre-existing classifications. Using Mistral-7B, they extract activations at each layer and train shallow learning classifiers (scikit-learn) to predict text chunk categories. The method achieves high accuracy, with F1-scores up to 98% on the synthetic dataset and 71% on the CORE dataset, consistently outperforming control tasks with random parameters. Results demonstrate that LLM activations encode high-level text structures in identifiable ways, providing a proof of concept for genre inference from activations using simple probes.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a genre prediction framework by first creating a synthetic dataset with 3,914 text chunks across five genre categories (instructional, explanatory, speech, narrative, code), along with a second dataset using pre-existing CORE classifications. They use Mistral-7B to process these chunks and extract activations at each layer. Shallow learning classifiers (scikit-learn models) are then trained to predict genre categories from these activations. The approach moves beyond token-level analysis by examining multi-token text chunks, with dimensionality reduction (PHATE) used to visualize activation space organization. The framework demonstrates that genre information is encoded in LLM activations in ways that can be reliably extracted using relatively simple probing methods.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1-scores up to 98% on synthetic dataset genre prediction
- Obtained 71% accuracy on CORE dataset with pre-existing classifications
- Consistently outperformed control tasks using random parameters
- Dimensionality reduction revealed clear clusters corresponding to labeled categories in synthetic dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works because LLM activations encode not just token-level information but also higher-level semantic structures like text genre. By examining activations at the chunk level rather than individual tokens, the approach captures broader contextual patterns that distinguish different text types. The shallow learning probes can effectively extract this information because the genre distinctions create measurable differences in activation patterns across model layers. The synthetic dataset provides clean, labeled examples of distinct genres, while the CORE dataset validates the approach on more naturalistic text.

## Foundational Learning
- **Text genre classification**: Categorizing text into instructional, explanatory, speech, narrative, and code types
  - *Why needed*: Provides the target categories for predicting from model activations
  - *Quick check*: Verify that human annotators can reliably distinguish these genres

- **Model activations extraction**: Capturing intermediate representations from Mistral-7B at each layer
  - *Why needed*: Provides the raw data from which genre information is predicted
  - *Quick check*: Confirm activation dimensions match expected model architecture

- **Shallow learning probes**: Using scikit-learn classifiers to predict genres from activations
  - *Why needed*: Simple, interpretable method for testing whether genre information is present
  - *Quick check*: Compare probe performance against random baselines

- **Dimensionality reduction (PHATE)**: Visualizing high-dimensional activation spaces
  - *Why needed*: Reveals whether activations cluster by genre in interpretable ways
  - *Quick check*: Verify that known categories form distinct clusters

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text chunks -> Mistral-7B model -> Layer activations -> Scikit-learn classifier -> Genre prediction

**Critical Path**: Text input → Model processing → Activation extraction → Classification → Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Uses shallow probes for simplicity and interpretability over potentially more powerful but opaque deep learning approaches
- Focuses on single-sentence chunks to control complexity, potentially missing cross-sentence dependencies
- Synthetic dataset provides clean labels but may not capture real-world text complexity

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Low classification accuracy indicating genre information may not be reliably encoded in activations
- Poor separation in dimensionality reduction suggesting activations don't distinguish genres
- Overfitting on synthetic data without generalization to CORE dataset

**First Experiments**:
1. Test genre prediction accuracy across different Mistral-7B layers to identify where genre information is strongest
2. Evaluate classification performance when training and testing on different genre splits
3. Compare shallow probe performance against random chance baselines for each genre category

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges that their work focuses on single-sentence chunks and does not explore cross-sentence dependencies or longer-range contextual relationships. The synthetic nature of the primary dataset raises questions about how well the findings generalize to more complex, real-world text scenarios.

## Limitations
- Potential lack of generalizability to other model architectures beyond Mistral-7B
- Synthetic dataset may not fully capture real-world text complexity
- Shallow probing methodology may miss deeper semantic relationships in activations
- Focus on single-sentence chunks without exploring cross-sentence dependencies

## Confidence

- **Genre prediction from activations using simple probes**: Medium-High
- **Model activations encode high-level text structures**: Medium-High
- **Method provides proof of concept for genre inference**: Medium
- **Approach enables monitoring model behavior beyond token-level predictions**: Low-Medium

## Next Checks

1. Test the genre prediction framework on multiple LLM architectures (e.g., Llama, GPT series) to assess generalizability and identify architecture-specific patterns in activation encoding

2. Evaluate the approach on longer text spans (paragraphs or multi-sentence chunks) to determine whether the genre prediction accuracy holds when considering cross-sentence dependencies and broader contextual relationships

3. Conduct ablation studies on the probe architecture complexity, comparing shallow learning approaches against more sophisticated methods like transformer-based classifiers to establish whether the high accuracy can be maintained or improved with deeper probes
