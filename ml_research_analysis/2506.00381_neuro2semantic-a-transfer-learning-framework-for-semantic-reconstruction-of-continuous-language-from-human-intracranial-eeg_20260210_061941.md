# Neuro2Semantic: A Transfer Learning Framework for Semantic Reconstruction of Continuous Language from Human Intracranial EEG

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00381
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00381
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Achieves BLEU 0.079 and BERTScore 0.195 on semantic reconstruction from iEEG with 30 minutes of training data

## Executive Summary
Neuro2Semantic addresses the challenge of decoding continuous language semantics from intracranial EEG recordings, overcoming limitations of prior classification-based approaches by enabling unconstrained text generation. The method employs a two-phase transfer learning framework: first, an LSTM adapter aligns neural signals with pre-trained text embeddings using contrastive loss; second, a Vec2Text corrector module generates natural language from these aligned embeddings. The approach achieves strong performance with as little as 30 minutes of training data, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in low-data settings.

## Method Summary
Neuro2Semantic uses a two-phase transfer learning approach to decode semantic content from iEEG. Phase 1 employs an LSTM adapter to align neural high-gamma envelopes with pre-trained text embeddings using contrastive and triplet margin losses. Phase 2 fine-tunes a Vec2Text corrector to generate natural language from the aligned embeddings. The method processes iEEG high-gamma band activity (70-150 Hz) downsampled to 100 Hz, segmenting neural data by sentence timing. Training requires approximately 30 minutes of speech perception data per subject, with evaluation using leave-one-trial-out cross-validation.

## Key Results
- Achieves BLEU score of 0.079 and BERTScore of 0.195 on semantic reconstruction tasks
- Demonstrates strong performance with minimal training data (30 minutes)
- Shows linear scaling improvements with increased electrode coverage and training data
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.7× in low-data settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Contrastive alignment creates a shared neural-semantic embedding space that preserves meaning while remaining trainable with limited data.
- **Mechanism:** The LSTM adapter maps iEEG high-gamma envelopes to fixed-dimensional embeddings. The contrastive loss (CLIP-style) pulls corresponding neural-text pairs together while pushing non-corresponding pairs apart, supplemented by triplet margin loss for separation.
- **Core assumption:** High-gamma band activity during speech perception contains recoverable semantic information that shares structure with text embedding spaces.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "an LSTM-based adapter aligns neural signals with pre-trained text embeddings"; [Section 2.1.1] contrastive loss formulation
- **Break condition:** If neural responses lack consistent semantic structure, alignment will converge to local minima with poor generalization.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Iterative text refinement corrects for noise and ambiguity in neural embeddings by exploiting the invertibility of text embedding spaces.
- **Mechanism:** Vec2Text starts with an initial hypothesis and iteratively updates it by comparing the hypothesis embedding to the target neural-aligned embedding.
- **Core assumption:** Text embedding spaces are approximately invertible—multiple valid text sequences can map to semantically similar embeddings.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "a corrector module generates continuous, natural text directly from these aligned embeddings"
- **Break condition:** If neural embeddings deviate significantly from the text embedding distribution, the corrector's pre-trained priors will dominate, producing fluent but unrelated text.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Two-phase transfer learning decouples alignment from generation, allowing each component to specialize with minimal interference.
- **Mechanism:** Phase 1 trains only the adapter while keeping text embeddings frozen. Phase 2 freezes the adapter and fine-tunes only the corrector.
- **Core assumption:** The embedding space learned in Phase 1 is sufficiently stable to serve as a fixed target for Phase 2 fine-tuning.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "our approach consists of two phases"; [Table 1] ablation showing full model outperforms either phase alone
- **Break condition:** If Phase 1 underfits, freezing propagates poor embeddings to Phase 2 with no recovery path.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning (CLIP-style)**
  - **Why needed here:** Core mechanism for Phase 1 alignment; understanding how similarity objectives shape embedding spaces is essential for debugging poor reconstruction.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a batch of 8 neural-text pairs, which pairs contribute positive vs. negative gradients to the contrastive loss?

- **Concept: High-Gamma Band (70-150 Hz) Neural Features**
  - **Why needed here:** Input representation choice; high-gamma envelopes are the actual signal being encoded, and understanding their temporal properties informs window sizing and preprocessing.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might high-gamma be preferred over raw iEEG voltage for semantic decoding tasks?

- **Concept: Iterative Refinement / Controlled Generation**
  - **Why needed here:** Phase 2 mechanism; Vec2Text doesn't decode tokens directly but searches for text whose embedding matches the target.
  - **Quick check question:** How does conditioning on both the target embedding and current hypothesis differ from standard autoregressive generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** iEEG high-gamma envelope (100 Hz) -> LSTM Adapter -> 1536-dim embedding -> Vec2Text Corrector -> Reconstructed sentence

- **Critical path:**
  1. Preprocess iEEG -> high-gamma envelope -> downsample to 100 Hz
  2. Segment neural data by sentence boundaries (aligned to speech timing)
  3. Train LSTM adapter with contrastive + triplet loss (100 epochs, α=0.25, τ=0.1)
  4. Freeze adapter, generate neural embeddings for all training sentences
  5. Fine-tune Vec2Text corrector on (neural embedding, ground-truth text) pairs (2 epochs, 1 refinement step)
  6. Inference: neural signal -> adapter -> embedding -> Vec2Text -> reconstructed text

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LSTM vs. Transformer adapter: LSTMs work with limited data (30 min); transformers may scale better with more data but require larger datasets
  - Number of refinement steps: 1 step used for efficiency; more steps may improve quality at inference cost
  - Electrode selection: Error bars in scaling experiments suggest some electrodes are far more informative; optimal coverage patterns exist

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High BLEU but low BERTScore: Surface-level n-gram matching without semantic coherence (corrector over-relying on language priors)
  - Near-random performance with >50% training data: Likely issue in neural preprocessing or sentence alignment
  - Large variance across electrode subsets: Suggests critical electrodes are being missed; investigate electrode selection criteria

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity check alignment:** Compute average cosine similarity between neural embeddings and their corresponding text embeddings vs. non-corresponding pairs after Phase 1. Expect clear separation (>0.2 difference).
  2. **Ablate refinement steps:** Run Phase 2 with 1, 3, and 5 refinement steps. Determine if iterative refinement provides diminishing returns or if 1 step is sufficient for this data scale.
  3. **Electrode importance analysis:** Train with random 50% electrode subsets (10 runs), record which electrodes appear in high-performing subsets. Correlate with anatomical location to identify critical regions for semantic decoding.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Do transformer-based architectures provide superior modeling capacity for neural-to-text alignment compared to LSTMs when trained on datasets significantly larger than the 30 minutes used in this study?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state: "Additionally, as we gather more data, we aim to investigate transformer-based architectures for the alignment phase, which typically require larger datasets but could offer enhanced modeling capacity."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study utilized LSTMs because they are more data-efficient, making them suitable for the limited 30-minute dataset. Transformers generally require more data to converge, so their potential performance ceiling in this specific domain remains untested.
- **Evidence that would resolve it:** A comparative ablation study training both LSTM and transformer-based adapters on increasingly large iEEG datasets (e.g., 1 hour, 5 hours, 20 hours) and comparing the resulting BLEU and BERTScore metrics.

- **Question:** What are the optimal electrode coverage patterns or specific cortical regions that maximize semantic information extraction for this framework?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that "relatively large error bars imply that some electrodes are substantially more valuable than others for decoding. This suggests that in decoding applications, there are optimal coverage patterns..."
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper demonstrates linear scaling with the number of electrodes using random subsets, it does not analyze the anatomical locations of the high-value electrodes versus the low-value ones.
- **Evidence that would resolve it:** A systematic analysis mapping electrode contribution weights to brain anatomy to identify if specific regions (e.g., temporal lobe vs. frontal lobe) drive the semantic reconstruction performance.

- **Question:** Can the Neuro2Semantic framework effectively decode intended speech (imagined language) in addition to perceived speech?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper focuses exclusively on "perceived speech" (listening), but the Introduction highlights the clinical need for "decoding motor intention" and "intended speech" for speech therapies.
- **Why unresolved:** The model is trained and evaluated solely on neural signals recorded while subjects listened to podcasts. It is unknown if the semantic embeddings aligned during perception correlate sufficiently with the neural representations of speech imagination or production.
- **Evidence that would resolve it:** An experiment applying the same transfer learning framework to iEEG data recorded while subjects silently imagine speaking sentences, comparing the reconstruction accuracy against the perceived speech baseline.

## Limitations
- Restricted evaluation scope: three subjects, limited training duration (~30 minutes per subject)
- Focus on passive speech perception rather than naturalistic conversation
- LSTM adapter architecture details remain underspecified
- Limited empirical evidence that semantic (rather than acoustic/lexical) information drives performance

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Two-phase transfer learning architecture and reported benefits are well-supported by ablation study
- **Medium Confidence:** Contrastive alignment mechanism's effectiveness relies on assumptions about high-gamma band semantic encoding
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about general applicability to different semantic domains or conversational contexts are speculative

## Next Checks
1. **Alignment Quality Verification:** Compute and report the distribution of cosine similarities between aligned neural-text pairs versus non-aligned pairs after Phase 1. Quantify the separation margin and test whether this correlates with downstream reconstruction quality across subjects and electrode subsets.

2. **Refinement Step Sensitivity:** Systematically evaluate Vec2Text performance with 1, 3, and 5 refinement steps during inference. Measure quality improvements against computational cost to establish whether the single-step approach is optimal or represents a practical tradeoff.

3. **Cross-Subject Generalization:** Train the Phase 1 adapter on two subjects and test on the third, measuring alignment quality and reconstruction performance. This tests whether the semantic embedding space is shared across individuals or requires subject-specific adaptation.
