# Human-AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23476
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23476
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: A framework for constructing prediction sets jointly between human experts and AI systems that outperforms either agent alone

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Human-AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification, a novel framework for constructing prediction sets that leverage both human expertise and AI predictions. The framework is guided by two principles: avoiding counterfactual harm (the AI should not degrade the human's correct judgments) and complementarity (the AI should recover correct outcomes the human missed). The authors develop both offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution-free finite-sample guarantees, demonstrating through experiments that collaborative prediction sets consistently outperform individual agents across image classification, regression, and medical diagnosis tasks.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs prediction sets by combining human and AI judgments through a two-threshold structure over a single score function. The optimal collaborative prediction set is derived to maximize coverage while minimizing set size under the two guiding principles. The authors develop an offline calibration algorithm that estimates thresholds from historical data and an online algorithm that adapts to distribution shifts in real-time. The online algorithm specifically addresses Human-to-AI Adaptation, where human behavior evolves through interaction with the AI system. Both algorithms provide distribution-free finite-sample guarantees for their performance.

## Key Results
- Collaborative prediction sets achieve higher coverage and smaller set sizes than either human or AI alone across multiple domains
- The two-threshold structure provides optimal performance under the complementarity and no-harm principles
- Online algorithm successfully adapts to distribution shifts including evolving human behavior patterns
- Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across image classification, regression, and text-based medical diagnosis tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by identifying scenarios where the human expert is likely to err but the AI is likely to be correct (and vice versa), then combining their judgments to achieve better overall performance. The two-threshold structure over a single score function enables efficient decision-making about when to trust the human versus when to defer to the AI. This approach captures the complementary strengths of both agents while protecting against degradation of the human's correct judgments.

## Foundational Learning

**Prediction Set Calibration**: Essential for constructing valid uncertainty estimates that achieve target coverage levels; quick check involves verifying coverage rates match nominal confidence levels across test data.

**Distribution-Free Guarantees**: Critical for ensuring robustness without parametric assumptions; quick check requires validating performance bounds hold across different data distributions.

**Online Learning with Distribution Shifts**: Needed to handle real-time changes in data and human behavior; quick check involves monitoring adaptation speed and stability under controlled shift scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Human Judgment -> Score Function -> Two-Threshold Decision Rule -> Prediction Set Output
Critical Path: Human input → Score computation → Threshold comparison → Set construction
Design Tradeoffs: Single score function simplicity vs. multi-modal complexity; theoretical guarantees vs. practical implementability
Failure Signatures: Poor score function selection leads to threshold misalignment; inadequate human modeling causes violation of no-harm principle
First Experiments: 1) Threshold sensitivity analysis under varying human error rates; 2) Coverage validation across synthetic distribution shifts; 3) Real-time adaptation testing with simulated human behavior evolution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework assumes static human decision-maker models that may not capture dynamic human-AI collaboration
- Two-threshold structure over single score function may limit applicability to complex multi-modal scenarios
- Online algorithm convergence depends on specific assumptions about distribution shifts that may not hold in practice

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal studies to validate framework performance when human decision-makers actively learn and adapt through extended AI interaction
2. Test framework robustness across diverse human populations with varying expertise levels and decision-making styles
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability of online algorithm in real-time applications with large-scale data streams
