# Discriminative protein sequence modelling with Latent Space Diffusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.18551
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18551
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Latent Diffusion models outperform discrete diffusion on protein property prediction when trained on learned latent spaces

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a framework for protein sequence representation learning that separates manifold learning (via autoencoders) from distributional modelling (via diffusion models) to overcome the limitations of discrete diffusion approaches. The authors introduce two autoencoder architectures: LSD-TN, which enforces identical distributions for embeddings of the same amino acid type, and LSD-NM, which applies noise-based masking for robust reconstruction. They train diffusion models on the learned latent spaces and evaluate discriminative performance across five protein property prediction tasks. Results show that diffusion models trained on both LSD variants outperform those trained on masked language model (MLM) baselines, though MLM embeddings themselves still achieve the highest performance.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework decouples representation learning from diffusion modelling by first training autoencoders to map protein sequences to continuous latent spaces, then training diffusion models on these learned representations. Two autoencoder variants are introduced: LSD-TN enforces distributional consistency for identical amino acids through type-specific normalization, while LSD-NM employs noise-based masking for robust reconstruction. The diffusion models are trained to denoise corrupted latent representations using standard score matching objectives. For downstream tasks, frozen autoencoder encoders are used to extract latent representations, which are then processed by task-specific prediction heads.

## Key Results
- Diffusion models trained on LSD-NM embeddings outperform those trained on MLM-based diffusion models across five protein property prediction tasks
- LSD-NM generally performs better than LSD-TN, with both providing complementary strengths when combined with diffusion model outputs
- MLM embeddings themselves achieve the highest overall performance, suggesting room for improvement in latent space learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging continuous latent spaces that can be efficiently processed by diffusion models, avoiding the computational challenges of discrete diffusion. The separation of manifold learning (autoencoder) from distributional modelling (diffusion) allows each component to specialize: autoencoders focus on capturing protein-specific structural information while diffusion models handle the probabilistic denoising task in continuous space. This decoupling enables more flexible and potentially more powerful representations than end-to-end discrete diffusion approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Protein sequence representation learning**
- Why needed: Proteins must be encoded into numerical representations for machine learning models to process them
- Quick check: Can you explain the difference between discrete and continuous sequence representations?

**Diffusion models for sequence generation**
- Why needed: Diffusion provides a principled framework for learning complex data distributions through iterative denoising
- Quick check: Can you describe the forward (corruption) and reverse (denoising) processes in diffusion models?

**Autoencoder architectures for proteins**
- Why needed: Autoencoders learn compressed representations that capture essential features of protein sequences
- Quick check: What is the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and latent space dimensionality?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**
Autoencoder (encoder + decoder) -> Latent space -> Diffusion model (score network) -> Denoised latent -> Downstream predictor

**Critical path**
Protein sequence → Encoder → Latent representation → Diffusion model → Denoised latent → Predictor → Property prediction

**Design tradeoffs**
The paper trades computational efficiency (continuous vs discrete diffusion) for representation quality, choosing to separate manifold learning from distributional modelling rather than learning both jointly. This allows specialized optimization but requires careful coordination between components.

**Failure signatures**
Poor downstream performance could stem from: 1) autoencoder failing to capture relevant protein features, 2) diffusion model not learning the latent distribution well, 3) mismatch between pretraining and downstream task distributions, or 4) suboptimal latent space dimensionality.

**First experiments**
1. Compare reconstruction accuracy of LSD-TN vs LSD-NM autoencoders on held-out protein sequences
2. Visualize latent space embeddings using t-SNE or UMAP to assess clustering by protein function
3. Evaluate diffusion model training stability and convergence rates across different latent space dimensionalities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- The absolute performance of diffusion models on LSD embeddings still lags behind MLM embeddings, questioning the practical advantage of the approach
- Limited analysis of why LSD-NM outperforms LSD-TN and what trade-offs exist between the two designs
- No exploration of the generative capabilities of the trained diffusion models, despite their potential for protein design applications

## Confidence

**Major claim clusters confidence:**
- LSD-NM vs LSD-TN performance comparison: Medium confidence (results show differences but lack mechanistic explanation)
- Diffusion models on LSD embeddings outperform MLM diffusion: Low confidence (comparison is between diffusion models, not to MLM embeddings directly)
- LSD-NM captures biologically meaningful features: Low confidence (based on visualization without quantitative validation)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing diffusion model performance directly against MLM embeddings rather than MLM-based diffusion models
2. Perform quantitative analysis of latent space features to validate biological relevance, such as correlation with known protein properties or clustering of functionally similar proteins
3. Evaluate generative capabilities of the trained diffusion models through sequence sampling and assessment of biological plausibility using established protein generation metrics
