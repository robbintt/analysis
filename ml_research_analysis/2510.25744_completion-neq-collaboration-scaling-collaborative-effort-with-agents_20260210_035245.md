# Completion $\neq$ Collaboration: Scaling Collaborative Effort with Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.25744
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25744
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Current agent evaluation focuses too narrowly on task completion rather than collaborative effort scaling, missing how well agents leverage increasing user involvement.

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that current agent evaluation frameworks are inadequate for measuring real-world collaborative performance. While most benchmarks focus on whether an agent can complete a task in one shot, the authors propose that effective collaboration depends on how well an agent's utility grows with increasing user effort. They introduce a framework that measures collaborative effort scaling through interaction trajectories, capturing two key properties: interaction sustainability (value increases with user effort) and maximum usability (agents sustain engagement in complex tasks). Applied to a simulated travel planning task, the framework reveals that state-of-the-art agents often fail to effectively leverage user input, with some collaborative approaches performing worse than fully autonomous baselines due to action loops and poor long-term planning.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize human-agent collaboration as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) where agents and users alternate turns. They introduce three metrics: utility U (average of commonsense and constraint pass rates judged by an LM), refinement gain G (improvement after first draft), and usability drop D@τ (performance loss if user quits due to lack of progress). The study evaluates three agent variants (automated, one-stage collaborative, two-stage collaborative) across four models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5/4.0 Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70B) in a simulated travel planning environment using the Collaborative Gym framework. Agents are evaluated on their ability to generate itineraries while interacting with simulated users who possess private information about preferences.

## Key Results
- Current collaborative agents often fail to effectively leverage user effort, with some performing worse than fully autonomous baselines
- Two-stage planning strategy significantly improves performance for weaker models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet but provides minimal benefit for stronger models like Claude 4.0 Sonnet
- Each model has an optimal agent-to-user effort ratio sweet spot, with degradation when either party dominates excessively
- Agents frequently get stuck in action loops and fail to develop coherent global plans for meaningful long-term interactions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Effort-Utility Scaling as a Diagnostic Lens
Agent effectiveness in collaborative settings can be characterized by how utility scales with user effort, not just final output quality. The framework decomposes collaboration into rounds via human-agent handoffs, tracking performance trajectory P_k against effort (rounds or tokens). This reveals whether additional user input yields diminishing returns, plateauing utility, or sustained improvement—exposing agents that appear competent in one-shot settings but fail to leverage human input productively.

### Mechanism 2: Two-Stage Planning Scaffold for Weaker Models
Explicit planning stages before action selection improve collaborative outcomes for less capable models by forcing deliberation about when to collaborate versus act autonomously. The two-stage agent first classifies the situation into (1) send message, (2) take task action, or (3) do nothing, then executes. This creates structured decision points that prevent premature action and encourage user synchronization.

### Mechanism 3: Effort Ratio Sweet Spot Detection
Joint performance peaks at model-specific agent-to-user effort ratios, with degradation when either party dominates excessively. By measuring token generation as effort proxy, the framework identifies optimal collaboration distributions. Claude-4.0-sonnet maintains strong performance across broader ratios (14-16x agent-to-user tokens), while gpt-4o and llama-3.1-70b degrade sharply outside narrow bands.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process)**
  - Why needed here: Section 3 uses POMDP to formalize human-agent collaboration as sequential decision-making under partial observability. Understanding states, observations, and actions is prerequisite to grasping the round decomposition.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why collaboration is "partially observable" from each agent's perspective?

- **Concept: ReAct Framework (Reasoning + Acting)**
  - Why needed here: The Co-Gym agents build on ReAct, interleaving thought traces with environment actions. The collaborative extensions add messaging as a new action type.
  - Quick check question: How does adding a "send message" action change the ReAct loop?

- **Concept: Mixed-Initiative Interaction**
  - Why needed here: The paper advocates for agents that dynamically decide when to act, defer, or prompt based on effort-utility dynamics—core to mixed-initiative systems (Horvitz, 1999, cited in discussion).
  - Quick check question: What signals would indicate an agent should defer to the user versus proceed autonomously?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Collaborative Gym environment -> Agent (Automated/One-stage/Two-stage) -> Simulated User -> LM Judge for evaluation

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize task with description and user's private preferences
  2. Agent receives observation + chat history → decides action
  3. If two-stage: planning step classifies intent → then executes
  4. User simulator responds based on private info and rules
  5. Repeat until task completion or max rounds (30)
  6. Compute U, G, D@τ metrics across trajectory

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - One-stage vs two-stage: Lower latency vs structured deliberation; benefit depends on base model capability
  - Autonomous vs collaborative baseline: Fully autonomous may outperform if user input is low-quality or if agent enters action loops
  - Effort proxy choice: Rounds are coarse; tokens capture volume but not cognitive complexity; behavioral traces are richer but harder to instrument

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Action looping: Agent repeats similar actions without progress
  - Premature output: Overly polished first response that obscures reasoning and blocks meaningful follow-up
  - Usability cliff: Sharp performance drop when user tolerance τ is exceeded
  - Effort imbalance: Very high user tokens with flat performance curve

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate travel planning with different models: Run one-stage vs two-stage agents on the same Co-Gym travel tasks; compare refinement gain and usability drop
  2. Ablate effort proxies: Replace round count with token count or simulated "cognitive load" scores; assess whether the utility-effort trajectory shifts meaningfully
  3. Perturb user simulation: Vary simulated user behavior to test whether the sweet spot ratio is robust to user strategy changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Do collaborative effort scaling trends persist when agents interact with real humans possessing private information, rather than LLM-simulated users? The authors note their experiments "rely on simulated users rather than real human participants" and suggest future work should "explore richer simulation settings where users possess private information... better capturing the irreducible value of human involvement."

- **Open Question 2:** How does the collaborative effort scaling framework apply to high-stakes domains like financial advising or education, compared to the tested travel planning domain? The authors list "single domain" evaluation as a limitation, noting "we conduct the experiment in a single domain (travel planning), which may not capture the full spectrum of collaborative dynamics across different task types."

- **Open Question 3:** Can fine-grained behavioral traces (e.g., edit histories, timing patterns) serve as better proxies for user effort than simple token counts or round numbers? The Discussion notes that "Richer behavioral traces—such as edit histories, timing patterns... could help approximate these dimensions," acknowledging that current proxies like interaction frequency overlook cognitive load.

## Limitations

- The study uses token counts and round numbers as proxies for user effort, which may poorly capture cognitive load or the quality of user engagement
- The framework is validated only on a simulated travel planning task, limiting generalization to real-world collaborative tasks
- Model capability assumptions are tied to the tested models, and the framework may not generalize to models with different architectural strengths

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core insight that one-shot completion metrics miss collaborative dynamics; the existence of collaboration failure modes like action loops; the need for trajectory-based evaluation frameworks
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific utility-effort scaling patterns observed for the tested models; the relative performance of one-stage vs two-stage agents; the identification of effort ratio sweet spots
- **Low Confidence:** The precise generalization of the framework to non-travel tasks; the exact thresholds for model capability where two-stage planning becomes detrimental; the stability of LM-based evaluation across different models and runs

## Next Checks

1. **Ablate Effort Proxies:** Replace token counts with alternative effort measures (e.g., simulated cognitive load scores, interaction timing patterns) and assess whether the observed utility-effort trajectories remain consistent or shift meaningfully.

2. **Cross-Task Generalization:** Apply the collaborative effort scaling framework to a different collaborative task domain (e.g., software development planning, creative brainstorming) to test whether the effort-utility patterns and model-specific sweet spots replicate.

3. **Real-User Validation:** Replace the simulated user with human participants in a controlled travel planning task and measure whether the effort-utility scaling curves and identified failure modes (action loops, usability cliffs) persist in human-agent interaction.
