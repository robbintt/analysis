# Bridging the Clinical Expertise Gap: Development of a Web-Based Platform for Accessible Time Series Forecasting and Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.07992
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07992
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Web-based Forecaster platform makes time series forecasting accessible to clinicians without technical backgrounds while maintaining analytical power

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a web-based platform called the Forecaster designed to democratize time series forecasting for clinicians and researchers lacking technical expertise. The platform addresses the critical gap between advanced forecasting capabilities and user accessibility through an intuitive interface that handles data upload, visualization, model training, and result interpretation. By incorporating large language model assistance for parameter selection and supporting multiple forecasting algorithms (ARIMA, random forest, XGBoost), the system makes sophisticated time series analysis accessible to healthcare professionals who need to make data-driven decisions without becoming data scientists.

The platform's dual-backend architecture combines PHP for web services with Python for analytical processing, creating a scalable solution that can be integrated into continuous health monitoring systems. Tested across diverse datasets including bike ridership, ECG readings, store sales, and COVID-19 data, the Forecaster demonstrated competitive forecasting performance with normalized metrics like RMSE and MAE. The tool successfully lowers technical barriers while maintaining analytical rigor, positioning it as a bridge between clinical expertise and advanced forecasting methodologies.

## Method Summary
The Forecaster platform was developed using a dual-backend architecture with PHP handling web services and Python managing analytical processing. The system provides an intuitive web interface for uploading time series data, generating visualizations, training multiple forecasting models (ARIMA, random forest, XGBoost), and interpreting results. Large language model assistance is integrated to help users select appropriate parameters for their forecasting tasks. The platform was tested across diverse datasets including bike ridership, ECG readings, store sales, and COVID-19 data to evaluate its performance and usability. The development focused on making sophisticated time series analysis accessible to users without technical backgrounds while maintaining analytical power and competitive forecasting performance.

## Key Results
- Platform demonstrated competitive forecasting performance with normalized RMSE and MAE metrics across diverse datasets
- Successfully lowered technical barriers to time series analysis for non-technical users
- LLM integration provided effective parameter selection assistance for forecasting models
- Platform architecture supports integration into continuous health monitoring systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The platform works by abstracting complex time series forecasting processes behind an intuitive web interface while maintaining analytical rigor through a dual-backend architecture. The PHP backend handles user interactions and web services, while the Python backend performs the heavy computational lifting for model training and analysis. Large language models assist users in selecting appropriate parameters, reducing the expertise required to generate meaningful forecasts. The multi-model approach (ARIMA, random forest, XGBoost) provides flexibility to handle different data patterns and user needs, while the visualization tools help users understand both their data and the forecasting results.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time series forecasting concepts**: Understanding temporal dependencies and patterns in sequential data - needed to select appropriate models and interpret results; quick check: can identify stationarity and seasonality in sample data
- **Dual-backend architecture**: PHP for web services + Python for analytics - needed to separate user interface from computational complexity; quick check: verify both components communicate effectively through defined APIs
- **Large language model integration**: Using LLMs for parameter selection assistance - needed to reduce technical expertise requirements; quick check: validate LLM recommendations against expert choices on sample datasets
- **Multiple forecasting algorithms**: ARIMA, random forest, XGBoost - needed to handle diverse data patterns and user requirements; quick check: compare model performance across different dataset characteristics
- **Web-based data visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for time series - needed to help users understand data patterns and forecast results; quick check: verify visualizations update correctly with different data inputs
- **Clinical data handling**: Secure processing of sensitive health information - needed for healthcare deployment; quick check: confirm HIPAA-compliant data handling procedures are implemented

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Web Interface -> PHP Backend -> Python Analytics Engine -> LLM Service -> Database Storage

**Critical Path**: User uploads data → PHP backend validates and stores → Python engine processes and trains models → LLM suggests parameters → Results visualized in interface

**Design Tradeoffs**: The dual-backend architecture provides separation of concerns but introduces complexity in maintaining two codebases and ensuring smooth communication between PHP and Python components. The LLM integration enhances accessibility but requires careful prompting strategies and validation against expert knowledge.

**Failure Signatures**: Web interface errors indicate PHP backend issues; model training failures suggest Python engine problems; poor parameter recommendations point to LLM integration issues; data upload failures may indicate validation or storage problems.

**First Experiments**:
1. Upload sample time series data and verify successful storage and initial visualization
2. Test model training with pre-configured parameters to validate Python backend functionality
3. Verify LLM parameter suggestions by comparing with known good parameter sets on sample datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on normalized performance metrics without absolute scale comparisons or clinical validation studies
- LLM integration for parameter selection lacks detailed documentation of prompting strategy and validation against domain experts
- Dual-backend architecture introduces maintenance complexity and security considerations for clinical deployment
- Claims about lowering technical barriers lack empirical user studies measuring actual usability improvements

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The platform's technical implementation and multi-model forecasting capabilities
- **Medium confidence**: The platform's accessibility improvements for non-technical users
- **Medium confidence**: The competitive forecasting performance claims

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with actual clinicians and researchers to measure usability improvements and time-to-insight compared to traditional tools
2. Perform clinical validation using real healthcare datasets with domain expert assessment of forecast utility for patient care decisions
3. Evaluate the security architecture and implement HIPAA-compliant data handling procedures for clinical deployment
