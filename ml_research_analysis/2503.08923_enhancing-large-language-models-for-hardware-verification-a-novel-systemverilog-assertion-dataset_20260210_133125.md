# Enhancing Large Language Models for Hardware Verification: A Novel SystemVerilog Assertion Dataset

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.08923
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08923
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Primary result**: VERT fine-tuned LLMs achieve up to 96.88% improvement over base models and 24.14% over GPT-4o in generating accurate SystemVerilog assertions for SoC verification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of automating hardware verification for complex System-on-Chip (SoC) designs by leveraging large language models to generate SystemVerilog assertions. Traditional manual assertion generation is both time-consuming and error-prone, while existing proprietary solutions like GPT-4o require expensive licenses and still produce inaccurate outputs. The authors present VERT, a curated dataset of synthetic Verilog/SystemVerilog code snippets paired with correct assertions, specifically designed to address common LLM limitations in handling clock cycles, nested conditions, and complex timing scenarios. By fine-tuning open-source models like DeepSeek Coder and Llama 3.1 on VERT, the research achieves significant performance improvements, demonstrating the viability of open-source approaches for industrial-scale hardware verification.

## Method Summary
The VERT approach consists of three main components: a curated dataset of paired Verilog code snippets and SystemVerilog assertions, a fine-tuning methodology using parameter-efficient techniques, and a comprehensive evaluation framework. The dataset construction process combines synthetic code generation with real-world examples from industry-standard SoC designs including OpenTitan, CVA6, OpenPiton, and Pulpissimo. The fine-tuning process employs techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to optimize model parameters for the specific task of assertion generation. Evaluation is conducted using both automated verification tools (JasperGold, Vivado) and manual code review to ensure syntactic and functional correctness of generated assertions. The methodology addresses specific LLM weaknesses in understanding hardware-specific concepts like clock sensitivity and combinational logic.

## Key Results
- VERT fine-tuned DeepSeek Coder 6.7B achieves 96.88% improvement over base model and 24.14% improvement over GPT-4o in assertion generation accuracy
- Models successfully generate assertions for complex SoC designs including OpenTitan and CVA6 with high syntactic correctness rates
- The dataset effectively addresses LLM limitations in handling clock cycle interpretation and nested conditional structures
- Performance improvements are consistent across different open-source model architectures (6B-8B parameter models)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The VERT approach works by providing targeted training data that addresses specific LLM weaknesses in hardware verification contexts. By curating a dataset that explicitly pairs common hardware design patterns with their corresponding assertions, the fine-tuning process enables models to learn the semantic relationships between code structures and verification requirements. The synthetic generation component ensures broad coverage of design patterns while the real-world SoC examples provide practical relevance. The use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA allows the models to adapt to the specialized domain without requiring full retraining, making the approach computationally efficient while maintaining the base model's general capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **SystemVerilog assertions**: Why needed - These are the primary mechanism for specifying and verifying temporal properties in hardware designs. Quick check - Models must generate assertions that correctly capture timing relationships and signal dependencies.
- **Hardware design patterns**: Why needed - Understanding common structures like if-else chains, case statements, and state machines is essential for generating relevant assertions. Quick check - The dataset must cover a representative sample of real-world design patterns.
- **Clock cycle interpretation**: Why needed - LLMs must distinguish between immediate combinational logic and clock-sensitive sequential logic. Quick check - Generated assertions must correctly handle synchronous vs asynchronous conditions.
- **Parameter-efficient fine-tuning**: Why needed - Full model retraining is computationally expensive and may degrade general capabilities. Quick check - LoRA techniques should achieve similar performance to full fine-tuning with fewer resources.
- **Verification tool integration**: Why needed - Generated assertions must be compatible with industry-standard verification tools. Quick check - Assertions must pass compilation and functional verification in tools like JasperGold and Vivado.
- **Synthetic data generation**: Why needed - Real-world assertion data is limited and expensive to obtain. Quick check - Synthetic examples must maintain the semantic properties of real hardware code.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Synthetic Data Generator -> VERT Dataset -> Fine-tuning Pipeline -> Verification Tools -> Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Code Pattern Identification → Synthetic Data Generation → Assertion Pairing → Model Fine-tuning → Verification Tool Testing → Accuracy Assessment

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades off dataset diversity for targeted coverage of LLM failure modes, uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning to balance performance with computational cost, and prioritizes syntactic correctness over semantic completeness to ensure tool compatibility.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failures include incorrect clock sensitivity handling, misinterpretation of nested conditions, missing edge cases in timing assertions, and generation of assertions that compile but fail functional verification.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Generate synthetic code snippets with simple if-else structures and their corresponding assertions to test basic pattern recognition
2. Fine-tune a base LLM on the synthetic dataset and evaluate assertion generation accuracy on held-out examples
3. Test the fine-tuned model on real SoC design snippets from OpenTitan to assess generalization to practical scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does expanding the VERT dataset to include more intricate design patterns improve the generalizability of fine-tuned LLMs on unseen hardware architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "In the future, we will focus on expanding the dataset to cover more intricate design patterns and hardware architectures."
- Why unresolved: The current dataset focuses on standard conditional structures (if-else, case) to address specific LLM limitations, but has not yet quantified performance on highly complex or novel architectural patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results evaluating fine-tuned models on a broader set of complex design patterns and diverse architectures not present in the current training set.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific fine-tuning optimizations are required to improve model performance in accurately distinguishing and handling asynchronous versus synchronous conditions in SystemVerilog assertions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion explicitly lists "improving model performance in handling asynchronous and synchronous conditions" as a focus area for future work.
- Why unresolved: While the current dataset includes an even distribution of both types, the authors identify further refinement in distinguishing immediate and clocked responses as a necessary step for enhancing accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing higher accuracy rates in distinguishing clock-sensitive logic from immediate combinational logic in complex edge-case scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the measurable efficiency gains in verification turnaround time when integrating VERT-based assertion generation into industry-standard functional verification tools?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion notes the aim to "integrate our approach with industry-standard functional verification tools to streamline the hardware verification process."
- Why unresolved: The current work validates assertions using tools like JasperGold and Vivado in a post-generation analysis phase, but has not yet integrated the generation process directly into an industrial verification workflow to measure end-to-end speedup.
- What evidence would resolve it: Data on verification closure times and bug detection latency within a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline utilizing the integrated approach.

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies primarily on synthetic benchmarks and open-source SoC designs, lacking validation on proprietary commercial hardware
- Comparison with GPT-4o is limited to a single proprietary model without benchmarking against other commercial verification tools
- The synthetic dataset construction methodology may introduce biases affecting model generalization to real-world verification tasks
- No assessment of the approach's performance on novel or highly complex design patterns not present in the training data

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core technical approach of fine-tuning LLMs for SystemVerilog assertion generation, supported by quantitative improvements over baseline models and GPT-4o
- **Medium confidence**: Practical applicability to commercial verification workflows, as evaluation scope is limited to open-source SoC designs and synthetic benchmarks
- **Medium confidence**: Dataset quality and representativeness, given synthetic nature of paired examples and lack of detailed bias analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled study comparing VERT-generated assertions against those produced by professional verification engineers on real commercial SoC designs, measuring both accuracy and development time.

2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each dataset component (synthetic vs. industry-standard designs) to the final model performance, identifying potential overfitting to specific design patterns.

3. Test the fine-tuned models on unseen assertion patterns and complex verification scenarios not present in the training data to evaluate generalization capabilities and identify failure modes.
