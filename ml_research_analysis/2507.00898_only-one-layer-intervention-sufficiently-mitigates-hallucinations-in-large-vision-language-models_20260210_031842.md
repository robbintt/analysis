# ONLY: One-Layer Intervention Sufficiently Mitigates Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.00898
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00898
- Reference count: 40
- Method achieves hallucination mitigation in LVLMs through one-layer intervention using text-to-visual entropy ratios

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ONLY, a training-free method to mitigate hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by performing a one-layer intervention during decoding. The approach selectively amplifies crucial textual information using text-to-visual entropy ratios computed for each token. The method demonstrates consistent improvements across six benchmarks and three LVLM backbones, achieving 3.14% higher accuracy on POPE and 1.6% higher accuracy on CHAIR compared to existing approaches. Additionally, ONLY requires only 1.07× inference time compared to 2× or more for contrastive decoding methods, offering significant efficiency gains while maintaining minimal GPU memory overhead.

## Method Summary
ONLY operates by computing text-to-visual entropy ratios for each token during the decoding process, then using these ratios to selectively amplify important textual information. The method requires only a single query and intervenes at one layer of the LVLM architecture during generation. By focusing on the entropy differences between textual and visual modalities, ONLY identifies tokens that require additional emphasis to maintain faithfulness to the input image. This training-free approach works across different LVLM backbones without requiring model fine-tuning or architectural modifications.

## Key Results
- Achieved 3.14% higher accuracy on POPE benchmark compared to existing methods
- Demonstrated 1.6% higher accuracy on CHAIR benchmark over state-of-the-art approaches
- Required only 1.07× inference time versus 2× or more for contrastive decoding methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging entropy differences between textual and visual modalities during decoding. By computing text-to-visual entropy ratios for each token, the method identifies instances where the textual generation may be drifting from the visual input. The one-layer intervention then amplifies crucial textual information at these critical points, effectively realigning the generation with the image content. This selective amplification prevents the model from generating hallucinated content while maintaining natural language fluency.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Text-to-Visual Entropy Ratio**
   - Why needed: Quantifies the alignment between textual generation and visual input at each decoding step
   - Quick check: Verify that entropy values are computed consistently across different LVLM backbones

2. **One-Layer Intervention**
   - Why needed: Minimizes computational overhead while providing sufficient control over generation
   - Quick check: Confirm that intervention occurs at the correct layer across all tested models

3. **Selective Amplification**
   - Why needed: Prevents over-correction that could harm generation quality or introduce new errors
   - Quick check: Measure amplification effects on tokens with different entropy ratios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Image -> LVLM Backbone -> Decoder (with intervention) -> Text Generation

**Critical Path:**
Image features → Text-to-visual entropy computation → One-layer amplification → Token generation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The method trades minimal additional computation (1.07× overhead) for significant hallucination reduction. The single-layer intervention balances effectiveness with efficiency, avoiding the 2× overhead of contrastive decoding methods.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Minimal impact on accuracy when entropy ratios are uniformly distributed
- Potential degradation in generation diversity if amplification is too aggressive
- Ineffectiveness on benchmarks where visual-textual alignment is already high

**First Experiments:**
1. Baseline accuracy comparison without ONLY intervention
2. Entropy ratio distribution analysis across different token positions
3. Ablation study removing amplification component to measure individual contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Modest accuracy improvements (3.14% on POPE, 1.6% on CHAIR) may not justify implementation costs in all scenarios
- The 1.07× inference overhead, while better than contrastive methods, still represents additional computation that could impact production deployment
- Limited exploration of failure modes and edge cases across different LVLM architectures

## Confidence

**Accuracy Improvements:** High confidence (supported by benchmark results across multiple datasets)
**Efficiency Claims:** Medium confidence (comparisons made against specific contrastive methods, but broader efficiency context missing)
**General Applicability:** Medium confidence (evaluated on three models but lacks stress testing)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing the entropy computation to quantify the actual contribution of the amplification mechanism versus simpler decoding strategies
2. Test the method on out-of-distribution images and prompts to evaluate robustness beyond benchmark datasets
3. Measure generation time and memory usage across a wider range of LVLM sizes to better understand scalability characteristics
