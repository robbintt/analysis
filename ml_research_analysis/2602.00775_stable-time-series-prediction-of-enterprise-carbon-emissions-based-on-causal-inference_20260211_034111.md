# Stable Time Series Prediction of Enterprise Carbon Emissions Based on Causal Inference

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2602.00775
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00775
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Stable-CarbonNet achieves 10-15% lower prediction error compared to conventional models while maintaining superior cross-regional and cross-industry generalization

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Stable-CarbonNet, a novel framework for predicting enterprise carbon emissions that addresses the challenges of distribution shifts and non-stationarity across regions, industries, and policy environments. The method integrates causal inference with stable learning principles to identify causally stable features that remain invariant across diverse environments, while incorporating adaptive normalization and sample reweighting to handle temporal non-stationarity. The framework employs cross-environmental risk consistency constraints to distinguish between stable structural drivers and environmentally-dependent features. Empirical evaluations using multi-environment panel data demonstrate that Stable-CarbonNet achieves 10-15% lower prediction error compared to conventional models, with superior generalization performance in cross-regional and cross-industry prediction tasks while maintaining high interpretability through identification of causally stable features.

## Method Summary
Stable-CarbonNet constructs a risk consistency-constrained stable learning framework that extracts causal stable features from multi-environment enterprise panel data. The method employs a shared representation network with per-environment normalization layers, a linear prediction head, and a joint loss function that combines prediction error with a gradient discrepancy penalty across environments. Sample reweighting down-weights periods with high distributional volatility, while adaptive normalization removes scale heterogeneity between environments. The framework identifies features like energy input structure and capital investment as causally stable, distinguishing them from spurious correlations like total profit and Tobin's Q that vary across environments.

## Key Results
- Stable-CarbonNet achieves 10-15% lower prediction error compared to conventional models (XGBoost, LSTM, Temporal GNN) on cross-regional and cross-industry prediction tasks
- The framework correctly identifies energy inputs, capital investment, and labor as causally stable features while rejecting spurious correlations like main business income and Tobin's Q
- Cross-policy scenario testing shows 13.6% performance degradation when stability constraints are removed, confirming the importance of the stable learning approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Environmental Risk Consistency via Gradient Constraints
Enforcing gradient consistency across environments isolates features with invariant causal relationships to carbon emissions by preventing the model from exploiting environment-specific spurious correlations. The gradient discrepancy metric S(θ,w) = Σ||∇w R_e(w^T Φ_θ(X))||² approaches zero when the linear prediction head's optimal parameters are consistent regardless of which environment's data is used, forcing the shared representation layer to retain only causally stable features.

### Mechanism 2: Sample Reweighting for Temporal Confounder Adjustment
Adaptive sample reweighting down-weights periods with high distributional volatility using ωt = exp(-α · Δt), preventing the model from overfitting to transient correlations during specific economic cycles or policy transitions. This implicitly adjusts for confounding factors that create spurious correlations during anomalous periods, allowing the model to learn from periods that better represent stable causal relationships.

### Mechanism 3: Environment-Adaptive Normalization for Cross-Environment Alignment
Per-environment normalization removes scale heterogeneity that would otherwise cause gradient conflicts during joint optimization. The normalization operator N_e(X) applies environment-specific standardization before features enter the shared representation layer, mapping heterogeneous inputs onto comparable distributions and ensuring that gradient consistency constraints operate on aligned feature spaces.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Stable Learning / Invariant Risk Minimization
Why needed here: Traditional ERM exploits all training correlations including spurious ones. The paper's entire approach depends on understanding why enforcing cross-environmental consistency improves out-of-distribution performance.
Quick check question: Why might a model that achieves optimal training loss fail catastrophically when predicting emissions for enterprises in a new region with different energy prices?

### Concept: Causal Feature Decomposition (Stable vs. Spurious)
Why needed here: The paper identifies energy inputs, capital investment, and labor as "causally stable" while main business income and Tobin's Q are "spurious correlations." Understanding this distinction is essential for interpreting feature importance and knowing which variables to trust for decision-making.
Quick check question: If "total profit" correlates strongly with emissions in training data, why would relying on this feature be dangerous for predictions after a new carbon tax is implemented?

### Concept: Multi-Environment Panel Data Structure
Why needed here: The framework requires data partitioned across regions, industries, and policy phases. Without proper environment delineation, gradient consistency constraints cannot be applied.
Quick check question: Why can't stable learning extract invariant features if all training data comes from a single regulatory environment?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map:
Raw inputs → Environment-specific normalization → Shared representation extraction → Linear prediction head → Loss computation (prediction error + λ·gradient discrepancy) → Joint backpropagation

### Critical Path:
Enterprise features → Per-environment normalization → Shared representation network Φ_θ → Linear projection w → Multi-environment loss → Gradient consistency constraint → Backpropagation

### Design Tradeoffs:
- **λ parameter**: Controls stability-accuracy tradeoff; λ→0 recovers standard ERM, λ→∞ enforces full invariance but potentially underfits
- **Environment granularity**: Finer partitions provide stronger consistency constraints but reduce per-environment sample sizes
- **Assumption**: Per-environment normalization removes confounding scale effects without eliminating meaningful environmental signals

### Failure Signatures:
- **i.i.d. testing**: Expect 2-5% higher MSE than XGBoost (intentional tradeoff—do not flag as bug)
- **Cross-environment testing with λ=0**: Performance degrades to baseline; MSE increases 13-20%
- **Identical environments**: Gradient discrepancy term provides no signal; model behaves like standard ERM

### First 3 Experiments:
1. **i.i.d. baseline validation**: Random temporal split, compare against FE/ARIMA/RF/XGBoost/LSTM. Verify Stable-CarbonNet achieves ~0.72 MSE (slightly worse than XGBoost's ~0.70).
2. **Cross-environment generalization**: Train on eastern region → test on central/western; train pre-policy → test post-policy. Verify 10-15% MSE reduction vs. best baseline (target ~0.76 vs. Temporal GNN's ~0.88).
3. **Ablation under cross-policy scenario**: Systematically remove each component. Verify: removing stability constraints causes largest degradation (~13.6%), sample weighting ~6.6%, normalization ~3.2%.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the stable learning framework effectively identify invariant features when environments are defined by microscopic internal factors (e.g., governance structures) rather than macro-level regions or industries?
Basis in paper: [Explicit] Section 5.3 states the study relies on "observable dimensions including regions, industries and policy phases" and suggests future work should explore "finer-grained environmental delineation" at the internal enterprise level.

### Open Question 2
How can the model maintain robustness if the causal intensity of stable features evolves gradually over long-term economic transformations?
Basis in paper: [Explicit] Section 5.3 notes the framework focuses on risk consistency "without explicitly modelling possibilities of causal intensity evolving over time," posing this as a problem for future exploration.

### Open Question 3
Does the Stable-CarbonNet framework generalize to other non-stationary energy economics tasks, such as energy demand prediction or macroeconomic risk warning?
Basis in paper: [Explicit] Section 5.3 suggests generalizing the framework to "energy demand prediction, pollutant emission assessment and macroeconomic risk warning domains to examine its universality."

## Limitations
- The gradient consistency mechanism depends critically on having sufficiently diverse environments, yet limited analysis of environment granularity effects is provided
- The sample reweighting strategy's temporal variation metric (Δt) is referenced but not fully specified, raising concerns about reproducibility
- The model architecture details for Φ_θ remain underspecified, particularly regarding depth, width, and regularization choices

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core premise that distribution shifts across regions/industries/policies degrade standard prediction models and that stable learning can help
- **Medium confidence**: The specific gradient consistency formulation and its implementation, pending clarification of architecture details
- **Medium confidence**: The claimed 10-15% error reduction, as this depends heavily on environment construction and hyperparameter tuning
- **Low confidence**: The specific feature importance rankings (energy inputs/capital vs. profit/Tobin's Q) without detailed ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct sensitivity analysis varying environment granularity (regional vs. provincial, pre/post vs. multi-phase policy) to determine minimum diversity requirements for gradient consistency to be effective
2. Implement ablation testing across cross-policy scenarios to quantify each mechanism's contribution, particularly comparing stability constraint vs. sample weighting vs. normalization effects
3. Perform robustness testing with synthetic data where ground truth causal mechanisms are known, verifying the model correctly identifies invariant features and rejects spurious correlations under controlled distribution shifts
