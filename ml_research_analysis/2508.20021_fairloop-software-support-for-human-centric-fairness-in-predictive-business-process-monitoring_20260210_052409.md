# FairLoop: Software Support for Human-Centric Fairness in Predictive Business Process Monitoring

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.20021
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20021
- Reference count: 16
- FairLoop is a tool for human-guided bias mitigation in neural network-based prediction models for predictive business process monitoring

## Executive Summary
FairLoop addresses the challenge of unfair predictions in business process monitoring by providing software support for human-guided bias mitigation. The tool enables users to inspect and modify biased decision logic in neural network-based prediction models through interpretable decision trees. By distilling neural networks into decision trees, users can identify and address bias related to sensitive attributes like gender or age while preserving beneficial bias patterns.

## Method Summary
FairLoop implements a distill-alter-tune cycle where neural network models are first distilled into interpretable decision trees. Users interact with these decision trees through a graphical interface to identify and modify biased decision logic. The modified decision trees are then used to fine-tune the original neural network models towards fairer predictions. This approach allows for context-aware bias removal where users can selectively address negative bias while preserving positive bias patterns, rather than uniformly removing sensitive attributes.

## Key Results
- Provides graphical interface for interactive exploration and modification of decision trees
- Displays performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall) for comparison after each iteration
- Enables context-aware bias removal through human involvement
- Addresses unfair predictions arising from sensitive attributes in business process monitoring

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FairLoop works by leveraging the interpretability of decision trees to make neural network biases visible and actionable. The distill-alter-tune cycle creates a feedback loop where human expertise guides the bias mitigation process. By allowing users to selectively modify decision logic, the tool can preserve beneficial bias patterns while addressing harmful ones, leading to more nuanced and effective fairness improvements than blanket approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Decision tree distillation**: Why needed - to make neural network decisions interpretable; Quick check - verify the distilled tree maintains reasonable accuracy compared to the original model
- **Human-in-the-loop bias detection**: Why needed - to leverage domain expertise for context-aware fairness decisions; Quick check - measure user agreement rates on bias identification
- **Fine-tuning with modified decision trees**: Why needed - to propagate human-guided fairness improvements back to the neural network; Quick check - compare fairness metrics before and after fine-tuning
- **Performance metric tracking**: Why needed - to monitor trade-offs between fairness and accuracy; Quick check - ensure metrics are computed consistently across iterations

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Neural Network -> Decision Tree Distillation -> User Interface -> Modified Decision Tree -> Fine-tuning -> Updated Neural Network
- **Critical path**: The distill-alter-tune cycle forms the core workflow where each iteration involves distillation, user modification, and fine-tuning
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balances model interpretability with prediction accuracy; prioritizes human judgment over automated bias detection
- **Failure signatures**: Poor distillation quality leading to inaccurate trees; user modifications that degrade model performance; convergence issues in fine-tuning
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test distillation accuracy on a simple neural network with known decision boundaries
  2. Validate user interface responsiveness with decision trees of varying sizes
  3. Measure fairness improvement on a benchmark dataset with known bias patterns
