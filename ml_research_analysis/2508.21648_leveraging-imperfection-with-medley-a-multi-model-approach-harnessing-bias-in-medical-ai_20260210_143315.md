## Executive Summary
MEDLEY is a multi-model orchestration framework that preserves diagnostic disagreement and model-specific biases as potential clinical assets rather than treating them as noise to be eliminated. Unlike traditional ensemble methods that aggregate outputs into single predictions, MEDLEY stratifies model outputs into consensus tiers (Primary ≥30%, Alternative 10-29%, Minority <10%) while explicitly documenting model provenance and known biases. The framework treats diagnostic uncertainty and model hallucinations as transparent signals for clinical deliberation rather than problems to be suppressed.

The approach aims to counter automation bias by forcing active clinician reasoning across competing perspectives and surfacing population-specific conditions that consensus approaches would suppress. While proof-of-concept results demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diagnostic diversity and reveal unexpected bias patterns, clinical validation remains pending.

## Method Summary
MEDLEY orchestrates multiple heterogeneous models processing identical clinical inputs in parallel, stratifying their outputs into consensus tiers rather than aggregating them. The system uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the primary synthesis engine with GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro as backups, querying 30+ LLMs via OpenRouter API on 12 synthetic clinical cases. Outputs are structured to extract diagnosis, ICD-10 codes, confidence scores, and reasoning, then stratified by consensus thresholds and mapped to documented model biases including training population, geographic origin, and known performance gaps.

## Key Results
- MEDLEY generated diagnostic diversity across synthetic cases, with consensus ranging from 48-95% and conditions like IgA nephropathy producing 58 distinct alternative differentials
- Geographic model origin poorly predicted regional disease recognition, with European models having lowest FMF recognition (2.0 mentions/model) despite geographic proximity
- The framework successfully stratified outputs into Primary, Alternative, and Minority tiers while documenting model-specific biases as potential strengths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Preserving model disagreement signals diagnostic uncertainty and surfaces population-specific conditions that consensus approaches would suppress. Multiple heterogeneous models process identical clinical inputs in parallel; their outputs are stratified into consensus tiers (Primary ≥30%, Alternative 10-29%, Minority <10%) rather than aggregated. Disagreement patterns are explicitly mapped to documented model characteristics (training population, geographic origin, architectural biases).

Core assumption: Diagnostic disagreement reflects meaningful variation in model specialization rather than random noise.
Evidence anchors: [abstract] "MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths... creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases"; [section] Table 3 shows 12 synthetic cases with consensus ranging from 48-95%; IgA nephropathy produced 58 distinct alternative differentials; [corpus] CURE (arXiv 2510.14353) demonstrates confidence-driven multi-model ensembles improve medical QA.

### Mechanism 2
Explicit bias documentation transforms model limitations into context-sensitive clinical assets. Each model's training provenance, known performance gaps, and demographic specializations are documented and surfaced alongside outputs. Clinicians weight outputs based on patient-context relevance (e.g., a model trained on Middle Eastern populations may appropriately flag Familial Mediterranean Fever).

Core assumption: Clinicians can and will integrate bias provenance information into their reasoning rather than ignoring it.
Evidence anchors: [abstract] "MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification"; [section] Table 2 maps 9 bias categories to MEDLEY orchestration strategies; Table 5 shows European models had lowest FMF recognition (2.0 mentions/model) despite geographic proximity.

### Mechanism 3
Multi-model orchestration counters automation bias by forcing active deliberation across competing perspectives. Rather than presenting a single authoritative output, MEDLEY surfaces a structured spectrum requiring clinician adjudication. The interface design prevents passive acceptance by making disagreement and uncertainty visible.

Core assumption: Presenting multiple perspectives reduces automation bias rather than causing confusion or decision paralysis.
Evidence anchors: [abstract] "making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight"; [section] Table 1 contrasts MEDLEY with traditional ensembles: "Encourages deliberation; surfaces disagreement patterns" vs. "Risk of automation bias; anchoring on single output".

## Foundational Learning

- **Ensemble Learning Paradigms (Bagging/Boosting/Bayesian/Mixture-of-Experts)**
  - Why needed here: MEDLEY explicitly contrasts with these traditional approaches that collapse outputs into single predictions. Understanding what MEDLEY rejects clarifies what it preserves.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why traditional ensemble methods treat disagreement as variance to be minimized?

- **Bias Taxonomy in Medical AI (Historical, Representation, Measurement, Aggregation, Learning, Evaluation, Deployment, Human Factors, Feedback)**
  - Why needed here: MEDLEY's core innovation is mapping specific bias types to orchestration strategies. The 9-category taxonomy (Table 2) is the conceptual vocabulary for the system.
  - Quick check question: How would you distinguish measurement bias from aggregation bias in a pediatric/adult pooled dataset?

- **Automation Bias and Human-AI Collaboration**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames MEDLEY as a countermeasure to automation bias and over-trust in single-model outputs. The theoretical justification depends on understanding when AI explanations increase vs. decrease trust calibration.
  - Quick check question: Why might explainable AI exacerbate rather than reduce over-trust, according to the cited literature?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Parallel Inference -> Orchestration -> Presentation
  Multiple models process inputs in parallel → Comparative analysis and synthesis → Structured stratified output with provenance

- **Critical path:**
  1. Model selection and bias profile documentation (manual curation required)
  2. Parallel query dispatch with failover handling (token overflow, timeout redirection)
  3. Output stratification by consensus thresholds
  4. Bias attribution mapping to known profiles
  5. Structured report generation for clinician review

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Computational cost vs. diversity: 30+ LLMs demonstrated feasibility but introduced API caps, latency variability, and scalability limits
  - Local deployment possible for CV/statistical models (reduced cloud dependency) but LLM orchestration currently requires external APIs
  - Cognitive load vs. comprehensiveness: presenting all minority views may overwhelm; threshold tuning needed

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High consensus on incorrect diagnosis (all models share same training blind spot)
  - Minority outputs dismissed as noise when actually signaling rare conditions
  - Clinician ignores provenance annotations, reverts to trusting highest-confidence single output
  - API unavailability cascades through ensemble (failover saturation)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline characterization: Run 30+ LLM ensemble on synthetic cases; measure consensus distribution, diagnostic breadth, and bias pattern emergence
  2. Geographic bias validation: Test whether model origin predicts regional disease recognition using controlled case sets
  3. Cognitive load pilot: Present multi-output reports to clinicians; measure decision quality, time-to-decision, and subjective workload against single-model baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does MEDLEY's preserved plurality improve diagnostic outcomes compared to single-model or traditional consensus-ensemble approaches in real clinical settings? The paper lists "empirical validation comparing single-model versus multi-model outcomes in clinical practice" as a critical research pathway, but the proof-of-concept used only synthetic cases without patient data.

### Open Question 2
What thresholds for ensemble activation distinguish when multiple perspectives enhance versus impair clinical reasoning given cognitive load constraints? Future research must determine optimal thresholds for ensemble activation to distinguish when multiple perspectives enhance versus impair clinical reasoning.

### Open Question 3
How can ensemble-level regulatory approval and liability allocation be structured for systems that deliberately preserve disagreement? The paper lists "regulatory frameworks for ensemble-level approval and liability allocation" as a critical research pathway, noting that regulators must ensure "bias-as-specialization" does not become discrimination loophole.

### Open Question 4
Can documented model biases be reliably leveraged as specializations to improve diagnostic accuracy for underrepresented populations? Realizing this potential requires sustained investment in local model development, targeted data collection in underserved communities, data sovereignty protections, and regulatory standards.

## Limitations

- The framework lacks direct clinical validation; all results come from synthetic cases without real patient data
- Geographic model origin poorly predicted regional disease recognition, suggesting training data curation may matter more than provenance
- Cognitive load implications of presenting multi-output diagnoses remain untested, with uncertainty about whether this approach improves or impairs decision-making

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The framework's architectural approach (parallel inference, structured stratification, bias attribution) is technically coherent and implementable. The GitHub repository provides sufficient detail for replication.

**Medium confidence**: The synthetic case results demonstrating diagnostic diversity and consensus patterns are reproducible from the provided materials. The mechanism for mapping model characteristics to disagreement patterns shows theoretical validity.

**Low confidence**: Claims about clinical utility and automation bias reduction require real-world validation. The finding that geographic origin poorly predicts regional disease recognition, while interesting, needs replication across broader conditions and datasets.

## Next Checks

1. **Clinical Outcome Validation**: Deploy MEDLEY in a controlled clinical setting comparing diagnostic accuracy, time-to-diagnosis, and clinician satisfaction against traditional single-model systems using real patient cases.

2. **Bias Profile Verification**: Test whether documented model bias profiles accurately predict performance across diverse patient populations, particularly for conditions with known demographic variations.

3. **Cognitive Load Assessment**: Conduct user studies measuring decision quality, time-to-decision, and subjective workload when clinicians use MEDLEY versus single-model outputs to determine if the multi-perspective approach enhances or impairs reasoning.
