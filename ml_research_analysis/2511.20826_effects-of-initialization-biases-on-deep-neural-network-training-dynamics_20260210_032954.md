# Effects of Initialization Biases on Deep Neural Network Training Dynamics

## Quick Facts

- Key outcome: Initial Guessing Bias causes untrained networks to disproportionately favor certain classes, with Cross-Entropy loss most effectively correcting this imbalance

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how initialization biases, termed Initial Guessing Bias (IGB), affect early-stage training dynamics in deep neural networks. The authors examine how different loss functions—Cross-Entropy (CE), Blurry Loss (BL), and Piecewise-Zero Loss (PZ)—interact with IGB during initial training phases. IGB causes untrained networks to disproportionately favor certain classes, assigning high probabilities to a few classes and near-zero to others. Results show that CE quickly corrects this imbalance by providing strong gradients even for low-probability classes, leading to faster convergence and improved accuracy across all classes. BL achieves similar outcomes but at a slower rate, while PZ struggles to overcome IGB due to its gradient-suppressing nature, resulting in the initially favored class dominating throughout training.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted experiments using ResNet-50 architecture on CIFAR-10 dataset to study initialization biases. They analyzed three loss functions—Cross-Entropy (CE), Blurry Loss (BL), and Piecewise-Zero Loss (PZ)—and their effectiveness in correcting Initial Guessing Bias (IGB) during early training stages. The study examined how these loss functions interact with IGB by measuring gradient strength, convergence speed, and class-wise accuracy distributions. Experiments tracked training dynamics from random initialization through multiple epochs, focusing on how each loss function addresses the disproportionate class probability distributions that emerge from random initialization.

## Key Results
- Cross-Entropy loss effectively corrects initialization biases through strong gradients for low-probability classes
- Blurry Loss achieves similar correction outcomes as CE but at a slower convergence rate
- Piecewise-Zero Loss struggles to overcome initialization biases due to gradient suppression, causing the initially favored class to dominate training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying these results relates to how different loss functions handle gradient flow for low-probability classes. Cross-Entropy loss provides strong gradients even when a class has very low predicted probability, enabling rapid correction of initialization biases. This strong gradient signal allows the model to quickly adjust weight parameters that favor underrepresented classes. Blurry Loss provides a similar gradient structure but with reduced magnitude, resulting in slower but still effective bias correction. Piecewise-Zero Loss, by suppressing gradients for certain probability ranges, fails to provide sufficient learning signals for underrepresented classes, allowing the initial bias to persist throughout training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Initial Guessing Bias (IGB)**: The phenomenon where random initialization leads to disproportionate class probability distributions. Why needed: Understanding this bias is crucial for explaining why models may struggle with certain classes early in training. Quick check: Verify that random initialization produces non-uniform class probability distributions in untrained networks.
- **Gradient Flow Dynamics**: How loss functions generate gradients for different probability ranges. Why needed: Critical for understanding why some loss functions correct biases faster than others. Quick check: Compare gradient magnitudes across different loss functions for low-probability classes.
- **Early Training Phase**: The initial epochs where initialization effects are most pronounced. Why needed: This phase determines whether biases persist or get corrected. Quick check: Track class probability distributions during first 10 epochs of training.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: ResNet-50 -> Cross-Entropy/BL/PZ Loss -> CIFAR-10 Dataset -> IGB Correction Dynamics
Critical path: Initialization -> Class Probability Distribution -> Loss Function Gradient Generation -> Weight Updates -> Bias Correction
Design tradeoffs: Strong gradient signals (CE) vs. stable training (PZ) vs. intermediate approach (BL)
Failure signatures: Persistent class dominance, slow convergence, imbalanced accuracy across classes
First experiments:
1. Measure initial class probability distributions from random ResNet-50 initialization
2. Track gradient magnitudes for low-probability classes across different loss functions
3. Compare convergence rates and final accuracy distributions for CE vs. BL vs. PZ

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses specifically on ResNet-50 architecture and CIFAR-10 dataset, limiting generalizability
- Investigation covers only three specific loss functions, not comprehensively exploring the loss function space
- Analysis examines initialization biases at a single learning rate, potentially missing effects from different optimization regimes

## Confidence
- High confidence: Cross-Entropy effectively corrects initialization biases through strong gradients for low-probability classes
- Medium confidence: Comparative performance of Blurry Loss versus Cross-Entropy, sensitive to hyperparameter choices
- Medium confidence: Piecewise-Zero Loss struggles with initialization biases, influenced by implementation details

## Next Checks
1. Test findings across multiple architectures (CNNs, Transformers) and datasets to assess generalizability
2. Experiment with different learning rate schedules to determine if effects persist across various optimization regimes
3. Investigate interaction between initialization biases and batch normalization effects
