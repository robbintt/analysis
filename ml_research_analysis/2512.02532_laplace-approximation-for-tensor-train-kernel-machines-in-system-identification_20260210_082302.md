# Laplace Approximation For Tensor Train Kernel Machines In System Identification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.02532
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02532
- Authors: Albert Saiapin; Kim Batselier
- Reference count: 2
- Key outcome: Combines Laplace approximation with variational inference in tensor train kernel machines, achieving up to 65× faster training than cross-validation while maintaining comparable predictive performance for system identification tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the scalability limitations of Gaussian process regression by introducing a Bayesian tensor train kernel machine (LA-TTKM) that combines Laplace approximation with variational inference. The key innovation is applying Laplace approximation to a selected TT-core while using variational inference for hyperparameter optimization, achieving up to 65× faster training compared to cross-validation while maintaining comparable predictive performance. The method resolves key design questions about which TT-core to treat Bayesian and shows that the choice is largely independent of TT-ranks and feature structure.

## Method Summary
The method represents model weights as a Tensor Train decomposition with ranks R₁,...,R_{D-1}, using Alternating Linear Scheme (ALS) to optimize TT-cores sequentially for multiple epochs. A single TT-core is selected for Bayesian treatment via Laplace approximation, computing a Gaussian posterior around the ALS-identified mode. Variational inference with Gamma priors replaces cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization, updating precision parameters β (noise) and γ (weights) in closed form. The predictive distribution uses the Laplace posterior mean and covariance, enabling scalable uncertainty quantification for large-scale nonlinear system identification.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 65× faster training than cross-validation on UCI regression datasets while maintaining comparable NLL and RMSE
- Successfully applies to 18-dimensional inverse dynamics problem for robotic arm with 60× speedup over cross-validation
- Demonstrates that selecting the first TT-core for Bayesian treatment provides best computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Single-Core Laplace Approximation
- Claim: Applying Laplace approximation to only one TT-core provides tractable Bayesian inference while maintaining theoretical justification.
- Mechanism: ALS optimizer updates each TT-core sequentially and computes exact optimal solution for one core at a time. By selecting the same core for Bayesian treatment (typically final core), the Laplace approximation assumption holds because ALS provably finds the optimum for that core.
- Core assumption: The local posterior around the ALS-identified mode can be well-approximated by a Gaussian.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "applies Laplace approximation to estimate the posterior distribution over a selected TT-core"; Section 3.1 explains theoretical justification when ALS-identified core is chosen.

### Mechanism 2: Tensor Train Decomposition for Exponential Basis Scaling
- Claim: Tensor train decomposition enables exponentially many basis functions while maintaining polynomial computational complexity.
- Mechanism: TT representation factorizes Dth-order tensor into chain of 3rd-order cores, reducing storage from O(I^D) to O(DIR²). ALS update exploits Kronecker structure to avoid explicit full tensor construction.
- Core assumption: Target function admits low-rank tensor representation.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "exponential number of basis functions without incurring exponential computational cost"; Section 2.2 provides complexity analysis T = O(EDI²R⁴(N + IR²)).

### Mechanism 3: Variational Inference Replacing Cross-Validation
- Claim: Variational inference provides up to 65× faster training than grid-search cross-validation with comparable predictive performance.
- Mechanism: Mean-field factorization enables coordinate ascent updates that iteratively refine Gamma posteriors without retraining the model.
- Core assumption: Mean-field factorization is reasonable; hyperparameters and weights are not strongly correlated.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "VI replaces cross-validation while offering up to 65x faster training"; Table 3 shows 1397.5s (CV) vs 48.6s (VI).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Tensor Train (TT) Decomposition**
  - Why needed here: Core data structure enabling scalability; without understanding TT-ranks and core interactions, cannot reason about computational tradeoffs.
  - Quick check question: Given a 5th-order tensor of shape [10,10,10,10,10] with TT-ranks [1,4,4,4,1], what is the total parameter count across all cores?

- Concept: **Laplace Approximation**
  - Why needed here: The probabilistic backbone of LA-TTKM; understanding what the covariance matrix represents is essential for interpreting uncertainty estimates.
  - Quick check question: In Laplace approximation, what does the inverse Hessian (∂²J/∂v∂vᵀ)⁻¹ represent about the posterior geometry?

- Concept: **Mean-Field Variational Inference**
  - Why needed here: Hyperparameter learning mechanism; the factorization assumption directly affects whether VI will succeed over CV.
  - Quick check question: What assumption does q(v)q(β)q(γ) make about correlations between weights and hyperparameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Feature maps ϕ⁽ᵈ⁾(xd) → TT-cores V⁽ᵈ⁾ → ALS optimizer → Laplace layer → VI module → Predictive distribution

- Critical path:
  1. Define feature maps (I basis functions per dimension)
  2. Initialize TT-cores with uniform ranks
  3. Run ALS until convergence
  4. Select final-updated core as Bayesian core; compute Laplace posterior
  5. Run VI iterations to update β, γ hyperparameters
  6. For prediction: compute A*₍ᵈ₎ from test inputs, return N(y*|A*μ, β⁻¹I + A*CA*ᵀ)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Which core to make Bayesian: First/last cores have R₀=RD=1 → fewer parameters → more stable Bayesian averaging, but may limit expressiveness. Paper recommends first core for scalability.
  - TT-rank selection: Higher R → better approximation but O(R⁴) complexity growth.
  - VI vs CV: VI is faster but shows higher NLL despite lower RMSE → overconfident uncertainty calibration.

- Failure signatures:
  - NLL increasing while RMSE decreasing: Overconfident predictions; VI converged to poor local optimum.
  - ALS divergence/oscillation: Learning rate too high or ranks insufficient.
  - Covariance matrix C not positive definite: Numerical instability in Hessian inversion.
  - Training time matches CV not VI: Verify VI loop is executing.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Core selection ablation on Boston (13D): Test each of 13 cores as Bayesian candidate with ranks [3,3,...,3]; verify best core is rank-independent.
  2. VI convergence timing on Concrete dataset: Run VI vs CV over 10 seeds; target ~30× speedup with NLL within ±0.1 of CV.
  3. Uncertainty calibration check on robotic arm: Plot predictive mean ± 2σ for held-out trajectory; flag if intervals are implausibly narrow given RMSE.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the variational framework be extended to treat multiple or all TT-cores as Bayesian variables?
- Basis in paper: Authors state "For future work, we plan to explore richer probabilistic formulations, such as making multiple—or all—TT-cores Bayesian or employing mean-field approximation."
- Why unresolved: Current method relies on ALS finding exact solution for single core; extending to multiple cores complicates theoretical justification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of mean-field or full-covariance approximation valid for multiple cores maintaining competitive training speed.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the model dynamically adapt TT-ranks during training without requiring complete restart?
- Basis in paper: Conclusion identifies "automatic adaptation of TT-ranks" as "promising direction" to allow model to grow incrementally.
- Why unresolved: Current training requires fixed TT-ranks; changing them typically invalidates current optimization state.
- What evidence would resolve it: Algorithm that adjusts ranks based on validation metrics during ALS procedure.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can overconfidence observed in inverse dynamics task be mitigated to lower NLL without sacrificing RMSE?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.3 notes VI model exhibits "higher NLL due to occasionally overconfident uncertainty estimates" despite best RMSE.
- Why unresolved: Laplace approximation provides local estimate of uncertainty that may underestimate true variance in complex systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modifications to variance estimation that align predictive uncertainty intervals with observed error distribution.

## Limitations
- Single-core Bayesian treatment may limit expressiveness compared to full Bayesian treatment of all TT-cores
- Mean-field VI assumption may not capture weight-hyperparameter correlations, leading to overconfident uncertainty estimates
- TT-rank selection remains a hyperparameter requiring manual tuning without dynamic adaptation mechanism

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core mechanism of combining Laplace approximation with single-core Bayesian treatment in TT framework is sound and well-supported by ALS optimization theory
- **Medium confidence**: 65× speedup claim based on specific dataset experiments; generalization to other domains requires validation
- **Medium confidence**: Uncertainty quantification claims partially supported but show calibration issues in some cases (higher NLL despite lower RMSE)

## Next Checks
1. **Core sensitivity analysis**: Systematically test all TT-core positions as Bayesian candidates across multiple datasets with varying dimensions and rank configurations to verify rank-independence claim
2. **VI calibration benchmark**: Compare VI uncertainty calibration against full Bayesian treatment on synthetic dataset where ground truth posterior is computable, focusing on NLL/RMSE tradeoffs
3. **Scalability stress test**: Evaluate performance on high-dimensional datasets (D > 20) with increasing TT-ranks to identify practical scalability limits and failure modes
