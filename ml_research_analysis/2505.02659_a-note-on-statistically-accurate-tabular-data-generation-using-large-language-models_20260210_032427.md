core_contribution: The paper addresses the challenge of preserving complex feature
  dependencies, particularly among categorical variables, when generating synthetic
  tabular data using large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based approaches often
  fail to capture realistic statistical distributions due to auto-regressive token-by-token
  generation, which leads to over- or under-representation of categories and incorrect
  correlations between features.

# A Note on Statistically Accurate Tabular Data Generation Using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.02659
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02659
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Probability-driven prompting enables LLM-based synthetic tabular data generation that preserves complex feature dependencies with minimal queries

## Executive Summary
Large language models struggle to generate statistically accurate synthetic tabular data due to their auto-regressive nature, which leads to incorrect feature correlations. This paper introduces a probability-driven prompting approach that overcomes these limitations by using LLMs to estimate conditional probability distributions for categorical features, then sampling synthetic data from these distributions. The method significantly improves statistical fidelity while requiring only a constant number of LLM queries regardless of dataset size.

## Method Summary
The probability-driven prompting method uses LLMs to estimate probability distributions rather than generating individual cells. First, the LLM is prompted to output marginal distributions for each categorical feature. Then, for each unique value of the first feature, the LLM is prompted to output conditional distributions for subsequent features. Synthetic data is generated by sampling from these distributions, preserving the statistical relationships between features. This approach requires only 5-6 LLM queries for any dataset size, compared to millions of queries for cell-by-cell generation.

## Key Results
- The method accurately preserves age-dependent ethnicity distributions in California demographic data, outperforming both table-wide and cell-by-cell generation approaches
- Statistical fidelity is maintained while requiring only a constant number of LLM queries (5-6) regardless of dataset size
- Cell-by-cell generation requires separate queries per cell (e.g., ~30,000 for 10,000 rows), making the probability-driven approach significantly more scalable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Traditional LLM-based tabular data generation fails because auto-regressive token-by-token generation cannot capture holistic statistical distributions across entire tables. The probability-driven approach works by leveraging LLMs' world knowledge to estimate probability distributions rather than generate specific values. By first obtaining marginal distributions and then conditional distributions given previously generated values, the method can sample synthetic data that accurately reflects real-world correlations while maintaining computational efficiency through distribution estimation rather than per-cell generation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Concept: Auto-regressive Generation** - LLMs generate text token-by-token based on next-token probability; this biases their tabular data generation toward incorrect feature correlations. Quick check: If an LLM generates "White" more often than "Latino" in general context, how will this bias affect its attempt to generate California population table directly?

- **Concept: Marginal vs. Conditional Probability** - P(Ethnicity) is the marginal distribution of all ethnicities, while P(Ethnicity | Age Group) captures the dependency of ethnicity on age. Quick check: Why is sampling from P(Ethnicity | Age="65 and older") more likely to produce realistic dataset than sampling from P(Ethnicity) for all age groups?

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering for Structured Output** - The method relies on carefully crafted prompts to force LLM output probability distributions (JSON objects) rather than narrative or single values. Quick check: What's the key difference between prompts for "cell-by-cell generation" and "probability-driven prompting"?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Prompt Template -> LLM Engine -> Distribution Extractor -> Statistical Sampler
- **Critical path**: Generate and sample first feature from marginal distribution, then iterate through unique values of first feature, query LLM for conditional distribution of second feature, and sample accordingly
- **Design tradeoffs**: Highly efficient for low-cardinality categorical features but scales poorly as features/categories increase; statistical fidelity limited by LLM's pre-existing knowledge
- **Failure signatures**: Poor feature ordering leads to incorrect correlations; LLM output malformation breaks pipeline; context overload degrades distribution estimates
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate California demographics experiment comparing correlation matrices across methods, 2) Test scalability by increasing conditioning variable categories from 5 to 50, measuring LLM calls and time, 3) Test feature order sensitivity with three correlated features using different generation orders

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions: Can this strategy extend to continuous numerical data or mixed-type variables? How does accuracy and latency scale with high-dimensional datasets containing complex multi-variate dependencies? Does the method fail when target statistical distribution contradicts LLM's pre-training biases? These questions remain unresolved as the study focuses exclusively on low-cardinality categorical data.

## Limitations
- Limited to low-cardinality categorical features; efficiency gains diminish as category count increases
- Statistical fidelity constrained by LLM's pre-existing knowledge rather than fine-tuned on specific domains
- Method's performance on wide tables with complex multi-feature dependencies not empirically validated

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core methodology of using probability-driven prompting to estimate distributions is technically sound and efficiency advantage is clearly demonstrated
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical validation on California demographics is convincing but limited in scope and generalizability
- **Low confidence**: Scalability claims for datasets with many features are not empirically validated; combinatorial explosion in conditional distribution queries not adequately addressed

## Next Checks
1. **Multi-feature Correlation Preservation**: Extend experiment to 5-7 categorical features with known correlations, generate synthetic data using different feature orders, measure pairwise correlation preservation against ground truth
2. **High-Cardinality Stress Test**: Create dataset with 10,000 rows where one feature has 50+ categories, measure LLM calls, generation time, and statistical fidelity compared to baseline
3. **Continuous Feature Extension**: Modify method to handle continuous features via binning, measure how bin size affects efficiency and accuracy, compare against auto-regressive approach on same binned data
