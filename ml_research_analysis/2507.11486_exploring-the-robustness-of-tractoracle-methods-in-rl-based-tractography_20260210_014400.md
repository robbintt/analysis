# Exploring the robustness of TractOracle methods in RL-based tractography

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.11486
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11486
- **Authors:** Jeremi Levesque; Antoine Théberge; Maxime Descoteaux; Pierre-Marc Jodoin
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Oracle-guided RL methods produce up to 30× more anatomically valid streamlines than traditional approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates TractOracle-RL, a reinforcement learning-based tractography method enhanced with anatomical priors through an oracle neural network. The framework aims to reduce false positives in white matter tract reconstruction by incorporating anatomical knowledge during RL training. Four key extensions are evaluated: support for multiple RL algorithms (SAC, DroQ, CrossQ), expanded input context via convolutional encoding, Iterative Reward Training (IRT), and streamline compression to 32 points. Results consistently demonstrate that oracle-guided RL methods outperform both traditional and oracle-free RL approaches across diverse datasets, with IRT showing particularly strong performance in anatomical validity and streamline accuracy.

## Method Summary
The TractOracle-RL framework integrates anatomical priors into RL-based tractography through an oracle neural network that provides anatomical feedback during training. The method explores four extensions: generalization across three RL algorithms (SAC, DroQ, CrossQ), CNN-based context encoding for richer input representation, IRT for iterative reward refinement, and streamline compression to 32 points for computational efficiency. The oracle network is trained on labeled tract data and guides the RL agent to produce anatomically plausible streamlines while minimizing false positives. Evaluation spans multiple datasets including HCP, synthetic data, and intra-subject validation across five major white matter tracts.

## Key Results
- Oracle-guided RL methods consistently outperform traditional and oracle-free RL approaches in anatomical validity
- IRT-enhanced methods produce up to 30× more true positive streamlines than baseline methods
- The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple RL algorithms (SAC, DroQ, CrossQ) and diverse diffusion MRI datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by incorporating anatomical priors through an oracle neural network that guides the RL agent during tractography. The oracle provides real-time feedback about anatomical plausibility, effectively constraining the search space and reducing false positive streamlines. IRT iteratively refines reward signals based on anatomical feedback, creating a self-improving loop that enhances anatomical accuracy over time. The CNN encoder expands the agent's contextual awareness, allowing it to make more informed decisions about streamline trajectories based on local anatomical features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning in tractography:** Needed to understand how RL agents learn optimal tractography paths; quick check: RL agent successfully navigates from seed point to tract endpoint
- **Anatomical priors integration:** Required to grasp how external knowledge constrains tractography; quick check: oracle network correctly identifies anatomical structures
- **Iterative reward training:** Essential for understanding self-improvement mechanism; quick check: reward signals converge and improve over iterations
- **Convolutional feature encoding:** Important for contextual decision-making; quick check: CNN extracts meaningful anatomical features from local regions
- **Streamline compression:** Critical for computational efficiency; quick check: 32-point representation preserves essential tract geometry
- **Tractography evaluation metrics:** Necessary to interpret performance results; quick check: true positive/false positive rates align with anatomical ground truth

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Diffusion MRI data -> CNN encoder -> RL agent -> Oracle network -> Reward signal -> Streamlines -> Evaluation metrics

**Critical path:** Diffusion data flows through CNN encoder to RL agent, which generates streamlines. The oracle network evaluates anatomical validity and provides reward signals back to the RL agent. IRT iteratively refines these rewards for improved performance.

**Design tradeoffs:** Point reduction to 32 points significantly improves computational efficiency but may lose subtle anatomical details. Multiple RL algorithm support increases flexibility but adds complexity. IRT improves accuracy but requires additional training iterations.

**Failure signatures:** Poor oracle training leads to misleading anatomical guidance. Insufficient CNN context encoding results in suboptimal local decisions. IRT convergence issues cause reward instability. Excessive point reduction distorts tract geometry.

**First experiments:** 1) Test oracle network standalone on anatomical classification task, 2) Validate CNN encoder extracts meaningful local features, 3) Verify RL agent can navigate simple synthetic tracts without oracle guidance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relatively small number of subjects (3) used in some evaluations limits generalizability
- Focus on five major tracts may not represent full anatomical diversity
- Assumption that labeled ground truth perfectly represents anatomical reality may not hold
- 32-point streamline reduction may discard clinically relevant curvature information

## Confidence
- Anatomical validity improvements: High
- Cross-algorithm generalization: Medium-High
- Computational efficiency gains: High
- Clinical applicability: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on pathological or developmental MRI datasets to assess robustness beyond healthy adult anatomy
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each extension (CNN context, IRT, point reduction) to quantify their individual impact
3. Validate results using independent anatomical atlases or expert-rater studies to confirm that increased streamline counts represent true anatomical structures rather than method artifacts
