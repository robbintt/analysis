# Exploration of Reproducible Generated Image Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.21562
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21562
- Authors: Yihang Duan
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Reproducibility analysis reveals AIGC detection methods overfit to generator-specific features and are sensitive to preprocessing variations.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates reproducibility challenges in AI-generated content (AIGC) image detection methods. Through analyzing seven key papers, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method, the research identifies fundamental issues with current detection approaches. The findings reveal that detection methods often overfit to exclusive features of specific generators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Additionally, papers frequently omit critical preprocessing details, making experimental reproducibility difficult.

## Method Summary
The study employs a three-pronged methodology: first, analyzing seven representative AIGC detection papers to assess their experimental detail disclosure and reproducibility; second, constructing a lightweight test dataset using images from three diffusion models (SDv1.5, SDv2.1, Playground-v2) with VAE reconstructions; third, reproducing a representative detection method based on VAE reconstructions to empirically validate reproducibility claims. The analysis combines quantitative performance measurements with qualitative frequency-domain visualizations to understand feature learning mechanisms and degradation patterns.

## Key Results
- Detection methods overfit to exclusive features of specific generators, achieving high accuracy on matched generators (~95%+) but dropping to near-chance levels (~50%) on different generators
- Common preprocessing operations like JPEG compression and resizing destroy VAE-specific features, causing detectors to learn spurious artifacts instead
- Basic performance can be reproduced when following core procedures, but results are sensitive to preprocessing details not disclosed in original papers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Detectors trained on VAE-reconstructed images can identify images from generators sharing that VAE by learning generator-specific high-frequency artifacts.
- Mechanism: VAEs inject distinctive frequency-domain artifacts during the final dimension-elevation step of diffusion generation. A classifier trained on aligned real/VAE-reconstructed pairs learns to recognize these artifacts without needing full generator access.
- Core assumption: The VAE's convolutional layer structure produces consistent, learnable high-frequency signatures that transfer from reconstructions to generated images.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "most detection methods overfit to exclusive features of specific generators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images"
  - [page 4]: "after real images are reconstructed by the VAE of the corresponding generator, they acquire the same high-frequency features as those of the generator; moreover, the features of different VAEs have certain differences"
  - [corpus]: CINEMAE paper confirms "image-based detectors still struggle with overfitting to generator-specific artifacts"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The discriminative features distinguishing real from generated images reside primarily in high-frequency spectral components, not semantic content.
- Mechanism: Visual inspection shows no semantic differences between real images and VAE reconstructions. Frequency-domain analysis reveals that generated and VAE-reconstructed images share similar spectral energy distributions that differ from real images.
- Core assumption: High-frequency artifacts are the primary learnable signal; semantic features are non-discriminative for this task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [page 4]: "Through direct visual observation, it can be found that there are no differences in content or semantics between real images and their reconstructions... it is natural to hypothesize that these features belong to high-frequency information"
  - [page 4, Figure 3]: Shows frequency spectra and energy spectra demonstrating similar patterns between reconstructions and generated images
  - [corpus]: FBA²D paper title references "Frequency-based Black-box Attack" supporting frequency-domain relevance, though full text unavailable for detailed confirmation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Common preprocessing operations (JPEG compression, resizing, Gaussian noise) destroy VAE-specific features, causing detectors to learn spurious artifacts instead.
- Mechanism: JPEG compression introduces its own high-frequency artifacts. If training data is JPEG-compressed but the detector is intended to learn VAE features, the model learns compression artifacts as the classification criterion instead.
- Core assumption: Simple classifiers learn whichever consistent discriminative feature is present, regardless of researcher intent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [page 5, Figure 5]: "Model A completely takes JPEG compression artifacts as the classification criterion"
  - [page 5]: "JPEG compression does destroy the original features and causes the model to recognize these damaged features as the characteristics of a certain type of image"
  - [corpus]: DINO-Detect abstract confirms detectors "struggle under real-world degradations, particularly motion blur"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in Diffusion Models**
  - Why needed here: The entire detection approach hinges on understanding that VAEs introduce artifacts during latent-to-pixel decoding. Without this, the reconstruction-based training strategy makes no sense.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a VAE reconstruction of a real image resembles images from the generator that uses that VAE?

- Concept: **Frequency Domain Analysis (FFT, Spectral Decomposition)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's diagnostic methodology relies on frequency-domain visualization to identify where discriminative information lives and how preprocessing affects it.
  - Quick check question: If you apply JPEG compression to an image, what happens to its high-frequency components?

- Concept: **Overfitting to Dataset-Specific Artifacts**
  - Why needed here: The core reproducibility failure is models learning generator-specific shortcuts rather than universal features. Understanding this distinction is essential for interpreting cross-generator results.
  - Quick check question: A detector achieves 99% on Generator A's images but 50% on Generator B. Is this likely a capacity problem or a data problem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Real Images → VAE Reconstruction → [Real, Reconstructed] Pairs → Binary Classifier → Detection Decision (Real/Generated)
- Critical path: **VAE alignment** between training data and deployment generators. If the VAE used for training reconstructions differs from the target generator's VAE, detection degrades sharply.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Single-VAE training**: High accuracy on matched generators (~95%+), near-chance on others (~50%)
  - **Multi-generator training**: More robust but requires diverse VAE coverage
  - **Preprocessing strictness**: Strict preprocessing preserves features but limits real-world applicability; relaxed preprocessing improves robustness but risks learning wrong features
- Failure signatures:
  - Cross-generator accuracy drops >40 percentage points from in-distribution performance
  - Model classifies based on compression artifacts (detectable by testing on uncompressed vs. JPEG versions)
  - Reproducibility deviation traceable to undocumented preprocessing steps in original paper
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Single-VAE baseline**: Train on SDv2 VAE reconstructions, test on SDv2-generated images vs. other generators to quantify overfitting magnitude.
  2. **Preprocessing ablation**: Train two models—on clean data vs. JPEG-compressed data—then test both on clean and compressed images to confirm feature destruction.
  3. **Frequency masking**: Apply low-pass filter to test images and observe performance drop to verify high-frequency dependency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The lightweight test dataset may not fully capture real-world AIGC distribution diversity
- Analysis relies on visual frequency-domain comparisons rather than quantitative spectral measurements
- Cross-generator performance confidence intervals remain broad due to limited generator diversity in experiments

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mechanisms 1 and 3 regarding VAE-induced artifacts and preprocessing effects are empirically supported with clear visual evidence and reproducible results
- **Medium Confidence**: Mechanism 2 about high-frequency features being primary discriminative signals is well-supported but lacks quantitative spectral analysis to confirm frequency-specific importance thresholds
- **Medium Confidence**: The general reproducibility problem in AIGC detection literature is supported by paper analysis, but specific case studies of omitted preprocessing details would strengthen this claim

## Next Checks
1. **Quantitative Spectral Analysis**: Apply discrete Fourier transforms with power spectral density calculations to precisely measure high-frequency energy differences between real, VAE-reconstructed, and generated images across multiple generators.
2. **Controlled Preprocessing Experiment**: Systematically vary JPEG quality factors and Gaussian kernel sizes in a factorial design, measuring detection accuracy degradation curves to establish exact feature destruction thresholds.
3. **Cross-Generator Generalization Study**: Train detectors on multiple VAEs simultaneously and test on held-out generators, measuring accuracy recovery rates compared to single-VAE models to quantify the benefit of architectural diversity in training.
