# Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Networks for Linear Inverse problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.13827
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13827
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a Bayesian framework for Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applied to linear inverse problems.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BPINN (Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Networks), a novel framework that integrates Bayesian inference with PINN methodology for solving linear inverse problems. The approach extends traditional PINNs by providing probabilistic solutions that naturally incorporate prior knowledge and quantify uncertainty. The framework is developed for both supervised scenarios with labeled training data and unsupervised cases where only measurement data is available, offering a generalized probabilistic interpretation of inverse problem solutions.

## Method Summary
The BPINN framework combines Bayesian inference with PINNs through a physics-informed loss function that balances data fidelity terms with physics constraints. For supervised training, the method derives posterior distributions for both unknown variables and neural network parameters using labeled data. In unsupervised scenarios, it handles cases with only measurement data available. The approach provides natural uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions while maintaining the physics constraints inherent to PINNs. The framework generalizes deterministic PINN approaches and offers theoretical foundations for implementation, though practical challenges remain regarding neural network architecture selection and optimization parameter tuning.

## Key Results
- The Bayesian approach provides natural incorporation of prior knowledge and uncertainty quantification
- Framework works for both supervised (labeled data) and unsupervised (measurement-only) training scenarios
- Physics-informed loss function combines data fidelity with physics constraints
- Generalizes deterministic PINN approaches to probabilistic solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Bayesian framework works by treating unknown parameters as random variables with prior distributions, then updating these through Bayes' theorem using both measurement data and physics constraints. The PINN component enforces physical laws through the loss function, ensuring solutions satisfy governing equations. The combination allows for principled uncertainty quantification while maintaining physical consistency, which is particularly valuable for ill-posed inverse problems where multiple solutions may exist.

## Foundational Learning
- Linear inverse problems: Fundamental mathematical framework for reconstruction problems; needed to understand the problem class being addressed; quick check: verify understanding of ill-posedness and regularization concepts.
- Bayesian inference: Statistical framework for updating beliefs with evidence; needed to grasp how prior knowledge combines with data; quick check: confirm understanding of posterior distributions and priors.
- Physics Informed Neural Networks: Neural network approach incorporating physical laws; needed to understand the PINN foundation; quick check: verify understanding of how physics constraints enter the loss function.
- Uncertainty quantification: Methods for measuring confidence in predictions; needed to appreciate the probabilistic outputs; quick check: understand credible intervals and posterior distributions.
- Posterior inference: Computational methods for estimating posterior distributions; needed to understand practical implementation challenges; quick check: familiarity with sampling methods or variational inference.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Prior distributions -> Likelihood function -> Posterior inference -> Neural network training -> Physics constraints -> Solution with uncertainty
Critical path: Data + Physics constraints -> Loss function formulation -> Bayesian inference -> Network optimization -> Solution extraction
Design tradeoffs: Computational complexity vs. uncertainty quantification accuracy; prior specification vs. data-driven learning; neural network expressiveness vs. physical interpretability
Failure signatures: Poor convergence indicating mismatched priors or inadequate network capacity; overconfident uncertainty estimates suggesting prior-data conflict; violation of physical constraints indicating optimization issues
First experiments: 1) Simple linear inverse problem with known solution to verify framework correctness, 2) Comparison with deterministic PINN on benchmark problem, 3) Sensitivity analysis of uncertainty estimates to prior specification
