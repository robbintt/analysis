core_contribution: We propose a lightweight input adapter for F5-TTS that enables
  Romanian speech synthesis by replacing the character embedding layer with a trainable
  ConvNeXt module, allowing the model to map Romanian text into a continuous input
  space while keeping core weights frozen. Evaluated on 20 native speakers across
  speaker similarity, pronunciation/naturalness, and code-switching tasks, the model
  achieved high speaker similarity and competitive naturalness scores, though occasional
  English accent traits were noted.

# F5-TTS-RO: Extending F5-TTS to Romanian TTS via Lightweight Input Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.12297
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12297
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Primary result**: Lightweight ConvNeXt input adapter enables Romanian TTS with frozen core weights, achieving high speaker similarity and competitive naturalness scores

## Executive Summary
F5-TTS-RO introduces a lightweight input adapter for extending the F5-TTS model to Romanian speech synthesis. The approach replaces the character embedding layer with a trainable ConvNeXt module while keeping core weights frozen, allowing the model to map Romanian text into a continuous input space. Evaluated by 20 native speakers across speaker similarity, pronunciation/naturalness, and code-switching tasks, the model achieved high speaker similarity and competitive naturalness scores, though occasional English accent traits were noted. The method reduces catastrophic forgetting risk and enables partial code-switching, though further work is needed on cross-language representation alignment and automated language switch detection.

## Method Summary
The method involves creating a lightweight input adapter by replacing the character embedding layer of F5-TTS with a trainable ConvNeXt module. This adapter learns to map Romanian text into a continuous input space while the core model weights remain frozen. The ConvNeXt architecture processes character sequences to produce representations compatible with the existing F5-TTS architecture, enabling Romanian synthesis without retraining the entire model. This approach preserves voice cloning capabilities and reduces computational overhead compared to full fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Achieved high speaker similarity scores across evaluation dimensions with 20 native Romanian speakers
- Demonstrated lower word error rates (5.27%) compared to MMS-TTS-RON (5.77%)
- Better speaker similarity than fully fine-tuned F5-TTS while preserving voice cloning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ConvNeXt module learns cross-linguistic representations by mapping Romanian text characters into a continuous space that the frozen English-trained F5-TTS core can process. This approach leverages the pre-trained model's understanding of phonetic patterns while adapting to Romanian's specific orthographic-to-phonetic mapping rules. The frozen core weights prevent catastrophic forgetting of English synthesis capabilities while the trainable adapter learns language-specific transformations.

## Foundational Learning
- **ConvNeXt Architecture**: Modern vision transformer variant adapted for sequence processing - needed for learning robust character representations; quick check: verify receptive field covers full word context
- **Phonetic Alignment**: Mapping orthographic characters to phonetic representations - needed for accurate pronunciation; quick check: test with minimal pairs and rare phonemes
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Phenomenon where model forgets previous knowledge during fine-tuning - needed to justify frozen weights approach; quick check: evaluate English synthesis quality post-adaptation
- **Cross-linguistic Representation Learning**: Adapting models between related languages - needed for Romanian synthesis from English model; quick check: test with code-switching examples
- **MOS Evaluation Methodology**: Mean Opinion Score for subjective quality assessment - needed for human evaluation; quick check: verify inter-rater reliability across evaluators

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Romanian Text -> ConvNeXt Adapter -> Frozen F5-TTS Core -> Audio Output
- **Critical Path**: Text input flows through ConvNeXt adapter for representation transformation before reaching frozen F5-TTS core for synthesis
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Frozen core preserves English capabilities but limits adaptation to language-specific suprasegmental features
- **Failure Signatures**: English accent traits in Romanian speech, difficulty with code-switching, potential loss of subtle phonetic distinctions
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test adapter with synthetic Romanian text containing known problematic phonetic patterns 2) Evaluate English synthesis quality retention 3) Measure adapter training convergence with varying learning rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Input adaptation may not generalize to languages with significantly different phonetic structures or writing systems
- Occasional emergence of English accent traits suggests incomplete phonetic decoupling
- Absence of automated language switch detection limits practical code-switching utility

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Lightweight input adapter enables Romanian TTS while preserving voice cloning capabilities (supported by MOS ratings and WER comparisons)
- **Medium Confidence**: Approach reduces catastrophic forgetting risk compared to full fine-tuning (plausible given frozen core weights but needs longitudinal verification)
- **Low Confidence**: Enables "partial code-switching" (theoretical possibility requiring manual segmentation, not practical feature)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Linguistic Transfer Test**: Evaluate F5-TTS-RO adapter on a third language (Romance vs. non-Romance) to assess generalization
2. **Longitudinal Stability Assessment**: Extended training with periodic synthesis tests in both Romanian and English to verify catastrophic forgetting prevention
3. **Automated Code-Switching Implementation**: Develop and evaluate automated language identification module integrated with TTS pipeline for seamless code-switching
