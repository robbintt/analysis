# Exploration vs. Fixation: Scaffolding Divergent and Convergent Thinking for Human-AI Co-Creation with Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18388
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18388
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Structured divergent-convergent workflow improves creativity support and novelty vs. baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of design fixation in human-AI co-creation, where users prematurely settle on initial results rather than exploring broader creative spaces. The authors propose a structured workflow based on Wallas's creativity model that explicitly scaffolds divergent thinking (conceptual exploration) and convergent thinking (refinement) stages. Their HAIExplore system implements this through a brainstorming stage for generating diverse high-level ideas using associative thinking prompts, followed by a refinement stage with interpretable parameters for controllable iteration. A within-subjects study (N=12) comparing HAIExplore to ChatGPT for poster design demonstrated significant improvements in creativity support, system usability, and novelty of final images.

## Method Summary
The authors implemented HAIExplore as a two-stage system: a brainstorming stage for divergent thinking that generates diverse high-level ideas through associative thinking prompts, and a refinement stage for convergent thinking that provides interpretable parameters and options for controllable iteration. The system is grounded in Wallas's model of creativity, which emphasizes the importance of separating exploration from refinement. A within-subjects study with 12 participants compared HAIExplore to ChatGPT for poster design tasks, measuring creativity support, usability, and novelty of outcomes through both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback.

## Key Results
- HAIExplore significantly improved creativity support metrics (Enjoyment p=0.0034, Exploration p=0.0029, Results Worth Effort p=0.0137)
- System usability was significantly better (p=0.0059) compared to ChatGPT baseline
- Novelty of final images was significantly higher (p=0.004) with HAIExplore
- Participants reported significantly higher perceived learning (p=0.0059) and appreciated the structured workflow for reducing cognitive load

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by explicitly separating divergent and convergent thinking stages, preventing premature convergence on initial results. By providing structured prompts for associative thinking during the brainstorming phase, the system encourages users to explore broader conceptual spaces before committing to specific directions. The refinement stage's interpretable parameters give users controllable iteration capabilities while maintaining awareness of the broader creative space they explored. This structured workflow reduces cognitive load by providing clear guidance through the creative process, allowing users to focus on generation rather than navigation decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Wallas's creativity model**: Understanding the four-stage model (preparation, incubation, illumination, verification) is essential for structuring the divergent-convergent workflow. Why needed: Provides theoretical foundation for separating exploration from refinement. Quick check: Can you map each HAIExplore stage to Wallas's model stages?
- **Design fixation**: Recognizing how early "good enough" results can prevent broader exploration is crucial for understanding the problem being solved. Why needed: Explains why unstructured workflows lead to suboptimal creative outcomes. Quick check: Can you identify fixation points in your own creative workflows?
- **Associative thinking prompts**: Understanding how prompts can guide conceptual exploration rather than specific output generation is key to the brainstorming stage. Why needed: Enables effective generation of diverse high-level ideas. Quick check: Can you create prompts that encourage lateral thinking rather than direct solutions?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: User -> HAIExplore (Brainstorming Stage -> Refinement Stage) -> Output
Critical path: User initiates brainstorming -> System generates diverse ideas via associative prompts -> User selects direction -> Refinement stage with interpretable parameters -> Final output generation
Design tradeoffs: Structured workflow vs. flexibility, guided exploration vs. user autonomy, complexity vs. learnability
Failure signatures: Users skipping brainstorming stage, over-reliance on initial ideas, difficulty understanding parameter relationships
First experiments: 1) Test if users naturally skip brainstorming when given option, 2) Measure parameter understanding through concept mapping tasks, 3) Compare exploration breadth with and without associative prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Sample size of 12 participants limits generalizability, particularly across different creative backgrounds and AI tool experience levels
- Focus on poster design as single application domain restricts understanding of transferability to other creative contexts
- Study measured perceived learning and enjoyment but not long-term retention of prompting skills or independent application capabilities
- Claims about reduced cognitive load are based on self-reports rather than objective cognitive measures

## Confidence
- Effectiveness of structured workflow: High
- Statistical significance of results: High
- Generalizability to other creative domains: Medium
- Long-term skill transfer: Low

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with a larger, more diverse sample (N≥30) including participants with varying levels of creative experience and AI tool familiarity.
2. Test the HAIExplore approach across multiple creative domains (e.g., product design, writing, music composition) to assess domain transferability.
3. Conduct a longitudinal study to measure retention and independent application of prompting techniques 4-6 weeks after initial training.
