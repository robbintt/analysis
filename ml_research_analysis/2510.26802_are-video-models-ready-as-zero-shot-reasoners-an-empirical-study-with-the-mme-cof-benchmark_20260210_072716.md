# Are Video Models Ready as Zero-Shot Reasoners? An Empirical Study with the MME-CoF Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.26802
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26802
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Current video generation models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Kling, Seedance) show promise on short-horizon spatial and local dynamics reasoning but remain unreliable as standalone zero-shot visual reasoners, particularly for long-horizon causal reasoning and strict geometric constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art video generation models can serve as zero-shot visual reasoners through Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. The authors evaluate four leading models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Kling-v1, Seedance-1.0-pro) across 12 reasoning dimensions using the MME-COF benchmark, which comprises 59 curated tasks from multiple reasoning-oriented datasets. Through qualitative assessment and automated evaluation, the study reveals that while video models demonstrate competence in short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. The findings suggest that current video models are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners but show encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates video generation models on zero-shot Chain-of-Frame reasoning across 12 dimensions including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic. The authors curate the MME-COF benchmark, comprising 59 tasks derived from existing datasets (V*Bench, ChartQA, MMMU, etc.) and expert-designed cases. Each model generates 6 videos per prompt at 1280×720 resolution, 24 FPS, 8 seconds duration. Evaluation employs qualitative assessment (Good/Moderate/Bad) and quantitative success rates, complemented by automated scoring via Gemini-2.5-Pro on five metrics: Instruction Alignment, Temporal Consistency, Visual Stability, Content Fidelity, and Focus Relevance. The study uses a unified prompt style with static camera constraints and explicit requirements.

## Key Results
- Video models demonstrate strong performance on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics
- Models fail significantly on long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic tasks
- Veo-3 shows the most balanced performance across reasoning dimensions, though all models exhibit similar failure patterns
- Automated evaluation via Gemini-2.5-Pro correlates with qualitative assessments but may be susceptible to visual aesthetics
- Models consistently prioritize visual plausibility over precise spatial reasoning and geometric correctness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Video models trained on large-scale video-text pairs learn to generate temporally coherent sequences that capture short-term visual relationships and dynamics. The Chain-of-Frame reasoning approach leverages the models' inherent ability to maintain local consistency across frames, making them effective for tasks requiring immediate spatial coherence and basic physical plausibility. However, the training objectives prioritize visual realism and temporal smoothness over strict logical or geometric adherence, leading to pattern-driven rather than principle-driven reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning**: Understanding that video models can be evaluated for reasoning by examining temporal coherence across frames; needed to assess reasoning capability beyond single-frame generation
- **Zero-shot evaluation methodology**: Assessing model reasoning without fine-tuning or adaptation; needed to determine inherent reasoning capabilities
- **Qualitative assessment framework**: Categorizing outputs into Good/Moderate/Bad levels; needed for systematic evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks
- **Automated video evaluation**: Using LLM-based scoring for temporal consistency and instruction alignment; needed for scalable assessment of video outputs
- **Static camera constraint enforcement**: Evaluating models' ability to maintain fixed viewpoints; needed to isolate reasoning from camera motion artifacts
- **Long-horizon vs. short-horizon reasoning**: Distinguishing between immediate coherence and multi-step planning; needed to identify capability boundaries

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Video Model (Veo-3/Sora-2/Kling/Seedance) -> Chain-of-Frame Reasoning -> MME-COF Benchmark -> Qualitative + Automated Evaluation (Gemini-2.5-Pro)

**Critical Path**: Prompt generation -> Video model inference -> Multi-sample generation (6 videos) -> Qualitative assessment -> Automated scoring -> Success rate calculation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Zero-shot evaluation vs. fine-tuned performance; visual plausibility vs. geometric precision; automated vs. human evaluation; sample size (6 videos) vs. computational cost

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Model ignores static shot constraint (camera drift)
- Local coherence maintained but long-horizon reasoning fails
- Visual plausibility prioritized over geometric correctness
- Pattern-driven outputs that look reasonable but violate instructions

**First Experiments**:
1. Generate sample videos from one MME-COF task across all four models to observe baseline performance differences
2. Test static camera constraint adherence by evaluating camera motion in outputs
3. Compare success rates between single-step and multi-step tasks within the same reasoning category

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How can video models be effectively integrated as "complementary visual engines" with dedicated reasoning models to overcome standalone limitations?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states that while models are not standalone reasoners, they exhibit "encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models."
- Why unresolved: The study strictly evaluates zero-shot generation in isolation and does not define or test an architecture for collaborative reasoning between video generators and external logic modules.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks of a hybrid system (e.g., a Video Model coupled with an LLM verifier) on the MME-CoF benchmark compared to standalone baselines.

**Open Question 2**: Can specific training interventions or loss functions mitigate the model's bias toward visual plausibility over geometric or physical correctness?
- Basis in paper: The analysis notes that models "prioritize visual plausibility over precise spatial reasoning" and often generate "plausible but instructionally flawed outputs" (Section 5), suggesting a fundamental conflict in current training objectives.
- Why unresolved: The paper characterizes the failure modes (e.g., pattern-driven vs. principle-driven) but does not investigate whether this bias can be corrected without degrading visual fidelity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing standard video generation models against those trained with explicit constraint-aware loss functions on tasks requiring strict geometric adherence.

**Open Question 3**: To what extent does the reliance on Gemini-2.5-Pro as an automated verifier bias the assessment of "reasoning" quality?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.3 employs Gemini-2.5-Pro to score reasoning, but the paper also demonstrates that high-fidelity visuals often mask logical errors, raising the possibility that the verifier may be similarly deceived by visual aesthetics.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation protocol assumes the verifier is a robust ground truth for "reasoning," a capability that is notoriously difficult for current LLMs to assess reliably in visual contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis between human expert evaluations and Gemini-2.5-Pro scores on the "Bad" vs. "Moderate" boundary cases in the MME-CoF benchmark.

## Limitations
- Restricted access to core models (Veo-3, Sora-2) and the MME-COF benchmark itself limits reproducibility
- Qualitative assessment introduces subjectivity despite automation
- Sample size of 6 videos per prompt may be insufficient for stable success-rate estimates
- Benchmark's focus on image-based prompts may not fully exercise video models' temporal reasoning strengths

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The finding that video models show competence in short-horizon spatial and local dynamics reasoning is well-supported by qualitative examples and consistent across multiple models.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that models fail on long-horizon causal reasoning is plausible but depends heavily on specific tasks in MME-COF; without access to full benchmark, independent verification is difficult.

**Low confidence**: The relative ranking between models (e.g., Veo-3 vs. Sora-2) is difficult to validate without direct access to both APIs and exact evaluation pipeline.

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Reconstruction**: Recreate a subset of MME-COF tasks using open-source datasets (V*Bench, ChartQA) and apply paper's prompt templates to test whether observed failure modes (long-horizon reasoning, geometric constraints) replicate with accessible models.

2. **Alternative Model Comparison**: Evaluate a publicly available video model (e.g., HunyuanVideo, SVD) on the same task subset to establish baseline and determine whether limitations are model-specific or general to current video generation.

3. **Evaluation Protocol Replication**: Implement the Gemini-2.5-Pro automated scoring pipeline with small test set to verify that 5-metric rubric produces consistent results across raters and aligns with paper's qualitative labels.
