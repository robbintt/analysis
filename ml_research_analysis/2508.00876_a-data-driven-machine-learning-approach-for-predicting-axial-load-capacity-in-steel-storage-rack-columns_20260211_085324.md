# A Data-Driven Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Axial Load Capacity in Steel Storage Rack Columns

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.00876
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00876
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Gradient Boosting Regression achieved R² of 0.97 on predicting axial load capacity of cold-formed steel storage rack columns

## Executive Summary
This study presents a machine learning framework to predict the axial load capacity of cold-formed steel storage rack columns using experimental data. The researchers curated a dataset of 261 samples, each characterized by ten geometric and material parameters, and evaluated multiple regression models. Gradient Boosting Regression emerged as the most accurate model, achieving an R² of 0.97 on validation data. The framework includes feature selection, model training, interpretability analysis through SHAP, and deployment as an interactive web interface using Streamlit.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed a comprehensive approach beginning with dataset curation of 261 experimental samples from existing literature on cold-formed steel storage rack columns. They performed preprocessing to remove non-informative features and handle missing values. Multiple regression models were evaluated including linear models, kernel-based regressors, and ensemble methods using cross-validation. Gradient Boosting Regression was selected as the best performer. The model's interpretability was enhanced through SHAP analysis to identify key influencing features. The framework was deployed as an interactive web interface using Streamlit for real-time predictions. The model was validated with independent experimental data, confirming robustness with an R² of 0.96.

## Key Results
- Gradient Boosting Regression achieved R² of 0.97 on validation set with low RMSE and MAE values
- SHAP analysis identified length, thickness, cross-sectional area, and width as most influential features
- Independent validation on separate experimental data confirmed model robustness with R² of 0.96
- Interactive web interface enables real-time predictions without programming expertise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works because it combines comprehensive feature engineering with powerful ensemble learning methods. The dataset captures essential geometric and material parameters that directly influence structural behavior. Gradient Boosting Regression excels at capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between features while being robust to overfitting through its sequential learning approach. The SHAP analysis provides interpretability by quantifying feature contributions to predictions, making the model transparent for engineering applications.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gradient Boosting Regression:** Sequential ensemble method that builds models iteratively to correct previous errors - needed for capturing complex non-linear relationships in structural data
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Game-theoretic approach to explain individual predictions by computing feature contributions - needed for interpretability in safety-critical engineering applications
- **Cross-validation:** Technique for assessing model performance by partitioning data into training and validation sets - needed to ensure model generalizes well beyond training data
- **Feature selection:** Process of identifying and removing non-informative or redundant features - needed to improve model efficiency and reduce overfitting risk
- **Streamlit deployment:** Python framework for creating interactive web applications - needed to make the model accessible to users without programming expertise

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Collection -> Preprocessing -> Model Training -> SHAP Analysis -> Web Interface Deployment

**Critical Path:** The most critical sequence is Data Collection → Preprocessing → Model Training → Validation, as errors in early stages propagate through the entire pipeline and compromise prediction accuracy.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study prioritized model accuracy over computational efficiency by selecting Gradient Boosting Regression, which provides superior predictive performance but requires more training time than simpler models. The small dataset size necessitated careful cross-validation to prevent overfitting.

**Failure Signatures:** Model underperformance typically manifests as increased prediction errors for columns with extreme geometric ratios or material properties not well-represented in the training data. The 261-sample dataset may limit generalizability to configurations outside the observed parameter space.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test model performance on columns with width-to-thickness ratios exceeding those in the training set
2. Evaluate prediction accuracy for different steel grades not included in the original dataset
3. Assess model robustness by introducing measurement noise to input parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relatively small dataset (261 samples) may restrict model generalizability to all possible column configurations
- Reliance on experimental data introduces inherent variability and measurement uncertainties
- Model specifically developed for cold-formed steel storage rack columns, limiting applicability to other steel structures
- Potential overfitting risk given the dataset size relative to the number of features evaluated

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Model accuracy for cold-formed steel storage rack columns | High |
| Generalizability to broader structural applications | Medium |
| Interpretability through SHAP analysis | High |

## Next Checks
1. Expand the dataset by incorporating additional experimental data from diverse sources to enhance the model's robustness and generalizability
2. Validate the model's performance on a separate, independent dataset of cold-formed steel storage rack columns not included in the original training set
3. Test the model's applicability to other types of steel structures, such as hot-rolled steel columns, to assess its broader utility in structural engineering
