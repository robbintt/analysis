core_contribution: The study introduced a pipeline integrating generative large language
  models (LLMs) with clinical expert knowledge to detect multiple diseases from electronic
  health records (EHRs) without manual data labeling. Using prompts based on clinical
  diagnosis, treatment, and guidelines, the pipeline processed clinical notes to identify
  acute myocardial infarction, diabetes, and hypertension.

# Integrating Large Language Models with Human Expertise for Disease Detection in Electronic Health Records

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.00053
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00053
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: A pipeline integrating generative LLMs with clinical expertise detected acute myocardial infarction, diabetes, and hypertension from EHR clinical notes with high sensitivity (88-94%) and negative predictive value, outperforming traditional ICD-10 methods for diabetes.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a novel pipeline that integrates generative large language models with clinical expert knowledge to detect multiple diseases from electronic health records without requiring manual data labeling. The approach uses prompts based on clinical diagnosis, treatment, and guidelines to process clinical notes and identify acute myocardial infarction, diabetes, and hypertension. The method demonstrated strong performance with high sensitivity and negative predictive value across all studied conditions, particularly excelling in diabetes detection compared to traditional ICD-10 coding methods.

## Method Summary
The pipeline leverages generative large language models combined with clinical expertise to detect diseases from EHR clinical notes. Rather than relying on manual labeling, the system uses carefully crafted prompts based on clinical diagnosis, treatment protocols, and clinical guidelines to process unstructured clinical text. The approach was specifically designed to identify three conditions: acute myocardial infarction, diabetes, and hypertension, making it suitable for scalable, real-time disease surveillance in healthcare systems.

## Key Results
- Achieved high sensitivity (88-94%) and negative predictive value across acute myocardial infarction, diabetes, and hypertension detection
- Outperformed traditional ICD-10 coding methods, with particularly strong performance for diabetes detection
- Demonstrated the potential for scalable, real-time disease surveillance using clinical notes without manual labeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline succeeds by leveraging the pattern recognition capabilities of large language models while grounding their outputs in clinical expertise. By using prompts based on established clinical diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols, and clinical guidelines, the system can extract relevant disease indicators from unstructured clinical notes. This approach avoids the limitations of traditional ICD-10 coding while maintaining clinical accuracy through expert-informed prompts.

## Foundational Learning
- Clinical note processing: Understanding how to extract structured disease information from unstructured clinical text is essential for EHR-based surveillance systems
- Prompt engineering for healthcare: Crafting effective prompts based on clinical guidelines ensures the LLM outputs align with medical standards
- Integration of clinical expertise: Combining LLM capabilities with human clinical knowledge creates more reliable disease detection than either approach alone

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Clinical Notes -> Prompt Engine -> LLM -> Disease Detection Output

Critical Path: Clinical Notes → Prompt Engineering → LLM Processing → Disease Classification → Validation

Design Tradeoffs: The system trades structured data completeness for the flexibility of processing unstructured clinical notes, which may miss some diagnostic information but allows for real-time processing without manual labeling

Failure Signatures: Potential failures include missing critical diagnostic information not captured in clinical notes, variability in documentation practices across institutions, and limitations in detecting rare diseases or complex diagnostic scenarios

First Experiments:
1. Test the pipeline on a diverse dataset from multiple healthcare institutions to assess generalizability
2. Compare performance against traditional clinical decision support systems using standardized benchmark datasets
3. Evaluate detection accuracy for rare diseases and conditions requiring complex clinical reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Performance was validated on a single institutional dataset, raising questions about generalizability to diverse healthcare systems
- Reliance on clinical notes alone may miss diagnostic information commonly captured in structured EHR fields
- Evaluation focused on three common conditions, leaving unclear how the approach scales to rare diseases or complex diagnostic scenarios

## Confidence

**Major Claims Confidence:**
- High confidence: The pipeline can achieve strong sensitivity and NPV for the studied conditions using clinical notes and LLM-based prompts
- Medium confidence: The approach outperforms traditional ICD-10 methods specifically for diabetes detection
- Low confidence: The method will maintain similar performance when deployed across diverse healthcare systems and for a broader range of diseases

## Next Checks

1. External validation across multiple healthcare systems with different EHR platforms and clinical documentation practices to assess generalizability
2. Head-to-head comparison with established clinical decision support systems using standardized datasets to benchmark performance
3. Evaluation of the pipeline's performance on rare diseases and conditions requiring complex clinical reasoning beyond the three studied conditions
