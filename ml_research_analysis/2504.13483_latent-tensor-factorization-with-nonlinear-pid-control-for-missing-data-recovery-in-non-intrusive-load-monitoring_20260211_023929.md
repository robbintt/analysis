# Latent Tensor Factorization with Nonlinear PID Control for Missing Data Recovery in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.13483
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13483
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: NPIL model achieves significant reductions in RMSE and MAE for missing NILM data prediction compared to state-of-the-art models.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of recovering missing data in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) systems by proposing a Nonlinear Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)-Incorporated Latent Factorization of Tensors (NPIL) model. NILM data often suffers from missing values due to sensor failures, leading to inaccuracies in monitoring and decomposition. The NPIL model leverages nonlinear PID control principles to rebuild instant learning errors by incorporating past update information, thereby enhancing the learning scheme. Experimental results on real-world NILM datasets (iAWE and UK-DALE) demonstrate that the NPIL model outperforms state-of-the-art models in both convergence rate and accuracy for predicting missing NILM data.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach for missing data recovery in NILM by modeling the data as a High-Dimensional Incomplete (HDI) tensor and applying Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition. The key innovation is the integration of a nonlinear PID controller into the optimization process, which modifies the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) update by incorporating proportional, integral, and derivative terms of the error. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to adaptively tune the nine PID gain parameters, improving computational efficiency. The method is evaluated on real-world NILM datasets (iAWE and UK-DALE) with varying levels of missing data density.

## Key Results
- NPIL model achieves significant reductions in RMSE and MAE compared to state-of-the-art models for missing NILM data prediction.
- The model demonstrates superior performance in handling sparse data, with graceful degradation as data density decreases.
- NPIL shows improved convergence rates compared to standard optimization methods like SGD.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Integrating historical gradient information via a nonlinear error function accelerates convergence over standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
- **Mechanism:** Standard SGD updates weights based solely on the current stochastic gradient, lacking "memory." The NPIL model reconstructs the instant learning error ($\tilde{e}_{ijk}$) by summing proportional (current error), integral (accumulated past errors), and derivative (future error trend) terms. This effectively adds momentum and damping to the search trajectory, allowing it to traverse flat regions and dampen oscillations.
- **Core assumption:** The optimization landscape of the Latent Factorization of Tensors (LFT) model benefits from the stability and response characteristics of control theory feedback loops.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "rebuilding the instant learning error... past update information is efficiently incorporated"
  - [section III.A] Equation 10 defines the adjusted instantaneous error $\tilde{e}_{ijk}$ using $K_p, K_i, K_d$ terms.
  - [corpus] Paper 20573 ("Water Quality Data Imputation...") confirms PID-based optimizers are being actively explored for tensor factorization to improve convergence speed.
- **Break condition:** If the time-series data lacks temporal dependency (i.i.d.), the integral and derivative terms may introduce noise rather than signal, failing to improve upon standard SGD.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Adaptive gain tuning via Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) prevents the need for manual PID parameter configuration and enhances computational efficiency.
- **Mechanism:** The nonlinear PID controller requires nine specific gain parameters ($K_{p1\dots3}, K_{i1\dots2}, K_{d1\dots4}$). The model employs PSO to search the parameter space for these gains, optimizing a fitness function based on estimation error. This automates the balancing of the P, I, and D contributions.
- **Core assumption:** The computational cost of running PSO is offset by the drastic reduction in training iterations (convergence speed) achieved by the optimized gains.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "implementing gain parameter adaptation by utilizing particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm"
  - [section III.B] Equations 12-15 detail the position and velocity updates for the particle swarm seeking optimal gains.
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence for PSO in this specific NILM context is weak (neighbors focus on Deep Learning/ResNet), suggesting this specific combination is a novel contribution of this paper rather than a standard industry practice.
- **Break condition:** If the swarm size or iteration count is too low, PSO may converge to suboptimal gains, causing the PID controller to oscillate or stagnate.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Modeling NILM data as a High-Dimensional Incomplete (HDI) tensor preserves spatiotemporal structure better than matrix methods.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of flattening data into a matrix, the method builds a third-order tensor (Time x Parameter x Day). It applies Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition to approximate this tensor using latent factor matrices. This maintains the relationships between different time points and electrical parameters explicitly.
- **Core assumption:** The missing data is not random noise but follows a low-rank structure that can be captured by the latent factors.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section I] "LFT model... can model the spatiotemporal incomplete data into a high-dimensional incomplete tensor"
  - [section II.A] Figure 2 and Equation 2 illustrate the reconstruction of the tensor from rank-one outer products.
- **Break condition:** If the tensor rank $R$ is set too low, the model cannot capture complex device interactions; if too high, it overfits to sensor noise.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Latent Factorization of Tensors (LFT)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the base architecture. You must understand how a sparse 3D tensor (NILM data) is approximated by the product of three dense matrices (latent factors) to understand what the PID controller is actually optimizing.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how Equation 2 reconstructs a single data point $y_{ijk}$ using the latent matrices $A, B,$ and $C$?

- **Concept: Nonlinear PID Control**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core innovation. Standard PID is linear; this paper uses nonlinear functions (Equation 4) to map gains based on error magnitude. Understanding the difference between P (present), I (past), and D (future) terms is crucial for debugging convergence.
  - **Quick check question:** In Equation 10, which term is responsible for eliminating steady-state error (static bias), and which term predicts future error trends?

- **Concept: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the meta-optimizer. Since tuning 9 PID gains manually is infeasible, PSO is used. You need to know how particles update their "velocity" and "position" based on personal and global bests to understand how the hyperparameters evolve.
  - **Quick check question:** According to Equation 14, what two pieces of information guide a particle's movement toward the optimal gain parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Tensor $\mathcal{Y}$ -> Latent Factorization (LFT) -> Nonlinear PID Controller -> PSO Tuner -> Output Predictions
- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize Latent Matrices randomly.
  2. Initialize PSO particles with random gain parameters.
  3. **Inner Loop (Training):** For each known entry in $\mathcal{Y}$, calculate error $e_{ijk}$. Reconstruct error to $\tilde{e}_{ijk}$ using current PID gains. Update latent factors using $\tilde{e}_{ijk}$.
  4. **Outer Loop (Meta-optimization):** Evaluate fitness of current gains. Update particle velocities/positions in PSO space to propose new gains.
  5. Repeat until convergence.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Speed vs. Stability:** The derivative term in PID speeds up convergence but can amplify noise.
  - **Accuracy vs. Computation:** PSO adaptation (Section III.B) improves accuracy significantly but adds computational overhead; however, the paper claims the total time cost is lower due to fewer required iterations (Section IV).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Oscillating Loss:** Likely $K_d$ (derivative gain) is too high, or $K_i$ (integral) is accumulating uncorrected bias.
  - **Stagnant Loss (Flat Line):** $K_p$ may be too small, or PSO particles are trapped in a local optimum.
  - **Exploding Gradients:** Nonlinear gain functions (Equation 4) may be outputting excessively large values for small errors.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Replication:** Implement standard LFT with SGD (Equation 9) on the iAWE dataset to establish the baseline RMSE and convergence speed.
  2. **Ablation Study (Linear vs. Nonlinear):** Implement the PID controller with fixed linear gains vs. the nonlinear gain mapping (Equation 4) to verify the specific contribution of the nonlinearity.
  3. **Density Stress Test:** Run the full NPIL model on the UK-DALE dataset at 5%, 10%, and 15% density to reproduce the result that NPIL degrades gracefully (Table III) compared to standard methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can incorporating advanced controllers beyond nonlinear PID (e.g., adaptive or robust controllers) further improve the convergence rate and estimation accuracy for missing NILM data?
- Can fuzzy logic-based hyperparameter adaptation outperform the implemented Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method in tuning gain parameters for this model?
- How does the NPIL model's performance generalize to High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) tensors in domains other than energy, such as recommendation systems or traffic analysis?

## Limitations
- The reported RMSE values are extremely low, strongly suggesting that data normalization is applied but not explicitly detailed in the paper.
- The efficiency of the PSO evaluation loop is unclear, with a reported computational time of 10 seconds that seems implausibly fast for the full training procedure.
- The specific implementation details of the nonlinear PID gain functions and PSO parameter ranges, while provided, depend heavily on correct data preprocessing.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core theoretical mechanism of integrating PID control into the SGD update (Mechanism 1) is well-defined in the equations and supported by literature on PID-based optimization. The tensor factorization approach (Mechanism 3) is a standard and well-documented method.
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific implementation details of the nonlinear PID gain functions (Equation 4) and the PSO parameter ranges are provided, but the practical impact of these choices depends heavily on the correct handling of the normalization and evaluation loop.
- **Low Confidence:** The claimed computational efficiency gain (PSO reducing total training time) is difficult to verify without access to the exact PSO implementation details and the precise definition of "10 seconds" in the context of the full training procedure.

## Next Checks
1. **Normalization Verification:** Re-implement the data preprocessing pipeline to confirm that the raw iAWE and UK-DALE data must be normalized (e.g., Min-Max scaling to [0,1]) to achieve RMSE values in the reported range (0.02-0.03). This is the most critical step for matching the paper's quantitative results.
2. **Convergence Rate Validation:** Run a controlled ablation study comparing the standard LFT-SGD model against the NPIL model on a small subset of the iAWE data. Measure and compare the number of iterations required to reach a fixed convergence threshold (e.g., 10^-4) to empirically verify the claim that the PID controller accelerates convergence.
3. **PSO Gain Stability Test:** Implement the PSO loop to search for the 9 PID gain parameters. After convergence, fix the optimal gains and re-run the full training procedure multiple times to ensure the model's performance is stable and not an artifact of a lucky PSO initialization.
