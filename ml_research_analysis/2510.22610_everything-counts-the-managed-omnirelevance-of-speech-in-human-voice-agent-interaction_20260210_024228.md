# Everything counts: the managed omnirelevance of speech in 'human - voice agent' interaction

- Humans must actively manage their speech to avoid unwanted responses from voice agents

## Executive Summary
This study examines how humans manage interactions with voice agents, revealing that any audible speech risks triggering unwanted responses from the machine. This "omnirelevance of human speech" forces users to adapt their conduct—whispering, gesturing, or designing turns to avoid detection—especially in multiparty settings. Even with advanced LLM-based agents, simple silence-based turn-taking models dominate, making human speech equally consequential as with older rule-based robots. The work highlights persistent "work to make technology work," showing that users must still learn specialized "Voice User Interface speak" to manage interruptions and maintain interaction progressivity. Praxeological continuity persists despite technological advances.

## Method Summary
The study employs conversation analysis of video-recorded interactions from 2017-2020, primarily focusing on commercial voice assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home. The methodological approach examines naturally occurring interactions to understand how users manage their conduct in voice agent interactions. The analysis tracks how participants adapt their behavior to avoid triggering unwanted agent responses, particularly in multiparty settings where turn-taking becomes more complex.

## Key Results
- Users must actively manage their conduct (whispering, gesturing, turn design) to avoid unwanted agent responses
- Omnirelevance of human speech persists even with LLM-based agents using silence-based turn-taking
- Users must learn specialized "Voice User Interface speak" to manage interruptions and maintain interaction progressivity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism operates through the fundamental design constraint that voice agents must detect speech to function, creating an omnirelevant environment where any human speech potentially triggers agent responses. This forces users to develop sophisticated strategies for managing their own speech patterns, particularly in multiparty contexts where traditional conversational norms (like overlapping speech) conflict with voice agent requirements for clear, silence-delimited turns.

## Foundational Learning
- Omnirelevance of speech: Any audible human speech risks triggering agent responses; critical for understanding user adaptation strategies
- Turn-taking adaptation: Users modify traditional conversational patterns to accommodate voice agent limitations; quick check: observe how users handle overlapping speech
- Voice User Interface speak: Specialized communication patterns users develop to interact with voice agents; why needed: to manage interruptions and maintain progressivity

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Human speaker -> Voice agent detection -> Agent response -> Interaction progression
Critical path: User speech detection → Agent interpretation → Response generation → User adaptation
Design tradeoffs: Agent responsiveness vs. false positives; complexity of turn-taking vs. user burden
Failure signatures: Unintended agent activation, missed user commands, conversation disruption
First experiments: 1) Test agent response to overlapping speech in multiparty settings; 2) Measure false positive rates in different acoustic environments; 3) Evaluate user adaptation strategies across different agent generations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis based on 2017-2020 interactions with commercial voice assistants, limiting generalizability to newer LLM systems
- Sample size and diversity of interaction contexts remain unclear
- Limited empirical evidence from newer LLM-based systems to support claims about technological continuity

## Confidence
- Omnirelevance of human speech: High confidence based on detailed empirical examples
- User adaptation strategies (whispering, gesturing): Medium confidence from well-documented patterns
- Praxeological continuity across technologies: Lower confidence due to limited evidence from newer systems

## Next Checks
1. Systematic comparison of user conduct management strategies across different voice agent generations in controlled studies
2. Longitudinal analysis tracking how user adaptation strategies evolve as voice agents become more sophisticated
3. Cross-cultural validation of the "omnirelevance" phenomenon in diverse linguistic contexts
