# Application and Optimization of Large Models Based on Prompt Tuning for Fact-Check-Worthiness Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.18104
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18104
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: F1 score of 0.7774 and accuracy of 0.8857 using 1.5B-parameter Qwen2 model with prompt tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a prompt-tuning-based method for fact-check-worthiness estimation to combat misinformation in multilingual environments. The method employs carefully designed prompt templates combined with in-context learning and prompt tuning to enhance large language models' ability to classify claims as worthy or not worthy of fact-checking, especially when dealing with limited or unlabeled data. Experiments on a COVID-19 misinformation dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves strong performance, surpassing classical classification models and matching the performance of GPT-4 while using a smaller 1.5B-parameter local model.

## Method Summary
The method converts fact-check-worthiness classification into a text generation task using carefully designed prompt templates with "[mask]" placeholders. It employs in-context learning with demonstration examples and prompt tuning technology that trains only ~0.0009% of model parameters (71,680 out of 7.6B total). The approach uses two template types (short and long) and a substring-based verbalizer ('es' in output → "Yes") to map model outputs to binary labels. The method is evaluated on a COVID-19 tweet dataset with 22,501 training samples, 1,032 validation samples, and 318 test samples.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1 score of 0.7774 and accuracy of 0.8857 using 1.5B-parameter Qwen2 model with prompt tuning
- Outperformed classical classification models and matched GPT-4 performance while using a smaller local model
- Model performance varies significantly with parameter size and template length, with 7B-parameter models performing best
- Prompt tuning improved Qwen2-1.5B F1 from 0.5303 to 0.7774 but unexpectedly decreased Qwen2-7B performance from 0.7186 to 0.6126

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Converting fact-check-worthiness classification into a text generation task via prompt templates improves performance, particularly for smaller models.
- Mechanism: Prompt templates reframe the prediction objective from $P(y|x)$ to a fill-in-the-blank generation task, potentially aligning more closely with the model's pretraining objective and activating latent knowledge about fact-checking without requiring new classification heads.
- Core assumption: The model's pretraining corpus contains sufficient implicit knowledge about fact-checking concepts for the task reframing to be effective.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "construct effective prompt templates to convert the classification task into a text generation task"
  - [section III-B] Templates use "[mask]" placeholder; long template provides workflow context and judgment criteria
  - [corpus] Related work on prompt optimization (arXiv:2510.08524) supports task reframing benefits for classification
- Break condition: Models with insufficient pretraining on fact-checking concepts (<2B parameters) show F1 <0.50 even with templates, suggesting latent knowledge threshold required.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: In-context learning with demonstration examples improves fact-check-worthiness estimation, but performance gains do not scale monotonically with sample count.
- Mechanism: Demonstrations provide implicit task specification by showing input-output patterns, allowing the model to infer task structure without gradient updates. However, excessive examples may dilute signal or push critical information away from attended positions.
- Core assumption: The model can generalize from limited examples to unseen claims within the same domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "establish in-context learning and leverage prompt tuning technology to improve accuracy... particularly when dealing with limited or unlabeled data"
  - [section IV-D-2] GPT-4o-mini improved 21.60% with in-context learning; however, Qwen2-7B and GPT-4 showed decreased F1 as shot count increased
  - [section IV-D-2] Cites Liu et al. [16]: "performance is typically highest when key information appears at the beginning or end of the input context"
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak—no direct neighbors study in-context learning scaling limits for fact-checking
- Break condition: Performance degrades when demonstration count exceeds model's effective context utilization; observed in Qwen1.5-1.8B (F1 dropped from 0.4569 to 0.3841 from 1-shot to 10-shot).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prompt tuning (learnable soft prompts appended to input embeddings) enables smaller models to match or exceed larger model performance with minimal parameter updates.
- Mechanism: Trainable prompt parameters $P_e \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times e}$ are prepended to input embeddings, optimizing only ~0.0009% of total parameters while freezing the base model. This adapts the model's behavior without catastrophic forgetting or full fine-tuning costs.
- Core assumption: Task-specific adaptations can be encoded in a small set of continuous prompt vectors without modifying model weights.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "combining prompt engineering, in-context learning, and prompt tuning"
  - [section IV-B] Prompt tuning requires training only 71,680 parameters for Qwen2.0-7B (0.0009% of 7.6B total)
  - [section IV-D-3] Qwen2-1.5B F1 improved from 0.5303 to 0.7774 after prompt tuning, surpassing untuned Qwen1.5-7B
  - [corpus] Related work on efficient prompt optimization (arXiv:2510.08524) corroborates parameter-efficient gains for text classification
- Break condition: Prompt tuning showed negative effect on Qwen2-7B (F1 dropped from 0.7186 to 0.6126), suggesting architecture-specific sensitivity or hyperparameter mismatch.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering (Template Design)**
  - Why needed here: The method hinges on designing templates that clearly specify the task, constraints, and output format. Poorly designed templates yield unstable or unparseable outputs.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the long template outperforms the short template for 7B models but underperforms for <2B models?

- **Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**
  - Why needed here: Prompt tuning is a PEFT technique. Understanding the trade-off between trainable parameter count and performance gain is essential for resource-constrained deployment.
  - Quick check question: What percentage of the Qwen2-1.5B model parameters are actually updated during prompt tuning, and why does this matter for deployment?

- **Concept: Verbalizer Design**
  - Why needed here: Model outputs must be mapped to discrete labels. The verbalizer handles cases where the model generates unexpected tokens (e.g., "Yes, absolutely" → "Yes").
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper use substring matching ('es' in output) rather than exact match for the verbalizer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input Claim → Preprocessed text from dataset → Template Selection → Long or short template based on model capacity → Demonstration Sampler → n-shot examples from training set (optional) → Prompt Constructor → Concatenates template + demonstrations + claim → Soft Prompt Layer → Learnable parameters $P_e$ prepended to embeddings (if tuning enabled) → Base LLM → Frozen Qwen or GPT model → Verbalizer → Maps generated text to Yes/No label → Output → Final fact-check-worthiness prediction

- **Critical path:**
  Template design → Demonstration selection → Prompt construction → (Optional: Soft prompt tuning) → Model inference → Verbalizer mapping

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Template length vs. model capacity:** Long templates help 7B+ models but hurt <2B models (information overload)
  - **Shot count vs. context utilization:** More demonstrations help some models (GPT-4o), hurt others (Qwen1.5-1.8B)
  - **Prompt tuning vs. inference cost:** Tuning adds training time (~5 epochs) but enables smaller models to match larger ones at inference

- **Failure signatures:**
  - F1 < 0.50 with short template on small model → Model lacks task understanding; switch to larger model or use prompt tuning
  - Performance degrades with more shots → Context dilution; reduce demonstrations or reorder with key examples at edges
  - Prompt tuning hurts performance → Check learning rate (0.00003 used), batch size (8), or try alternative PEFT (LoRA, P-Tuning mentioned as future work)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline template test:** Run 0-shot inference with short template on target model; establish F1 floor. If <0.50, model likely insufficient.
  2. **Template length ablation:** Compare short vs. long template on same model. Expect improvement for ≥7B, degradation for <2B.
  3. **Prompt tuning validation:** Apply soft prompt tuning (5 epochs, lr=3e-5, batch=8) on 1.5B model. Target: F1 improvement >0.15 as seen in Qwen2-1.5B.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies improve the model's reasoning capability and accuracy compared to the current short and long template designs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states that the "chain-of-thought template design approach could also be applicable to this problem," noting that only two template types were created.
- Why unresolved: The current study focused on direct instruction templates and did not evaluate reasoning-based prompt structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments implementing CoT prompts on the same dataset to measure performance changes against the current baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does prompt tuning compare to other parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, Prefix Tuning, or P-Tuning, for the task of fact-check-worthiness estimation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion explicitly lists "methods such as LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and P-Tuning" as unvalidated approaches that will be the focus of future work.
- Why unresolved: The authors restricted the fine-tuning methodology exclusively to prompt tuning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the performance (F1 score, accuracy) of LoRA or P-Tuning on the Qwen models against the prompt tuning results reported in Table VII.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the effectiveness of the proposed prompt tuning method transfer to fact-check-worthiness estimation in non-English languages or cross-lingual contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion highlights that "tasks involving fact-check-worthiness in other languages, such as Chinese and German, have not been assessed."
- Why unresolved: The experiments were confined to an English-language COVID-19 dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: evaluating the fine-tuned models on multilingual datasets to determine if performance is maintained across different linguistic structures.

## Limitations

- Dataset generalization uncertainty: Results are based exclusively on COVID-19 misinformation data from one source, limiting claims about multilingual or cross-domain applicability
- Template design subjectivity: The effectiveness threshold between long and short templates appears arbitrary and not systematically optimized for different model sizes
- Prompt tuning instability: The method improved performance for 1.5B models but unexpectedly degraded performance for 7B models, suggesting architecture-specific sensitivity

## Confidence

- **High Confidence (Mechanism 1 - Template Reframing):** Strong evidence from comparative results showing 7B models benefit from long templates while <2B models degrade. The mechanism of task reframing from classification to generation is well-established in prompt engineering literature.
- **Medium Confidence (Mechanism 2 - In-Context Learning):** Mixed evidence - GPT-4o-mini shows clear gains while Qwen models show inconsistent scaling. The claim that "more demonstrations help" is partially supported but lacks explanation for degradation patterns.
- **Medium Confidence (Mechanism 3 - Prompt Tuning):** Evidence is compelling for small models (Qwen2-1.5B improvement) but contradicted by negative results on larger models. The parameter-efficiency claim is supported by the 0.0009% update ratio.
- **Low Confidence (Cross-Domain Generalization):** No experiments validate performance beyond COVID-19 claims. The multilingual claim is asserted but not demonstrated.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Transfer Validation:** Test the exact same prompt templates and tuning approach on a non-COVID dataset (e.g., political claims or general misinformation) to verify the claimed cross-domain applicability. Measure performance drop to quantify domain sensitivity.

2. **Model Architecture Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically test prompt tuning across a broader range of architectures (Mistral, Llama, Claude) with identical hyperparameters to determine if the Qwen-specific negative result is architecture-dependent or hyperparameter-related.

3. **Verbalizer Robustness Test:** Replace the substring-based verbalizer with exact-match and confidence-threshold variants. Compare false positive/negative rates to quantify the impact of verbalizer design on overall system reliability.
