# Sora as a World Model? A Complete Survey on Text-to-Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.05131
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05131
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey of 250+ studies examining how text-to-video models support world modeling through spatial, action, and strategic intelligences, identifying key technical advancements and remaining challenges.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of text-to-video generation research and its relationship to world modeling. The authors analyze 250+ studies to identify how modern T2V models increasingly adhere to completeness, consistency, and invention principles through innovations like diffusion transformers and multimodal control. While current models demonstrate impressive visual fidelity and temporal consistency, the survey identifies persistent challenges in achieving long-term consistency, handling complex physical simulations, and developing flexible interaction modalities. The work concludes that T2V generation is progressing toward world modeling capabilities but requires further technical improvements in diversity-consistency trade-offs and ethical considerations.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews over 250 text-to-video generation studies, classifying them according to their contributions to world modeling capabilities. The authors employ a comprehensive search strategy across major academic databases and preprint servers, focusing on papers published between 2015-2023. Studies are analyzed based on their technical approaches, evaluation methodologies, and demonstrated capabilities in spatial, action, and strategic intelligences. The survey framework emphasizes three core principles: completeness (generating all aspects of requested content), consistency (maintaining coherence over time and space), and invention (creating novel combinations and scenarios). Technical innovations are categorized by their contributions to diffusion models, multimodal control mechanisms, and physics-aware generation techniques.

## Key Results
- Modern T2V models increasingly satisfy completeness, consistency, and invention principles through innovations like diffusion transformers and multimodal control
- Current models show impressive capabilities in visual fidelity, diversity, and temporal consistency but struggle with long-term consistency and complex physical simulations
- Technical improvements needed in diversity-consistency trade-offs and ethical considerations before fully realizing world model capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of modern T2V models in supporting world modeling stems from their ability to integrate multimodal information processing with advanced generative architectures. Diffusion transformers enable the models to capture complex temporal dependencies and spatial relationships simultaneously, while multimodal control mechanisms allow for precise specification of desired attributes and behaviors. The integration of physics-aware generation techniques helps ensure that generated content adheres to real-world constraints, supporting the consistency principle essential for world modeling. These technical innovations collectively enable T2V models to generate content that is not only visually coherent but also semantically meaningful and temporally consistent.

## Foundational Learning
- **World Modeling Principles**: The framework of completeness, consistency, and invention provides a structured approach to evaluating T2V capabilities. Why needed: These principles establish clear criteria for assessing whether generated content can support intelligent system development. Quick check: Does the model generate all requested elements (completeness), maintain temporal coherence (consistency), and create novel scenarios (invention)?
- **Diffusion Transformers**: Hybrid architectures combining diffusion models with transformer attention mechanisms for improved temporal and spatial coherence. Why needed: Traditional transformers struggle with temporal consistency while diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images. Quick check: Can the model maintain consistent object properties across multiple frames?
- **Multimodal Control**: Techniques for incorporating text, audio, and other modalities to guide video generation. Why needed: Enables precise specification of desired attributes and behaviors in generated content. Quick check: Does the model accurately respond to cross-modal prompts while maintaining visual quality?
- **Physics-Aware Generation**: Integration of physical simulation constraints into generative models. Why needed: Ensures generated content adheres to real-world physical laws, supporting consistency. Quick check: Do objects behave realistically under gravity, collisions, and other physical forces?
- **Temporal Consistency**: Maintaining coherent object properties, relationships, and behaviors across video frames. Why needed: Essential for creating believable sequences that support world understanding. Quick check: Are object positions, appearances, and interactions consistent throughout the generated video?
- **Diversity-Consistency Trade-off**: Balancing the generation of novel content with the maintenance of coherent world representations. Why needed: Too much diversity can break consistency while excessive consistency limits creative potential. Quick check: Does the model generate varied content while maintaining core world properties?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Text Input -> Multimodal Encoder -> Diffusion Transformer Backbone -> Spatial-Temporal Decoder -> Video Output
- **Critical Path**: The multimodal encoder processes input prompts, the diffusion transformer backbone generates latent representations, and the spatial-temporal decoder produces final video frames with consistent properties across time
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Models must balance computational efficiency (using efficient attention mechanisms) against generation quality (requiring deeper networks), and between diversity (creative variation) and consistency (temporal coherence)
- **Failure Signatures**: Common failures include temporal inconsistency (objects changing properties mid-video), physical impossibility (violating gravity or collision constraints), and prompt deviation (generating content that doesn't match specifications)
- **3 First Experiments**:
  1. Generate a simple scene with consistent object properties across 10+ frames
  2. Test multimodal control by varying text and audio prompts while maintaining visual coherence
  3. Evaluate physics simulation by generating scenes with complex interactions and collisions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions regarding the future development of T2V models as world models. Key questions include how to achieve longer-term temporal consistency beyond current frame limits, what approaches can best handle complex physical simulations involving multiple interacting objects, and how to develop more flexible interaction modalities that support real-time generation and manipulation. The authors also question how to balance the diversity-consistency trade-off more effectively and what ethical frameworks are needed to address potential harms from increasingly realistic synthetic content generation.

## Limitations
- The field's rapid evolution means many technical details and performance benchmarks may be outdated by publication time
- Coverage of 250+ studies may miss emerging research from preprint servers not captured in major databases
- Focus on technical capabilities may underemphasize real-world deployment challenges including computational costs and data privacy concerns

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the technical taxonomy of T2V architectures and their evolution
- **Medium confidence** in the assessment of world modeling capabilities, given the rapidly evolving nature of the field
- **Medium confidence** in the identification of key challenges, as some may be resolved by the time of publication
- **Low confidence** in the comprehensive coverage of all relevant studies due to the field's rapid growth

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic review of preprints and conference proceedings from the past 6 months to identify emerging trends not captured in the survey
2. Perform controlled experiments comparing multiple T2V models on standardized world modeling benchmarks to validate the reported capabilities
3. Develop a standardized evaluation framework for assessing consistency and diversity trade-offs across different T2V architectures
