# Are LLMs Ready for English Standardized Tests? A Benchmarking and Elicitation Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17056
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17056
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Even top models struggle with English standardized test problem-solving and show inconsistent performance across question types.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ESTBOOK, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large language models on English standardized tests. Covering 10,576 questions across five major exams (SAT, GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS) and 29 question types, the authors systematically assess LLM performance using various prompting strategies. The study reveals that current models struggle significantly with EST problem-solving, particularly in reasoning-heavy tasks involving numeric calculation, multimodal integration, and complex logic. The authors propose a breakdown analysis framework that isolates reasoning steps, showing that while LLMs are strong at problem formulation, they often fail in deeper reasoning stages.

## Method Summary
The authors developed ESTBOOK, a benchmark containing 10,576 questions from five English standardized tests (SAT, GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS) across 29 question types. They employed multiple evaluation strategies including In-Context Learning, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thought prompting to assess LLM performance. To diagnose model limitations, they introduced a breakdown analysis framework that isolates and evaluates individual reasoning steps within test questions. This systematic approach allowed them to identify specific weaknesses in model reasoning capabilities rather than just overall performance metrics.

## Key Results
- Even top-performing LLMs show inconsistent results across different EST question types
- Models demonstrate strong problem formulation abilities but struggle with deeper reasoning stages
- Significant performance gaps exist in tasks involving numeric calculation, multimodal integration, and complex logic

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's effectiveness stems from its systematic evaluation approach that combines comprehensive benchmarking with detailed breakdown analysis. By isolating individual reasoning steps within test questions, the authors can identify specific failure points rather than just measuring overall performance. This mechanistic understanding reveals that current LLMs, while capable of understanding problem structure, lack the robust reasoning capabilities needed for complex standardized test questions.

## Foundational Learning
- English standardized test question types (why needed: to create comprehensive benchmark; quick check: 29 distinct types identified)
- Multimodal reasoning (why needed: tests involve text, audio, images, tables; quick check: multiple modalities in ESTBOOK)
- In-Context Learning (why needed: evaluation strategy; quick check: prompting methods tested)
- Chain-of-Thought prompting (why needed: reasoning assessment; quick check: compared against other methods)
- Tree-of-Thought reasoning (why needed: complex problem-solving evaluation; quick check: included in prompt strategies)
- Breakdown analysis framework (why needed: to isolate reasoning failures; quick check: framework proposed for diagnostics)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: ESTBOOK benchmark -> Prompting strategies (ICL, CoT, ToT) -> LLM evaluation -> Breakdown analysis framework
Critical Path: Question selection → Prompt application → Model response → Step-by-step breakdown → Performance analysis
Design Tradeoffs: Comprehensive coverage vs. focused analysis; automated evaluation vs. human verification
Failure Signatures: Strong formulation but weak reasoning; multimodal integration failures; numeric calculation errors
First Experiments:
1. Apply ESTBOOK to a new LLM and compare against existing benchmarks
2. Test breakdown analysis framework on non-EST question types
3. Evaluate prompt engineering effectiveness on specific reasoning failure modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions beyond the immediate research findings and recommendations for improving LLM reasoning capabilities in standardized test contexts.

## Limitations
- Benchmark coverage may not capture all real-world testing scenarios
- Evaluation relies on automated scoring which may miss nuanced errors
- Focus on English language tests may limit generalizability to other domains

## Confidence
High: Comprehensive benchmark creation and systematic evaluation methodology
Medium: Interpretation of breakdown analysis results
Low: Generalization of findings to non-EST applications

## Next Checks
1. Validate breakdown analysis framework on non-EST question types to test generalizability
2. Conduct human evaluation of model responses to verify automated scoring accuracy
3. Test enhanced LLMs with improved reasoning capabilities on ESTBOOK to measure progress
