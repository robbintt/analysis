# Knowledge-Guided Textual Reasoning for Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via LLMs
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07429
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07429
- Reference count: 40
- TbVAD achieves competitive performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets using text-based reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TbVAD, a text-based framework for video anomaly detection that performs anomaly detection and explanation entirely within the textual domain. The framework represents video semantics through language, enabling interpretable and knowledge-grounded reasoning. TbVAD operates in three stages: transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. Evaluated on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks, TbVAD demonstrates that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios, achieving competitive performance compared to visual-feature-based baselines while offering explainable reasoning through structured textual understanding.

## Method Summary
TbVAD is a three-stage text-based video anomaly detection framework. First, it uses a vision-language model to transform video content into fine-grained textual captions. Second, it constructs structured knowledge by organizing these captions into four semantic slots: action, object, context, and environment. Third, it performs knowledge-guided textual reasoning to detect anomalies and generate explanations by analyzing which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. The framework operates entirely in the textual domain, avoiding direct visual feature processing while maintaining interpretability through structured semantic representations.

## Key Results
- TbVAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks
- The framework provides interpretable explanations through slot-wise analysis of semantic factors
- Text-based reasoning demonstrates reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TbVAD leverages the rich semantic understanding capabilities of large language models to perform anomaly detection through textual reasoning rather than direct visual feature analysis. By converting visual information into structured textual representations across four semantic dimensions (action, object, context, environment), the framework enables systematic analysis of what makes a video segment anomalous. The slot-wise explanation mechanism reveals which specific semantic factors drive anomaly decisions, providing transparency that traditional black-box visual models cannot offer. This approach capitalizes on the ability of LLMs to reason about complex relationships between semantic concepts while maintaining interpretability through structured knowledge organization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Models**: Required for converting visual content to textual captions; quick check: verify model accuracy on relevant captioning tasks
- **Semantic Slot Organization**: Four-way categorization (action, object, context, environment) structures knowledge; quick check: validate slot assignments cover relevant anomaly factors
- **Textual Anomaly Reasoning**: LLM-based analysis of semantic relationships; quick check: test reasoning capabilities on known anomalous vs normal examples
- **Explainable AI Principles**: Slot-wise attribution provides transparency; quick check: verify explanations align with human reasoning about anomalies
- **Video Captioning**: Fine-grained temporal description generation; quick check: ensure captions capture sufficient detail for anomaly detection
- **Knowledge Grounding**: Structured semantic representations anchor reasoning; quick check: validate knowledge structure supports diverse anomaly types

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Video -> VLM Captioning -> Semantic Slots (4) -> LLM Reasoning -> Anomaly Detection + Explanations

**Critical Path**: The vision-language model's captioning accuracy directly impacts downstream reasoning quality. Poor caption generation propagates errors through slot organization and final anomaly classification.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Textual reasoning offers interpretability but may miss subtle visual cues that direct feature analysis would capture. The four-slot structure provides systematic organization but may not capture all relevant factors for complex anomalies.

**Failure Signatures**: Caption generation errors, inappropriate slot assignments, or LLM reasoning failures manifest as misclassified anomalies with potentially misleading explanations. Performance degradation occurs when visual nuances don't translate well to textual descriptions.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test captioning accuracy on sample videos, 2) Validate slot assignment consistency across similar video segments, 3) Verify explanation quality by comparing with human-labeled anomalous factors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two relatively constrained datasets (UCF-Crime and XD-Violence)
- Performance metrics primarily compare against visual-feature-based baselines
- Framework's reliance on generated captions introduces potential error propagation from vision-language models
- Four semantic slots may not capture all relevant anomaly factors in complex scenarios
- Explainability claims lack comprehensive human evaluation of explanation quality and usefulness

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the technical implementation and methodology described for TbVAD's three-stage pipeline
- **Medium confidence** in the comparative performance claims, given the limited baseline comparisons and dataset scope
- **Medium confidence** in the explainability benefits, as these are demonstrated qualitatively but lack extensive user studies

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TbVAD on additional diverse surveillance datasets (e.g., Avenue, ShanghaiTech) to assess generalizability across different anomaly types and environments
2. Conduct human studies with domain experts to evaluate the quality, accuracy, and usefulness of the slot-wise explanations for real-world decision-making
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the impact of caption quality and vision-language model choice on final anomaly detection performance
