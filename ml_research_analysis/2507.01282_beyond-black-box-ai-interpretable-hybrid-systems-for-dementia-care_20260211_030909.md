# Beyond Black-Box AI: Interpretable Hybrid Systems for Dementia Care

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.01282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01282
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Advocates hybrid AI systems combining ML with expert rules for interpretable dementia care decision support

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies critical limitations in current black-box AI tools for dementia care, particularly their lack of interpretability and clinical actionability. The authors argue that hybrid AI architectures combining statistical learning with expert-curated rules can restore clinical trust by providing transparent, context-aware guidance. Drawing on examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS, they demonstrate how such hybrid approaches bridge the gap between complex ML predictions and actionable clinical recommendations. The review calls for future AI tools to prioritize explanatory coherence through causal reasoning and human-in-the-loop feedback, with evaluation metrics extending beyond accuracy to include clinician understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes.

## Method Summary
The proposed hybrid approach integrates machine learning models for pattern detection with expert rule-based systems for contextual validation. The method involves: (1) training ML classifiers on clinical data including biomarkers, imaging, and cognitive assessments; (2) building rule engines encoding diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines; (3) combining ML outputs with rule-based reasoning to generate interpretable reports; and (4) implementing human-in-the-loop feedback loops where clinicians maintain and update the rule base. The system aims to produce transparent explanations that connect symptoms to diagnoses while allowing for uncertainty quantification and edge case handling through incremental rule maintenance.

## Key Results
- Black-box ML models in dementia care lack interpretability and actionable recommendations, limiting clinical adoption
- Hybrid architectures combining ML with expert rules can restore clinical trust by providing context-aware reasoning
- Neuro-symbolic integration (LLMs + rules) can bridge the explanation gap while preventing hallucinations
- Evaluation should prioritize clinician understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes over pure accuracy metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Context-Aware Validation
ML models generate raw predictions from high-dimensional data, which expert rule engines then contextualize using clinical logic to produce actionable recommendations rather than opaque scores.

### Mechanism 2: Incremental Knowledge Maintenance
Clinicians directly modify rule bases through human-in-the-loop feedback, ensuring systems remain relevant and handle edge cases without requiring complete model retraining.

### Mechanism 3: Neuro-Symbolic Fact-Checking
LLMs draft explanatory text that symbolic rule layers vet against medical logic, preventing hallucinations while maintaining natural language fluency.

## Foundational Learning

- **Explanatory Coherence**: Understanding the causal "story" behind predictions is essential for clinical trust and adoption
  - *Quick check*: Can you trace the "why" behind the system's output?

- **The Interpretation Gap**: Bridging the chasm between statistical outputs and clinician actions is critical for clinical utility
  - *Quick check*: Does the system output tell you *what* to do next, or just *what* the risk is?

- **Meehl's "Broken Leg" Conditions**: Unique contextual factors can invalidate statistical trends, requiring human oversight
  - *Quick check*: Does the system allow for exceptions where the statistical trend should be ignored?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Clinical data -> ML Perception Layer -> Expert Reasoning Layer -> LLM Interface Layer -> Feedback Layer
- **Critical path**: The handoff between ML probability assessment and rule-based contextual validation
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Accuracy vs. Interpretability: Pure ML offers higher accuracy but is opaque; rules offer transparency but are brittle
  - Automation vs. Control: LLMs are fast but hallucinate; human-in-the-loop is slower but safer
  - Generality vs. Specificity: Broad models vs. narrow, specialized rule bases
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Hallucination Cascade: LLM invents unsupported rationale
  - Rule Brittleness: System fails on new patient profiles
  - Alert Fatigue: System over-explains, causing clinicians to ignore outputs
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test RAG validation for accurate biomarker retrieval without hallucinations
  2. Simulate "broken leg" scenarios to verify rule-based override logic
  3. Compare clinician trust and accuracy between ML-only vs. hybrid outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can clinical AI evaluation shift from technical accuracy to pragmatic measures of workflow fit and patient outcomes?
- What interface designs can effectively communicate AI uncertainty without inducing alarm fatigue or automation bias?
- How can scalable frameworks be developed for clinicians to maintain knowledge bases without intensive programming resources?

## Limitations

- The scalability of incremental human-in-the-loop rule maintenance for complex clinical domains remains unproven
- Conflict resolution strategies when ML predictions and rule outputs disagree are not fully specified
- Limited evidence exists on the long-term sustainability of hybrid systems in evolving clinical guidelines

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Fundamental need for interpretable AI and clinical value of hybrid systems
- **Medium confidence**: Neuro-symbolic integration using LLMs plus rule-based fact-checking
- **Low confidence**: Scalability of incremental human-in-the-loop rule maintenance

## Next Checks

1. Test conflict resolution by simulating ML-rule disagreements and validating system prioritization
2. Assess incremental maintenance by tracking rule base accuracy and consistency over time
3. Study clinician workflow integration by measuring time-to-decision and cognitive load in realistic vignettes
