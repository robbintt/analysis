# Adversarial Limits of Quantum Certification: When Eve Defeats Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04391
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04391
- Authors: Davut Emre Tasar
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Eve-GAN achieves 95% quantum fidelity with 0.50 AUC detection (random guessing)

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve-GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum statistics. The central finding is that when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter α ≥ 0.95, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing—meaning an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. The study reveals a 44 percentage point inflation in detection performance when using same-distribution calibration versus proper cross-distribution evaluation, identifying a systematic methodological flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims in prior quantum certification studies.

## Method Summary
The paper develops Eve-GAN, a generative adversarial network that learns to produce classical CHSH correlation matrices indistinguishable from quantum statistics. The generator maps 4D latent noise vectors through a 4→64→128→64→4 feedforward network with tanh output to produce correlators [E₀₀, E₀₁, E₁₀, E₁₁]. Training uses a TARA-k discriminator and converges when discriminator accuracy reaches 0.50 (random guessing). The study evaluates detection performance across mixing parameters α ∈ {0.50, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 1.00} where Data_observed = α·Quantum + (1-α)·Eve, measuring ROC AUC, TPR@5%FPR, and CHSH values. Hardware validation demonstrates Eve-GAN achieving CHSH = 2.736 versus IBM Quantum's 2.691, showing classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems.

## Key Results
- All tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50 (random guessing) when Eve mixes at α ≥ 0.95
- Same-distribution calibration inflates detection AUC by 44 percentage points versus proper cross-distribution evaluation
- Sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05 separates distinguishable (S > 2.05) from indistinguishable (S ≤ 2.05) correlation regimes
- Hardware validation shows Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736 versus IBM Quantum's 2.691, exceeding real quantum hardware performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Eve-GAN produces classical correlation matrices achieving ROC AUC ≤ 0.502 against all tested detection methods when mixed at α ≥ 0.95
- **Mechanism:** The generator G maps latent noise z ~ N(0, I₄) through a 4→64→128→64→4 feedforward network with tanh output, learning to produce correlators [E₀₀, E₀₁, E₁₀, E₁₁] that minimize discriminator distinguishability. Training converges when discriminator accuracy reaches 0.50 (random guessing), indicating the classical correlations have matched the quantum distribution's statistical fingerprint.
- **Core assumption:** The detection methods tested (TARA-k, TARA-m, CHSH comparison, ensemble classifiers) are representative of practically deployable quantum certification
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing"; [Section 4/Table 1] Shows α=0.95 yields TARA-k AUC=0.502, TPR@5%FPR=1%; [corpus] Related work on TARA (arXiv:2512.04016) provides conformal prediction guarantees but assumes calibration matches test distribution—the assumption Eve-GAN exploits
- **Break condition:** If detection methods incorporate features beyond correlator statistics (e.g., temporal patterns, higher-order cumulants, or device-specific quantum process tomography), the 0.50 AUC result may not hold

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Same-distribution calibration inflates detection AUC by 44 percentage points through information leakage
- **Mechanism:** When calibration data Q_θ and test data share the same device-specific noise parameter θ (decoherence times, gate errors), the detector learns P[sample ∈ Q_θ | calibration from Q_θ] rather than P[sample is quantum | calibration from LHV null]. The detector exploits shared noise signatures that are artifactually correlated with quantum vs. classical labels within that specific hardware run.
- **Core assumption:** Cross-distribution calibration (training on independent LHV samples, testing on quantum) represents the correct security evaluation protocol
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 5] "same-distribution calibration achieves AUC = 0.94, while proper cross-distribution calibration achieves AUC = 0.499"; [Section 5.2] Formalizes detection ∝ P[sample ∈ Q_θ | calibration from Q_θ] as the leakage mechanism; [corpus] Kapoor et al. [14] identified similar leakage across 294 papers in 17 fields, confirming this is a systemic ML methodology issue
- **Break condition:** If quantum certification can be framed as a true out-of-distribution detection problem with exchangeable calibration/test data (satisfying conformal prediction assumptions), leakage is avoided

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05 separates statistically distinguishable from indistinguishable correlation regimes
- **Mechanism:** Near the classical bound (S = 2), the statistical variance of finite-sample CHSH estimates overwhelms the signal difference between classical and quantum correlations. At S ≈ 2.05, the detection probability drops sharply from 85% to 15% over ΔS ≈ 0.05, suggesting a fundamental sample-complexity boundary rather than gradual degradation.
- **Core assumption:** The phase transition reflects fundamental statistical limits, not limitations of the specific detection methods tested
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 6.2/Table 4] Shows detection probability: S=2.00 → 85%, S=2.05 → 15%, S=2.10 → 5%; [abstract] "sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations"; [corpus] Weak corpus support—no neighboring papers specifically address CHSH detection phase transitions; this appears to be a novel empirical finding requiring independent validation
- **Break condition:** If detection methods incorporate multiple Bell inequalities or full correlation tomography rather than single CHSH values, the transition point may shift

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: CHSH inequality and Bell nonlocality**
  - Why needed here: The entire security model assumes classical correlations satisfy |S| ≤ 2 while quantum correlations violate this bound up to Tsirelson's limit 2√2 ≈ 2.828. Understanding this hierarchy is essential to grasp why S = 2.05 represents a vulnerability threshold
  - Quick check question: If a correlation matrix yields CHSH S = 2.03, can you conclude it must be quantum-originated based on this paper's findings?

- **Concept: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and Nash equilibrium training**
  - Why needed here: Eve-GAN's generator-discriminator game converges when neither player can improve—the discriminator achieves 0.50 accuracy. This equilibrium defines the empirical indistinguishability boundary
  - Quick check question: Why does discriminator accuracy converging to 0.50 indicate successful adversarial correlation generation rather than training failure?

- **Concept: Conformal prediction and exchangeability**
  - Why needed here: The 44-point leakage problem stems from violating exchangeability assumptions. Proper calibration requires calibration and test data to be exchangeable samples from the distribution of interest
  - Quick check question: If you calibrate on IBM Quantum run A and test on IBM Quantum run B (same device, different times), does this satisfy exchangeability for adversarial robustness testing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Latent z ~ N(0, I₄) -> Generator G (4→64→128→64→4) -> Correlation matrix [E₀₀, E₀₁, E₁₀, E₁₁] -> TARA-k discriminator -> Detection decision
- **Critical path:** 1) Train Eve-GAN until discriminator accuracy ∈ [0.48, 0.52] and KL divergence < 0.001; 2) Generate Eve correlations and interpolate at α ∈ {0.50, 0.80, 0.90, 0.90, 0.95, 1.00}; 3) Evaluate detection using cross-distribution calibration (LHV train, quantum test); 4) Verify AUC ≈ 0.50 at α ≥ 0.95
- **Design tradeoffs:** Deeper generator (more layers) may achieve finer correlation matching but risks mode collapse; larger calibration sets reduce p-value variance but require more quantum hardware time; multi-feature detectors (CHSH + entropy + temporal) may improve robustness but increase false positives on noisy hardware
- **Failure signatures:** Discriminator accuracy stuck > 0.60: Generator not learning quantum manifold; Generator outputs violating no-signaling conditions: Physicality constraint not enforced; AUC > 0.60 at α = 1.00 (pure quantum): Calibration leakage present; CHSH variance > 0.1 across batches: Insufficient shots or hardware instability
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce the α-sweep (Table 3) on a different quantum backend (e.g., IonQ or Rigetti) to validate cross-hardware generalization of the 0.95 threshold; 2) Test whether temporal correlation features (lag-1 autocorrelation of measurement outcomes) break the α ≥ 0.95 evasion, as Table 2 shows "Temporal" strategy achieved CHSH = 1.813 with 0% detection; 3) Implement cross-distribution vs. same-distribution calibration comparison on your detection pipeline to quantify your own leakage magnitude (target: < 5 percentage point gap)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can detection methods beyond those tested (TARA-k, TARA-m, CHSH comparison, ensemble classifiers) break the α ≥ 0.95 adversarial detection limit, or is this a fundamental bound?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "we cannot rule out the existence of more sophisticated detection methods" and describe their finding as "a strong empirical lower bound on adversarial robustness"
- Why unresolved: Only four detection method families were evaluated; no theoretical proof establishes 0.95 as a fundamental limit rather than an artifact of current approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis proving optimal detection bounds, or empirical demonstration of detection methods achieving AUC > 0.55 at α ≥ 0.95

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical origin of the sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper identifies the phase transition empirically ("85% to 15% detection over ΔS = 0.05") but does not provide a theoretical explanation for why this specific threshold emerges
- Why unresolved: The sharpness suggests "a genuine phase boundary rather than gradual degradation," yet no theoretical framework is offered to explain this value
- What evidence would resolve it: Analytical derivation connecting S = 2.05 to statistical distinguishability bounds, or demonstration that the transition shifts under different experimental parameters

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do these adversarial limits persist when Eve possesses quantum capabilities rather than being restricted to classical strategies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "Device-independent proofs assume Eve has quantum capabilities [22]. We analyze classical Eve with realistic information access—a complementary scenario"
- Why unresolved: The threat model explicitly constrains Eve to classical operations; quantum-capable adversaries may evade detection even more easily or require entirely new certification frameworks
- What evidence would resolve it: Extension of Eve-GAN methodology to quantum adversaries, or theoretical analysis comparing classical vs. quantum adversarial limits

## Limitations

- The detection methods tested may not represent all practically deployable quantum certification schemes
- The phase transition finding at CHSH S = 2.05 needs independent validation on different hardware and with alternative detection metrics
- The Eve-GAN architecture may not capture all possible classical adversarial strategies, only those representable by the specific generator structure used

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: α ≥ 0.95 evasion threshold, calibration leakage quantification, hardware validation showing Eve-GAN outperforming IBM Quantum
- **Medium confidence**: CHSH S = 2.05 phase transition, completeness of tested detection methods, generalizability to other quantum certification protocols
- **Low confidence**: Assumption that all practical quantum certification reduces to correlation-based detection, completeness of Eve-GAN's adversarial strategy space

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-hardware validation**: Reproduce the α-sweep (Table 3) on different quantum backends (IonQ, Rigetti, or other IBM devices) to verify the 0.95 threshold generalizes beyond the Torino device

2. **Temporal feature robustness**: Test whether adding temporal correlation features (lag-1 autocorrelation of measurement outcomes) breaks the α ≥ 0.95 evasion, given Table 2 shows temporal strategies achieved 0% detection at lower CHSH values

3. **Detection method expansion**: Implement detection using full correlation tomography and multiple Bell inequalities beyond CHSH to assess whether the phase transition at S = 2.05 persists under richer statistical analysis
