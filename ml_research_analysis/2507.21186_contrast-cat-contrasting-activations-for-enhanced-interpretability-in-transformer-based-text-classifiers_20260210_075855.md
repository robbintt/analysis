## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.21186
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21186
- Authors: Sungmin Han; Jeonghyun Lee; Sangkyun Lee
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Proposes Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and models, achieving significant improvements in interpretability metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting transformer-based text classification models, where existing activation-based attribution methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations, leading to less reliable interpretations. The authors propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features through contrastive reference activations. Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps by contrasting target activations with multiple reference activations from different classes, weighting by gradients and attention scores, and refining via a deletion test. Experimental results across various datasets and models (BERTbase, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, Llama-2) confirm that Contrast-CAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of ×1.30 in AOPC and ×2.25 in LOdds under the MoRF setting, and ×1.34 in AOPC and ×1.03 in LOdds under the LeRF setting, compared to the best competitors.

## Method Summary
Contrast-CAT introduces a novel approach to enhance interpretability in transformer-based text classifiers by addressing the limitation of existing activation-based attribution methods, which can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations. The method refines token-level attributions by contrasting target activations with multiple reference activations from different classes, weighting by gradients and attention scores, and refining via a deletion test. This contrastive approach generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps by filtering out class-irrelevant features. The experimental results demonstrate that Contrast-CAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various datasets and models, including BERTbase, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and Llama-2, with significant improvements in interpretability metrics.

## Key Results
- Contrast-CAT achieves average improvements of ×1.30 in AOPC and ×2.25 in LOdds under the MoRF setting compared to the best competitors.
- Under the LeRF setting, Contrast-CAT achieves average improvements of ×1.34 in AOPC and ×1.03 in LOdds compared to the best competitors.
- The method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attribution methods across multiple datasets and models, including BERTbase, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and Llama-2.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Contrast-CAT works by contrasting target activations with multiple reference activations from different classes, which helps filter out class-irrelevant features that can undermine the reliability of existing activation-based attribution methods. By weighting the contrastive activations by gradients and attention scores, and refining via a deletion test, Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. This approach addresses the core challenge of interpreting transformer-based text classifiers by improving the accuracy and reliability of token-level attributions.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Activation-based attribution methods**: These methods assign importance scores to input tokens based on their contribution to the model's prediction. They are needed to understand which parts of the input are most influential in the model's decision-making process. Quick check: Verify that the method can handle different types of input features and model architectures.

2. **Class-irrelevant features**: These are features that do not contribute to the model's prediction for a specific class. They can undermine the reliability of activation-based attribution methods by introducing noise into the attribution scores. Quick check: Ensure that the method can effectively identify and filter out class-irrelevant features.

3. **Contrastive reference activations**: These are activations from different classes used to contrast with the target activations. They help filter out class-irrelevant features by highlighting the differences between classes. Quick check: Validate that the method can generate meaningful contrastive reference activations for different classes.

4. **Gradient and attention weighting**: This technique assigns importance weights to the contrastive activations based on the model's gradients and attention scores. It helps refine the attribution maps by emphasizing the most relevant features. Quick check: Verify that the method can effectively incorporate gradient and attention information into the attribution process.

5. **Deletion test**: This is a post-hoc evaluation method that measures the quality of attribution maps by assessing the impact of removing the most important tokens on the model's prediction. It helps refine the attribution maps by ensuring that the most important tokens are correctly identified. Quick check: Validate that the method can effectively use the deletion test to improve the quality of attribution maps.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input -> Transformer Model -> Activation Extraction -> Contrastive Reference Generation -> Gradient and Attention Weighting -> Attribution Map Refinement -> Deletion Test -> Final Attribution Map

### Critical Path
The critical path in Contrast-CAT involves the extraction of target activations from the transformer model, the generation of contrastive reference activations from different classes, the weighting of these activations by gradients and attention scores, and the refinement of the attribution map via the deletion test. This path ensures that the final attribution map is clear, faithful, and free from class-irrelevant features.

### Design Tradeoffs
The use of multiple reference activations from different classes increases the computational overhead but improves the accuracy and reliability of the attribution maps. The weighting of activations by gradients and attention scores adds complexity but helps emphasize the most relevant features. The deletion test adds an additional post-hoc evaluation step but ensures the quality of the attribution maps.

### Failure Signatures
Potential failure modes include the inability to generate meaningful contrastive reference activations for certain classes, the introduction of noise due to incorrect gradient or attention weighting, and the failure to correctly identify the most important tokens during the deletion test. These failures can lead to less accurate or less reliable attribution maps.

### First Experiments
1. Evaluate the method's performance on a simple text classification task with a small dataset to validate the basic functionality.
2. Test the method's ability to handle different types of input features and model architectures.
3. Assess the method's robustness to adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The attribution method's robustness to adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs remains unexplored.
- The contrastive approach relies on the assumption that class-irrelevant features are adequately captured by reference activations, which may not hold in all cases.
- The computational overhead of multiple reference activations could limit scalability in real-time applications.

## Confidence
- High confidence in the method's effectiveness on standard benchmark datasets and models.
- Medium confidence in the method's interpretability improvements due to the qualitative human study's unspecified sample details.
- Low confidence in the method's robustness to adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Contrast-CAT's performance on adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs to assess robustness.
2. Conduct a larger and more diverse human study to validate the qualitative improvements in interpretability.
3. Benchmark the computational overhead of Contrast-CAT against state-of-the-art methods in real-time scenarios.
