# Lightweight Model Attribution and Detection of Synthetic Speech via Audio Residual Fingerprints

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2411.14013
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Training-free method detects synthetic speech with >99% AUROC and attributes to source model via standardized audio residuals.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a lightweight, training-free approach for detecting synthetic speech and attributing it to its source synthesis model. The method extracts model-agnostic fingerprints by computing standardized average residuals—the difference between audio signals and their filtered versions—to capture synthesis artifacts. Experiments demonstrate high performance across multiple synthesis systems and languages, achieving AUROC scores above 99%. The approach maintains strong reliability under common audio distortions including echo and moderate background noise, while remaining efficient and generalizable for digital forensics applications.

## Method Summary
The method computes standardized average residuals to extract fingerprints that capture synthesis artifacts. First, log-magnitude spectrograms are obtained using STFT with 8ms window size and 0.125ms hop length, then averaged over time to get a fixed vector representation. A content-preserving filter (either FIR or EnCodec) is applied to the audio, and the residual is calculated as the difference between original and filtered representations. For attribution, residuals from N samples (≥70) are averaged to form a fingerprint vector, and a covariance matrix is computed. Detection and attribution are performed by calculating the Mahalanobis distance between test residuals and target fingerprints, with classification based on minimum distance or thresholded distances.

## Key Results
- Achieves AUROC scores above 99% for synthetic speech detection across multiple synthesis systems
- Maintains high performance under common audio distortions including echo and moderate background noise
- Out-of-domain detection using Mahalanobis distances achieves F1 score of 0.91 on unseen models
- Data augmentation improves results in challenging conditions with severe audio corruptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits systematic differences in synthesis artifacts between models. Each synthesis system introduces characteristic distortions in the spectral domain that persist even after content-preserving filtering. By computing residuals between original and filtered audio, these model-specific artifacts become isolated. Standardizing these residuals through averaging and covariance normalization creates robust fingerprints that capture the unique "signature" of each synthesis approach, enabling both detection and attribution without requiring training on specific models.

## Foundational Learning
- **STFT Spectrogram Computation:** Converts time-domain audio to frequency domain representation with fixed parameters (8ms window, 0.125ms hop) to capture spectral content.
  - *Why needed:* Provides the frequency-domain basis for comparing original and filtered audio representations.
  - *Quick check:* Verify spectrogram dimensions match expected output size given sampling rate and STFT parameters.

- **Content-Preserving Filtering:** Removes certain spectral components while maintaining overall audio structure (1kHz low-pass or 5-6kHz band-pass FIR, or EnCodec).
  - *Why needed:* Isolates synthesis artifacts by removing content while preserving the distortions introduced by different synthesis systems.
  - *Quick check:* Confirm filtered audio retains intelligibility while showing reduced high-frequency content.

- **Mahalanobis Distance Computation:** Measures distance between test residuals and target fingerprints using covariance-weighted metrics.
  - *Why needed:* Provides statistically sound comparison that accounts for feature correlations and scales residuals appropriately.
  - *Quick check:* Validate distance calculations produce reasonable values and correctly rank similar vs. dissimilar samples.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Audio -> STFT -> Log Magnitude Spectrogram -> Filtering -> Residual Extraction -> Fingerprint Computation -> Mahalanobis Distance Scoring

**Critical Path:** The pipeline's core sequence (STFT → Filtering → Residual → Fingerprint → Scoring) must execute correctly for detection and attribution. Each step builds directly on the previous one, with no redundancy.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Uses standardized residuals rather than learned features for training-free operation, sacrificing potential performance gains from model-specific optimization. Employs Mahalanobis distance for statistical rigor instead of simpler distance metrics, requiring stable covariance matrix computation.

**Failure Signatures:** Singular covariance matrices indicate insufficient samples or high-dimensional instability. Inconsistent STFT outputs across libraries suggest parameter interpretation issues. Poor distance separation indicates inadequate filtering or residual extraction.

**First Experiments:**
1. Generate residuals using both FIR and EnCodec filters on clean synthetic speech samples and visualize their distributions.
2. Compute fingerprints from 70 samples of a single synthesis model and verify covariance matrix stability.
3. Test Mahalanobis distance scoring on held-out samples from the same model to establish baseline attribution performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can combining fingerprints from different spectral regions or filter types (ensembles) significantly improve robustness against severe audio corruptions compared to single-filter approaches?
- Do alternative signal decomposition techniques yield more distinct or robust fingerprints for models with similar architectures than the currently tested FIR and EnCodec methods?
- How resilient is the method against gradient-based optimization attacks specifically targeting the Mahalanobis distance metric?
- Does the method maintain high attribution performance under extreme perturbations, such as low-bitrate telephony codecs or packet loss scenarios?

## Limitations
- FIR filter specification lacks critical implementation details (order and window design method) that directly impact residual quality and detection accuracy
- Covariance matrix computation with only 70 samples in high-dimensional feature spaces presents numerical stability concerns that may cause Mahalanobis distance calculations to fail
- Extremely short 0.125ms hop length for STFT is atypical and may produce inconsistent results across different signal processing libraries

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| High AUROC scores (>99%) | Medium |
| Robustness across languages and synthesis systems | Medium |
| Training-free operation with strong performance | High |
| Out-of-domain detection capability | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Implement the FIR filter with multiple order configurations (e.g., 50, 100, 200 taps) and compare residual distributions to identify optimal settings for stable covariance matrix computation.
2. Test the STFT implementation across different libraries (Librosa, Torch, SciPy) to verify consistent spectrogram dimensions and residual extraction when using the specified 0.125ms hop length.
3. Evaluate the Mahalanobis distance computation with and without covariance matrix regularization (epsilon values from 1e-3 to 1e-6) to determine the minimum viable sample size for stable out-of-domain detection.
