# Compliance Brain Assistant: Conversational Agentic AI for Assisting Compliance Tasks in Enterprise Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17289
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17289
- Reference count: 13
- CBA routes queries between FastTrack (RAG-based) and FullAgentic (multi-step agentic) modes, achieving 83.7% average match rate vs 41.7% for vanilla LLM

## Executive Summary
CBA is a conversational AI assistant for enterprise compliance tasks that routes queries between FastTrack (RAG-based) and FullAgentic (multi-step agentic) modes. A lightweight LLM router selects the optimal workflow based on query complexity and artifact needs. Evaluated on three benchmarks, CBA outperformed vanilla LLM significantly (83.7% vs 41.7% average match rate, 82.0% vs 20.0% pass rate). The routing design achieved better quality metrics while maintaining low latency compared to single-mode approaches. The system demonstrates effective trade-offs between response quality and speed for compliance-related enterprise queries.

## Method Summary
The system implements a two-mode architecture with a lightweight LLM router (Llama 3.1-8B) that classifies incoming queries as either generic knowledge requests (routing to FastTrack) or artifact-specific/complex requests (routing to FullAgentic). FastTrack performs single-step RAG retrieval with GPT-4o generation, while FullAgentic uses a ReAct agent to orchestrate multiple tools including artifact fetch, semantic search, knowledge retrieval, and specialist models. The router uses 10 in-context examples and no fine-tuning, with concurrent tool execution enabled in FullAgentic to reduce latency.

## Key Results
- CBA achieved 83.7% average match rate versus 41.7% for vanilla LLM across three benchmarks
- Pass rate improved from 20.0% to 82.0% when using CBA versus single-mode approaches
- Router demonstrated 86.7% accuracy in distinguishing between query types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Query Complexity Routing
A lightweight LLM can classify incoming queries by complexity to select the minimal sufficient processing path. Llama 3.1-8B inspects the user query with a crafted prompt and 10 in-context examples, routing to FastTrack if no internal artifacts are needed, else to FullAgentic. Core assumption: Query complexity and tool requirements can be inferred from query text alone. Evidence: Router demonstrates 86.7% overall accuracy; misrouting occurs on borderline queries.

### Mechanism 2: RAG-Augmented Fast Responses
Single-step retrieval combined with an LLM provides sufficient grounding for generic compliance knowledge queries. FastTrack executes one RAG call against semantically chunked knowledge corpora, injects retrieved context into the prompt, and generates a response with GPT-4o. Core assumption: Simple queries do not require multi-hop reasoning or entity-specific lookups. Evidence: FastTrack effective for single-step retrieval; insufficient for queries requiring synthesis across multiple documents.

### Mechanism 3: ReAct-Based Multi-Step Tool Orchestration
Interleaved reasoning and action execution enables complex compliance tasks requiring multiple information sources and API calls. FullAgentic runs a ReAct loop where the agent plans which tools to use, executes tools iteratively, reasons over outputs, and generates a grounded response. Core assumption: Tool descriptions and example usage scenarios are sufficient for the LLM to plan correct execution sequences. Evidence: Effective for complex queries; observed incorrect tool selection produces fast but low-quality answers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) paradigm
  - Why needed here: FullAgentic depends on ReAct for iterative tool selection and reasoning
  - Quick check question: Why does interleaving reasoning steps with tool executions outperform pure chain-of-thought for tasks requiring external information?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: FastTrack and parts of FullAgentic rely on retrieval services for context
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between semantic chunking and fixed-size chunking for document indexing?

- Concept: LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation
  - Why needed here: Pass rate metric uses an LLM grader to assess freeform answer quality
  - Quick check question: What biases might arise when using an LLM to evaluate another LLM's outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Router (Llama 3.1-8B) → classifies query → FastTrack or FullAgentic → GPT-4o → response
- Critical path: Router decision gates all downstream processing; FullAgentic multi-step execution dominates worst-case latency
- Design tradeoffs: Router adds ~1-2s latency but avoids unnecessary agentic overhead; larger router models improve accuracy but increase latency; concurrent tool execution reduces latency but requires dependency analysis
- Failure signatures: Misrouting (generic queries to FullAgentic or artifact queries to FastTrack); incorrect tool selection; context overflow in multi-tool queries
- First 3 experiments: 1) Replicate router accuracy with 15 labeled queries across different model sizes; 2) Ablate routing by comparing full CBA against FastTrack-only and FullAgentic-only; 3) Profile latency per component to identify optimization targets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does CBA perform in live production environments regarding user adoption and task completion compared to static benchmarks?
- To what extent does incorporating real-time feedback from privacy specialists improve router classification for borderline queries?
- How does the agent's planning efficiency and latency scale as the number of available tools increases?

## Limitations

- Router relies on query text alone without conversation history, potentially misclassifying complex multi-turn queries
- Proprietary enterprise artifacts and specialist models limit generalizability to other organizations
- Evaluation benchmarks represent limited compliance scenarios and may not capture edge cases in real environments

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Routing mechanism improves performance over single-mode baselines; router demonstrates strong classification accuracy; concurrent tool execution reduces latency without sacrificing quality

**Medium Confidence:** CBA maintains acceptable latency while improving quality; current routing threshold represents optimal balance; ReAct orchestration is superior to RAG-only for complex queries

**Low Confidence:** Performance would scale similarly with larger knowledge bases; improvements would persist across different compliance domains; LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation provides reliable quality assessment

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness Testing:** Evaluate CBA on a larger, more diverse set of compliance queries (minimum 200 samples) spanning multiple enterprise domains and query types, including multi-turn conversations

2. **Router Threshold Optimization:** Systematically vary the router's classification threshold and measure the resulting quality-latency trade-off curve to identify optimal settings for different enterprise contexts

3. **Component Ablation Study:** Conduct detailed ablation analysis removing individual components (router, concurrent execution, specialist models) to quantify their specific contributions to overall performance and identify optimization targets
