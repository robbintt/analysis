# LLP: LLM-based Product Pricing in E-commerce
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09347
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09347
- Reference count: 40
- First LLM-based framework for second-hand product pricing on C2C platforms

## Executive Summary
LLP introduces the first LLM-based framework for second-hand product pricing on C2C e-commerce platforms. It addresses challenges in capturing market dynamics and understanding fine-grained product descriptions by retrieving similar products and leveraging LLM reasoning to generate accurate price suggestions. The system is optimized via supervised fine-tuning and group relative policy optimization on a dataset constructed through bidirectional reasoning. LLP achieves strong performance, raising static adoption rates from 40% to 72% at 30% coverage and maintaining 47% at 90% recall. It has been successfully deployed on Xianyu, demonstrating significant improvements over previous pricing methods.

## Method Summary
LLP addresses second-hand product pricing challenges by combining retrieval of similar products with LLM reasoning capabilities. The framework retrieves comparable items and uses LLM to analyze fine-grained product descriptions and market dynamics. It employs supervised fine-tuning and group relative policy optimization using a dataset built through bidirectional reasoning. The approach aims to generate accurate price suggestions that sellers are willing to accept, improving upon traditional rule-based pricing methods that struggle with the complexity and variability of second-hand marketplaces.

## Key Results
- Static adoption rates increased from 40% to 72% at 30% coverage
- Maintained 47% static adoption rate at 90% recall
- Successfully deployed on Xianyu with significant improvements over previous pricing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages LLMs' reasoning capabilities to understand complex product attributes and market dynamics that traditional pricing systems miss. By retrieving similar products as context and using bidirectional reasoning to construct training data, LLP can generate more accurate and acceptable price suggestions. The combination of retrieval-based context and LLM reasoning addresses the limitations of both pure rule-based systems and black-box ML models.

## Foundational Learning
- **Product Retrieval Systems**: Needed to find comparable items for pricing context; quick check: retrieval precision and recall metrics
- **LLM Fine-tuning**: Required to adapt general reasoning to specific pricing tasks; quick check: loss curves and validation accuracy
- **Group Relative Policy Optimization**: Used to optimize pricing suggestions based on relative performance; quick check: policy improvement over baseline
- **Bidirectional Reasoning**: Technique for constructing training data by reasoning both from products to prices and vice versa; quick check: data quality and coverage
- **Static Adoption Rate**: Key metric measuring seller acceptance of price suggestions; quick check: A/B testing with control group
- **Coverage vs Recall Tradeoff**: Balance between suggestion frequency and accuracy; quick check: precision-recall curves

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Product Database -> Retrieval Engine -> LLM Processor -> Price Generator -> Optimization Module
**Critical Path**: Retrieval Engine -> LLM Processor -> Price Generator
**Design Tradeoffs**: Retrieval quality vs. computational cost; LLM complexity vs. inference latency; coverage vs. accuracy
**Failure Signatures**: Poor retrieval results leading to inaccurate pricing; LLM hallucinations producing unreasonable prices; optimization instability causing suggestion inconsistency
**First Experiments**:
1. Measure retrieval precision and recall for product similarity
2. Test LLM pricing accuracy with ground truth validation
3. Evaluate static adoption rates in controlled A/B tests

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy dependency on retrieval quality for similar products
- Limited evaluation to single platform (Xianyu) raising generalizability concerns
- Unclear performance across different product categories and edge cases

## Confidence
High confidence in core technical contribution and framework architecture
Medium confidence in performance claims due to single-platform evaluation
Medium confidence in practical deployment claims without operational details

## Next Checks
1. Test LLP framework on multiple C2C e-commerce platforms with different product categories and user demographics
2. Conduct systematic evaluation of pricing performance for specialized, rare, or highly unique products
3. Implement controlled experiments measuring not just adoption rates but actual transaction outcomes and seller satisfaction
