# Fin-R1: A Large Language Model for Financial Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16252
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16252
- Reference count: 27
- A 7-billion parameter financial reasoning model achieving 75.2 average score on financial benchmarks, ranking second overall with best-in-class results on FinQA (76.0) and ConvFinQA (85.0).

## Executive Summary
Fin-R1 is a compact 7-billion parameter language model designed to address challenges in financial AI applications including fragmented data sources, intransparent reasoning processes, and weak business transferability. The authors develop a high-quality bilingual dataset of 60,091 chain-of-thought samples through data distillation and filtering from multiple financial benchmarks. Using a two-stage training pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization, Fin-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on financial reasoning benchmarks while maintaining transparent reasoning processes. Despite its compact size, the model demonstrates practical utility in compliance checking and robo-advisory applications.

## Method Summary
The Fin-R1 training pipeline consists of two stages: first, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Fin-R1-Data, a 60,091-sample bilingual dataset distilled from multiple financial benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-671B and filtered via Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct based on answer correctness and reasoning quality. Second, reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applied to objective questions using format and accuracy rewards. The format reward enforces structured outputs with explicit reasoning traces, while the accuracy reward uses Qwen2.5-Max to judge semantic equivalence with ground truth. GRPO optimizes these rewards using group-relative advantages without a separate value network, with KL regularization to prevent policy collapse.

## Key Results
- Fin-R1 achieves 75.2 average score on financial benchmarks, ranking second overall among tested models.
- Best-in-class performance on FinQA (76.0) and ConvFinQA (85.0), demonstrating superior reasoning capabilities.
- Outperforms larger models including Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (65.6) and GPT-4o (74.2) on average benchmark scores.
- Practical utility demonstrated through successful applications in compliance checking and robo-advisory scenarios.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Curated chain-of-thought data distilled from a strong teacher model and filtered via LLM judges improves financial reasoning performance.
- Mechanism: DeepSeek-R1-671B generates reasoning traces and answers for raw financial questions; Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct filters outputs via answer-check and reasoning-selection steps to retain only logically consistent, domain-aligned samples, yielding Fin-R1-Data (60,091 entries).
- Core assumption: The teacher model's reasoning patterns are both transferable to a smaller student and reliably evaluable by an LLM judge.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states Fin-R1-Data consists of 60,091 chain-of-thought samples distilled and filtered from authoritative benchmarks; Section 3.2 describes distillation with DeepSeek-R1-671B and filtering via Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct with high accuracy metrics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sequential training with supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning via GRPO improves both reasoning accuracy and output structure beyond either stage alone.
- Mechanism: SFT on Fin-R1-Data teaches the model to generate structured outputs with explicit reasoning traces; GRPO then optimizes the policy using format and accuracy rewards computed from multiple sampled outputs per question, without learning a separate value network.
- Core assumption: SFT establishes a stable behavioral prior (reasoning format and domain patterns) that GRPO can refine without collapsing; group-relative advantages sufficiently approximate value estimates.
- Evidence anchors: Table 2 ablation shows clear performance gains from full pipeline over individual stages; Section 4.2 details GRPO's advantage calculation and policy update with KL regularization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explicit format rewards coupled with accuracy rewards enforce interpretable, structured reasoning while maintaining correctness.
- Mechanism: The format reward R_fmt requires outputs to enclose reasoning in ⋯\boxed{}; the accuracy reward R_acc uses Qwen2.5-Max to judge semantic equivalence with ground truth. GRPO optimizes the sum R = R_fmt + R_acc.
- Core assumption: The evaluator model can reliably judge semantic equivalence for numerical and textual financial answers; format constraints do not hamper expressive reasoning.
- Evidence anchors: Equations 4.2-4.3 define R_fmt and R_acc; Figure 6 shows structured SFT data; Section 5.1 discusses LLM-as-judge evaluation handling decimal/format variations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
  - Why needed here: Fin-R1-Data and the entire training pipeline assume the model can follow and generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing final answers.
  - Quick check question: Given a multi-step financial calculation, can you explicitly write out each intermediate step before the final answer?

- Concept: Policy gradient methods and advantage functions
  - Why needed here: GRPO is a policy-gradient algorithm that uses group-relative advantages to update the model; understanding baseline subtraction and variance reduction is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why does subtracting a baseline (e.g., group mean reward) from the raw reward reduce variance in policy gradient estimates?

- Concept: Importance sampling and KL regularization in RL
  - Why needed here: GRPO uses importance sampling ratios and clips them; KL divergence to the SFT policy regularizes updates to prevent collapse.
  - Quick check question: What goes wrong if the importance sampling ratio is allowed to become arbitrarily large during policy updates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw financial datasets → DeepSeek-R1-671B distillation → Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct filtering (answer check + reasoning selection) → Fin-R1-Data (60k bilingual CoT samples) → Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (base) → SFT on Fin-R1-Data → GRPO on objective questions with format and accuracy rewards → Fin-R1 model.

- Critical path: 1. Prepare and validate Fin-R1-Data quality (judge alignment, format consistency). 2. Run SFT to convergence; verify structured output format adoption. 3. Configure GRPO hyperparameters (group size G, clip ε, KL β, learning rate η); run RL on objective-question subset.

- Design tradeoffs: Judge model choice (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct vs GPT-4o) affects filtering accuracy and regularity; group size G in GRPO balances advantage estimate stability against compute; KL coefficient β controls exploration vs preservation of SFT behavior.

- Failure signatures: GRPO-only (no SFT) produces incoherent outputs; SFT-only plateaus below full pipeline performance; small G leads to noisy advantages; large β stifles exploration; misconfigured prompts for LLM-as-judge increase irregularity.

- First 3 experiments: 1. Reproduce the ablation: train Fin-R1-SFT and Fin-R1-Zero on a subset of Fin-R1-Data; compare to full Fin-R1 to validate the SFT→GRPO gain. 2. Sweep group size G ∈ {2, 4, 8, 16} on a held-out benchmark (e.g., FinQA) to characterize stability vs compute. 3. Evaluate judge robustness: compare Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct vs GPT-4o on answer-check and reasoning-selection tasks using human-annotated samples to replicate Table 5 and Figure 17 findings.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How can Fin-R1's architecture be refined to effectively process financial multimodal data (e.g., charts, time-series) while maintaining the efficiency of a 7B-parameter model?
  - Basis in paper: The conclusion states the authors "will refine Fin-R1's architecture to accommodate financial multimodal data and deepen its application in cutting-edge areas."
  - Why unresolved: The current implementation focuses on text-based reasoning; adding multimodal capabilities typically requires visual encoders that may increase the model size and deployment cost.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A variant of Fin-R1 that integrates a vision encoder and performs successfully on multimodal financial benchmarks (e.g., FinVQA) without exceeding the computational constraints of the 7B scale.

- **Question:** Can reinforcement learning (specifically GRPO) be stabilized to generate coherent reasoning chains without the dependency on a large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage?
  - Basis in paper: The ablation study shows Fin-R1-Zero (trained solely with GRPO) produces incoherent outputs, while the SFT stage is required to enforce the "think before answering" paradigm.
  - Why unresolved: The current pipeline relies on SFT to structure the output space; whether RL alone can discover and stabilize explicit reasoning patterns from scratch remains a methodological gap.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A training configuration where GRPO initializes from the base model and converges to structured, interpretable reasoning without mimicking expert CoT demonstrations.

- **Question:** Does the reliance on specific LLM judges (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) for data filtering and reward calculation introduce a performance ceiling or bias relative to the judge's capabilities?
  - Basis in paper: The methodology relies on the "LLM-as-Judge" paradigm for both filtering the 60k dataset and computing accuracy rewards during RL.
  - Why unresolved: Distillation and RL optimization might force the student model to replicate the judge's errors or hallucinations rather than learning ground-truth financial logic.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments evaluating Fin-R1 when trained with different judge models or against a human-annotated gold standard to identify variance attributable to the judge.

- **Question:** How can Fin-R1 be integrated with dynamic risk management systems to handle evolving regulatory requirements without requiring frequent, full retraining?
  - Basis in paper: The conclusion outlines the future goal to "foster deeper integration with risk management and regulatory compliance."
  - Why unresolved: The current model is trained on a static snapshot of data; real-world compliance requires adapting to new laws and market conditions which static weights cannot capture.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An architectural extension (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation) allowing Fin-R1 to dynamically reference updated regulatory documents and adjust its reasoning accordingly.

## Limitations

- The study relies heavily on LLM-as-judge evaluations for both data filtering and reward computation, introducing potential evaluation bias and compounding error, though alignment with human judgments is reported.
- Training hyperparameters for both SFT and GRPO stages are not fully specified, particularly learning rates, batch sizes, iteration counts, and KL penalty coefficient β, limiting reproducibility.
- The evaluation focuses on specific benchmarks (FinQA, ConvFinQA, Ant-Finance, TFNS) and may not generalize to broader financial domains or real-world deployment scenarios.
- The 60,091-sample Fin-R1-Data dataset size, while substantial, is relatively small compared to general-purpose LLM training corpora, raising questions about long-tail coverage and domain robustness.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The two-stage training pipeline (SFT followed by GRPO) improves performance over either stage alone, as evidenced by the clear ablation results in Table 2.
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific architectural choices (DeepSeek-R1-671B for distillation, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct for filtering, group-relative advantages in GRPO) are optimal for this problem. While the approach is well-justified, alternative choices may yield similar or better results.
- **Medium Confidence:** The reported benchmark scores (75.2 average, 76.0 on FinQA, 85.0 on ConvFinQA) accurately reflect the model's capabilities. The LLM-as-judge methodology is reasonable but introduces evaluation uncertainty.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce the ablation study:** Train Fin-R1-SFT and Fin-R1-Zero models on a subset of Fin-R1-Data and compare their performance to full Fin-R1 on held-out benchmarks to verify the SFT→GRPO performance gain.

2. **Evaluate judge model robustness:** Compare Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct against GPT-4o (or another strong judge) on answer-check and reasoning-selection tasks using human-annotated samples to quantify evaluation bias and alignment.

3. **Sweep GRPO hyperparameters:** Systematically vary group size G, KL penalty coefficient β, and learning rate in GRPO to characterize their impact on performance and identify optimal settings for stable training.
