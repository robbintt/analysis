# ExeKGLib: A Platform for Machine Learning Analytics based on Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00394
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00394
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: ExeKGLib enables non-ML experts to develop ML pipelines using knowledge graphs

## Executive Summary
ExeKGLib is a platform designed to make machine learning pipeline development accessible to non-ML experts by leveraging knowledge graphs. The system encodes ML knowledge in simple, accessible terms that can be translated into executable data pipelines. It provides a Python-based solution with a graphical interface layer, allowing users with minimal ML knowledge to build, validate, and execute ML pipelines. The platform was successfully evaluated in an industrial setting at Bosch, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.

## Method Summary
ExeKGLib utilizes a multi-level knowledge graph approach, employing one upper-level and three lower-level KG schemata to describe ML, Statistics, and Visualization tasks. The system translates these knowledge graph representations into executable pipelines while maintaining transparency and reusability. The platform includes both a Python library and a graphical interface, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. The evaluation was conducted in collaboration with Bosch, focusing on practical applications such as welding quality monitoring and optimization.

## Key Results
- Successfully enabled non-ML experts to build and execute ML pipelines
- Demonstrated enhanced communication between domain experts and ML specialists
- Achieved transparency and reusability scores above 4 in user studies
- Validated effectiveness in industrial setting at Bosch for welding quality monitoring

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ExeKGLib works by abstracting complex ML concepts into knowledge graph representations that non-experts can understand and manipulate. The system bridges the gap between domain expertise and ML implementation by providing an intuitive interface that translates user-friendly knowledge graph inputs into executable ML pipelines. This approach maintains the technical rigor of ML while making it accessible through familiar conceptual frameworks.

## Foundational Learning

1. Knowledge Graph Schema Design
   - Why needed: To structure ML concepts in an accessible, hierarchical manner
   - Quick check: Verify schema captures essential ML concepts without oversimplification

2. Pipeline Translation Mechanism
   - Why needed: To convert knowledge graph representations into executable code
   - Quick check: Test translation accuracy across different ML task types

3. User Interface Design
   - Why needed: To make the system accessible to non-technical users
   - Quick check: Validate interface usability through user testing
