# A Survey of Foundation Models for Environmental Science

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.03142
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03142
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive survey of foundation models in environmental science, covering applications, methodologies, and future directions

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of foundation models in environmental science, examining their applications across forward prediction, data generation, data assimilation, downscaling, model ensembling, and decision-making. The authors explore how these models leverage large-scale pre-training to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns and adapt across diverse environmental tasks.

The survey outlines a systematic approach to model design, including data collection, architecture design, training, tuning, and evaluation, providing a roadmap for developing robust, scalable models tailored to environmental challenges. By highlighting current advancements and future opportunities, the authors aim to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and accelerate the adoption of foundation models for sustainable environmental solutions.

## Method Summary
This survey synthesizes existing literature on foundation models in environmental science through a comprehensive review of applications, methodologies, and emerging trends. The authors systematically categorize applications into forward prediction, data generation, data assimilation, downscaling, model ensembling, and decision-making. They analyze model design methodologies including data collection strategies, architectural considerations, training approaches, and evaluation frameworks. The survey identifies key challenges and opportunities in the field, providing insights into the development of robust and scalable foundation models for environmental applications.

## Key Results
- Foundation models effectively capture complex spatiotemporal patterns in environmental data
- Multi-modal data integration is a key strength of foundation models in environmental applications
- Large-scale pre-training enables adaptation across diverse environmental science tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Foundation models work effectively in environmental science because they can learn rich representations from massive amounts of heterogeneous data, capturing complex spatiotemporal relationships that traditional models struggle to represent. The pre-training phase allows these models to develop a general understanding of environmental patterns before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. This approach is particularly valuable in environmental science where data can be sparse, noisy, or incomplete, and where understanding multi-process interdependencies is crucial. The ability to integrate diverse data sources (satellite imagery, sensor networks, climate models) through a unified framework enables more comprehensive and accurate environmental modeling.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spatiotemporal modeling** - why needed: Environmental processes are inherently spatiotemporal, requiring models to capture both spatial patterns and temporal dynamics; quick check: Evaluate model performance on temporal forecasting tasks with varying lead times
- **Multi-modal data fusion** - why needed: Environmental data comes from diverse sources (remote sensing, in-situ measurements, models) that must be integrated; quick check: Test model performance when adding new data modalities to existing trained models
- **Transfer learning** - why needed: Environmental tasks often have limited labeled data but benefit from knowledge transfer; quick check: Measure performance degradation when fine-tuning on smaller target domains

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input preprocessing -> Foundation model backbone -> Task-specific head -> Output layer

**Critical path:** Raw environmental data → Preprocessing (normalization, temporal alignment) → Foundation model encoding → Task-specific adaptation → Prediction/output

**Design tradeoffs:** Balancing model complexity with computational efficiency, choosing between unified vs. task-specific architectures, deciding on pre-training objectives that best capture environmental patterns

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance on rare events indicates insufficient training data diversity, degraded accuracy in extreme conditions suggests inadequate representation learning, failure to generalize across spatial scales indicates architecture limitations

**First experiments:**
1. Evaluate foundation model performance on standard environmental forecasting benchmarks (e.g., temperature, precipitation)
2. Test multi-modal integration by combining satellite imagery with ground sensor data
3. Assess transfer learning capabilities by fine-tuning on downstream tasks with limited labeled data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Rapid pace of development may make some applications and methodologies outdated quickly
- Focus on certain environmental science applications may overlook emerging use cases
- Long-term scalability and sustainability of models in real-world applications remain uncertain
