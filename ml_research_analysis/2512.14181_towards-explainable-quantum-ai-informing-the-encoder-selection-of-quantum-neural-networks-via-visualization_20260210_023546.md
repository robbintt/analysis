# Towards Explainable Quantum AI: Informing the Encoder Selection of Quantum Neural Networks via Visualization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.14181
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14181
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces XQAI-Eyes, a visualization tool that bridges classical and quantum perspectives to enable informed selection and understanding of quantum encoders in QNNs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of encoder selection and interpretability in Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) by introducing XQAI-Eyes, a visualization tool that extracts and visualizes encoded quantum states as interpretable scalar values. The tool employs Encoder Expectation Measurement to bridge classical and quantum perspectives, providing an intuitive interface with multiple views for analyzing encoder performance across different datasets. Evaluations across 60 encoder-dataset combinations demonstrate that XQAI-Eyes significantly enhances transparency and usability in QNN development, enabling developers to reason about encoder performance and make informed decisions. Case studies reveal two key practices: aligning encoder features with dataset characteristics and ensuring clear class separability in encoded states.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces XQAI-Eyes, a visualization tool designed to address the challenge of selecting and understanding quantum encoders in Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). The core innovation is the Encoder Expectation Measurement technique, which extracts encoded quantum states and visualizes them as interpretable scalar values, effectively bridging classical and quantum perspectives. The tool features an intuitive interface with multiple views: original data, encoded data evolution, encoder maps, quantum distribution maps, trained maps, and performance analysis. This comprehensive visualization framework allows developers to analyze how different encoders transform classical data into quantum states and how these transformations impact QNN performance. The evaluation was conducted across 60 encoder-dataset combinations to validate the tool's effectiveness in enabling informed encoder selection and enhancing transparency in QNN development.

## Key Results
- XQAI-Eyes enables developers to reason about encoder performance through intuitive visualization of encoded quantum states
- Case studies reveal two key practices: aligning encoder features with dataset characteristics and ensuring clear class separability in encoded states
- Evaluations across 60 encoder-dataset combinations demonstrate the tool's effectiveness in enhancing transparency and usability in QNN development

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The tool works by extracting quantum states from encoders using Encoder Expectation Measurement and visualizing these states as interpretable scalar values, creating a bridge between classical data and quantum representations that developers can understand and analyze.

## Foundational Learning
- **Encoder Expectation Measurement**: Technique to extract and quantify quantum states from encoders; needed to convert quantum information into interpretable classical values
- **Quantum distribution maps**: Visual representation of quantum state distributions; needed to show how different encoders transform data in quantum space
- **Class separability analysis**: Evaluation of how well encoded states distinguish between different classes; needed to assess encoder effectiveness for classification tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Classical Data -> Encoder Expectation Measurement -> Interpretable Scalar Values -> Visualization Views (Original, Encoded Evolution, Encoder Maps, Quantum Distribution Maps, Trained Maps, Performance Analysis)

### Critical Path
1. Input classical data and select encoder
2. Apply Encoder Expectation Measurement to extract quantum states
3. Generate scalar representations of encoded states
4. Display visualizations across all interface views
5. Analyze performance metrics and patterns

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Explicit vs Implicit**: Explicit visualization of quantum states (requires complex measurement) vs implicit black-box approach (easier but less interpretable)
- **Static vs Dynamic**: Static snapshots of encoded states vs dynamic evolution tracking over training epochs
- **Scalar vs Vector**: Scalar values for simplicity vs vector representations for richer information (at cost of complexity)

### Failure Signatures
- Poor class separability in quantum distribution maps indicates encoder inadequacy
- Inconsistent patterns between original and encoded data evolution suggest misalignment
- Low performance metrics despite clear visualizations indicate potential implementation issues

### First 3 Experiments
1. Apply XQAI-Eyes to a simple dataset with known optimal encoder to validate baseline functionality
2. Test multiple encoders on the same dataset to observe comparative visualization patterns
3. Evaluate encoder performance on increasingly complex datasets to assess scalability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on 60 encoder-dataset combinations without detailed characterization of dataset diversity
- Limited expert feedback validation without elaboration on feedback depth and reliability
- Scalability and performance bottlenecks not addressed for larger, more complex quantum systems

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation of XQAI-Eyes and Encoder Expectation Measurement technique
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness in improving transparency and usability based on case studies and expert feedback
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability across diverse quantum systems and datasets due to limited evaluation details

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive evaluation using a wider range of diverse datasets to assess scalability and robustness
2. Perform detailed quantitative analysis comparing QNN performance with and without XQAI-Eyes
3. Gather detailed feedback from a larger group of domain experts with varying experience levels in quantum computing
