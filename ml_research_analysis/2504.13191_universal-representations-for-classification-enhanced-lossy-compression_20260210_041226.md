# Universal Representations for Classification-enhanced Lossy Compression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.13191
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13191
- Reference count: 27
- This paper explores universal representations in lossy compression, showing that fixed encoders with retrained decoders can approach specialized model performance for perceptual tasks but incur distortion penalties in classification-enhanced settings.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates universal representations for lossy compression, where a single encoder supports multiple decoding objectives across various distortion-classification tradeoffs. The work focuses on the rate-distortion-classification (RDC) tradeoff, building on prior work in rate-distortion-perception (RDP). Using a stochastic autoencoder architecture with GAN and classifier regularization on the MNIST dataset, the experiments show that reusing a fixed encoder with retrained decoders (universal models) can achieve performance close to specialized end-to-end models for perceptual compression tasks, confirming earlier findings. However, in the RDC setting, encoder reuse incurs a significant distortion penalty when applied to different classification-distortion tradeoff points, unless the tradeoff parameter is carefully adjusted. This highlights that while universal representations offer computational benefits, they may require careful parameter selection to maintain performance across different RDC objectives. The study suggests a practical pathway to simplify deep-learning-based compression system training by reducing the need for specialized encoders.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a stochastic autoencoder architecture where a fixed encoder is paired with multiple trained decoders to support different distortion-classification tradeoffs. The system incorporates GAN-based adversarial training and classifier regularization to balance rate, distortion, and classification accuracy. The experiments are conducted on the MNIST dataset, evaluating performance across various tradeoff parameters that control the relative importance of reconstruction quality versus classification accuracy. The universal representation approach involves training one encoder once, then retraining only the decoders for different objectives, contrasting with specialized end-to-end models trained separately for each tradeoff point.

## Key Results
- Universal models with fixed encoders and retrained decoders can achieve performance close to specialized end-to-end models for perceptual compression tasks
- In the RDC setting, encoder reuse incurs a significant distortion penalty when applied to different classification-distortion tradeoff points
- Careful adjustment of the tradeoff parameter is required to maintain performance across different RDC objectives when using universal representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Universal representations work by learning an encoder that captures information relevant across multiple decoding objectives. The encoder learns to preserve features that are useful for both reconstruction and classification, while the decoders specialize for specific tradeoff points. This approach exploits the observation that different tasks often share common underlying representations, allowing computational efficiency through parameter sharing while maintaining reasonable performance across objectives.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Stochastic Encoder -> Latent Representation -> Multiple Decoders (per tradeoff point)

Critical Path:
Encoder training -> Fixed representation learning -> Decoder specialization for each tradeoff point

Design Tradeoffs:
- Fixed encoder provides computational efficiency but may limit optimal performance at extreme tradeoff points
- Multiple decoders increase storage requirements but allow specialization
- GAN regularization improves perceptual quality but adds training complexity
- Classifier regularization balances accuracy with compression but requires careful hyperparameter tuning

Failure Signatures:
- Large performance gap between universal and specialized models indicates encoder limitations
- Unstable training suggests improper balance between reconstruction, classification, and adversarial objectives
- Poor generalization across tradeoff points indicates encoder failure to capture universal features

First Experiments:
1. Train universal model on MNIST with varying tradeoff parameters
2. Compare performance of universal vs. specialized models across all tradeoff points
3. Analyze latent representations to identify shared vs. task-specific features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experiments are conducted exclusively on the MNIST dataset, limiting generalizability to complex visual domains
- The analysis focuses on rate-distortion-classification tradeoffs without exploring other perceptual quality metrics
- Only one specific autoencoder architecture is tested, leaving open whether results generalize to alternative designs

## Confidence
- High confidence in experimental methodology and reproducibility on MNIST
- Medium confidence in generalizability to other datasets and tasks
- Medium confidence in practical implications for deep compression system design

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the experiments on more complex datasets (CIFAR-10 or ImageNet) to assess scalability of universal representations
2. Test alternative autoencoder architectures (e.g., VAEs, normalizing flows) to determine if architecture choice affects universal representation performance
3. Extend the analysis to include additional perceptual quality metrics beyond classification accuracy to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality across tradeoff points
