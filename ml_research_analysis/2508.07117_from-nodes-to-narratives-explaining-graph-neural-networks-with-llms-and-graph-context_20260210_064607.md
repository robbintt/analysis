# From Nodes to Narratives: Explaining Graph Neural Networks with LLMs and Graph Context

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.07117
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07117
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LOGIC achieves 94.6% fidelity on CORA with explanation size ~1.3, outperforming traditional explainers while maintaining human-centric interpretability.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LOGIC, a lightweight post-hoc explanation framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on text-attributed graphs. The core idea is to project GNN node embeddings into the LLM embedding space and interleave them with natural language tokens in a hybrid prompt, enabling LLMs to generate natural language explanations and concise subgraphs for GNN predictions. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off between fidelity (94.6% on CORA) and sparsity (explanation size ~1.3), significantly improving human-centric metrics like insightfulness and trustworthiness compared to traditional explainers like GNNExplainer. The method is training-agnostic, plug-and-play, and demonstrates strong performance across multiple GNN and LLM architectures.

## Method Summary
LOGIC operates by first training a lightweight projector to map GNN node embeddings into the LLM embedding space using context alignment and contrastive losses. For each target node, a hybrid prompt is constructed by interleaving the projected embeddings (as soft prompts) with natural language tokens from the graph structure and computation tree. A frozen LLM then generates natural language explanations and binary support decisions for each neighbor. These decisions are parsed and refined into explanation subgraphs with a sparsity constraint. The method is training-agnostic, requiring only a pre-trained GNN and LLM, and can be applied to any text-attributed graph classification task.

## Key Results
- Achieves 94.6% fidelity on CORA with explanation size ~1.3, outperforming GNNExplainer (86.4% fidelity, size 2.0)
- Shows 1.3-3.2x improvement in human-centric metrics (insightfulness, trustworthiness, helpfulness) over baseline explainers
- Demonstrates consistent performance across GCN, GIN, and GAT architectures, though with some degradation for structure-heavy models
- Requires no LLM fine-tuning, making it computationally efficient and widely applicable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Modal Embedding Projection
The projector maps GNN node embeddings into LLM token space using context alignment and contrastive losses, enabling semantic reasoning over learned graph representations. This alignment allows LLMs to process GNN embeddings as native semantic information.

### Mechanism 2: Hybrid Prompt Interleaving
Soft projected embeddings are interleaved with natural language tokens in hybrid prompts, allowing LLMs to simultaneously reason over both latent graph structure and human-interpretable text. This creates a unified reasoning process across modalities.

### Mechanism 3: Label Attribution and Subgraph Refinement
LLM-generated binary support decisions are converted into faithful explanation subgraphs through structured parsing and sparsity constraints. This ensures explanations remain both interpretable and faithful to the GNN's decision logic.

## Foundational Learning

- **GNN Message Passing and Node Embeddings**: Understanding how GNNs aggregate neighbor information into node representations is essential since LOGIC operates on pre-classification embeddings. Quick check: Given a 2-layer GCN, what information does the embedding of node v at layer 2 contain about its 2-hop neighborhood?

- **Soft Prompting in LLMs**: The projector outputs continuous token embeddings (soft prompts) that are directly concatenated with discrete token embeddings, bypassing the LLM's input embedding lookup. Quick check: How does a soft prompt differ from prepending text tokens to an LLM input?

- **Contrastive Learning Objectives**: The projector uses a contrastive loss to preserve similarity structure from GNN space. Understanding InfoNCE-style objectives helps diagnose alignment failures. Quick check: In L_contrast, what happens to the loss if all projected embeddings collapse to the same vector?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Trained GNN → Node embeddings → Projector → Soft prompts → Hybrid prompt constructor → Frozen LLM → Parser + Refinement → Explanation subgraph

- **Critical path**: 1) Train projector on node embeddings from frozen GNN using context alignment + contrastive losses. 2) Construct hybrid prompt with computation tree. 3) LLM generates support decisions; aggregate into subgraph with size constraint.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Projector complexity vs. training-free alternatives; fidelity vs. sparsity through size constraint p; temperature τ and balance β control contrastive loss behavior.

- **Failure signatures**: Low fidelity with large explanations (projector alignment failure); high hallucination rate (too many nodes in prompt); GIN/GAT models show lower fidelity than GCN (architecture-aware projector needed).

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Projector ablation with β ∈ {0.0, 0.5, 1.0} on CORA validation set. 2) Soft prompt token count k ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8} to determine minimum tokens needed. 3) Computation tree depth variation to identify fidelity plateaus vs. context limits.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Tailored Projector Objectives**: How can training objectives for the projector be specifically optimized for explanation tasks rather than relying on general context alignment or contrastive losses? The current objectives don't explicitly optimize for semantic quality or fidelity of final explanations.

2. **Batching Without Hallucinations**: What technical mechanisms can mitigate soft prompt interference to enable batching multiple nodes without inducing hallucinations? Current requirement for individual node processing limits scalability.

3. **Formal Faithfulness Guarantees**: How can the framework provide formal guarantees of faithfulness to the GNN's internal decision logic? The LLM interpretation layer creates a gap between explanation and true model mechanics.

4. **Structural Information Adaptation**: How can the projection mechanism be adapted for GNN architectures that rely heavily on structural information rather than attribute semantics? Current approach shows significant fidelity drop for structure-heavy models like GIN.

## Limitations

- **Architecture Dependency**: Performance critically depends on GNN architecture used during projector training, with significant fidelity degradation when applied to structure-heavy models like GIN/GAT.

- **Training Procedure Opacity**: Critical hyperparameters including projector architecture, learning rate, training epochs, and size constraint parameter p are not specified, creating reproduction barriers.

- **Scalability Constraints**: Soft prompt interference in batching forces individual node processing, limiting computational efficiency for large graphs and raising questions about practical scalability.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core mechanism of projecting GNN embeddings into LLM space and interleaving with natural language tokens is well-specified and technically sound.

- **Medium Confidence**: Projector training methodology is theoretically justified but optimal hyperparameter settings lack empirical validation; reported fidelity scores appear robust but may be architecture-dependent.

- **Low Confidence**: Exact implementation details for hallucination filtering, computation tree construction, and size constraint parameters remain underspecified; scalability implications of individual node processing are not fully addressed.

## Next Checks

1. **Projector Architecture Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary projector MLP depth (1-3 layers) and width (32-256 units) while training on CORA, measuring fidelity and hallucination rates to identify optimal architecture specifications.

2. **GNN Architecture Transferability Test**: Train LOGIC projector using GCN embeddings, then evaluate explanation fidelity when applied to GIN and GAT models on same datasets to quantify architecture-dependent performance degradation.

3. **Scaling and Batching Experiment**: Compare individual node processing versus batched processing with varying batch sizes (2, 4, 8 nodes), measuring hallucination rates, processing time, and fidelity to characterize scalability limits of soft prompt interference.
