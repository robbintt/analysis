- One-line primary result: Oncology-specialized NLP framework integrating instruction tuning, RAG, and graph knowledge achieves strong cross-lingual performance with minimal data

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an oncology-specialized NLP framework that integrates instruction tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and graph-based knowledge integration to address challenges in processing unstructured clinical oncology data. The framework leverages lightweight language models fine-tuned with minimal bilingual (English/German) instructions to improve cross-lingual adaptability and task performance. Evaluation on tasks including named entity recognition, relation extraction, TNM staging, and document classification demonstrates strong results, with F1 scores reaching up to 89.50% on standard biomedical benchmarks and significant improvements on oncology-specific datasets. Cross-lingual experiments show that even small amounts of non-English data (100-400 instructions) can effectively transfer knowledge across languages, improving tasks like ICD-10 coding and TNM staging in German. The approach balances high accuracy with reduced computational costs, making it suitable for resource-limited healthcare settings while maintaining strong performance across diverse oncology applications.

## Method Summary
The framework uses instruction tuning to align lightweight LLaMA models to oncology tasks through curated task-specific prompts, RAG with semantic chunking and FAISS indexing to ground outputs in clinical evidence, and graph-based knowledge integration via TransE embeddings to link entities to standardized ontologies. Models are evaluated on public biomedical benchmarks (NCBI-Disease, BC5CDR, i2b2, MedNLI, HoC) and oncology-specific datasets (TCGA pathology reports, restricted DUP-127 German dataset), with cross-lingual instruction tuning using 100-400 bilingual examples. The approach enables accurate oncology-specific tasks including NER, relation extraction, TNM staging, and document classification while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- F1 scores reach 89.50% on NCBI-Disease after instruction tuning
- Cross-lingual transfer with 100-400 German instructions improves ICD-10 coding by 5-6%
- Graph-RAG improves entity linking precision by 2.5% F1 on oncology tasks
- LLaMA-3.1-8B achieves best accuracy while maintaining efficiency
- Instruction tuning outperforms continued pretraining for domain alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Instruction tuning with domain-specific task prompts aligns lightweight LLMs to oncology workflows more efficiently than continued pretraining.
- Mechanism: Curated instruction-response pairs (e.g., "tag disease entities using BIO labeling") teach the model structured output formats and task-specific reasoning patterns. The loss function L_tuning = −(1/N) Σ log P(y|x, instruction) optimizes conditional generation toward clinically meaningful completions.
- Core assumption: The base LLM has sufficient latent medical knowledge from pretraining; the bottleneck is task formatting and domain vocabulary alignment, not knowledge acquisition.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our lightweight models prove effective at oncology-specific tasks, such as named entity recognition... TNM staging, document classification."
  - [section] Table 2 shows LLaMA-3.1-8B improving from 86.33% to 89.50% on NCBI-Disease after instruction tuning.
  - [corpus] Related work (FRACCO corpus, arXiv:2510.13873) confirms annotated oncology datasets remain scarce across languages, supporting the need for efficient tuning approaches.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with semantic chunking grounds model outputs in current clinical evidence without parameter updates.
- Mechanism: Queries and documents are encoded via oncology-fine-tuned sentence embeddings, indexed with FAISS, and retrieved via cosine similarity. Top-k chunks are appended to model input, providing real-time context from MIMIC-IV and German oncology reports.
- Core assumption: Relevant clinical information exists in retrievable form and similarity search correctly identifies contextually useful passages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RAG improves outputs by retrieving relevant clinical data from trusted sources."
  - [section] "Using RAG and Graph-RAG, the models matched gene-disease pairs more precisely" (p. 8).
  - [corpus] Clinical Knowledge Graph Construction (arXiv:2601.01844) reports similar RAG benefits for clinical narrative processing, though notes validation challenges.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Graph-based knowledge integration improves factual consistency by linking extracted entities to standardized ontologies (UMLS, SNOMED-CT, ICD-10).
- Mechanism: Entities are mapped to knowledge graph nodes; relationships (edges) encode verified medical relationships (e.g., "treated_with"). TransE embeddings enable semantic traversal, allowing the model to retrieve related concepts during inference.
- Core assumption: Knowledge graph coverage is sufficient for oncology terminology, and entity linking accuracy is high enough to avoid propagating errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Graph-based reasoning ensures outputs are reliable and factually grounded."
  - [section] "Graph-RAG improved entity linking by referencing established oncology guidelines, boosting F1 scores by 2.5%" (p. 8).
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is limited for graph-RAG specifically in oncology; related work focuses on general clinical KGs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Instruction Tuning vs. Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses instruction tuning (task-formatted prompts) rather than traditional fine-tuning (raw text continuation). Understanding this distinction is critical for reproducing results.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why instruction tuning with explicit task descriptions ("Tag entities using BIO labeling") would outperform standard language modeling on structured extraction tasks?

- **Concept: Dense Retrieval and FAISS Indexing**
  - Why needed here: RAG implementation requires understanding how sentence embeddings, similarity search, and vector databases work together.
  - Quick check question: Given a query embedding q and document embedding d, how would you rank documents by relevance? What preprocessing steps ensure embeddings capture medical semantics?

- **Concept: Knowledge Graph Embeddings (TransE)**
  - Why needed here: The graph component uses TransE for node/edge encoding. Without this, implementing graph-enhanced retrieval is impossible.
  - Quick check question: In TransE, how does the relationship "treated_with" between "adenocarcinoma" and "Osimertinib" get represented mathematically?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input Query → Sentence Encoder → FAISS Retrieval (top-k docs) → Knowledge Graph Lookup (UMLS/SNOMED/ICD-10) → LLaMA Model (instruction-tuned) → Structured Output (JSON/annotations)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Instruction dataset curation (bilingual English/German, 100-400 examples minimum for cross-lingual)
  2. Sentence embedding model fine-tuning on oncology corpus
  3. FAISS index construction from MIMIC-IV + German reports
  4. Knowledge graph construction from UMLS/SNOMED/ICD-10
  5. Instruction tuning of base LLaMA model
  6. Integration testing of RAG + Graph retrieval pipeline

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Model size vs. latency: LLaMA-3.2-1B is fastest but plateaus earlier; LLaMA-3.1-8B achieves best accuracy but requires more compute.
  - Instruction count vs. marginal gain: Paper shows diminishing returns after ~200 German instructions for simpler tasks; complex tasks benefit up to 400.
  - Retrieval granularity vs. context window: Semantic chunking improves precision but requires careful paragraph splitting to maintain coherence.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Confusion between similar biomarkers (EGFR vs. HER2) indicates insufficient contextual disambiguation.
  - Poor performance on rare genetic variants suggests sparse retrieval references.
  - Long German compound words causing ICD-10 coding errors indicates multilingual embedding limitations.
  - TNM staging failures on non-standard formulations reveal over-reliance on canonical terminology.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate instruction tuning on NCBI-Disease using LLaMA-2-7B with 200 English instructions; verify F1 improvement from ~85% to ~88% baseline.
  2. Test cross-lingual transfer: Add 100 German instructions, measure ICD-10 coding accuracy change. Expected: +5-6% improvement per paper findings.
  3. Ablate RAG vs. Graph-RAG on TNM staging task; isolate contribution of graph-based entity linking (expected ~2-3% F1 delta per paper).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**
  - Question: To what extent does integrating imaging data (radiology/histopathology) enhance the framework's predictive capabilities compared to the text-only approach?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "Expanding multimodal capabilities by integrating text-based NLP with imaging data... could create a more comprehensive oncology assistant."
  - Why unresolved: The current framework processes only unstructured text; the technical feasibility and performance impact of combining text with visual clinical data within this specific lightweight architecture remain untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating model performance on diagnostic tasks using text-only inputs versus combined text-image inputs on datasets containing matched clinical notes and imaging scans.

- **Open Question 2**
  - Question: Can the minimal instruction-tuning approach (100-400 examples) effectively transfer oncology knowledge to low-resource languages with limited base LLM support?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest "Extending cross-lingual integration to low-resource languages could address global disparities."
  - Why unresolved: The study only validates cross-lingual transfer between English and German (both high-resource languages); it is unknown if minimal data is sufficient for languages with significantly different morphologies or less pre-training data.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Application of the framework to a low-resource language clinical dataset, measuring the degradation of F1 scores relative to the German/English baselines using the same instruction counts.

- **Open Question 3**
  - Question: Does integrating curated genomic knowledge bases significantly improve the model's accuracy in identifying and reasoning about rare genetic variants?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the model "struggled with rare genetic variants due to sparse retrieval references" and propose "integrating curated genomic knowledge bases" as a solution.
  - Why unresolved: The current retrieval mechanism relies on existing references which are sparse for rare variants; the paper does not test whether adding specialized genomic graphs successfully mitigates these specific errors.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies on genomic datasets (e.g., MSK-IMPACT) comparing the error rates for rare vs. common variants before and after the integration of a specialized genomic knowledge graph.

## Limitations

- Dataset accessibility: DUP-127 German oncology dataset requires ethics approval and cannot be directly accessed, limiting full reproducibility of cross-lingual experiments.
- Knowledge graph scope: Coverage of oncology-specific terminology remains unclear, particularly for rare genetic variants and biomarkers.
- Retrieval quality dependence: RAG performance relies heavily on the quality and completeness of underlying clinical corpus sources.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Instruction tuning mechanism for task alignment, base model performance improvements on standard benchmarks, general RAG architecture implementation.
- **Medium confidence**: Cross-lingual transfer effectiveness, Graph-RAG contribution to entity linking precision, optimal model size selection tradeoffs.
- **Low confidence**: Exact hyperparameter settings for instruction tuning, knowledge graph construction details, sentence embedding model specifications for medical RAG.

## Next Checks

1. **Instruction tuning replication**: Implement instruction tuning on NCBI-Disease using LLaMA-2-7B with 200 English instructions; verify baseline F1 improvement from ~85% to ~88% reported in paper.
2. **Cross-lingual transfer test**: Add 100 German instructions and measure ICD-10 coding accuracy change; expect +5-6% improvement per paper findings, but validate with accessible German oncology datasets.
3. **RAG vs. Graph-RAG ablation**: On TNM staging task, isolate contribution of graph-based entity linking (expected ~2-3% F1 delta) using publicly available clinical reports with standardized staging terminology.
