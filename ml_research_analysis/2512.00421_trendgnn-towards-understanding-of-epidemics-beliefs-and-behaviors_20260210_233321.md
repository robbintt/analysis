# TrendGNN: Towards Understanding of Epidemics, Beliefs, and Behaviors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00421
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00421
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Graph-based forecasting with DTW+S outperforms baselines for 2-4 week-ahead predictions on COVID-19 signals.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of forecasting epidemic outcomes alongside human behaviors and beliefs, emphasizing the need for interpretable models. It proposes a graph-based forecasting framework that constructs graphs from time series signals using trend similarity (DTW+S) and applies GraphSAGE to predict multiple signals. Experiments on COVID-19 data show that graph-based models, especially with DTW+S and lagged correlation graphs, outperform traditional baselines and non-graph methods, particularly for 2–4 week-ahead forecasts. The framework also provides interpretability by identifying critical signal relationships influencing predictions. This work advances toward simulation models integrating behavior, beliefs, and epidemic outcomes.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs a graph of interrelated signals based on trend similarity (DTW+S) or lagged correlation, then applies GraphSAGE for prediction. For each state, pairwise signal similarities are computed, top-5 edges per node are retained, and a block-diagonal adjacency matrix is assembled. The model takes 4 weeks of normalized values for 26 signals across 26 states as input and predicts 4 weeks ahead. Training uses retrospective expanding-window splits, and performance is measured by MAE across all signals and forecast horizons.

## Key Results
- Graph-based models (Sage(DTW+S), Sage(Lagged)) outperform non-graph baselines (Sage(Random), Sage(Full)) for 2-4 week horizons.
- DTW+S captures temporal misalignments and non-linear similarities better than lagged correlation for COVID-related indicators.
- Counterfactual explanation identifies critical edges influencing predictions, providing interpretability for public health insights.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Trend-based graph structure improves forecasting by capturing temporally-aligned signal dependencies.
- Mechanism: DTW+S constructs similarity matrices by aligning local trend shapelets, then sparsifies to top-5 connections per node; GraphSAGE aggregates neighbor features through message passing along these edges.
- Core assumption: Signals with similar temporal trends have predictive relationships that persist into the forecast horizon.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "constructs a graph of interrelated signals based on trend similarity, and then applies graph neural networks (GNNs) for prediction"
  - [section 3] "DTW+S captures temporal misalignments and non-linear similarities, which are common in COVID-related indicators, while lagged correlation is limited to linear dependencies with fixed shifts"
  - [corpus] Related work (arXiv:2504.05140) shows causal spatiotemporal GNNs improve epidemic forecasting when graph structure reflects transmission dynamics, but does not validate DTW+S specifically.
- Break condition: If signal relationships are dominated by contemporaneous noise rather than trend-level dependencies, DTW+S edges will not improve over random graphs.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Block-diagonal graph architecture preserves state-specific signal structure while enabling shared GNN weights.
- Mechanism: Each state gets its own N_signal × N_signal similarity block; off-diagonal regions are zero, preventing cross-state information flow; GraphSAGE operates on the unified block-diagonal matrix with shared parameters across blocks.
- Core assumption: Signal dependencies operate primarily within states, not across states; shared temporal patterns justify shared model weights.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] Figure 1 shows "block-diagonal matrix, where each light gray sub-block on the diagonal is an N_signal × N_signal similarity matrix for one state"
  - [section 4] Table 1 shows Sage(DTW+S) outperforming non-GNN baselines, but the paper does not ablate cross-state connections.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on block-diagonal vs. full cross-state graphs for epidemic forecasting.
- Break condition: If important cross-state dependencies exist (e.g., regional spillover), the block-diagonal constraint will limit accuracy gains.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Counterfactual explanation identifies which edges contribute most to prediction accuracy.
- Mechanism: CF-GNNExplainer perturbs edges to find minimal changes that reduce MAE to random-graph baseline; frequent important edges across states/weeks are aggregated as "critical" relationships.
- Core assumption: Edges whose perturbation harms accuracy are causally relevant, not merely correlated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "our variant seeks the smallest perturbations that brings the MAE at or below the MAE using random graph"
  - [section 5] Figure 2 visualizes important edges for representative signals (e.g., mask-wearing influenced by safety concerns, illness reports)
  - [corpus] No corpus validation of CF-GNNExplainer for time-series GNNs; standard CF-GNNExplainer was designed for node classification.
- Break condition: If GNN predictions rely on distributed representations rather than localized edges, counterfactual importance will be unstable or misleading.

## Foundational Learning
- Concept: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
  - Why needed here: DTW+S extends DTW with shapelet-based alignment; understanding DTW is prerequisite for grasping why trend similarity differs from lagged correlation.
  - Quick check question: Given two time series [1,2,3,2,1] and [1,3,2,1,2], would standard DTW align them perfectly? Why or why not?

- Concept: GraphSAGE aggregation
  - Why needed here: The model uses GraphSAGE (not GCN or GAT) for inductive representation learning; understanding sample-and-aggregate is essential for debugging message passing.
  - Quick check question: In GraphSAGE, if a node has 5 neighbors and sample size is 3, which neighbors contribute to the node's updated representation?

- Concept: Rolling-window time series forecasting
  - Why needed here: The retrospective training setup uses expanding windows (τstart increasing); this differs from random train/test splits and affects evaluation validity.
  - Quick check question: If τstart=20 and you forecast 4 weeks ahead, which weeks are in the test set? What happens to the test set as τstart increases to 21?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map:
  - Input: (N_state × N_signal) × 4 weeks of normalized values
  - Similarity Generator: DTW+S per state → N_signal × N_signal matrix
  - Graph Constructor: Top-5 sparsification → block-diagonal adjacency matrix
  - GNN Encoder: GraphSAGE layers (ReLU, Linear)
  - Output Head: Linear projection to 4-week-ahead predictions
  - Loss: MAE between predictions and targets

- Critical path:
  1. Verify DTW+S similarity matrices are non-trivial (not all zeros or uniform)
  2. Confirm top-5 sparsification yields ~5 edges per node on average
  3. Check GraphSAGE forward pass produces correct output shape (N_state × N_signal × 4)
  4. Monitor MAE per horizon; expect degradation from 1-week to 4-week ahead

- Design tradeoffs:
  - DTW+S vs. Lagged Correlation: DTW+S captures non-linear/temporal misalignment but is computationally heavier; lagged correlation is faster but limited to linear shifts
  - Top-5 vs. Top-k sparsification: Higher k increases connectivity but may introduce noise; paper uses k=5 without ablation
  - Block-diagonal vs. full cross-state graph: Current design assumes no cross-state dependencies; untested alternative

- Failure signatures:
  - 1-week-ahead MAE worse than ARIMA: Expected per Table 1; not a failure
  - 2-4 week-ahead MAE similar to Sage(Random): Indicates graph construction is not capturing meaningful structure
  - MAE variance across runs >0.01: Suggests training instability or insufficient random seeds
  - Explanation outputs inconsistent across states/weeks: May indicate overfitting or insufficient data for stable importance estimates

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Table 1 baseline comparison on the provided CTIS subset; confirm Sage(DTW+S) achieves MAE within 0.01 of reported values for 2-4 week horizons.
  2. Ablate graph construction: Compare Sage(DTW+S), Sage(Lagged), Sage(Random), and Sage(Full) on held-out weeks; verify that DTW+S and Lagged consistently outperform Random for 3-4 week horizons.
  3. Pilot explanation extraction: Run CF-GNNExplainer on 3 signals across 5 states; check if identified "important edges" are consistent across ≥3 of 5 states (preliminary stability check).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can lag-aware causal structures be integrated to disentangle true epidemic drivers from spurious temporal correlations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that future directions include "incorporating lag-aware causal structures to disentangle true drivers from correlations."
- Why unresolved: The current DTW+S and lagged correlation methods identify predictive relationships but cannot confirm causality, potentially leading to correct forecasts based on wrong mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful integration of a causal discovery module (e.g., PCMCI) that identifies distinct drivers compared to standard correlation, validated against known intervention outcomes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the assumption of state-level signal independence (block-diagonal matrix) limit the ability to capture geographic spillover effects?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Figure 1 and the Method section describe aggregating state matrices into a "block-diagonal structure... Off-diagonal regions are set to zero," effectively ignoring inter-state dependencies.
- Why unresolved: While this reduces complexity, epidemics inherently involve cross-border transmission and behavioral diffusion, which this architecture explicitly excludes.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing the current block-diagonal approach against a model incorporating inter-state edges (e.g., based on mobility or adjacency) to measure performance gains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework's interpretability be operationalized to directly support specific public health policy decisions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the need for "enhancing edge- and subgraph-level interpretability to support policy decisions and simulation modeling."
- Why unresolved: The current framework identifies important signals post-hoc (via CF-GNNExplainer), but does not provide a mechanism for simulating counterfactuals (e.g., "What if mask-wearing increased by 10%?").
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the model to output counterfactual forecasts based on edge perturbations, validated by domain experts confirming the simulated dynamics match theoretical expectations.

## Limitations
- DTW+S implementation details are underspecified, requiring reference [20] for exact implementation.
- Block-diagonal graph construction assumes no cross-state dependencies without experimental validation.
- CF-GNNExplainer was designed for node classification, not time-series forecasting, raising interpretability validity concerns.
- Retrospective expanding-window training protocol details (exact τstart values, validation splits) are unclear.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The general forecasting methodology (GraphSAGE on trend-based graphs) is well-established, and the improvement over non-graph baselines for 2-4 week horizons is directly supported by Table 1 results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The interpretability claims through counterfactual edge importance are plausible but methodologically questionable given CF-GNNExplainer's original design intent and lack of corpus validation for time-series applications.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that DTW+S specifically captures non-linear dependencies better than lagged correlation cannot be independently verified without implementing the exact DTW+S procedure from reference [20].

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the exact DTW+S similarity computation from reference [20], then compare its similarity matrices against simple lagged correlation to verify non-linear dependency capture.
2. Conduct an ablation study comparing block-diagonal (current) vs. full cross-state connectivity graphs to test the assumption that signal dependencies operate primarily within states.
3. Apply CF-GNNExplainer to a simpler time-series GNN baseline (like lagged correlation + GraphSAGE) to determine if the identified important edges are specific to the DTW+S graph structure or generic artifacts of the explanation method.
