# LLM Alignment for the Arabs: A Homogenous Culture or Diverse Ones?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.15003
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15003
- Authors: Amr Keleg
- Reference count: 21
- One-line primary result: Existing Arabic LLMs assume a monolithic Arab culture, leading to biased and unrepresentative models that fail to capture the diversity of Arabic speakers.

## Executive Summary
This position paper critiques the assumption of a single homogeneous Arabic culture in large language model (LLM) development. The author argues that this oversimplification leads to biased models that misrepresent the diverse cultural realities of Arabic speakers. Through analysis of existing datasets and benchmarks used for Arabic NLP, the paper demonstrates that cultural nuances are often neglected, with examples showing culturally specific items being treated as universal preferences. The paper concludes with recommendations for building more inclusive LLMs that reflect the full spectrum of Arab cultural identities.

## Method Summary
The paper provides a qualitative analysis of existing Arabic datasets and benchmarks (CIDAR, ACVA, ArabicMMLU, AraDICE-Culture, CVQA, Henna) to demonstrate cultural misrepresentation. No quantitative experiments were conducted. The author examines cherry-picked examples from these datasets to illustrate how they encode regional cultural assumptions as universal Arab norms. The paper concludes with four recommendations: improve research team diversity, understand regional topic interests, identify language/variety preferences for technology use, and collect more inclusive alignment data.

## Key Results
- Arab cultures are diverse and heterogeneous, not monolithic as commonly assumed in LLM development
- Existing datasets encode regional cultural norms (Gulf, Levant, etc.) as universal Arab culture
- Dialectal Arabic contains culturally-specific expressions that non-native speakers misinterpret
- Current Arabic LLMs likely propagate cultural biases present in their training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dialect-annotator mismatch degrades annotation quality
- Claim: Routing Arabic dataset samples to annotators without matching dialect backgrounds reduces interannotator agreement
- Mechanism: Dialectal Arabic contains culturally-specific expressions and references that non-native speakers of that dialect misinterpret, particularly for sarcasm and hate speech detection
- Core assumption: Lower agreement scores stem from cultural misinterpretation rather than pure linguistic unintelligibility
- Evidence anchors: Keleg et al. (2024) found interannotator agreement decreased as dialectness increased across 15 datasets; two independent papers showed annotators were harsher on hate speech and worse at sarcasm detection for non-native dialects

### Mechanism 2: Cultural homogenization in alignment data propagates to model outputs
- Claim: Treating Arab culture as monolithic in instruction-tuning data produces outputs that are only regionally accurate
- Mechanism: Annotators unconsciously embed their regional cultural norms (e.g., Gulf-specific clothing, eating practices) into "culturally representative" datasets, which models then learn as universal
- Core assumption: Models lack mechanisms to distinguish regional cultural context from the training signal
- Evidence anchors: CIDAR-MCQ-100 contains questions where "gold" answers (e.g., eating Kabsa by hand, wearing jellabiya/ghutra) are only correct for specific regions

### Mechanism 3: Research team composition influences cultural coverage in artifacts
- Claim: Homogeneous research teams (by region/country) produce datasets and benchmarks that reflect their specific cultural context while marginalizing others
- Mechanism: Teams unconsciously operationalize "Arab culture" through their lived experience, creating blind spots for regions not represented among team members
- Core assumption: Lived cultural experience shapes how researchers define and curate "culturally relevant" content
- Evidence anchors: ACVA benchmark contains non-inclusive statements (e.g., assuming all Arabs are Muslim, assuming gender segregation is universal)

## Foundational Learning

- **Dialectal Arabic vs. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)**
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes familiarity with Arabic's diglossic nature—MSA as shared formal variety, DA as region-specific spoken varieties with cultural markers
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a Lebanese speaker might misinterpret an Egyptian sarcastic expression even if both read MSA fluently?

- **Cultural alignment in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The paper critiques how "alignment" is operationalized; understanding current paradigms (SFT with localized data, preference datasets) is prerequisite
  - Quick check question: How does CIDAR differ from machine-translated instruction tuning data, and why might both fail cultural representativeness?

- **Interannotator agreement (IAA) as a quality signal**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses IAA drops as evidence that dialect mismatch harms data quality
  - Quick check question: If IAA decreases with dialectness, what are two alternative explanations besides cultural misunderstanding?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
```
Arabic LLM Pipeline:
├── Data Curation
│   ├── Classical task datasets (multi-dialect, random annotator assignment)
│   ├── Cultural benchmarks (country-level curation: CVQA, Henna, ArabicMMLU)
│   └── Alignment datasets (CIDAR, ACVA)
├── Training
│   └── SFT on alignment data (most Arabic LLMs except ALLaM, Fanar)
├── Evaluation
│   ├── Language understanding (ArabicMMLU, BLEnD)
│   └── Cultural alignment (ACVA, AraDICE-Culture)
└── Deployment (regional user populations with unstated preferences)
```

- Critical path:
  1. Identify target regions/countries (explicitly, not "Arab world" as monolith)
  2. Map dialect-language preferences per use case (MSA vs. DA vs. French/English)
  3. Collect region-specific alignment data with matched annotators
  4. Evaluate with region-disaggregated metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Broad coverage vs. regional fidelity**: Single model for all Arab users vs. region-specific models
  - **MSA-only vs. multi-dialect**: MSA is intelligible across regions but culturally thin; DA is culturally rich but fragments the user base
  - **Automated vs. manual curation**: ACVA (GPT-generated, 8K statements) has scale but cultural blind spots; manual curation (CVQA 300 images) is accurate but low-coverage

- Failure signatures:
  - Benchmark accuracy varies dramatically by country-of-origin for questions labeled "culturally representative"
  - User feedback indicates responses feel "foreign" or "Gulf-centric" despite being in Arabic
  - Sarcasm/hate speech models over-flag content from underrepresented dialects

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Dialect-matched annotation audit**: Re-annotate 500 samples from CIDAR/ACVA with annotators grouped by dialect; measure IAA and identify systematic divergences
  2. **Region-disaggregated benchmark evaluation**: Run ArabicMMLU and AraDICE-Culture per-country, report accuracy stratified by country-of-origin for each question
  3. **Language preference survey**: Adapt Blaschke et al.'s (2024) German dialect methodology to 3+ Arab regions; identify contexts where users prefer MSA, DA, or colonial languages (French/English) for technology interaction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific topics of interest and needs for Arabic speakers across different regions, particularly regarding sensitive contexts like religion?
- Basis in paper: Step #2 of the recommendations explicitly calls for identifying regional topics of interest, noting that researchers currently rely on assumptions rather than evidence
- Why unresolved: The paper notes that the views of Arabic speakers were excluded from global datasets like PRISM, and current development often lacks a clear vision of user needs
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive surveys or usage analyses detailing the specific information needs and desired use cases of Arabic speakers from diverse regions

### Open Question 2
- Question: In which specific technological contexts do Arabic speakers prefer using Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), local dialectal varieties, or colonial languages like English or French?
- Basis in paper: Step #3 argues for identifying these preferences, noting that bilingualism and diglossia make usage context-dependent
- Why unresolved: There is a lack of empirical data on how language variety preferences shift based on the specific technology or domain
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies focused on Arabic speakers' preferences for input/output varieties across different tasks

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do current Arabic-specific LLMs actually capture the cultural diversity of the Arab world, or do they merely align with a dominant subset?
- Basis in paper: The author states "it is unclear if they could currently model the cultural diversity among them"
- Why unresolved: Existing evaluations often assume a homogenous culture, making it difficult to distinguish between general alignment and specific regional representation
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-grained evaluations using benchmarks that distinguish between regional cultural norms

## Limitations
- The paper is a position paper relying on qualitative analysis rather than empirical experiments
- Analysis focuses on cherry-picked examples that may not represent systematic patterns across full datasets
- No quantitative methodology or scoring rubric provided for measuring "cultural representativeness"
- The specific subset of examples analyzed is not fully documented

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The fundamental claim that Arab cultures are diverse and that treating them as homogeneous in LLM development is problematic
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific examples of cultural misrepresentation in CIDAR and ACVA benchmarks are documented, though selection may be biased
- **Low Confidence**: The practical impact of these cultural misalignments on actual model performance and user experience across different Arab regions remains unmeasured

## Next Checks
1. **Systematic Bias Analysis**: Sample 500 random statements from CIDAR and ACVA, categorize them by cultural origin (Gulf, Levant, Maghreb, etc.), and measure agreement between annotators from different regions to quantify systematic bias patterns

2. **Regional Performance Disaggregation**: Evaluate Jais, ALLaM, and other leading Arabic LLMs on ArabicMMLU and cultural benchmarks (ACVA, AraDICE-Culture) with results stratified by country-of-origin for each question to identify performance gaps

3. **User Preference Validation**: Conduct a survey across 3+ Arab regions adapting Blaschke et al.'s (2024) German dialect methodology to identify contexts where users prefer MSA, DA, or colonial languages for technology interaction, then correlate with current LLM design choices
