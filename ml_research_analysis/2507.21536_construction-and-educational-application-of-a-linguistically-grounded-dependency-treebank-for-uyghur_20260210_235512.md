- This study introduces the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT), a linguistically grounded annotation framework specifically designed to address the computational and pedagogical challenges posed by Uyghur's agglutinative morphology.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT), a linguistically grounded annotation framework specifically designed to address the computational and pedagogical challenges posed by Uyghur's agglutinative morphology. Unlike the Universal Dependencies standard, MUDT explicitly models phenomena such as zero copula constructions and fine-grained case marking, and restructures dependency relations to better reflect the head-final nature of Uyghur. A high-quality treebank of 3,456 sentences was constructed using a hybrid LLM-human annotation pipeline. Intrinsic evaluation shows MUDT significantly reduces crossing-arc rates from 7.35% to 0.06%, and extrinsic parsing experiments demonstrate superior performance across models like UDPipe and Stanza. To validate real-world impact, an AI-assisted grammar tutoring system was developed using MUDT-based parsing; a controlled classroom experiment with 35 L2 learners found that students receiving syntax-aware feedback achieved significantly higher learning gains (13.73 vs 7.88 points) compared to a control group. These results confirm that linguistically informed NLP resources are essential for advancing intelligent language learning tools in low-resource agglutinative languages.

## Method Summary
The study employed a hybrid annotation pipeline to construct the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT). The process began with the Qwen3-max LLM pre-annotating raw Uyghur sentences, followed by rigorous manual correction in the Brat annotation tool by 6 linguistically trained annotators. The treebank consists of 3,456 sentences sourced from the UD_Uyghur-UDT treebank, split into train (1,656), dev (900), and test (900) sets. Parsing models (UDPipe, Stanza, DiaParser) were trained on the MUDT corpus and evaluated using both intrinsic metrics (crossing arc rates, dependency distance) and extrinsic metrics (UAS/LAS scores). The educational application involved developing a grammar tutoring system that provided syntax-aware feedback to L2 learners, validated through a controlled classroom experiment with 35 native Chinese speakers.

## Key Results
- MUDT significantly reduced crossing-arc rates from 7.35% to 0.06% compared to Universal Dependencies
- Parsing models trained on MUDT showed superior performance: UDPipe UAS 0.734, Stanza UAS 0.655, DiaParser UAS 0.805
- Students receiving MUDT-based syntax-aware feedback achieved learning gains of 13.73 points versus 7.88 points for the control group (Cohen's d=0.90)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Re-structuring dependency relations to reflect Uyghur's head-final nature reduces structural ambiguity (non-projectivity) more effectively than generic Universal Dependencies (UD).
- **Mechanism:** By inverting dependencies for postpositions and auxiliary verbs so they govern their arguments (rather than acting as leaves), the annotation scheme minimizes "back-and-forth" crossing arcs. This aligns the graph structure with the linear processing order of the language.
- **Core assumption:** Lower crossing-arc rates (higher projectivity) correlate directly with linguistic plausibility and parser learnability for head-final, agglutinative languages.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Intrinsic evaluation shows MUDT significantly reduces crossing-arc rates from 7.35% to 0.06%."
  - [Section 4.3] "MUDT restores the linear projectivity... by re-assigning functional morphemes (postpositions and light verbs) as syntactic heads."
  - [corpus] Related works like the Korean UD Treebank also focus on annotation refinement for agglutinative structures, suggesting structural alignment is a general efficiency driver.
- **Break condition:** If the new head assignments create invalid dependency cycles or if the reduced complexity comes at the cost of losing semantic nuance required for non-syntactic tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Syntax-aware feedback generated by the MUDT parser improves L2 learner outcomes by enabling precise structural diagnosis rather than generic error flagging.
- **Mechanism:** The system uses fine-grained dependency labels (e.g., `cop:zero`, specific case markers) to map learner errors to specific morphological or syntactic rules, providing scaffolding for "Focus on Form."
- **Core assumption:** The learning gain is driven by the specificity of the syntactic feedback (identifying the exact error location and type) rather than the mere presence of an automated response.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Students receiving syntax-aware feedback achieved significantly higher learning gains (13.73 vs 7.88 points)."
  - [Section 5.3] "The experimental group... achieved a mean learning gain of 13.73... Cohen's d=0.90, indicating a large effect."
  - [corpus] Insufficient corpus evidence directly linking dependency parsing granularity to L2 learning gains; general ICALL literature supports feedback utility, but the specific "syntactic granularity" link is less established externally.
- **Break condition:** If a control group receiving simple string-matching or non-syntactic feedback achieves equivalent learning gains, the mechanism is likely just "feedback effect" rather than "syntax-aware effect."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A hybrid LLM-human annotation pipeline accelerates treebank construction for low-resource languages while maintaining gold-standard quality.
- **Mechanism:** LLMs (specifically Qwen3-max) handle the heavy lifting of initial structural tagging, while human annotators correct systematic hallucinations and fine-grained morphological errors, ensuring the high precision needed for pedagogical tools.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs possess sufficient latent syntactic knowledge for Uyghur to provide a better-than-random pre-annotation, reducing human workload significantly compared to cold-start annotation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.1] "We initially employed the Qwen3-max Large Language Model via API to generate preliminary annotations... rigorous manual correction phase."
  - [Section 4.2] High Inter-Annotator Agreement (UAS ~92%) suggests the guidelines and correction process yield consistent data.
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbors (e.g., UD-KSL Treebank) also utilize "semi-automated frameworks" for L2 data, validating the pipeline approach.
- **Break condition:** If the LLM error rate on the specific morphology-syntactic interface (e.g., zero copulas) is excessively high, requiring total reconstruction of the tree, the efficiency gain is negated.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Agglutinative Morphology**
  - **Why needed here:** You cannot understand why UD fails for Uyghur without grasping that a single Uyghur word functions like a full sentence in English, encoding mood, voice, and case in suffix chains.
  - **Quick check question:** If a suffix determines the grammatical role of a word, why would treating the word as a single "token" confuse a parser designed for English?

- **Concept: Projectivity in Dependency Parsing**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's primary structural metric is the reduction of crossing arcs. You need to understand that projective trees (no crossing lines) are generally easier for algorithms to learn and reflect a stricter word-order logic.
  - **Quick check question:** If a dependency arc crosses over another arc, does that mean the sentence is ungrammatical, or just structurally complex?

- **Concept: Functional vs. Content Heads**
  - **Why needed here:** The core of MUDT's divergence from UD is treating postpositions and auxiliaries as heads (functional) rather than dependents. This flips the entire logical structure of the syntax tree.
  - **Quick check question:** In the phrase "book for," does the preposition "for" modify "book," or does "book" serve as the object required by "for"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Raw Uyghur text -> Qwen3-max LLM pre-annotation -> Brat interface (Human correction) -> Gold Standard Treebank (MUDT) -> UDPipe/Stanza/DiaParser models -> MUDT-Tutor System (Parser + Rule Engine) -> Feedback Interface

- **Critical path:** The **Annotation Guidelines (Section 3.3)**. The definition of `cop:zero` and the inversion of postpositional heads are the keystone. If these rules are not strictly enforced during the human correction phase, the parser will fail to learn the intended structural biases.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Universality vs. Fidelity:** MUDT sacrifices cross-linguistic compatibility with UD standards to optimize for Uyghur-specific pedagogical accuracy. You cannot easily use these models for cross-lingual transfer tasks without alignment.
  - **Sample Size:** The educational experiment (N=35) validates the concept but lacks the statistical power for broad generalization.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High Crossing Arc Rate:** If your training data still shows >1% crossing arcs, the MUDT conversion logic (inverting heads) likely failed.
  - **Zero `cop:zero` count:** If the parser never predicts `cop:zero`, it is falling back to UD-style root attachment or punctuation attachment.
  - **Generic Feedback:** If the tutoring system says "Sentence incorrect" without citing a specific dependency relation, the Rule Engine is decoupled from the parser output.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1.  **Intrinsic Validation:** Replicate the crossing-arc analysis. Parse the MUDT test set and ensure the crossing arc ratio is < 0.1%.
  2.  **Cross-Domain Parse Check:** Train UDPipe on MUDT and evaluate on a held-out UD corpus. Verify the claim that MUDT acts as a "superset" of linguistic knowledge (Section 4.4).
  3.  **Ablation on Feedback:** In the tutoring system, turn off the "syntax-aware" specific rules and provide only "correct/incorrect" feedback. Measure if the learning gain drops to control group levels.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** To what extent do the learning gains observed in the MUDT-Tutor system generalize to L2 learners with different native language backgrounds or higher proficiency levels?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The study's experimental cohort was strictly limited to 35 native Chinese speakers who had only studied Uyghur for three months (novice proficiency).
- **Why unresolved:** The cognitive load of processing agglutinative morphology and the utility of explicit syntactic feedback likely vary based on the learner's L1 typological distance and their existing grammatical intuition, which was not tested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A replication of the controlled experiment with advanced learners or learners from non-SVO linguistic backgrounds to measure if the effect size of syntax-aware feedback remains significant.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the significant improvement in learning gains persist over long-term periods, or is it limited to immediate post-intervention performance?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The experimental design utilized a four-day protocol with a single "cooling-off" day, which distinguishes learning from short-term memory but does not assess long-term retention.
- **Why unresolved:** While the intervention successfully improved post-test scores, it remains unverified whether the explicit syntactic corrections facilitated deep interlanguage restructuring that persists weeks or months later.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Conducting a longitudinal follow-up assessment (e.g., 1-3 months post-intervention) to compare retention rates between the control and experimental groups.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the MUDT annotation principles, specifically the restructuring of postpositional heads and compound predicates, be effectively transferred to other Turkic languages to resolve similar structural ambiguities?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper notes that Universal Dependencies create inconsistencies across various Turkic treebanks and argues for language-specific fidelity, but only validates MUDT for Uyghur.
- **Why unresolved:** While Uyghur shares agglutinative traits with languages like Kazakh or Turkish, it is unclear if the specific "fidelity over universality" adjustments (e.g., zero copula labeling) directly apply without further modification to other languages' morphosyntax.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying the MUDT framework guidelines to construct a pilot treebank for another Turkic language and measuring resulting changes in crossing-arc rates and parser accuracy.

## Limitations

- The educational experiment (N=35) is too small to establish generalizability across diverse learner populations
- The specific LLM prompting strategy and training hyperparameters for the annotation pipeline remain underspecified
- The claimed "superset" relationship between MUDT and UD knowledge is asserted but not empirically validated through cross-domain parsing experiments

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: MUDT's structural improvements (crossing arc reduction from 7.35% to 0.06%), parsing performance gains across multiple models, and the general feasibility of the hybrid annotation pipeline
- **Medium confidence**: The educational experiment results showing syntax-aware feedback superiority, given the small sample size and potential uncontrolled variables in classroom dynamics
- **Medium confidence**: The efficiency gains from LLM-human hybrid annotation, as the specific error rates and time savings are not quantified

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate the educational experiment** with a larger, more diverse sample (N>100) across multiple institutions, controlling for teacher variability and prior knowledge differences
2. **Conduct cross-domain parsing evaluation** by training models on MUDT and testing on standard UD treebanks to empirically verify the "superset" knowledge claim
3. **Perform an ablation study** on the tutoring system by comparing learning gains between syntax-aware feedback, simple correctness feedback, and no feedback to isolate the specific contribution of syntactic granularity
