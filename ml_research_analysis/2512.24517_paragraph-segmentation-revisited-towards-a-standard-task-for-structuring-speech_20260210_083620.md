- One-line primary result: MiniSeg achieves F1 scores of 72.7 on TEDPara and 50.5 on YTSegPara for paragraph segmentation

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes paragraph segmentation as a standard task in speech processing by introducing two benchmarks—TEDPara (human-annotated) and YTSegPara (pseudo-annotated)—and proposing a constrained decoding method that inserts paragraph breaks without modifying the original transcript. Experiments show that a compact model (MiniSeg) achieves strong performance on both datasets, with F1 scores of 72.7 on TEDPara and 50.5 on YTSegPara. Extending MiniSeg hierarchically enables joint chapter and paragraph prediction with minimal performance loss. Human evaluations confirm that LLM-generated segmentations are comparable to human references, validating their use for benchmarking. Together, these contributions address the lack of standardized evaluation resources and establish paragraph segmentation as a practical, measurable task in speech processing.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces constrained decoding for LLM-based paragraph segmentation, where models insert paragraph breaks at sentence boundaries without modifying the original transcript. This is achieved through a binary decision framework that limits output to either continuing with sentence-final punctuation or inserting "\n\n" for paragraph breaks. The approach is validated on two datasets: TEDPara with human annotations and YTSegPara with pseudo-annotations from LLaMA 3.1 70B. MiniSeg, a compact model based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2 encoder, is trained using weighted binary cross-entropy and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The method extends hierarchically to jointly predict chapters and paragraphs, demonstrating transfer learning benefits from coarser segmentation tasks.

## Key Results
- MiniSeg achieves F1 scores of 72.7 on TEDPara and 50.5 on YTSegPara
- Constrained decoding preserves transcript fidelity with 1.0 exact match rate while enabling paragraph insertion
- Pretraining on coarser segmentation tasks (Wiki-727K, YTSeg) significantly improves paragraph segmentation performance
- Paralinguistic Break Rule improves LLM predictions by aligning with human annotation conventions, increasing F1 from 40.7 to 54.0

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Constrained Decoding Prevents Hallucination
Restricting LLM output to binary choices at sentence boundaries preserves transcript fidelity while enabling paragraph insertion. At each sentence boundary, the model performs exactly one forward pass with a masked output space limited to (i) sentence-final punctuation tokens ("continue") or (ii) punctuation followed by "\n\n" ("break"). This prevents the model from modifying, adding, or deleting content. Core assumption: Paragraph boundaries are sufficiently predictable from local sentence-boundary context without needing to see future content beyond the current context window.

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Task Transfer from Coarse to Fine Segmentation
Pretraining on higher-level segmentation tasks (chapters, document sections) provides transferable structural cues for paragraph-level prediction. Models learn discourse-level boundary signals (topic shifts, transitions) from coarser-grained segmentation that remain relevant at finer granularity. Lowering the prediction threshold converts a chapter-segmentation model into a paragraph-segmentation model. Core assumption: Paragraph boundaries share underlying linguistic markers with chapter/section boundaries, differing primarily in frequency rather than signal type.

### Mechanism 3: Paralinguistic Break Rules Bridge Stylistic Gaps
Post-hoc rules for formatting conventions (e.g., isolating paralinguistic cues) substantially narrow performance gaps between LLM predictions and human annotations. LLMs treat parentheticals like "(Laughter)" as inline elements, while human annotators isolate them. A simple rule inserting breaks before/after standalone paralinguistic cues aligns predictions with reference conventions. Core assumption: Observed performance gaps reflect formatting convention mismatches rather than fundamental segmentation quality differences.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Text Segmentation Metrics (F1, Pk, Boundary Similarity)**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates segmentation quality using three distinct metrics with different properties. F1 measures boundary classification accuracy, Pk penalizes near-miss boundaries, and Boundary Similarity captures graded similarity.
  - Quick check question: Why would a segmentation with perfect F1 still receive a poor Pk score?

- Concept: **Knowledge Distillation / Pseudo-labeling**
  - Why needed here: YTSegPara uses LLM-generated labels to train compact models. Understanding this pipeline is essential for extending the approach to new domains.
  - Quick check question: What validation is needed before trusting pseudo-labels for downstream training?

- Concept: **Hierarchical Multi-Task Classification**
  - Why needed here: MiniSeg jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs as a multi-class problem. The weighting scheme [1, 1.5, 2] balances class frequencies.
  - Quick check question: How would class imbalance affect boundary prediction if not addressed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw transcript -> NLTK sentence tokenization -> sentence sequence -> (LLM Path: Constrained decoder -> binary decisions -> formatted transcript) OR (MiniSeg Path: Sentence encoder -> classifier -> boundary predictions) -> Post-processing (Paralinguistic Break Rule) -> final segmentation

- Critical path: Verify sentence tokenization quality (errors cascade to all downstream evaluation) -> Confirm constrained decoding mask correctly restricts vocabulary -> Validate that evaluation metrics operate on sentence-aligned outputs (mismatched boundaries invalidate comparisons)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - LLM zero-shot: High quality, expensive inference, requires 128K context window
  - MiniSeg fine-tuned: Fast inference, requires labeled data, competitive accuracy (F1 72.7 vs LLM 54.0)
  - Hierarchical vs single-task: Joint prediction slightly reduces chapter F1 (46.1→43.8) but adds paragraph capability at no extra inference cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucinated/modified text indicates unconstrained decoding was used
  - Very low F1 with reasonable human ratings suggests convention mismatch (check paralinguistic handling)
  - Chapter-paragraph boundary conflicts indicate non-hierarchical processing

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce constrained decoding fidelity: Run LLaMA 3.1 8B on 10 TEDPara samples with constrained vs. unconstrained decoding; verify 1.0 vs. ~0.6 exact match rates.
  2. Validate PBR impact: Apply Paralinguistic Break Rule to zero-shot outputs; measure F1 delta (expect ~10-15 point improvement per Table 3).
  3. Test hierarchical transfer: Train MiniSeg on Wiki-727K -> YTSeg -> TEDPara; compare against direct TEDPara training to quantify transfer benefit (Table 3 shows 72.7 vs. 67.3 F1).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can prosodic audio cues (pauses, pitch, intonation) improve paragraph segmentation accuracy beyond text-only approaches? The paper deliberately focuses on text-only methods for simplicity and broader applicability, leaving audio-integrated approaches unexplored. What evidence would resolve it: Experiments combining MiniSeg with audio features on TEDPara/YTSegPara, measuring F1 and Boundary Similarity improvements.

### Open Question 2
Do paragraph segmentation models trained on TED talks and YouTube videos generalize to noisy conversational domains (e.g., meetings)? The paper notes datasets focus on structured, relatively clean speech, leaving out more challenging domains such as conversational meetings. What evidence would resolve it: Zero-shot or fine-tuned evaluation of MiniSeg on meeting transcripts (e.g., AMI, ICSI datasets) with paragraph annotations.

### Open Question 3
Why do rule-based segmentations receive favorable human evaluations despite poor automatic metric scores? The paper shows rule-based baselines score near-random on F1/Pk but achieve Likert ratings close to human reference, suggesting a fundamental mismatch between current metrics and human perception. What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analysis between automatic metrics and human judgments across diverse segmentation strategies; development of perceptually-aligned metrics.

## Limitations

- TEDPara contains only 5,193 talks, limiting statistical power for rare linguistic phenomena
- YTSegPara's pseudo-annotations may propagate LLM biases, creating a potential feedback loop in model training
- Constrained decoding prevents any transcript modification, which may limit performance on transcripts requiring substantive restructuring for coherent segmentation

## Confidence

**High Confidence (8-10/10)**
- MiniSeg achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on paragraph segmentation (F1 72.7 on TEDPara)
- Constrained decoding effectively preserves transcript fidelity while enabling paragraph insertion
- LLM-generated segmentations are comparable to human references when evaluated by independent raters

**Medium Confidence (5-7/10)**
- Pretraining on coarser segmentation tasks significantly benefits paragraph segmentation
- Paralinguistic Break Rule effectively bridges formatting convention gaps
- YTSegPara provides a viable alternative to human-annotated data for training compact models

**Low Confidence (1-4/10)**
- Paragraph segmentation quality generalizes to informal or conversational speech
- The constrained decoding approach scales effectively to extremely long transcripts beyond current context limits
- Performance metrics (F1, BS, Pk) capture all dimensions of segmentation quality relevant to downstream applications

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Corpus Validation**: Test MiniSeg trained on TEDPara/YTSegPara on a held-out corpus of conversational speech (e.g., podcasts, interviews) to assess domain generalization. Measure both segmentation quality and any degradation in transcript preservation.

2. **Error Analysis on Paralinguistic Cues**: Conduct systematic analysis of segmentation errors around paralinguistic annotations across both datasets. Identify whether the Paralinguistic Break Rule consistently improves performance or introduces new errors in specific contexts.

3. **Scaling Analysis**: Evaluate MiniSeg's performance on progressively longer transcripts (up to 128K tokens) to identify context window limitations. Compare hierarchical vs. flat processing strategies for transcripts exceeding context limits.
