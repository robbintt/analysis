# HieroLM: Egyptian Hieroglyph Recovery with Next Word Prediction Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.04996
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04996
- Reference count: 9
- Over 44% accuracy on Egyptian hieroglyph recovery with LSTM language model

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HieroLM, the first language model approach to Egyptian hieroglyph recovery, framing it as a next-word prediction task rather than relying on image classification. The authors choose LSTM architecture based on the strong local semantic affinity in hieroglyphic texts and the limited dataset size. Experiments on real-world datasets show HieroLM achieves over 44% accuracy, outperforming other architectures like RNNs and Transformers, and remains robust on multi-shot predictions and short contexts. The model's learned embeddings also reflect semantic patterns in offering formulas and royal titles. Overall, HieroLM provides a practical complement to CV-based methods for inferring missing hieroglyphs.

## Method Summary
HieroLM converts Egyptian hieroglyphs into MdC transliteration format, then uses a next-word prediction LSTM to recover missing signs based on contextual probability. The model processes one-hot encoded MdC vectors through an embedding layer, then a single-layer LSTM with 1024 hidden units, finally projecting to vocabulary size with softmax. Training uses learning rate decay and early stopping based on validation perplexity, with dropout tuned per dataset. The approach addresses limitations of computer vision methods that cannot handle missing glyphs or leverage grammatical context.

## Key Results
- HieroLM achieves over 44% accuracy on Egyptian hieroglyph recovery tasks
- LSTM architecture outperforms RNN, Transformer, and N-gram baselines on both AES and Ramses datasets
- Model demonstrates robustness on short contexts (4+ words) and multi-shot predictions
- Learned embeddings reveal semantic clustering of signs (gods vs. mortals, offering formulas)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Framing hieroglyph recovery as next-word prediction allows the system to infer missing signs based on grammatical and contextual probability rather than visual features alone.
- **Mechanism:** The model uses the sequential history of transliterated signs to condition the probability distribution of the subsequent sign. If a sign is visually missing, the model relies on learned probability of specific signs appearing in that grammatical context.
- **Core assumption:** The damaged texts follow grammatical and formulaic structures present in the training corpus.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract notes CV approaches fail on missing hieroglyphs; Figure 1 illustrates ambiguous visual context disambiguated by textual context.
- **Break condition:** If input context is too short or text deviates significantly from known structures, conditional probability becomes too diffuse.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The LSTM architecture captures the "strong local semantic affinity" of hieroglyphic texts more effectively than Transformers in low-data regimes.
- **Mechanism:** LSTMs process sequences step-by-step, maintaining cell state that retains information over short-to-medium ranges. The authors posit hieroglyphic semantics rely heavily on local dependencies.
- **Core assumption:** Hieroglyphic dependencies are primarily local, and dataset size is insufficient to train high-capacity attention mechanisms effectively.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 1 explicitly selects LSTM due to limited data and local affinity; Section 4.3 shows Transformer underperforms compared to LSTM.
- **Break condition:** If longer-range dependencies become critical or dataset size increases significantly, LSTM capacity limit might be reached.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Learned embeddings cluster semantically (e.g., gods, mortals), enabling the model to predict plausible substitutions even when exact predictions fail.
- **Mechanism:** By training on next-word prediction objective, the model projects signs into vector space where signs with similar grammatical roles are closer together.
- **Core assumption:** Vocabulary is restrictive enough that semantic roles map consistently to specific vector regions.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 4.6 visualizes PCA projections showing distinct clusters for "Gods/Osiris" vs. "Mortals/Kings"; Section 4.8 shows model predicting standard formulaic endings.
- **Break condition:** If a sign has multiple disparate meanings in different contexts without sufficient disambiguating context, embedding representation may become muddled.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** MdC (Manuel de Codage) Transliteration
  - **Why needed here:** HieroLM does not process raw images or Unicode hieroglyphs directly. It operates on "MdC" strings, which map complex hieroglyphic signs to ASCII characters.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the authors convert raw hieroglyphs into MdC format before feeding them into the LSTM?

- **Concept:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Gates
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly chooses LSTM over standard RNNs to handle "long-range perception." Understanding the forget and input gates is necessary to understand how the model selects which context to preserve for prediction.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the "forget gate" in HieroLM help filter irrelevant context when transitioning between distinct sections of an inscription?

- **Concept:** Perplexity vs. Accuracy in Low-Resource NLP
  - **Why needed here:** The paper cites a perplexity of ~26 to argue that hieroglyphic vocabulary is "restrictive." Distinguishing these metrics is key to understanding the authors' conclusion that the task is constrained but solvable.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does a low perplexity score in this context support the claim that an LSTM is sufficient, whereas a high perplexity might demand a larger model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (one-hot) → Embedding Layer → LSTM Layer → Prediction Head (dense + softmax)
- **Critical path:** The flow relies on the **Input → Embedding → LSTM** transition. If the embedding layer fails to capture semantic similarity, the LSTM cannot leverage local affinity.
- **Design tradeoffs:** The authors trade the global context awareness of Transformers for the data efficiency and local bias of LSTMs, assuming this trade-off is favored because the dataset is considered "small" for training a Transformer from scratch without overfitting.
- **Failure signatures:** Accuracy drops significantly when input length is < 5 words; accuracy drops from ~45% (1-shot) to ~14% (4-shot), indicating error accumulation when predicting multiple missing words recursively.
- **First 3 experiments:** 
  1. Run HieroLM against NPLM, RNN, and Transformer on the AES/Ramses datasets to validate the LSTM advantage
  2. Group test sentences by length and plot accuracy to verify robustness against data scarcity
  3. Train the model, extract the embedding matrix, apply PCA, and visualize clusters to confirm semantic grouping

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can self-attention-based architectures (Transformers) be specifically adapted to handle the small-scale data constraints inherent in Egyptian hieroglyph corpora?
- **Open Question 2:** What is the optimal architectural framework for integrating computer vision (CV) models with language models (LM) into a unified hieroglyph recovery system?
- **Open Question 3:** Does the conversion of complex 2D hieroglyphic layouts into linear MdC transliteration strings result in the loss of structural information that could otherwise aid prediction?

## Limitations

- Data representativeness: AES and Ramses corpora likely over-represent formulaic religious texts, potentially inflating performance on formulaic recovery while underperforming on non-standard texts.
- Evaluation protocol: Paper does not specify how missing hieroglyph prediction is simulated for testing, potentially leading to optimistic upper bounds for actual archaeological applications.
- Architectural simplicity: Single-layer LSTM design may be underutilizing available patterns; paper does not explore whether deeper or bidirectional variants could improve performance.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** LSTM outperforms Transformer on these datasets (Table 3) - directly measurable with clear experimental results
- **Medium confidence:** Claim that "strong local semantic affinity" explains LSTM superiority - empirical result is clear but lacks ablation studies isolating local vs. long-range dependencies
- **Low confidence:** Practical utility claim that HieroLM "complements CV-based methods" - theoretical rather than demonstrated capability as paper doesn't integrate with actual image-based systems

## Next Checks

1. **Distribution analysis:** Stratify test performance by sentence type (offering formulas vs. narrative vs. administrative) to quantify whether the "44% accuracy" masks significant variation across text genres.

2. **Damage pattern simulation:** Implement non-random gap insertion to better simulate real-world damage and measure performance degradation compared to random insertion.

3. **Model complexity ablation:** Train deeper LSTM variants and bidirectional models with early stopping to determine whether the single-layer design is truly optimal or simply a safe choice given data constraints.
