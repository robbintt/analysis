# Adaptive Label Error Detection: A Bayesian Approach to Mislabeled Data Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.10084
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10084
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ALED achieves 84.7% sensitivity in detecting mislabeled samples, outperforming Confident Learning's 42.3% while maintaining comparable precision

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of detecting mislabeled samples in datasets used for training deep learning models. The authors propose Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a novel method that leverages intermediate feature representations from deep convolutional neural networks to identify mislabeled samples. By extracting penultimate layer features, reducing dimensionality, and fitting Gaussian distributions to class clusters using Minimum Covariance Determinant estimation, ALED applies a likelihood ratio test to detect outliers likely corresponding to mislabeled samples. The method demonstrates significantly higher sensitivity compared to established approaches while maintaining precision, resulting in substantial improvements in model performance when used for dataset cleaning.

## Method Summary
ALED operates by first extracting features from the penultimate layer of pretrained DCNNs (DenseNet121 and ResNet50), then reducing dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to capture 90% of variance. The method fits Gaussian distributions to each class cluster using Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimation to robustly estimate parameters in the presence of outliers. A likelihood ratio test is then applied to identify samples whose feature representations deviate significantly from their assigned class distribution, marking them as potential mislabeled instances. The approach is evaluated on four medical imaging datasets with 5% simulated label noise, demonstrating superior performance compared to Confident Learning and its feature-based variant.

## Key Results
- ALED achieves 84.7% sensitivity in detecting mislabeled samples versus 42.3% for Confident Learning
- The method maintains comparable precision to established approaches while significantly improving sensitivity
- Using ALED to clean datasets results in a 33.8% reduction in test set errors
- Performance is consistent across multiple medical imaging datasets (PneumoniaMNIST, BreastMNIST, RetinaMNIST, BloodMNIST)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ALED works by leveraging the hierarchical feature representations learned by deep neural networks, where the penultimate layer captures high-level semantic features that are relatively stable to label noise. By fitting robust Gaussian distributions to these features using MCD estimation, the method can identify samples that deviate significantly from their assigned class distribution. The likelihood ratio test provides a principled statistical framework for outlier detection, while the dimensionality reduction via PCA helps mitigate the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional feature spaces. This combination allows ALED to effectively distinguish between correctly labeled samples and outliers that likely correspond to mislabeled instances.

## Foundational Learning
- Gaussian Mixture Models: Why needed - for modeling class distributions in feature space; Quick check - verify that data follows approximately Gaussian distributions within each class
- Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD): Why needed - robust parameter estimation in presence of outliers; Quick check - compare MCD estimates with standard maximum likelihood estimates
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Why needed - dimensionality reduction for computational efficiency and noise reduction; Quick check - verify explained variance ratio meets threshold
- Likelihood Ratio Test: Why needed - principled statistical framework for outlier detection; Quick check - confirm test statistic follows expected distribution under null hypothesis
- Feature Extraction from Pretrained Models: Why needed - leverage learned representations without additional training; Quick check - verify feature extraction pipeline matches original model architecture

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Pretrained DCNN -> Feature Extraction -> PCA Dimensionality Reduction -> MCD Estimation -> Likelihood Ratio Test -> Label Error Detection

Critical Path:
The critical path involves extracting penultimate layer features from pretrained models, reducing dimensionality with PCA, fitting robust Gaussian distributions using MCD, and applying the likelihood ratio test. Each component must function correctly for accurate detection, with feature quality being particularly crucial as it directly impacts downstream analysis.

Design Tradeoffs:
The method trades computational complexity for accuracy by using robust statistical methods (MCD) and comprehensive feature analysis. While this approach is more computationally intensive than simple confidence-based methods, it provides significantly better sensitivity. The choice of 90% variance retention in PCA represents a balance between computational efficiency and information preservation.

Failure Signatures:
- Poor feature quality from pretrained models leads to degraded detection performance
- Non-Gaussian class distributions violate method assumptions, reducing effectiveness
- High dimensionality not adequately addressed by PCA can cause computational issues
- MCD estimation may fail with extreme outlier proportions (>20%)
- Likelihood ratio test may produce false positives when classes have significant overlap

First Experiments:
1. Verify feature extraction pipeline produces consistent embeddings across different runs
2. Test PCA dimensionality reduction on feature space to confirm 90% variance retention
3. Validate MCD estimation by comparing fitted parameters with known clean subsets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit limitations suggest areas for future investigation including generalizability to non-medical domains, performance with varying noise levels and patterns, and computational efficiency considerations.

## Limitations
- Focus on medical imaging datasets with specific architectures (DenseNet121 and ResNet50) may limit generalizability
- Reliance on pretrained models and simulated 5% label noise raises questions about performance under different noise distributions
- Method assumes Gaussian distributions adequately model class clusters, which may not hold for complex or multimodal distributions
- Evaluation lacks comprehensive analysis of false positive rates and computational efficiency

## Confidence

| Major Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------------|------------------|
| Effectiveness of ALED in detecting mislabeled samples | High |
| Superiority over established methods like Confident Learning | High |
| Practical impact on model performance | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test ALED on non-medical imaging datasets and diverse model architectures to evaluate domain generalizability
2. Conduct experiments with varying noise levels (0-50%) and different noise patterns (random vs. class-dependent) to assess robustness
3. Implement ablation studies to determine the individual contributions of MCD estimation and likelihood ratio testing to overall performance
