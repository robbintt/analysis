# Structured Outputs Enable General-Purpose LLMs to be Medical Experts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.03194
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03194
- **Reference count**: 37
- **Primary result**: Med-SoCoT achieves 85.8 Factuality Score on MedLFQA benchmark, surpassing fine-tuned models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Medical Structured Output Chain-of-Thought (Med-SoCoT), a prompt-based approach that guides large language models through a seven-step clinical reasoning process to generate comprehensive medical responses. The method addresses hallucinations and incomplete coverage in medical question-answering by structuring outputs into systematic components including understanding, analysis, assessment, and source referencing. Experiments on the MedLFQA benchmark demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, with Med-SoCoT achieving a Factuality Score of 85.8 compared to 74.2 for fine-tuned models.

The approach shows strong transferability to smaller models without requiring additional training, making it a scalable solution for medical question-answering. By providing a structured framework for clinical reasoning, Med-SoCoT enables general-purpose LLMs to function as medical experts while maintaining transparency and reducing the risk of generating inaccurate or incomplete medical information.

## Method Summary
Med-SoCoT implements a seven-step reasoning process that guides LLMs through medical question-answering: understanding the question, recalling relevant knowledge, analyzing information, providing assessment, offering additional context, suggesting follow-up steps, and referencing sources. The structured output format ensures comprehensive coverage of medical queries while minimizing hallucinations. The method uses prompt engineering rather than fine-tuning, making it applicable across different model sizes. The approach was evaluated on the MedLFQA benchmark, which contains medical questions requiring clinical reasoning and factual accuracy.

## Key Results
- Med-SoCoT achieves Factuality Score of 85.8 on MedLFQA benchmark
- Outperforms fine-tuned models (74.2) and zero-shot baselines significantly
- Successfully transfers to smaller models without additional training requirements
- Demonstrates consistent performance improvements across different model sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The seven-step structured output framework provides systematic clinical reasoning that guides models through comprehensive medical analysis. Each step serves a specific purpose: understanding ensures question comprehension, knowledge recall provides medical context, analysis synthesizes information, assessment delivers conclusions, additional information adds depth, follow-up steps offer next actions, and source referencing maintains transparency. This structure prevents incomplete responses and reduces hallucinations by forcing systematic coverage of all necessary components.

## Foundational Learning

**Clinical Reasoning Framework**: Why needed - Medical questions require systematic analysis; Quick check - Verify each of the seven steps is addressed in responses

**Structured Output Format**: Why needed - Prevents incomplete or hallucinated information; Quick check - Confirm all output components are present and relevant

**Prompt Engineering**: Why needed - Guides model reasoning without fine-tuning; Quick check - Test prompt variations for effectiveness

**Medical Knowledge Integration**: Why needed - Ensures accurate clinical information; Quick check - Validate medical facts against authoritative sources

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Question Understanding -> Knowledge Recall -> Analysis -> Assessment -> Additional Information -> Follow-up Steps -> Source Referencing

**Critical Path**: The seven-step reasoning sequence forms the critical path, where each component builds upon the previous one to generate comprehensive medical responses

**Design Tradeoffs**: Prompt engineering vs. fine-tuning (cost vs. performance), structured outputs vs. free-form responses (completeness vs. flexibility), general vs. domain-specific prompts (transferability vs. optimization)

**Failure Signatures**: Missing components in structured output, inconsistent medical facts across steps, irrelevant follow-up suggestions, inadequate source referencing, incomplete analysis sections

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test each individual step's contribution by removing one component at a time
2. Compare structured vs. unstructured outputs on same medical questions
3. Evaluate performance across different medical specialties within the benchmark

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on human ratings rather than verifiable clinical outcomes
- Lacks expert clinician validation for structured outputs
- Factuality Score methodology lacks transparency in calculation details
- Claims of "general-purpose" expertise may overstate capabilities for specific benchmarks

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Structured output approach improves Factuality Score over baseline methods on MedLFQA benchmark

**Medium Confidence**: The seven-step reasoning process consistently guides accurate clinical responses across different model sizes

**Medium Confidence**: Performance gains translate to smaller models without additional training requirements

## Next Checks
1. Conduct clinician expert review of structured outputs for clinical accuracy and safety, comparing against established medical guidelines
2. Test the approach on additional medical QA benchmarks with different formats and domains to assess generalizability
3. Perform ablation studies to identify which specific components of the seven-step structure contribute most to performance improvements
