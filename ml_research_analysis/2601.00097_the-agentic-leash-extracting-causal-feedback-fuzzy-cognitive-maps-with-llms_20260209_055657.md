# The Agentic Leash: Extracting Causal Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.00097
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00097
- Authors: Akash Kumar Panda; Olaoluwa Adigun; Bart Kosko
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Agentic LLM-based method extracts FCMs from text; extracted FCMs converge to same equilibria as human-generated ones despite node/edge differences.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a three-step guided LLM extraction method to build causal Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) from unstructured text. The pipeline systematically extracts nouns/noun phrases, refines them into causal concept nodes, and infers weighted edges with textual evidence. Tested on a Kissinger essay, the method produces FCMs that converge to identical equilibrium limit cycles as human-generated ones, even with different node and edge counts. Mixing FCMs from Gemini and ChatGPT agents yielded a 24-node system that retained dominant equilibria while creating new ones. The approach enables automated, interpretable causal modeling from unstructured text.

## Method Summary
The method uses a three-step guided LLM extraction pipeline: (1) extract nouns/noun phrases from text using sentence-by-sentence parsing, (2) refine these into FCM concept nodes by filtering for nouns associated with qualitative/quantitative measures and causal links, and (3) infer weighted edges between node-pairs by evaluating textual evidence and verbs indicating causal direction and strength. The extracted FCMs evolve through discrete-time vector-matrix multiplication with nonlinear squashing, iterating until reaching fixed points, limit cycles, or chaotic attractors. FCMs from different LLMs can be combined via convex combination with zero-padding to preserve causal structure.

## Key Results
- Three-step guided extraction produces FCMs converging to same equilibrium limit cycles as human-generated FCMs despite differing node/edge counts
- FCM mixing via convex combination preserves dominant equilibria while generating new ones
- Guided prompts produce smaller but more reliable FCMs compared to unguided approaches
- System instructions requiring textual evidence significantly reduce hallucination in extracted edges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Three-Step Guided Extraction Pipeline
Structured system instructions guide LLMs to systematically extract FCM components from unstructured text with reduced hallucination. The pipeline decomposes extraction into three sequential tasks: noun/phrase extraction, node refinement, and edge extraction with textual evidence. Each step constrains the solution space for the next. Unguided prompts produce inconsistent FCMs with hallucinated edges; texts with implicit or ambiguous causal language may yield unreliable structures.

### Mechanism 2: Equilibrium Convergence via Feedback Dynamics
FCMs evolve through discrete-time vector-matrix multiplication with nonlinear squashing: C_j(t+1) = Φ(Σ_i C_i(t)w_ij). The weighted adjacency matrix defines causal feedback loops. Iteration continues until reaching fixed points, K-step limit cycles, or chaotic attractors. The basin-to-equilibrium map approximates the underlying dynamical system. Edge weights producing chaotic attractors or wrong-signed causal relationships break convergence; initial states outside relevant basins of attraction also cause issues.

### Mechanism 3: FCM Mixture via Convex Combination
Combining FCMs from multiple LLMs through convex combination preserves dominant equilibria while generating new ones. Given m FCMs with node sets S_k and edge matrices E_k, define union node set S = ∪S_k. Zero-pad each E_k to N×N where N=|S|, then compute E_mixed = Σ_k v_k*E_k where v_k are convex weights (≥0, Σv_k=1). The mixed FCM inherits causal structure from all components and remains a valid FCM. Incompatible node abstractions across LLMs or excessive zero-padding that dilutes edge weights are break conditions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs)** - Core representation—directed weighted graphs where nodes are causal concepts, edges are fuzzy causal relationships ([-1,1]), and feedback loops enable equilibrium analysis. Why needed: The paper's entire framework depends on this representation. Quick check: Given a 3-node FCM with edges A→B=0.8, B→C=-0.5, C→A=0.3, what type of structure does this represent?

- **Concept: Limit Cycles and Fixed-Point Attractors** - The paper validates extracted FCMs by comparing their equilibrium behavior—states that repeat (limit cycles) or stabilize (fixed points) under iteration. Why needed: Equilibrium convergence is the primary validation metric. Quick check: If state vector C(t) = [1,0,1] and after 3 iterations C(t+3) = C(t), what equilibrium type is this?

- **Concept: System Instructions vs. Prompts** - The extraction relies on "finely tuned system instructions" that shape LLM behavior—distinct from user prompts, these set persistent behavioral constraints. Why needed: The method's success depends critically on these instructions, not standard prompting. Quick check: Why might system instructions reduce hallucination compared to unguided prompts for causal extraction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw text document -> Step 1 (Noun Extraction: LLM + System Instruction 1 -> List of nouns/noun phrases) -> Step 2 (Node Refinement: LLM + System Instruction 2 -> Filtered FCM nodes) -> Step 3 (Edge Extraction: LLM + System Instruction 3 -> Weighted adjacency matrix with textual evidence) -> Dynamics Engine (Iterative state evolution -> Equilibrium detection) -> Optional Mixer (Zero-padding + convex combination for multi-LLM FCM fusion)

- **Critical path**: 1. Design System Instruction 1 to extract ALL nouns/phrases (over-inclusion is fine; refinement follows) 2. Design System Instruction 2 to filter for causally-active concepts (must have associated measures) 3. Design System Instruction 3 to require textual evidence for each edge—this is the hallucination guardrail 4. Run dynamics until convergence or max iterations; verify limit cycle detection

- **Design tradeoffs**: Node count vs. interpretability: More nodes capture more nuance but complicate equilibrium analysis; Guided vs. unguided prompts: Guided produces smaller but more reliable FCMs (Fig 10: 12→15 nodes Gemini, 24→20 nodes GPT); Single vs. mixed LLM: Mixing adds coverage but requires node alignment and may dilute strong edges

- **Failure signatures**: Hallucinated edges: Edges without textual citation—tighten System Instruction 3; Chaotic dynamics: No convergence within reasonable iterations—check for excessive positive feedback loops; Trivial equilibria: All nodes activate/deactivate together—edge weights may be too uniform or nodes insufficiently differentiated; Node mismatch in mixing: Zero-padding dominates—requires manual node alignment or semantic matching

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Reproduce the paragraph-level extraction (Figures 4-7) with a single LLM—verify noun→node→edge pipeline produces a converging FCM 2. Compare guided vs. unguided prompts on the same text—measure differences in node count, edge count, and equilibrium behavior 3. Implement FCM mixing with two LLMs on a shared document—verify that mixed FCM preserves at least one equilibrium from each component

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How should FCMs from different LLM agents be optimally weighted when mixed?
- Basis in paper: Paper uses equal mixing weights for Gemini and ChatGPT FCMs without justification.
- Why unresolved: No investigation of weighting strategies based on agent reliability or domain expertise.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing weighting schemes against expert-validated FCMs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the extraction method generalize across document types and domains?
- Basis in paper: Only tested on one Kissinger essay; claims scalability without empirical evidence.
- Why unresolved: No experiments on books, technical papers, or domain-specific documents.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-domain extraction with quality evaluation on diverse corpora.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can a fully bidirectional agentic system be implemented where equilibria drive text fetching?
- Basis in paper: Describes equilibria-driven text retrieval as core to agency, but implements only text→FCM direction.
- Why unresolved: Closed-loop architecture is conceptual; actual system is unidirectional extraction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Working autonomous system that fetches and processes text based on detected equilibrium states.

## Limitations
- Prompt specificity gap: Exact system instruction wording is not provided, creating reproducibility barriers
- Weight assignment ambiguity: Mapping from causal verbs to [-1,1] fuzzy weights is not specified
- Limited external validation: Testing was performed only on the Kissinger essay with human FCMs as sole ground truth

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The three-step guided extraction framework works as described. The paper demonstrates systematic, reproducible extraction with reduced hallucination compared to unguided approaches.
- **Medium confidence**: FCMs extracted by LLMs converge to similar equilibria as human-generated FCMs. The evidence shows qualitative agreement on the Kissinger text, but this hasn't been validated across diverse sources.
- **Low confidence**: The convex combination mixing mechanism produces meaningful new equilibria. While mathematically sound, the creative capacity claim lacks empirical validation beyond the single example.

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt sensitivity analysis**: Run the extraction pipeline with systematic variations in system instruction wording for Step 3 (evidence citation requirement). Measure changes in hallucination rate, edge count, and equilibrium convergence.
2. **Cross-domain FCM extraction**: Apply the method to 3-5 diverse texts from different domains (scientific, news, policy). Compare FCM equilibrium behavior across domains and against human annotations.
3. **Edge weight sensitivity testing**: Implement three different weight assignment schemes (uniform, verb-intensity-based, and random within bounds) and measure impact on limit cycle detection and stability.
