# Keyword Spotting with Hyper-Matched Filters for Small Footprint Devices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.04857
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04857
- Reference count: 40
- Smallest 4.2M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art keyword spotting performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HyperSpotter, an open-vocabulary keyword spotting system specifically designed for resource-constrained devices. The system combines a speech encoder with a target keyword encoder that generates keyword-specific convolutional weights, creating a matched filter approach. Using a Perceiver architecture for cross-attention, HyperSpotter demonstrates state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a small footprint, with the 4.2M parameter model matching or outperforming larger models across multiple datasets. The system shows strong generalization to challenging scenarios including second-language speech and out-of-domain conditions.

## Method Summary
HyperSpotter employs a novel approach that combines a pre-trained speech encoder (either tiny Whisper or tiny Conformer) with a target keyword encoder. The keyword encoder generates convolutional weights specific to the target keyword, which are then applied within a Perceiver architecture to guide cross-attention toward the keyword. This creates an adaptive matched filter that can detect arbitrary keywords in an open-vocabulary setting. The system is trained on large-scale datasets and demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities across various acoustic conditions and language scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves 96.4% AUC on challenging LibriPhrase benchmark
- 4.2M parameter model matches or outperforms larger models
- Strong performance on second-language speech and out-of-domain scenarios
- Demonstrates effective open-vocabulary keyword detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by dynamically generating convolutional weights specific to each target keyword, effectively creating a matched filter for that keyword. The Perceiver architecture uses these weights to guide cross-attention mechanisms, focusing the model's attention on relevant acoustic patterns corresponding to the target keyword. This adaptive approach allows the system to handle arbitrary keywords without requiring separate models for each keyword, while the small-footprint design makes it suitable for embedded devices.

## Foundational Learning

**Matched Filter Theory**: Understanding how filters can be designed to maximize detection of specific signals in noise - needed for grasping the core detection mechanism, quick check: can you explain how a matched filter maximizes signal-to-noise ratio?

**Perceiver Architecture**: Knowledge of how Perceiver models handle cross-attention and sequence processing - needed for understanding the attention mechanism, quick check: can you describe how Perceiver differs from standard Transformer attention?

**Speech Encoding**: Understanding of how speech signals are processed and represented in neural networks - needed for grasping the initial signal processing, quick check: can you explain the difference between frame-level and sequence-level speech representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Speech -> Speech Encoder -> Target Keyword Encoder -> Convolutional Weight Generator -> Perceiver Cross-Attention -> Detection Output

**Critical Path**: The keyword-specific convolutional weights generation and their application in the Perceiver cross-attention module represents the most critical path for system performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice between tiny Whisper and tiny Conformer encoders affects both performance and computational requirements, while the open-vocabulary approach trades some specialization for flexibility.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on homonyms or context-dependent keywords, degraded accuracy with highly accented speech outside training distribution, potential false positives with similar-sounding words.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test keyword detection accuracy across varying signal-to-noise ratios
2. Measure inference latency and memory usage on target embedded hardware
3. Evaluate cross-lingual keyword detection performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation limited to specific curated datasets rather than real-world conditions
- 4.2M parameters may still be too large for ultra-constrained embedded devices
- Open-vocabulary capability faces challenges with homonyms and context-dependent meanings
- No analysis of real-time processing constraints or energy consumption

## Confidence
- Core performance metrics on tested datasets: Medium-High
- Real-world deployment viability: Low-Medium
- Generalization claims beyond evaluated corpora: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on a broader range of acoustic environments and noise conditions, including real-world recordings
2. Evaluate the system's performance on ultra-low-power microcontrollers with strict memory constraints
3. Conduct long-term stability testing to measure false positive rates over extended periods and across varying keyword contexts
