# TVS Sidekick: Challenges and Practical Insights from Deploying Large Language Models in the Enterprise

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26482
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26482
- Reference count: 14
- TVS Sidekick, an AI assistant using LLMs with RAG, processed over 750 queries in a four-month pilot, demonstrating value for retrieving enterprise knowledge and aligning with ISO/IEC 42001 AI management standards.

## Executive Summary
TVS SCS UK developed TVS Sidekick, an in-house AI assistant using large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer queries from enterprise data sources. The system integrates SharePoint, Azure DevOps, code repositories, and company websites into a vector database, enabling semantic search and code-specific prompt engineering. A monitoring framework was implemented to track usage and feedback. Over a four-month pilot (March-June 2025), Sidekick processed over 750 queries, averaging five questions per session and a 46-second response time. Usage was highest among IT and business roles. Qualitative feedback highlighted Sidekick’s value for retrieving SharePoint content and business logic, though technical users noted insufficient code detail. The project also aligned with ISO/IEC 42001 AI management standards, establishing governance processes for risk management, monitoring, and continuous improvement.

## Method Summary
TVS Sidekick was developed as an in-house AI assistant integrating SharePoint, Azure DevOps, code repositories, and company websites into a vector database for semantic search. The system employed LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and code-specific prompt engineering. A monitoring framework tracked usage and feedback during a four-month pilot (March-June 2025). Qualitative feedback was collected from pilot participants across IT and business roles. The project aligned with ISO/IEC 42001 AI management standards, establishing governance for risk management, monitoring, and continuous improvement.

## Key Results
- Processed over 750 queries in four months, averaging five questions per session and a 46-second response time.
- Highest usage among IT and business roles, with users valuing SharePoint and business logic retrieval.
- Technical users reported code responses lacked sufficient detail.
- Governance framework aligned with ISO/IEC 42001 AI management standards.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TVS Sidekick leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to combine semantic search of enterprise data with LLM-driven query responses, enabling efficient access to internal knowledge. Integration with SharePoint, Azure DevOps, and code repositories ensures comprehensive data coverage. Prompt engineering tailored for code-specific queries enhances relevance for technical users. The monitoring framework enables continuous feedback and iterative improvement. Governance aligned with ISO/IEC 42001 ensures responsible AI deployment and risk management.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines semantic search with LLM responses for accurate, context-aware answers. *Why needed*: Enables efficient retrieval of relevant enterprise knowledge. *Quick check*: Verify semantic search retrieves accurate, context-specific documents.
2. **Vector Database Integration**: Stores and indexes enterprise data for fast semantic search. *Why needed*: Supports scalable, real-time query processing. *Quick check*: Confirm vector embeddings accurately represent document content.
3. **Code-Specific Prompt Engineering**: Tailors LLM prompts for technical queries. *Why needed*: Improves relevance and accuracy of code-related responses. *Quick check*: Test prompt effectiveness with sample code queries.
4. **ISO/IEC 42001 AI Governance**: Establishes risk management, monitoring, and continuous improvement processes. *Why needed*: Ensures responsible and compliant AI deployment. *Quick check*: Review governance documentation for alignment with ISO standards.
5. **Usage Monitoring Framework**: Tracks query volume, session duration, and user feedback. *Why needed*: Enables data-driven optimization and user experience improvements. *Quick check*: Analyze metrics for trends and anomalies.
6. **Enterprise Data Integration**: Connects SharePoint, Azure DevOps, and code repositories. *Why needed*: Provides comprehensive access to internal knowledge. *Quick check*: Validate data synchronization and retrieval accuracy.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Enterprise data sources -> Vector database -> RAG pipeline -> LLM -> User interface
**Critical Path**: Data ingestion -> Vector embedding -> Semantic search -> Prompt engineering -> LLM response -> User feedback
**Design Tradeoffs**: Single vector database for simplicity vs. distributed systems for scalability; Azure ecosystem for integration vs. vendor lock-in.
**Failure Signatures**: Poor semantic search results (vector embedding issues), irrelevant LLM responses (prompt engineering flaws), low adoption (user interface or trust issues).
**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test semantic search accuracy with sample enterprise documents.
2. Validate LLM response relevance for code-specific queries.
3. Measure user satisfaction with initial pilot feedback.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Absence of a control group or comparative baseline limits verification of efficiency and accuracy improvements.
- Feedback based on voluntary pilot participants and qualitative interviews, introducing potential selection and self-report biases.
- Usage patterns reported descriptively without statistical testing; four-month pilot may not reflect long-term adoption.
- Reliance on a single vector database and Azure ecosystem limits generalizability to other technical stacks.

## Confidence
- Sidekick reduces time to retrieve enterprise knowledge (Medium): Supported by average session duration and query volume, but lacks task completion benchmarks or pre/post comparisons.
- Users perceive high value in SharePoint and business logic queries (High): Consistently reflected in qualitative feedback across roles.
- Code-related responses lack sufficient technical depth (Medium): Based on technical user reports; no systematic evaluation of response quality or completeness.
- TVS SCS governance framework aligns with ISO/IEC 42001 (High): Directly stated and operationalized through documented risk and monitoring procedures.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing Sidekick-assisted query resolution time and accuracy against baseline manual search across multiple enterprise departments.
2. Implement a longitudinal study to assess retention, changing usage patterns, and sustained productivity gains beyond the initial pilot phase.
3. Perform a third-party audit of response quality for code-related queries using standardized technical benchmarks and peer review.
