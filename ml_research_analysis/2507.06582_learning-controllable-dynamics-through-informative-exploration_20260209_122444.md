## Executive Summary
This work introduces an approach for learning the dynamics of controllable Markov chains through informative exploration. The method uses a predicted information gain (PIG) measure to select the most informative controls for exploration, extending prior work by applying reinforcement learning techniques to find better non-myopic exploring policies. The authors demonstrate their approach by comparing it with several myopic exploration methods across multiple environments, showing that the rollout policy consistently leads to more reliable estimates of the underlying dynamics. The work also introduces a novel methodology for comparing estimated controllable Markov chains by evaluating their performance on infinite horizon optimal control tasks, providing a principled way to assess model quality beyond traditional information-theoretic measures.

## Method Summary
The approach learns transition probabilities of an unknown controllable Markov chain (CMC) through informative exploration over a finite horizon. It maintains a count tensor F tracking observed transitions and uses a Dirichlet posterior to estimate transition probabilities. The PIG metric quantifies expected information gain from observing each possible transition, guiding exploration. The key innovation is the rollout policy that simulates trajectories using a PIG-greedy base policy to approximate lookahead planning. The final CMC estimate is evaluated on infinite-horizon optimal control tasks via policy iteration, providing a principled measure of model quality beyond information-theoretic metrics alone.

## Key Results
- PIG rollout consistently outperforms myopic methods (Random, PIG Greedy, JPIG Greedy) in terms of missing information across environments
- Task-based evaluation reveals PIG rollout's estimated CMC achieves optimal control performance (total cost = 2) while others perform poorly (cost = 100)
- The rollout scheme successfully navigates transient states that myopic methods miss due to greedy behavior
- Novel methodology for CMC comparison through infinite-horizon control tasks provides more meaningful model quality assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
PIG computes expected KL divergence between current transition estimate and a hypothetically-updated estimate that would result from observing a transition. This enables informative action selection without knowing true transition probabilities. The expectation over possible next states means PIG depends only on current estimates, not the unknown true dynamics. Core assumption: KL divergence between Dirichlet posterior estimates meaningfully quantifies "learning progress" for exploration decisions. Break condition: If transition estimates become highly confident, PIG values collapse toward zero, eliminating exploration signal regardless of remaining uncertainty elsewhere.

### Mechanism 2
Rollout policies with PIG-based base policies achieve non-myopic exploration that outperforms greedy approaches in environments with transient states. The rollout scheme approximates the intractable dynamic programming solution by simulating trajectories under a base policy, accumulating PIG values along each path. This one-step lookahead captures the planning needed to reach transient states before they become inaccessible. Core assumption: The PIG greedy base policy is sufficiently correlated with optimal exploration that simulating its trajectories provides useful lookahead value estimates. Break condition: If the base policy performs catastrophically (e.g., immediately enters absorbing states), rollout simulations provide misleading value estimates unless many rollouts reveal escaping paths.

### Mechanism 3
Task-based evaluation on infinite-horizon control problems reveals model quality differences that information-theoretic measures alone may miss. Learned CMCs are evaluated by computing optimal policies via Bellman equation and measuring total discounted cost under the true dynamics. This tests whether estimated transitions support correct control decisions, not just low KL divergence. Core assumption: Performance on a specific downstream task generalizes to model quality for related control problems. Break condition: If the evaluation task is poorly matched to exploration objectives (e.g., requires transitions never sampled), all policies appear equally bad regardless of model quality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Dirichlet distribution for categorical parameter estimation**
  - Why needed here: The CMC estimate is the posterior mean of a Dirichlet distribution with parameters from transition counts. Understanding conjugate priors explains why adding pseudo-counts represents prior ignorance.
  - Quick check question: Given count tensor F with F_uij = 3 for one transition and F_uij' = 1 for another, what is p̂_ij(u, F) with α = 0.05?

- **KL divergence properties**
  - Why needed here: PIG is built on KL divergence between transition distributions. Recognizing that KL divergence is asymmetric, non-negative, and zero only for identical distributions clarifies PIG behavior.
  - Quick check question: Why is KL divergence D_KL[P||Q] ≠ D_KL[Q||P] in general, and which direction does PIG use?

- **Rollout / Monte Carlo Tree Search basics**
  - Why needed here: The rollout policy approximates dynamic programming via simulation. Understanding how base policies generate trajectories and how averaging reduces variance is essential.
  - Quick check question: In rollout, why does the policy improvement guarantee require deterministic dynamics or specific tie-breaking rules?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Environment (black box simulator) -> Count Tensor F -> CMC Estimator -> Transition estimates p̂ -> PIG Calculator -> Exploration Loop -> Rollout Simulator -> Final CMC Estimate -> Task Evaluator -> Performance Metrics

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize F to zeros (or prior counts from α)
  2. At each timestep k: compute PIG(i, u, F) for all valid controls
  3. Run rollout simulations from each (i, u) pair using PIG greedy base policy
  4. Select u maximizing Eq. 5 (PIG + expected future value)
  5. Execute u in environment, observe j, update F_uij ← F_uij + 1
  6. Repeat until horizon N
  7. Evaluate final p̂ on downstream task via policy iteration

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Horizon N**: Longer horizons capture more planning but increase rollout computation quadratically
  - **Monte Carlo samples**: More samples reduce variance in J̃_{k+1} but cost linear compute time
  - **Prior α**: Larger α represents more prior knowledge but slows adaptation; smaller α is more responsive but risks overconfident early estimates
  - **Base policy choice**: PIG greedy is principled but could be replaced with domain-specific heuristics

- Failure signatures:
  - **PIG collapse**: All PIG values near zero despite high missing information → counts too concentrated, consider resetting F or increasing α
  - **Absorbing state trapping**: Agent enters absorbing state early and never escapes → rollout horizon too short or base policy inadequate
  - **JPIG outperforming PIG rollout**: Suggests state-space is sparse relative to reachable dynamics; controllable dynamics concentrated on small subset

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce Fig. 2**: Implement all four exploration methods on the 2-state CMC with p=0; verify PIG rollout achieves lowest missing information after ~10 timesteps
  2. **Ablate rollout depth**: Test PIG rollout with 1-step, 3-step, and 5-step lookahead on the 3-state CMC; plot missing information curves to find compute-performance sweet spot
  3. **Task generalization test**: Train CMC estimates using each method on Fig. 4 environment, then evaluate on a different infinite-horizon task (e.g., minimize time to reach state 2); assess whether PIG rollout's advantage persists across tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: How does maximizing predicted information gain (PIG) specifically map onto the cognitive process of hypothesis formation? The paper draws an analogy to animal behavior and "hypothesis formation" but utilizes a purely information-theoretic metric without defining the cognitive or theoretical bridge between the two concepts.

## Limitations
- The specific one-step lookahead rollout policy lacks rigorous convergence guarantees, with theoretical foundations established only in related work
- Several critical implementation details remain unspecified, including Monte Carlo sample counts and exact transition probabilities for test environments
- The novel task-based evaluation methodology, while principled, has limited empirical validation beyond the presented examples

## Confidence
- **PIG mechanism and theoretical basis**: High confidence - built on established information-theoretic foundations with clear mathematical formulation
- **Rollout policy effectiveness**: Medium confidence - intuitive approach with empirical support, but theoretical guarantees limited to approximate policy improvement
- **Task-based evaluation methodology**: Medium confidence - novel and principled, but requires broader validation across diverse control tasks
- **Reproducibility**: Medium confidence - core algorithms are specified, but missing implementation details could affect results

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study**: Implement PIG rollout with varying lookahead depths (1-step, 3-step, 5-step) on the 3-state CMC to empirically determine the optimal computational tradeoff between planning depth and performance.

2. **Task generalization**: Train CMC estimates using each exploration method on the Fig. 4 environment, then evaluate on a different infinite-horizon control task (e.g., minimize time to reach state 2). Assess whether PIG rollout's advantage persists across task domains.

3. **Base policy sensitivity**: Replace the PIG greedy base policy in rollout with an entropy-based exploration policy (maximizing state-action entropy). Compare performance to determine if PIG's specific information measure is essential or if any informative base policy suffices.
