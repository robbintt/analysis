# SolverLLM: Leveraging Test-Time Scaling for Optimization Problem via LLM-Guided Search

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16916
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16916
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SolverLLM achieves up to 10% improvement in solving accuracy over prompt-based and learning-based baselines on six benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
SolverLLM introduces a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling and LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to solve diverse optimization problems. Unlike existing prompt-based or learning-based approaches, SolverLLM incrementally generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code guided by novel MCTS strategies. The framework achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining flexibility across different optimization domains.

## Method Summary
The method combines LLM capabilities with MCTS to guide the search for optimal mathematical formulations. SolverLLM uses dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, prompt backpropagation to steer exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and uncertainty backpropagation to incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. The approach incrementally generates formulations and translates them into executable code without requiring additional training on optimization tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 10% improvement in solving accuracy over prompt-based and learning-based baselines
- Outperforms existing approaches on six benchmark optimization datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness of MCTS-guided formulation generation without requiring additional training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages test-time scaling capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to explore mathematical formulation spaces through guided search. MCTS provides systematic exploration of solution paths while backpropagation mechanisms ensure exploration is directed by both outcome quality and uncertainty in rewards. This combination allows SolverLLM to navigate complex optimization landscapes without relying on task-specific training data.

## Foundational Learning
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Required for systematic exploration of formulation spaces; quick check: verify understanding of selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation phases
- Mathematical formulation generation: Core capability for translating optimization problems into solver-ready code; quick check: confirm ability to map problem constraints to mathematical expressions
- Backpropagation mechanisms: Essential for incorporating feedback into search decisions; quick check: understand difference between outcome-driven and uncertainty-driven feedback

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Problem input -> Formulation generator -> MCTS planner -> Code translator -> Solver execution -> Result evaluation -> Feedback loop

**Critical path:** Input problem -> MCTS formulation search -> Code generation -> Solver execution -> Performance evaluation

**Design tradeoffs:** Training-free approach vs. reliance on pre-trained LLM capabilities; systematic search vs. computational overhead

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance indicates limitations in LLM mathematical reasoning or insufficient exploration depth in MCTS; runtime issues suggest computational bottlenecks in search process

**First experiments:**
1. Test formulation generation on simple optimization problems to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate MCTS exploration on toy problems with known solutions
3. Benchmark runtime performance against direct prompting approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends on pre-trained LLM capabilities rather than being truly training-free
- Evaluation restricted to well-defined mathematical problems, limiting generalizability
- Computational overhead from MCTS-based search not quantified against baseline approaches

## Confidence
- Performance claims on benchmark datasets: Medium confidence
- Innovation contributions: Low confidence (no ablation studies)
- Training-free characterization: Medium confidence
- Generalizability to real-world problems: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing each innovation (dynamic expansion, prompt backpropagation, uncertainty backpropagation) to quantify individual contributions to performance gains.

2. Evaluate on optimization problems with noisy reward signals and non-convex solution spaces to test robustness beyond clean mathematical benchmarks.

3. Compare wall-clock runtime and computational resources against baseline approaches to quantify the practical cost of the MCTS-based formulation search.
