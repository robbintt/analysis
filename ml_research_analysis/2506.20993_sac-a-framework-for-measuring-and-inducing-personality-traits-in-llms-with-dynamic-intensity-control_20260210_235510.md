# SAC: A Framework for Measuring and Inducing Personality Traits in LLMs with Dynamic Intensity Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.20993
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20993
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Introduces SAC framework achieving continuous 1-5 intensity control for 16PF traits in LLMs via adjective-based semantic anchoring, with more consistent modulation than binary approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the SAC (Semantic Anchoring for Control) framework, which enables fine-grained personality trait induction in large language models using the 16PF model with continuous intensity control. The key innovation is combining adjective-based semantic anchoring with five behavioral intensity dimensions to modulate trait expression on a 1-5 scale. Experiments on four LLMs show SAC achieves more consistent and controllable personality modulation compared to binary approaches like P2 prompting. The results reveal that LLMs exhibit psychologically coherent inter-trait relationships, with induced traits systematically influencing related traits in expected directions, demonstrating that LLMs internalize multi-dimensional personality structures.

## Method Summary
The SAC framework measures and induces personality traits in LLMs using the 16PF model with 16 traits. It employs adjective-based semantic anchoring to map abstract intensity levels (1-5) to concrete descriptors, combined with five behavioral dimensions (Frequency, Depth, Threshold, Effort, Willingness) to create composite trait scores. The framework uses structured prompts that define target traits and intensity levels, then evaluates responses through a 163-item PERS-16 benchmark questionnaire. The evaluation engine calculates mean trait scores and delta scores against neutral baselines, enabling both measurement and controlled induction of personality traits.

## Key Results
- SAC achieves consistent 1-5 intensity control across four LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Mistral) with minimal standard deviation
- Induced traits systematically influence related traits in psychologically coherent directions, demonstrating LLMs internalize multi-dimensional personality structures
- Compared to binary P2 prompting, SAC shows superior controllability with monotonic delta progression (1→3→5) across all tested traits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adjective-Based Semantic Anchoring for Intensity Calibration
Providing curated adjective sets for each intensity level gives the model concrete semantic reference points, enabling more reliable continuous modulation than abstract numeric values alone. This grounds "intensity" in the model's rich semantic knowledge of adjectives, guiding it toward specific behavioral personas. The mechanism assumes strong, distinct semantic associations for chosen adjectives correlate with intended traits.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Dimensional Behavioral Probing for Robust Measurement
Defining trait intensity as a composite score across five behavioral dimensions yields more stable measurement than single-axis queries. Instead of one "how {trait} are you?" question, the framework uses multi-faceted probes like "How often do you [trait behavior]?" (Frequency) and "How much effort do you put into [trait behavior]?" (Effort). This reduces noise and provides holistic trait profiles.

### Mechanism 3: Structured Prompting for Inter-Trait Activation
A structured prompt defining a target trait and intensity can induce that trait and cause related traits to shift in psychologically coherent directions. The prompt template activates a latent, interconnected "personality structure" within the model's representations, similar to human psychometric correlations. This suggests LLMs have internalized coherent, multi-dimensional personality structures from training data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **The 16 Personality Factor (16PF) Model**
  - Why needed here: The dominant Big Five (OCEAN) model is too coarse; 16PF provides fine-grained trait vocabulary that makes intensity control meaningful.
  - Quick check question: Why is the 16PF model considered more suitable for fine-grained personality control in LLMs compared to the Big Five?

- Concept: **Trait Induction via Prompting**
  - Why needed here: The core technical problem is controlling an LLM's persona; this concept is the method—using descriptive prompts to condition specific behavioral stances without retraining.
  - Quick check question: How does a carefully designed text prompt cause an LLM to temporarily adopt a specific personality trait?

- Concept: **Semantic Anchoring**
  - Why needed here: This is the paper's key innovation for solving the "binary toggle" problem; it maps abstract intensity levels to concrete words the model can understand and emulate.
  - Quick check question: What problem does adjective-based semantic anchoring solve when trying to induce a trait at a specific intensity level (e.g., 3 out of 5) in an LLM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PERS-16 Benchmark (163-item questionnaire) -> SAC Prompt Template (structured with trait/definition/intensity placeholders) -> Intensity Adjective Maps (manual 1-5 lists per trait) -> Behavioral Intensity Dimensions (5 axes) -> Evaluation Engine (scoring logic)

- Critical path: 1) Run PERS-16 on neutral model for baseline profile. 2) Select target trait and intensity. 3) Populate SAC prompt template with trait definition, adjectives, and behavioral question. 4) Prompt model and record 1-5 response. 5) Aggregate responses to compute final induced trait score and analyze co-trait movement.

- Design tradeoffs: Manual adjective lists ensure semantic quality but limit scalability to new domains without expert input. Evaluation based on self-report questionnaires may not fully capture behavioral tendencies in open-ended dialogue.

- Failure signatures:
  - Semantic Drift: Responses don't align with provided adjectives, causing inconsistent intensity scores
  - Binary or Flat Response: Model ignores intensity scale, outputting only maximum/minimum values or clustering around neutral baseline (~3.0)
  - Incoherent Co-Movement: Inducing a trait causes related traits to shift in unexpected or psychologically invalid directions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline Profiling: Run PERS-16 evaluation on neutral model to establish baseline scores for all 16 traits
  2. Adjective Ablation Test: Test key traits (e.g., Warmth, Intellect) with and without adjective-based semantic anchoring, comparing consistency and controllability
  3. Co-Trait Validation: Induce high intensity (level 5) for single target trait (e.g., Warmth) and measure other traits, verifying top "co-movers" shift in expected directions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does SAC perform when simultaneously inducing multiple traits, particularly those with opposing or complex psychological correlations? The current study isolates individual traits but doesn't test the system's ability to maintain conflicting trait combinations.

### Open Question 2
To what extent do intensity-controlled personality profiles transfer to open-ended generative tasks beyond psychometric evaluation format? The evaluation relies on Likert-scale responses, which may not capture deeper behavioral tendencies in actual conversations.

### Open Question 3
Can SAC's adjective-based semantic anchoring methodology be generalized to other hierarchical personality models, such as HEXACO or the Big Five? The framework is specifically tailored to 16PF and untested on other models.

### Open Question 4
How can trait intensities be modulated dynamically in real-time to adapt to user interactions or changing context during dialogue? The current framework establishes static "intensity scales" but lacks mechanisms for fluid adjustment based on conversational feedback.

## Limitations

- Semantic Anchoring Dependence: Framework's effectiveness relies heavily on manually curated adjective sets that may not generalize across cultures or languages, with no cross-cultural validity testing
- Self-Report Validity: All measurements depend on model's responses to questionnaires rather than behavioral observation, raising questions about ecological validity
- Generalization Beyond 16PF: Unclear how well intensity control mechanisms would translate to other personality frameworks or custom trait definitions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core finding that adjective-based semantic anchoring improves intensity control consistency compared to binary approaches. Behavioral dimensions framework for measurement appears robust across tested models.

**Medium Confidence**: Claim about psychologically coherent inter-trait relationships. While patterns are observed, causation isn't established and prompting artifacts might create artificial correlations.

**Low Confidence**: Assertion that LLMs "internalize multi-dimensional personality structures" similar to humans. This interprets observed patterns rather than proving through rigorous psychological validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Behavioral Validation Study**: Conduct controlled experiment where induced traits are tested in open-ended dialogue tasks (not just questionnaires) to verify questionnaire responses predict actual behavioral tendencies.

2. **Cross-Cultural Adjective Validation**: Test adjective-based semantic anchoring with culturally diverse adjective sets to assess whether intensity control works across different cultural contexts or reflects Western-centric interpretations.

3. **Open-Source Model Replication**: Apply SAC framework to open-source models (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) to determine whether personality structure effects are specific to commercial models or represent a general LLM phenomenon.
