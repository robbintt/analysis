# AgenticIE: An Adaptive Agent for Information Extraction from Complex Regulatory Documents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.11773
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11773
- Authors: Gaye Colakoglu; Gürkan Solmaz; Jonathan Fürst
- Reference count: 40
- AgenticIE achieves Exact Match scores of 0.396, outperforming GPT-4o (0.342) and GPT-4o-V (0.314) on Declaration of Performance document extraction tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AgenticIE, an adaptive agent system for extracting key information from complex Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents mandated by EU regulations. DoPs contain critical construction product specifications but vary significantly in layout, structure, and language. The authors address this challenge by developing a domain-specific agentic system based on a planner-executor-corresponder pattern that dynamically adapts to user intent and document modality. They also introduce a new high-density dataset of 80 multilingual (English/German) DoP documents with over 15,000 expert-annotations across 174 pages, averaging 190+ annotations per document. Experiments show that AgenticIE outperforms static and multimodal LLM baselines, achieving Exact Match (EM) scores of 0.396 compared to 0.342 for GPT-4o and 0.314 for GPT-4o-V, demonstrating improvements of 16% and 26% respectively across both Key Information Extraction and Question Answering tasks.

## Method Summary
AgenticIE implements a three-component agentic architecture consisting of a planner, executor, and corresponder that work together to extract information from Declaration of Performance documents. The system uses a domain-specific prompting strategy combined with a new adaptive agent framework designed to handle the variability and complexity of regulatory documents. The authors created a novel dataset containing 80 multilingual DoP documents with over 15,000 expert annotations, providing a high-density evaluation benchmark for information extraction tasks. The agentic system dynamically adapts to user intent and document modality, allowing it to handle the diverse layouts and structures found in real-world regulatory documents. Performance was evaluated against standard multimodal and text-only LLM baselines using Exact Match metrics across both Key Information Extraction and Question Answering tasks.

## Key Results
- AgenticIE achieves Exact Match score of 0.396, outperforming GPT-4o (0.342) by 16% and GPT-4o-V (0.314) by 26%
- The system demonstrates superior performance on both Key Information Extraction and Question Answering tasks
- New high-density dataset introduced with 80 multilingual DoP documents containing over 15,000 expert annotations across 174 pages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The agentic architecture enables dynamic adaptation to document variability through specialized components that handle different aspects of the extraction task. The planner component interprets user intent and determines optimal extraction strategies based on document characteristics. The executor carries out the extraction operations using appropriate tools and techniques for the specific document structure. The corresponder ensures consistency and coherence across extracted information by validating relationships between different extracted elements. This modular approach allows the system to handle the diverse layouts, structures, and languages found in real-world regulatory documents more effectively than monolithic LLM approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents**: Standardized EU regulatory documents containing construction product specifications that vary significantly in layout and structure. *Why needed*: Understanding the target document domain is essential for designing appropriate extraction strategies and evaluation metrics.

**Agentic system architecture**: A three-component pattern consisting of planner, executor, and corresponder that work together to accomplish complex tasks. *Why needed*: This modular approach enables specialized handling of different aspects of information extraction while maintaining system coherence.

**Multimodal vs text-only processing**: Different approaches to handling documents that contain both visual layout information and textual content. *Why needed*: Regulatory documents often combine structured visual elements with free-form text, requiring appropriate processing strategies.

**Exact Match evaluation metric**: A performance measurement that assesses whether extracted information exactly matches ground truth annotations. *Why needed*: Provides a strict evaluation of extraction accuracy for regulatory compliance applications where precision is critical.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Planner -> Executor -> Corresponder (with feedback loops between components)

**Critical path**: User query -> Planner interprets intent -> Executor selects extraction strategy -> Corresponder validates and refines output -> Final extracted information

**Design tradeoffs**: The three-component agentic approach adds implementation complexity compared to single-model baselines but provides better adaptability to document variability. The modular design enables specialized optimization but requires careful coordination between components.

**Failure signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when document layouts fall outside the training distribution, when user queries are ambiguous, or when the correspondence validation fails to identify inconsistencies. The system may struggle with documents containing novel structural elements not encountered during training.

**First experiments**:
1. Run the same query on both text-only and multimodal versions of the same document to observe how different modalities affect extraction quality
2. Test the system with progressively more complex user queries to evaluate planner adaptability
3. Compare performance on documents with varying layout complexity to identify structural thresholds for optimal performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Real-world applicability beyond DoP domain remains uncertain and would require further adaptation for other regulatory document types
- Performance improvements over baselines, while statistically significant, show only modest absolute gains (Exact Match scores still indicate substantial room for improvement)
- Dataset construction from German and Austrian sources may introduce geographic bias and limited language diversity (only English/German)

## Confidence
- Comparative performance claims within DoP domain: High
- Claims about broader applicability to other regulatory documents: Medium
- Claims about multilingual generalization capabilities: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test AgenticIE on regulatory documents outside the DoP domain (e.g., product safety data sheets, technical specifications) to assess true domain adaptability and identify required adaptation steps.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each agentic component (planner, executor, corresponder) to overall performance, determining whether all three components are necessary or if simplified versions could achieve similar results.
3. Evaluate model performance across different EU languages not included in the training dataset to assess multilingual generalization capabilities and identify potential language-specific limitations.
