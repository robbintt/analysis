# ReMeREC: Relation-aware and Multi-entity Referring Expression Comprehension

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.16877
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16877
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: State-of-the-art performance in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, with 58.32% grounding accuracy on ReMeX dataset

## Executive Summary
ReMeREC introduces a novel framework for relation-aware and multi-entity referring expression comprehension, addressing the limitations of existing single-entity localization methods. The framework jointly localizes multiple entities and models their complex inter-entity relationships through a Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP) and an Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR). To support this task, the authors construct the ReMeX dataset with detailed image-text-relation annotations and generate a small-scale auxiliary EntityText dataset to improve language comprehension. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction.

## Method Summary
The ReMeREC framework addresses multi-entity referring expression comprehension by introducing two key components: a Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP) that dynamically identifies the number and boundaries of entities from fine-grained textual cues, and an Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) that enhances relational reasoning and global scene understanding. The method leverages the newly constructed ReMeX dataset with detailed image-text-relation annotations, along with a small-scale auxiliary EntityText dataset for improved language comprehension. The framework processes referring expressions to jointly localize multiple entities and predict their relationships, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-entity grounding tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 58.32% grounding accuracy on the ReMeX dataset
- State-of-the-art performance in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction across four benchmark datasets
- Successfully models complex inter-entity relationships through the Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by integrating textual understanding with visual reasoning through two specialized modules. The TMP dynamically parses referring expressions to identify entity boundaries and count, adapting to the specific linguistic cues in each expression. The EIR then uses this information to reason about relationships between entities, leveraging both visual features and the structured output from TMP. This dual approach allows the system to handle complex expressions that reference multiple entities and their spatial or semantic relationships, going beyond simple single-object localization.

## Foundational Learning

**Visual Grounding**: Locating objects in images based on language descriptions - needed to map textual references to specific regions in images; quick check: can the system accurately draw bounding boxes around referenced objects?

**Multi-entity Reasoning**: Simultaneously processing multiple objects and their relationships - needed for handling expressions that reference more than one entity; quick check: can the system handle expressions like "the woman to the left of the man holding a book"?

**Cross-modal Attention**: Focusing on relevant parts of both text and image - needed to align linguistic cues with visual features; quick check: does the attention mechanism correctly weight important words and image regions?

**Dynamic Entity Detection**: Identifying variable numbers of entities from text - needed because referring expressions can mention different numbers of objects; quick check: can the system handle both single and multiple entity references?

**Relational Reasoning**: Understanding spatial and semantic relationships between objects - needed for expressions that describe relative positions or interactions; quick check: can the system correctly interpret "between," "behind," or "wearing"?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Referring Expression -> TMP -> Entity Features -> EIR -> Relationship Prediction -> Bounding Boxes

**Critical Path**: Text input is first processed by TMP to identify entity boundaries, then passed to EIR which combines this with visual features to predict relationships and final bounding boxes.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for accuracy by using two specialized modules (TMP and EIR) rather than a simpler single-stage approach. This allows for more nuanced understanding of complex expressions but increases model size and inference time.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may struggle with highly ambiguous expressions, complex scenes with many similar objects, or when the referring expression contains contradictory or unclear relational information.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test single-entity grounding performance on standard benchmarks to establish baseline capability
2. Evaluate multi-entity grounding with simple relational expressions to verify joint localization
3. Assess relationship prediction accuracy independently of grounding to measure relational reasoning capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Primary evaluation on newly constructed ReMeX dataset with limited testing on established benchmarks, raising questions about generalizability
- Computational efficiency and inference speed of the TMP module are not discussed, particularly for images with many entities
- Claims about superior relation-aware comprehension lack comprehensive comparative analysis on established multi-entity referring expression datasets

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The framework design and its core components (TMP, EIR) are clearly described and logically structured.

**Medium confidence**: The reported performance on ReMeX is promising, but the lack of broader benchmark evaluation reduces confidence in generalizability.

**Low confidence**: Claims about superior relation-aware comprehension are not fully supported by comparative analysis on established datasets.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ReMeREC on additional established multi-entity referring expression datasets (e.g., RefCOCO+ or similar) to verify cross-dataset robustness.
2. Conduct detailed ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of TMP and EIR modules to overall performance.
3. Analyze the computational complexity and inference time of the TMP module, especially for images with many entities or complex relations.
