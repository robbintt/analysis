# Mirror Mode in Fire Emblem: Beating Players at their own Game with Imitation and Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11902
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11902
- Reference count: 31
- Novel game mode using IL/RL to mirror player strategies

## Executive Summary
This study introduces Mirror Mode, a novel game mode where enemy AI mimics a player's personal strategy using Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. The research developed a simplified Fire Emblem Heroes game in Unity with Standard and Mirror Modes, training models combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), Behavioral Cloning (BC), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on player demonstrations. A user study with 12 participants showed that Mirror Mode agents effectively imitated defensive behavior and movement patterns but struggled with offensive strategies, with participants reporting higher satisfaction due to less predictable enemy behavior and recognition of their own tactics.

## Method Summary
The study developed a simplified Fire Emblem Heroes game environment in Unity, implementing both Standard and Mirror Modes. Researchers trained models using a combination of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), Behavioral Cloning (BC), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on player demonstration data. The training pipeline involved collecting gameplay demonstrations from players, processing this data through IL techniques to capture strategy patterns, and then refining the models with RL to improve adaptive performance. The user study compared player experiences between the two modes, focusing on satisfaction metrics and strategy recognition.

## Key Results
- Mirror Mode agents successfully imitated defensive behavior and movement patterns
- Models struggled to replicate offensive strategies effectively
- Participants reported higher satisfaction with Mirror Mode due to less predictable enemy behavior and recognition of personal tactics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Mirror Mode works by combining imitation learning to capture player behavioral patterns and reinforcement learning to adapt these strategies dynamically during gameplay. The GAIL component helps distinguish between player-like and non-player-like behaviors, while BC provides direct strategy replication from demonstrations. The PPO component then refines these learned strategies through self-play and environmental interaction, allowing the AI to adapt to different game scenarios while maintaining the core strategic elements learned from the player.

## Foundational Learning
- **Imitation Learning**: Why needed - to capture player strategies from demonstrations; Quick check - verify model can reproduce basic movement patterns
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Why needed - to adapt learned strategies dynamically; Quick check - test if agent improves performance over multiple episodes
- **Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning**: Why needed - to distinguish player-like behaviors from random actions; Quick check - measure success rate of behavior discrimination
- **Behavioral Cloning**: Why needed - for direct strategy replication from demonstrations; Quick check - compare cloned strategy to original player demonstrations
- **Proximal Policy Optimization**: Why needed - to refine strategies while maintaining stability; Quick check - monitor policy update magnitudes during training

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Player Demonstrations -> BC/GAIL -> Strategy Model -> PPO Refinement -> Mirror Mode Agent
- **Critical Path**: Demonstration Collection → IL Training (BC+GAIL) → RL Fine-tuning (PPO) → Deployment in Mirror Mode
- **Design Tradeoffs**: BC provides accurate replication but limited adaptability vs. GAIL provides better behavioral distinction but requires more training data
- **Failure Signatures**: Inability to replicate offensive strategies suggests insufficient demonstration data or model capacity limitations
- **3 First Experiments**: 1) Test BC-only model on simple defensive scenarios 2) Evaluate GAIL discrimination on mixed behavior datasets 3) Compare PPO refinement speed with different learning rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (12 participants) limits statistical power and generalizability
- Simplified Fire Emblem Heroes environment may not capture full game complexity
- Difficulty replicating offensive strategies suggests model architecture or training data limitations

## Confidence
- High confidence: IL effectiveness in capturing defensive and movement patterns
- Medium confidence: RL contribution to adaptive performance needs more extensive testing
- Medium confidence: Satisfaction improvements lack statistical significance despite positive feedback

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale user study (n≥50) with diverse player skill levels to validate satisfaction metrics and examine learning curve effects
2. Test IL/RL models on more complex game environments to assess scalability and robustness of strategy replication
3. Implement ablation studies comparing pure IL, pure RL, and hybrid approaches to isolate specific contributions to player strategy replication
