# UAMDP: Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process for Risk-Constrained Reinforcement Learning from Probabilistic Forecasts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08226
- Authors: Michal Koren; Or Peretz; Tai Dinh; Philip S. Yu
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Integration of Bayesian forecasting, posterior sampling, and CVaR risk constraints yields up to 25% lower RMSE, 32% lower sMAPE, and improved trading Sharpe ratio (1.54 → 1.74) in sequential decision-making under uncertainty.

## Executive Summary
UAMDP addresses the challenge of sequential decision-making under uncertainty in high-stakes domains by combining probabilistic forecasting, posterior-sampling reinforcement learning, and risk-sensitive planning via CVaR constraints. The framework maintains a posterior belief over latent dynamics, updates beliefs using probabilistic forecasts, and optimizes policies through Thompson sampling and risk-aware rollouts. Theoretical analysis establishes regret bounds converging to the Bayes-optimal benchmark. Empirical results on S&P 500 equity trading and H&M retail demand forecasting demonstrate significant performance improvements, validating the approach for safer and more profitable decision-making.

## Method Summary
UAMDP integrates Bayesian forecasting (Gaussian Processes for moderate dimensions, Temporal Fusion Transformers with Monte Carlo dropout for high dimensions) to generate probabilistic forecasts. These forecasts update a posterior belief over latent dynamics, which is then used for posterior sampling (Thompson sampling) to explore the state-action space. Risk-sensitive planning is achieved through Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraints on rollouts, ensuring decisions remain robust to tail risk. The framework is theoretically grounded with regret bounds converging to the Bayes-optimal benchmark and validated empirically on financial trading and retail demand forecasting tasks.

## Key Results
- RMSE decreases by up to 25% and sMAPE by 32% compared to baseline methods.
- Trading Sharpe ratio improves from 1.54 to 1.74, with maximum drawdown roughly halved.
- Theoretical regret bounds converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under well-calibrated posterior distributions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
UAMDP works by maintaining a posterior belief over latent dynamics and updating it using probabilistic forecasts from Bayesian models. Posterior sampling (Thompson sampling) explores the state-action space while respecting the uncertainty in the dynamics model. Risk-sensitive planning via CVaR constraints ensures decisions are robust to tail risk, avoiding catastrophic outcomes. The integration of calibrated probabilistic forecasting with uncertainty-driven exploration and risk-aware control enables safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian forecasting**: Generates probabilistic predictions that capture uncertainty; needed for updating beliefs over latent dynamics. Quick check: verify predictive distributions are well-calibrated using calibration metrics (e.g., reliability diagrams).
- **Posterior sampling (Thompson sampling)**: Explores the state-action space by sampling from the posterior belief; needed for uncertainty-driven exploration. Quick check: ensure posterior samples reflect the true uncertainty in the dynamics model.
- **CVaR constraints**: Limits risk exposure by constraining the Conditional Value-at-Risk on rollouts; needed for robust decision-making under uncertainty. Quick check: verify CVaR constraints are not overly conservative, which could limit performance.
- **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**: Used for probabilistic forecasting in moderate-dimensional settings; needed for interpretable uncertainty quantification. Quick check: ensure GP hyperparameters are well-tuned to avoid overconfident predictions.
- **Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) with Monte Carlo dropout**: Used for high-dimensional probabilistic forecasting; needed for scalable uncertainty quantification. Quick check: verify dropout-based uncertainty estimates are reliable through calibration tests.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Probabilistic forecasts (GP/TFT) -> Posterior belief update -> Thompson sampling -> CVaR-constrained rollouts -> Policy optimization.
- **Critical path**: Forecast generation → Belief update → Posterior sampling → Risk-aware planning → Policy execution.
- **Design tradeoffs**: GPs offer interpretable uncertainty but scale poorly with dimensionality; TFTs scale better but require careful calibration of dropout-based uncertainty. CVaR constraints ensure robustness but may limit performance if overly conservative.
- **Failure signatures**: Overconfident forecasts lead to suboptimal risk-constrained policies; poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates degrade exploration efficiency; overly conservative CVaR constraints limit performance.
- **First experiments**: 1) Test forecast calibration using reliability diagrams for GP and TFT models. 2) Validate posterior sampling explores the state-action space effectively by measuring coverage. 3) Benchmark CVaR-constrained rollouts against mean-variance risk measures on a synthetic task.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on accurate probabilistic forecasts; model misspecification or overconfident predictions can degrade policy performance.
- Theoretical regret bounds assume well-calibrated posteriors and known model classes, which may not hold in practice.
- Evaluation limited to two domains (financial trading, retail demand), limiting generalizability to other sequential decision-making settings.

## Confidence
- **High**: Theoretical regret bound derivation; basic framework integration of Bayesian updating with CVaR-constrained RL.
- **Medium**: Empirical improvements in RMSE/sMAPE and trading metrics; effectiveness of GP vs. TFT for different dimensionalities.
- **Medium**: Practical feasibility of the end-to-end pipeline for real-world deployment.

## Next Checks
1. Test robustness to forecast uncertainty misspecification by injecting synthetic overconfident or underconfident predictive distributions and measuring policy degradation.
2. Scale up to higher-dimensional domains (e.g., autonomous driving or multi-product inventory) and benchmark wall-clock runtime and sample efficiency against non-uncertainty-aware baselines.
3. Perform ablation studies on the Thompson sampling vs. alternative posterior sampling strategies (e.g., bootstrap ensembles) and CVaR vs. other risk measures (e.g., mean-variance) to quantify sensitivity to algorithmic choices.
