# DeepJIVE: Learning Joint and Individual Variation Explained from Multimodal Data Using Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.19682
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19682
- Reference count: 0
- DeepJIVE successfully disentangles joint and individual variation in multimodal data using parallel autoencoders, achieving classification accuracy >0.8 on ADNI Alzheimer's data.

## Executive Summary
DeepJIVE is a deep-learning extension of Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE) that directly handles high-dimensional multimodal data like images without requiring dimensionality reduction. The method uses parallel autoencoders to disentangle joint variation (shared across modalities) from individual variation (modality-specific), with three strategies to enforce identity constraints among joint latent variables and orthogonality between joint and individual components. Evaluated on synthetic data and real-world ADNI MRI-PET pairs, DeepJIVE successfully recovered joint and individual structures and outperformed separate autoencoders in classifying cognitively normal vs. Alzheimer's subjects.

## Method Summary
DeepJIVE uses parallel autoencoders where each modality receives paired encoders—one capturing shared joint variation and one capturing individual variation. The joint decoders reconstruct the shared signal while individual decoders handle modality-specific features. Three identity constraint strategies (explicit, exchange, merged) ensure joint latent vectors are identical across modalities, while a regression network enforces orthogonality between joint and individual latent spaces. Rank selection follows AJIVE methodology using singular value thresholding on concatenated autoencoder scores.

## Key Results
- Successfully recovered joint and individual structures in 1D synthetic, 2D MNIST, and 3D ADNI MRI-PET data
- Achieved classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores above 0.8 for cognitively normal vs. Alzheimer's subjects
- Identified biologically plausible covariation patterns between brain atrophy and amyloid accumulation
- Outperformed separate autoencoder baselines on downstream classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Parallel autoencoders can disentangle joint and individual variation without pre-dimensional reduction
- Mechanism: Paired autoencoders create competitive pressure—joint encoder/decoder must capture shared signal while individual encoder/decoder handles modality-specific variation
- Core assumption: Shared latent space can represent joint variation; individual variation is orthogonal to joint
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "uses parallel autoencoders to disentangle joint and individual variation"; Section 2.3.1 describes paired architecture; HeteroJIVE uses similar decomposition but with linear methods
- Break condition: No shared signal leads to spurious joint structure or collapse

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Identity constraints between joint latent vectors enforced through three loss strategies
- Mechanism: (1) Explicit: MSE between joint latents; (2) Exchange: cross-reconstruction using other modality's joint latent; (3) Merged: single concatenated joint vector
- Core assumption: At least one strategy produces meaningful joint representations
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions three strategies; Section 2.3.2 defines all three with equations; all showed "adequate ability to learn JIVE"
- Break condition: Exchange/explicit networks fail with small batches; merged requires all modalities at inference

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Orthogonality via regression network predicting individual from joint latents
- Mechanism: Regression network learns dependencies; residual becomes orthogonalized individual representation; residual magnitude penalized in loss
- Core assumption: Regression network can capture cross-dependencies during training
- Evidence anchors: Section 2.3.3 defines orthogonality loss; Figure 5 shows reduced correlation; no corpus validation of this technique
- Break condition: Learning rate imbalance destabilizes training or causes orthogonalization lag

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **JIVE (Joint and Individual Variation Explained)**
  - Why needed here: DeepJIVE is neural extension of classical JIVE; understanding X = J + S + ε decomposition is essential
  - Quick check question: Given two modalities with shared factor and modality-specific noise, can you sketch JIVE decomposition?

- Concept: **Autoencoders and their relationship to PCA**
  - Why needed here: Linear autoencoders equivalent to PCA; nonlinear extensions capture nonlinear subspaces
  - Quick check question: What happens to latent variable orthogonality when adding nonlinear activations?

- Concept: **Orthogonality constraints in representation learning**
  - Why needed here: DeepJIVE requires joint/individual spaces be orthogonal; uses regression-based enforcement
  - Quick check question: Why might standard autoencoders fail to produce orthogonal latents, and what interventions help?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Joint encoder (per modality) -> Joint latent space Λ_J
  - Individual encoder (per modality) -> Individual latent space Λ_S
  - Joint decoder (per modality) -> Reconstructs joint contribution from Λ_J
  - Individual decoder (per modality) -> Reconstructs individual contribution from Λ_S
  - Regression network (per modality) -> Predicts Λ_S from Λ_J for orthogonalization
  - Loss aggregator -> Combines reconstruction + identity + orthogonality losses

- Critical path:
  1. Choose identity constraint strategy based on batch size and inference requirements
  2. Determine ranks r_J and r_S via separate autoencoder pre-training + AJIVE singular value thresholding
  3. Initialize regression network with higher learning rate than main network
  4. Train with orthogonality weight γ initially kept low

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Explicit networks: Simple loss, requires large batches for stable latent comparison
  - Exchange networks: No explicit latent loss, doubles decoder computations per step
  - Merged networks: Guaranteed identity, requires all modalities at inference
  - Regression network complexity: Shallow may underfit; deep adds instability

- Failure signatures:
  - Both reconstructions blurry: identity constraint too weak or orthogonality penalty too strong
  - Joint latents identical but meaningless: learning rate imbalance between main and regression networks
  - Worse than separate autoencoders: rank selection incorrect (r_J too high/low)
  - Training divergence after initial epochs: γ increased too quickly or regression learning rate too high

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate 1D synthetic experiment (Equation 19) with all three network types; verify joint/individual structures match Figure 6
  2. Build MNIST paired dataset; implement merged network with 1-2 conv layers; add regression network; train SVM on latents; target classification improvement
  3. Preprocess ADNI data (SPM12 registration, gray matter TPM, PET normalization, FSL brain mask, 3mm³ resampling); train 3D conv explicit network; evaluate SVM vs separate autoencoder baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Missing critical implementation details including exact hyperparameters, network architectures, and training procedures
- Orthogonality mechanism relies on regression network learning rate balance not quantified in paper
- ADNI results depend on complex preprocessing pipelines (SPM12, FSL) mentioned but not fully specified
- Three identity constraint strategies presented without rigorous comparative analysis

## Confidence
- **High**: DeepJIVE successfully recovers joint/individual structures in controlled synthetic settings (1D and 2D MNIST)
- **Medium**: DeepJIVE improves classification performance over separate autoencoders on real ADNI data, though architectural details needed for exact replication are missing
- **Low**: Three identity constraint strategies presented without rigorous comparative analysis of relative performance or failure modes

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce 1D synthetic experiment with all three network types to verify ground truth structure recovery before scaling to complex data
2. Conduct systematic ablation study on orthogonality—train with and without regression network on paired MNIST data, quantifying classification performance gap to justify complexity
3. Perform rank sensitivity analysis by varying r_J ± 2 from AJIVE-estimated values on held-out validation data, measuring reconstruction error and classification metrics to establish robustness boundaries
