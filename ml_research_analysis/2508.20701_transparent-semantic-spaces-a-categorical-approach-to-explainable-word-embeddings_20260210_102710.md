# Transparent Semantic Spaces: A Categorical Approach to Explainable Word Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.20701
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20701
- **Reference count:** 2
- **Primary result:** A novel framework using category theory to make word embeddings explainable, proving equivalence between neural methods and metric MDS.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a mathematically rigorous framework based on category theory to enhance the explainability of word embeddings. The authors construct a monoidal category $\mathcal{P}_T$ from text corpora that serves as a transparent semantic space, allowing biases to be detected before embedding and demonstrating that popular neural embedding methods (GloVe, Word2Vec) are mathematically equivalent to metric MDS. By reframing embeddings as transparent analytical problems rather than black boxes, the framework provides new tools for understanding and mitigating biases in AI systems.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a categorical framework for semantic spaces by first building a syntax category $\mathcal{C}_T$ from text corpora, then extending it to $\mathcal{L}_T$ via Yoneda embedding to capture contextual similarities. The monoidal category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is formed as a semantic space where endomorphisms represent word relationships. Bias is quantified as asymmetry in similarity quotients $S_{ik}/S_{ij}$ before embedding. The framework proves that minimizing loss functions in GloVe and Word2Vec is equivalent to minimizing the stress function in metric MDS for a specific dissimilarity matrix derived from co-occurrence probabilities.

## Key Results
- Construction of transparent semantic spaces as endomorphisms in monoidal category $\mathcal{P}_T$
- Mathematical proof of equivalence between GloVe/Word2Vec and metric MDS algorithms
- Definition of bias as pre-embedding asymmetries in similarity quotients
- Demonstration that modifying semantic spaces before embedding can mitigate biases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Semantic spaces are defined as endomorphisms (matrices) on a text's dictionary within a monoidal category $\mathcal{P}_T$, allowing semantic relationships to be captured independently of vector dimensionality.
- **Mechanism:** The text is transformed into a syntax category $\mathcal{C}_T$ (expressions and extension probabilities). Using the Yoneda embedding, this is generalized to $\mathcal{L}_T$ to allow comparisons between expressions of the same length. Finally, $\mathcal{P}_T$ aggregates these into probabilistic matrices where endomorphisms encode similarity.
- **Core assumption:** The "meaning" of a word can be sufficiently represented by the conditional probabilities of its surrounding contexts (distributional hypothesis), mapped via enriched category theory.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract] "The monoidal category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of extracting semantic information... offering a dimension-agnostic definition of semantic spaces."
  - [Section 3] Definition 3.9 explicitly defines a semantic space as an endomorphism of $L^1_T$ in $\mathcal{P}_T$.
  - [Corpus] Weak direct support; neighbor papers focus on categorical clipping and logic functors rather than this specific monoidal definition.
- **Break condition:** If the text corpus is too sparse to generate meaningful conditional probabilities for the infimum calculation in $\mathcal{L}_T$, the resulting endomorphism in $\mathcal{P}_T$ will be sparse or diagonal, failing to capture semantic relationships.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The paper proves that training GloVe and Word2Vec models is mathematically equivalent to performing Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) on a specific derived distance matrix.
- **Mechanism:** The framework defines a category of word embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$ where objects are maps from semantic spaces to configurations (metric spaces). A "divergence" (loss function) is applied as a decoration. The paper demonstrates that minimizing the loss functions of GloVe and Word2Vec is equivalent to minimizing the "stress" function of MDS for a dissimilarity matrix $d_{ij} = \sqrt{\log(S_{ii}S_{jj} / S_{ij}S_{ji})}$.
- **Core assumption:** The optimization landscapes of the neural algorithms (iterative gradient descent) converge to the same global minima as the analytical stress minimization of MDS.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract] "...demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm..."
  - [Section 4 / Theorem 4.12] "The GloVe and Word2Vec neural network embeddings are equivalent to metric MDS embeddings on vector spaces."
  - [Corpus] Not explicitly validated by corpus neighbors; equivalence is a unique derivation in this text.
- **Break condition:** If the embedding dimension is significantly lower than the intrinsic dimensionality of the semantic space, the "stress" cannot be sufficiently minimized, and the equivalence degrades due to information loss in the projection.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Bias in word embeddings can be detected and quantified in the semantic space (pre-embedding) as asymmetries in similarity quotients, rather than solely as geometric skew in the vector space.
- **Mechanism:** Bias is defined as a ratio $b_i(k,j) = S_{ik}/S_{ij}$. If $b \neq 1$, the target word $w_i$ correlates more strongly with one attribute than another. The framework suggests mitigating this by equalizing cross-probabilities in the matrix $P$ before the embedding step.
- **Core assumption:** Bias is a statistical property of the corpus (captured in $\mathcal{P}_T$) that is inherited by the embedding, rather than an artifact of the embedding algorithm itself.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract] "...mathematical approach to computing biases in word embeddings by analyzing semantic spaces before embedding."
  - [Section 4 / Definition 4.15] Defines bias as the quotient $S_{ik}/S_{ij}$.
  - [Corpus] "Logic Explanation of AI Classifiers" supports the use of categorical functors for explainability, but does not confirm this specific bias metric.
- **Break condition:** If bias is introduced *during* the embedding process (e.g., via specific weight initializations or batch ordering) rather than existing in the input statistics, modifying the pre-embedding semantic space will not remove it.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Enriched Category Theory
  - **Why needed here:** The paper defines categories $\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$ where the morphisms are not just arrows but probabilities in $[0,1]$ or matrices. Understanding "enrichment" is required to see how composition works in these semantic spaces.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how the hom-set $\mathcal{C}_T(x,y)$ differs from a standard set-theoretic function in this framework?
- **Concept:** Yoneda Embedding
  - **Why needed here:** It is the theoretical engine allowing the move from $\mathcal{C}_T$ (only extensions) to $\mathcal{L}_T$ (comparing words by their contexts). It replaces objects with their "views" from all other objects.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the Yoneda lemma allow us to compare two words that never appear next to each other in the text?
- **Concept:** Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper frames "black box" neural embeddings as "transparent" MDS problems. Understanding the stress function in MDS is necessary to understand the paper's main equivalence proof.
  - **Quick check question:** What geometric property is the MDS stress function trying to preserve when mapping dissimilarities to a low-dimensional space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Text T -> Syntax category C_T (n-grams) -> L_T (similarities via Yoneda) -> P_T (Endomorphism Matrix) -> Bias Analyzer -> Embedder (MDS)
- **Critical path:** The construction of the endomorphism in $\mathcal{P}_T$. If this matrix is constructed incorrectly (e.g., ignoring tensor product rules), the downstream MDS equivalence fails.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Transparency vs. Efficiency:** The transparent MDS approach avoids hidden neural layers but may scale poorly compared to approximations like negative sampling in Word2Vec for massive dictionaries.
  - **Rigidity vs. Flexibility:** $\mathcal{L}_T$ is "rigid" (probabilities strictly determined by corpus counts), whereas $\mathcal{P}_T$ allows more flexibility but requires careful definition of stochastic matrices.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Semantic Collapse:** Returning identity matrices in $\mathcal{P}_T$ (no similarities found).
  - **Non-convergence:** High stress in MDS indicates the semantic space cannot be flattened into the requested dimensions without massive distortion.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Equivalence Verification:** Implement the derivation $d_{ij} = \sqrt{\log(S_{ii}S_{jj} / S_{ij}S_{ji})}$ on a small corpus and compare the resulting MDS plot against a standard Word2Vec plot.
  2. **Bias Quantification:** Select a known biased pair (e.g., "doctor"/"nurse") and compute the bias quotient $b$ in $\mathcal{P}_T$ before running the embedding.
  3. **Divergence Stress Test:** Modify the weights $W_{ij}$ in the loss function to verify the claim in Remark 4.13 that weights do not alter the theoretical minimum, only convergence speed.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the categorical framework be generalized to the over-category $\mathcal{L}/T$ to better analyze biases inherent in training corpora?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.2 (Future Work) explicitly proposes generalizing the analysis to the over-category where $T$ encompasses all texts.
- **Why unresolved:** The current framework is defined for a specific text $T$; the over-category extension requires new mathematical criteria to handle the broader scope of diverse training data.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A formal definition of the over-category $\mathcal{L}/T$ with a demonstrated ability to identify corpus-level biases that single-text analysis misses.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the concept of divergence in this framework be rigorously linked to game theory via utility functions?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.2 suggests exploring the connection between word embeddings, semantic spaces, and games using divergence as a combination of utility functions.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper establishes divergence as a decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$ but does not map this mathematical concept to the strategic interactions defined in game theory.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical model mapping divergence functions to player utility functions, showing how embedding optimization equates to equilibrium seeking.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the framework be adapted to maintain semantic meaning when analyzing bias in sub-word tokens?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 5.1 states that applying the current framework to sub-word tokens (like OpenAI's) causes bias to lose its semantic meaning, reducing to mere statistical preference.
- **Why unresolved:** The category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is built on semantic spaces of expressions, which break down when expressions are fragmented into non-semantic sub-word units.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified definition of semantic spaces in $\mathcal{P}_T$ that successfully isolates semantic bias from statistical noise in sub-word tokenization schemes.

## Limitations
- The framework requires sufficiently rich text corpora to generate meaningful conditional probabilities; sparse corpora may fail to capture semantic relationships
- Computational complexity of enriched category operations (particularly infimum calculations) is not addressed, raising scalability concerns
- While theoretical equivalence to MDS is proven, the approach lacks empirical validation against established neural embedding methods

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Construction of $\mathcal{P}_T$ from text corpora using standard co-occurrence statistics; formalization of distributional hypothesis via enriched categories
- **Medium Confidence:** Mathematical proof of equivalence between neural embeddings and metric MDS; theoretical soundness of bias detection mechanism
- **Low Confidence:** Practical scalability of transparent approach versus neural methods; effectiveness of pre-embedding semantic space modifications for bias mitigation

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Equivalence Test:** Implement the full pipeline on a standard corpus (e.g., Wikipedia) to verify that MDS embeddings from the proposed dissimilarity matrix produce comparable results to Word2Vec/GloVe in downstream tasks.
2. **Bias Detection Validation:** Test the bias quotient metric $S_{ik}/S_{ij}$ on known biased word pairs (e.g., gender-biased occupation words) and verify it correctly identifies disparities before embedding.
3. **Scalability Assessment:** Benchmark the computational cost of constructing $\mathcal{P}_T$ and running MDS on corpora of increasing size to establish practical limitations compared to standard embedding approaches.
