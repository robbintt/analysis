# Tight Lower Bounds and Improved Convergence in Performative Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.03671
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03671
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces Affine Risk Minimizers (ARM) that aggregate historical data for improved convergence in performative prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper advances the field of performative prediction by extending the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) framework through a novel class of algorithms called Affine Risk Minimizers (ARM). ARM leverages historical datasets from previous retraining iterations to optimize model parameters, enabling convergence to performatively stable points under broader conditions than previous methods. The authors establish new theoretical bounds showing ARM can surpass standard RRM's lower bound, with convergence guaranteed when √ϵM/γ < 2√3 ≈ 1.155, improving upon the previous threshold of 1. Empirical validation on credit-scoring and ride-share benchmarks demonstrates faster convergence to stable points compared to standard approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces Affine Risk Minimizers (ARM), which extend standard RRM by aggregating data from multiple past distributions to optimize model parameters. Instead of using only the current distribution's data, ARM constructs an affine combination of historical datasets, creating a richer optimization problem that can achieve better convergence properties. This approach broadens the class of problems where convergence to performatively stable points is possible, relaxing the strict assumptions required by standard RRM methods. The method maintains theoretical guarantees while demonstrating practical improvements through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation on two benchmark domains.

## Key Results
- ARM converges to performatively stable points for a broader class of problems than standard RRM
- Theoretical analysis establishes convergence when √ϵM/γ < 2√3 ≈ 1.155, improving upon the previous threshold of 1
- First lower bound analysis for RRM within the ARM class quantifies maximum achievable convergence improvements
- Empirical results on credit-scoring and ride-share benchmarks show faster convergence to stable points using aggregated historical snapshots

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ARM works by leveraging historical data snapshots to create a more informative optimization landscape. By aggregating past distributions, the method effectively smooths the objective function and provides better gradient estimates, enabling more stable convergence trajectories. The affine combination of historical risks creates a surrogate objective that approximates the long-term behavior of the system, allowing the algorithm to navigate toward performatively stable points more efficiently than methods that rely solely on current distribution data.

## Foundational Learning

**Performative Prediction** - Why needed: Core framework for problems where model deployment changes the data distribution. Quick check: Understand that model predictions influence future data generation.

**Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM)** - Why needed: Standard approach for iterative retraining in performative settings. Quick check: Recognize RRM's limitation to specific problem classes.

**Performative Stability** - Why needed: Desired equilibrium where model predictions no longer significantly alter the distribution. Quick check: Identify conditions under which models reach stable operating points.

**Convexity and Lipschitz Continuity** - Why needed: Theoretical assumptions enabling convergence guarantees. Quick check: Verify these properties hold in target applications.

**Historical Data Aggregation** - Why needed: Mechanism for leveraging past information to improve current optimization. Quick check: Assess availability and relevance of historical snapshots.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Historical datasets -> ARM aggregator -> Convex optimizer -> Model parameters -> Distribution predictor -> Updated historical datasets

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves collecting historical datasets, applying ARM aggregation to construct the surrogate objective, running the convex optimizer to update model parameters, deploying the model to observe the new distribution, and storing this as the next historical snapshot.

**Design Tradeoffs:** ARM trades increased memory requirements (storing multiple historical datasets) for improved convergence guarantees and broader applicability. The affine aggregation approach introduces computational overhead but enables convergence in previously intractable problem classes.

**Failure Signatures:** Convergence failure occurs when √ϵM/γ ≥ 2√3, indicating insufficient model expressivity or excessive distribution shift. Poor historical data quality or rapidly changing environments may also degrade ARM's performance relative to standard RRM.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare ARM convergence against standard RRM on synthetic performative prediction problems with varying ϵ, M, and γ parameters
2. Evaluate memory and computational overhead of ARM versus RRM on large-scale datasets
3. Test ARM's robustness to outdated historical data in non-stationary environments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies on convexity and Lipschitz continuity assumptions that may not hold in complex real-world applications
- Empirical validation limited to two specific domains (credit-scoring and ride-sharing) without broader generalization testing
- Convergence threshold improvement from 1 to approximately 1.155 represents modest practical gains in most scenarios
- Assumes availability of historical data snapshots, which may not be feasible in rapidly changing environments
- Affine aggregation may introduce computational overhead prohibitive for large-scale problems

## Confidence
- Theoretical convergence bounds: High - Mathematical proofs are rigorous and build upon established frameworks
- Empirical performance claims: Medium - Results demonstrated on two benchmarks but lack broader validation
- Practical applicability: Medium - Theoretical improvements are clear but real-world constraints are not fully addressed

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ARM on non-convex loss functions common in deep learning applications to test theoretical assumptions
2. Benchmark memory and computational overhead of ARM versus standard RRM on large-scale datasets
3. Test ARM's performance in non-stationary environments where historical data distributions may become obsolete
