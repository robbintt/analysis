# A Comparative Benchmark of a Moroccan Darija Toxicity Detection Model (Typica.ai) and Major LLM-Based Moderation APIs (OpenAI, Mistral, Anthropic)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.04640
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04640
- Authors: Hicham Assoudi
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Typica.ai achieved 83.0% accuracy and 0.830 F1-score, outperforming major LLM-based moderation APIs on Moroccan Darija toxicity detection

## Executive Summary
This study presents a comparative benchmark evaluating Typica.ai's custom Moroccan Darija toxicity detection model against major LLM-based moderation APIs (OpenAI, Mistral, Anthropic Claude). The benchmark focuses on culturally grounded toxic content, including implicit insults and sarcasm, which general-purpose systems often miss. Using a balanced test set from the OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix dataset, the evaluation measures precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to assess model performance in detecting harmful content while minimizing false positives.

Typica.ai demonstrated superior performance with 83.0% accuracy and 0.830 F1-score, outperforming all compared LLM APIs. The results underscore the importance of culturally adapted models for reliable content moderation in low-resource, dialect-rich languages like Moroccan Darija. The study highlights how general-purpose moderation systems struggle with dialect-specific nuances, emphasizing the need for specialized approaches in culturally sensitive content moderation.

## Method Summary
The benchmark compared Typica.ai's Moroccan Darija toxicity detection model against OpenAI, Mistral, and Anthropic Claude moderation APIs. A balanced test set was created from the OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix dataset containing culturally specific toxic content including implicit insults and sarcasm. The evaluation measured precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy across all models. Typica.ai's custom model was specifically trained on Moroccan Darija linguistic patterns and cultural contexts, while the LLM APIs were tested using their standard moderation endpoints without customization for Darija.

## Key Results
- Typica.ai achieved the highest accuracy at 83.0% and F1-score of 0.830
- Superior balance between detecting harmful content and minimizing false positives compared to LLM APIs
- Demonstrated effectiveness in detecting culturally specific toxic content including implicit insults and sarcasm
- Outperformed OpenAI, Mistral, and Anthropic Claude moderation APIs on Moroccan Darija test set

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **Moroccan Darija linguistic features**: Critical for understanding dialect-specific toxicity patterns; quick check involves testing model on code-switched content
- **Cultural context adaptation**: Essential for detecting implicit insults and sarcasm; quick check requires expert validation of false positives
- **Dialect-specific training data**: Necessary for capturing regional variations; quick check involves comparing performance across different Darija dialects
- **Implicit toxicity detection**: Important for catching subtle harmful content; quick check requires analyzing model's handling of context-dependent insults
- **Cross-cultural moderation challenges**: Relevant for understanding limitations of general-purpose systems; quick check involves testing on non-Darija content

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Raw text input -> Typica.ai model / OpenAI API / Mistral API / Claude API -> Toxicity score output
- **Critical path**: Input preprocessing -> Feature extraction (dialect-specific tokenization) -> Classification (toxic/non-toxic) -> Confidence scoring
- **Design tradeoffs**: Specialized vs. general-purpose moderation - Typica.ai prioritizes cultural accuracy over broad language coverage
- **Failure signatures**: Over-flagging of non-toxic dialectal expressions, under-detection of culturally-specific sarcasm, false positives on code-switched content
- **3 first experiments**:
  1. Test Typica.ai on English content to verify language-specific behavior
  2. Evaluate robustness by introducing common misspellings and typos
  3. Compare performance on explicit vs. implicit toxicity cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Narrow scope focused exclusively on Moroccan Darija without cross-dialect validation
- Single curated test set (OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix) raises questions about generalizability
- Limited API comparison excluding other major platforms and traditional ML classifiers

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Typica.ai's superior performance metrics (83.0% accuracy, 0.830 F1-score) on the OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix test set compared to tested LLM APIs
- **Medium confidence**: The importance of cultural adaptation for Darija toxicity detection is demonstrated but not exhaustively validated across all toxicity types
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about Typica.ai's balance between detection and false positives are supported by reported metrics but limited to the specific test set

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation using multiple independent Darija datasets, including real-world social media content, to assess performance stability and generalization
2. Expand API comparison to include additional major moderation platforms (e.g., Google Perspective API, Cohere) and traditional ML-based toxicity classifiers
3. Perform adversarial testing with crafted inputs designed to evade detection, including misspellings, code-switching, and subtle cultural references to evaluate robustness
