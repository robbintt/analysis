# mmExpert: Integrating Large Language Models for Comprehensive mmWave Data Synthesis and Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.16521
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16521
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: mmExpert achieves 84.6% F1-score on mmWave classification tasks using synthetic data generated from LLMs

## Executive Summary
mmExpert introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models to generate synthetic millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar data from textual descriptions, eliminating the need for costly real-world data collection. The system employs a multi-stage approach: LLMs generate diverse motion descriptions, a motion synthesizer converts these into 3D human motion sequences, an electromagnetic simulator produces realistic radar signals, and domain randomization enhances generalization. Additionally, mmExpert includes a multi-modal LLM (WaveLLM) trained on synthesized data for mmWave signal interpretation, achieving strong zero-shot performance on real-world data. The method significantly improves classification accuracy and outperforms baseline synthesis approaches.

## Method Summary
mmExpert integrates large language models with electromagnetic simulation to create a comprehensive pipeline for mmWave data synthesis. The framework begins with LLM-generated textual descriptions of human motions, which are then converted into 3D motion sequences using a motion synthesizer. These sequences feed into an electromagnetic simulator that generates realistic mmWave radar signals. Domain randomization techniques are applied to enhance the generalization of the synthetic data. The system also includes WaveLLM, a multi-modal LLM specifically trained on the synthesized data to interpret mmWave signals. This approach addresses the challenge of limited real-world mmWave data availability while maintaining high performance on real-world tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 84.6% F1-score on mmWave classification tasks using synthetic data
- Outperforms baseline synthesis approaches by 19% in classification tasks
- Improves signal generation fidelity by 22% compared to traditional methods
- Demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on real-world data with WaveLLM

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of mmExpert stems from its ability to leverage LLMs' understanding of human motion semantics to generate diverse and realistic motion descriptions. By converting these descriptions into 3D motion sequences and simulating the corresponding mmWave signals, the framework captures the complex relationship between human movement and radar reflections. The domain randomization further enhances the synthetic data's robustness by introducing variations that help the model generalize to real-world scenarios. WaveLLM's training on this synthetic data allows it to develop a comprehensive understanding of mmWave signal patterns, enabling strong performance on real data without requiring extensive real-world training examples.

## Foundational Learning
- **Electromagnetic Simulation**: Simulates how mmWave signals interact with human bodies and environments. Needed to generate physically accurate radar reflections. Quick check: Compare simulated signal patterns with real radar data.
- **Motion Synthesis**: Converts textual descriptions into 3D human motion sequences. Needed to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and physical motion. Quick check: Validate synthesized motions against motion capture data.
- **Domain Randomization**: Introduces controlled variations in synthetic data. Needed to improve generalization to real-world scenarios. Quick check: Measure performance improvement on out-of-distribution test sets.
- **Multi-modal LLM Training**: Trains WaveLLM on synthetic mmWave data. Needed to develop signal interpretation capabilities without real data. Quick check: Evaluate zero-shot transfer performance on real data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM Motion Generator -> Motion Synthesizer -> Electromagnetic Simulator -> Domain Randomization -> WaveLLM

**Critical Path**: Text description generation → 3D motion synthesis → Signal simulation → Model training → Real-world inference

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances computational cost against synthetic data quality, with electromagnetic simulation providing physical accuracy but requiring significant processing power. The use of LLMs enables semantic understanding but introduces potential biases in motion generation.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor motion description diversity leading to limited synthetic data coverage
- Electromagnetic simulation inaccuracies causing unrealistic signal patterns
- Overfitting to synthetic data characteristics preventing real-world transfer
- Computational bottlenecks in the multi-stage pipeline

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Validate synthetic motion diversity by comparing generated motion types against real human activity datasets
2. Test electromagnetic simulation accuracy by comparing synthetic signals with controlled real-world measurements
3. Evaluate WaveLLM's zero-shot performance on a held-out real-world mmWave dataset
