# Representation Unlearning: Forgetting through Information Compression

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.21564
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21564
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Near-perfect forgetting while maintaining utility through representation-space unlearning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Representation Unlearning, a framework that removes the influence of specific training data from machine learning models by operating directly on their representation spaces rather than updating model parameters. The method enforces an information bottleneck that maximizes mutual information with retained data while suppressing information about data to be forgotten. Using variational approximations, the framework works in both settings where retained data is available and in a zero-shot setting where only forget data can be accessed. Experiments demonstrate that Representation Unlearning achieves near-perfect forgetting on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet while maintaining high utility, outperforming parameter-centric baselines with up to 754× speedup over retraining.

## Method Summary
Representation Unlearning works by learning a lightweight transformation in the model's representation space that enforces information-theoretic constraints. Instead of modifying model parameters directly, the method learns a transformation that maximizes mutual information with retained data while minimizing information about data to be forgotten. The framework uses variational approximations to make this objective tractable, employing an upper bound on mutual information through a variational distribution. The method operates in two settings: a standard setting where retained data is available, and a zero-shot setting where only forget data can be accessed. In the zero-shot variant, the method learns to suppress information about the forget data without explicit access to retained data, making it particularly practical for scenarios where retain data cannot be used.

## Key Results
- Achieves near-perfect forgetting on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet while maintaining high utility
- Outperforms parameter-centric baselines with up to 754× speedup over retraining
- Zero-shot variant effectively unlearns without access to retained data, overcoming catastrophic collapse in prior methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by shifting the unlearning operation from the high-dimensional parameter space to the lower-dimensional representation space, where information-theoretic constraints can be more effectively enforced. By learning a transformation that maximizes mutual information with retained data while minimizing information about forget data, the method creates an information bottleneck that selectively forgets while preserving utility. The variational approximation makes the otherwise intractable mutual information optimization tractable by providing an upper bound through a variational distribution. This approach leverages the fact that representations often contain redundant information about training data, allowing selective suppression without catastrophic loss of useful features.

## Foundational Learning

**Information Bottleneck Principle** - A framework for learning compressed representations that retain relevant information while discarding irrelevant details. Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for selectively forgetting information. Quick check: Verify that the learned transformation reduces mutual information with forget data while maintaining it with retain data.

**Variational Inference** - A method for approximating intractable probability distributions through optimization. Why needed: Makes the mutual information objective computationally tractable. Quick check: Confirm that the variational approximation provides a tight upper bound on the true mutual information.

**Mutual Information** - A measure of the statistical dependence between random variables. Why needed: Quantifies how much information about forget data remains in representations. Quick check: Calculate MI before and after unlearning to verify reduction.

**Representation Space** - The latent feature space where inputs are mapped by neural networks. Why needed: Serves as the target space for unlearning operations. Quick check: Verify that representations maintain semantic structure for retained classes.

**Catastrophic Forgetting** - The phenomenon where learning new information causes forgetting of previously learned information. Why needed: Understanding this helps design methods that avoid utility loss during unlearning. Quick check: Monitor performance on retained data throughout the unlearning process.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Data -> Representation Extractor -> Variational Transformation -> Output Representation

**Critical Path:** The transformation learned in representation space directly determines forgetting effectiveness. The variational approximation bridges the gap between the theoretical mutual information objective and practical implementation.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Operating in representation space rather than parameter space trades off direct control over model behavior for computational efficiency and stability. The zero-shot setting sacrifices some control for practical applicability when retained data is unavailable.

**Failure Signatures:** If the transformation becomes too aggressive, representations may lose semantic structure leading to catastrophic collapse. If too conservative, forgetting may be incomplete. Poor variational approximations can lead to suboptimal information bottlenecks.

**First Experiments:** 1) Verify that MI between representations and forget data decreases after unlearning. 2) Test forgetting performance on CIFAR-10 with synthetic forget/retain splits. 3) Compare computational efficiency against baseline retraining methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations

- Assumes representation spaces remain stable during unlearning, which may not hold for models with dynamic or non-stationary features
- Effectiveness across diverse model architectures beyond image classifiers remains untested
- Memory requirements for storing representation spaces could become prohibitive for very large datasets or high-dimensional models

## Confidence

**High:** Computational efficiency metrics and comparative performance against baselines
**Medium:** Zero-shot unlearning effectiveness, as this relies on assumptions about information separability
**Low:** Claims about "near-perfect forgetting" given measurement limitations and potential information leakage

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on transformer-based architectures and language models to assess cross-domain generalization
2. Evaluate long-term stability of unlearned representations through incremental learning scenarios
3. Measure information leakage through adversarial attacks or membership inference to verify the completeness of forgetting
