# Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13945
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13945
- Reference count: 40
- Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models improve MAE by up to 40.67% and CRPS by up to 56.26% on visual field prediction and human motion capture datasets

## Executive Summary
Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models (PGDM) introduce a novel approach to multivariate time series forecasting by leveraging inherent patterns through archetypal analysis combined with diffusion models. The method extracts archetypal patterns from training data, predicts future pattern contributions, and applies dynamic guidance scaling based on uncertainty quantification. Evaluated on visual field prediction and human motion capture datasets, PGDM demonstrates substantial improvements over both unguided PGDM and baseline models, achieving up to 40.67% and 14.12% MAE improvements respectively.

## Method Summary
PGDM combines archetypal analysis with diffusion models for multivariate time series forecasting. The approach first extracts patterns using archetypal analysis, then predicts future pattern contributions to guide the diffusion process. A key innovation is the dynamic scaling of guidance based on uncertainty quantification from pattern estimates, using a novel metric that captures geometric distance from training data. This allows the model to adjust guidance strength based on how confident it is in its pattern predictions, potentially improving forecast accuracy while maintaining stability.

## Key Results
- Improves MAE by up to 40.67% and 14.12% on visual field prediction and human motion capture datasets respectively
- Improves CRPS by up to 56.26% and 14.10% on the same datasets
- Outperforms baseline models by up to 65.58%/84.83% and 93.64%/92.55% on MAE/CRPS

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PGDM leverages the inherent structure in multivariate time series data by identifying archetypal patterns that represent fundamental modes of variation. The diffusion model benefits from these structured patterns rather than learning purely from raw data, reducing the search space for plausible forecasts. The uncertainty-aware guidance scaling ensures that the model doesn't over-rely on pattern estimates when they're unreliable, maintaining robustness while still exploiting the pattern structure when confidence is high.

## Foundational Learning

### Archetypal Analysis
- **Why needed**: Identifies representative patterns that capture the essential structure of multivariate time series data
- **Quick check**: Verify that extracted archetypes represent distinct modes of variation and cover the data distribution

### Diffusion Models
- **Why needed**: Provides a probabilistic framework for generating diverse, realistic time series forecasts
- **Quick check**: Ensure stable sampling and reasonable diversity in generated forecasts

### Uncertainty Quantification
- **Why needed**: Enables dynamic adjustment of guidance strength based on confidence in pattern estimates
- **Quick check**: Validate that uncertainty estimates correlate with prediction error and guide appropriate scaling

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Archetypal Analysis -> Pattern Contribution Prediction -> Uncertainty Quantification -> Diffusion Model Guidance

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from pattern extraction through uncertainty estimation to the diffusion model's guidance function. The pattern contribution prediction bridges archetypal analysis and the diffusion model, while uncertainty quantification directly modulates the guidance strength.

### Design Tradeoffs
The method trades computational complexity (adding archetypal analysis and uncertainty quantification) for potentially improved forecast accuracy and robustness. The dynamic guidance scaling introduces additional hyperparameters that must be tuned but allows for adaptive behavior based on data characteristics.

### Failure Signatures
Performance degradation may occur when: (1) archetypal patterns poorly represent the data structure, (2) pattern contribution predictions are inaccurate, (3) uncertainty estimates are unreliable, or (4) the dynamic scaling mechanism over-corrects guidance strength.

### First Experiments
1. Validate archetypal pattern extraction quality on training data
2. Test pattern contribution prediction accuracy on held-out data
3. Evaluate uncertainty quantification's correlation with actual prediction errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two specific datasets (visual field prediction and human motion capture), potentially limiting generalizability
- Computational complexity of combining archetypal analysis with diffusion models may be prohibitive for large-scale applications
- Assumes training data contains sufficient archetypal patterns, which may not hold for all multivariate time series domains

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Empirical improvements in MAE and CRPS on tested datasets | High |
| Effectiveness of uncertainty metric in capturing geometric distance | Medium |
| Generalizability to other multivariate time series domains | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate PGDM on additional multivariate time series datasets from different domains (financial, climate, sensor networks) to assess generalizability

2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of archetypal analysis, pattern contribution prediction, and uncertainty-based guidance scaling

3. Perform computational complexity analysis and benchmarking to determine scalability for large-scale applications, including comparison with other state-of-the-art methods
