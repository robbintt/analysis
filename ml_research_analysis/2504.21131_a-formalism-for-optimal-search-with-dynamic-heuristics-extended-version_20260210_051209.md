# A Formalism for Optimal Search with Dynamic Heuristics (Extended Version)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.21131
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21131
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Formal framework for optimal search with dynamic heuristics that depend on accumulated search information

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a formalism for optimal search algorithms that use dynamic heuristics, where heuristic values change based on information gathered during search. The authors present DYN-A*, an A*-like algorithm that maintains optimality guarantees when using DYN-admissible heuristics. The framework extends classic A* properties to dynamic settings and provides conditions under which state reopening is unnecessary. The work formalizes and generalizes several existing planning techniques including landmark progression and online abstraction refinement.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a framework where heuristic functions depend on a state of information that evolves during search. They introduce DYN-A*, which operates by maintaining an OPEN list of states to explore and tracking the current information state. The algorithm updates the information state when new states are expanded, which in turn affects heuristic values for remaining states. The key insight is that by carefully controlling how information can be modified, the algorithm can maintain optimality guarantees similar to classic A* while allowing heuristic values to change dynamically based on search progress.

## Key Results
- DYN-A* returns optimal solutions when using DYN-admissible heuristics
- States are not reopened when using DYN-monotonic and DYN-consistent heuristics with re-evaluation
- The framework generalizes existing techniques like landmark progression and online abstraction refinement
- Formalizes conditions under which dynamic heuristic search maintains classic A* properties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by maintaining a consistent information state that governs heuristic evaluations. When a state is expanded, the information state may be updated, which affects future heuristic calculations. The key mechanism is that expanded states' heuristic values are never changed after expansion, preventing the need to reconsider them. This constraint, combined with appropriate admissibility conditions, ensures that the first time a goal state is expanded, the optimal path has been found. The information state acts as a monotonic record of what has been learned, allowing heuristics to incorporate this knowledge without invalidating past decisions.

## Foundational Learning

**DYN-admissibility**: Heuristic values that never overestimate true costs under any information state. Needed to ensure optimal solutions. Quick check: Verify heuristic bounds hold across all possible information updates.

**Information state management**: The evolving record of search knowledge that influences heuristic values. Needed to control how heuristics can change during search. Quick check: Confirm information updates only add knowledge, never remove it.

**State reopening conditions**: Scenarios where previously expanded states might need reconsideration. Needed to understand when optimality guarantees require additional computational cost. Quick check: Identify which dynamic heuristic classes avoid reopening.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Search problem -> State space -> Information state -> Heuristic function -> OPEN list -> Expansion policy -> Solution path

Critical path: Initialize information state and OPEN list → Expand states in order of f-value → Update information state based on expanded states → Recalculate heuristic values for remaining states → Continue until goal expansion

Design tradeoffs: The constraint that expanded state heuristic values cannot change simplifies correctness proofs but limits expressiveness. Allowing information updates only when expanding states prevents reopening but may miss opportunities for more aggressive pruning. The framework prioritizes formal guarantees over maximum flexibility.

Failure signatures: Non-optimal solutions indicate violation of DYN-admissibility. Unnecessary state reopening suggests missing DYN-monotonicity or DYN-consistency. Excessive computational overhead may indicate poorly designed information state updates that trigger too many heuristic recalculations.

First experiments:
1. Implement DYN-A* on a simple grid domain with dynamic obstacles to verify basic functionality
2. Test with a heuristic that violates DYN-admissibility to observe suboptimality
3. Apply to a planning problem using landmark progression to validate the generalized technique

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Restricted to dynamic heuristics where expanded state values remain unchanged, excluding some practical scenarios
- Information state updates only occur during state expansion, potentially limiting heuristic adaptability
- The framework's complexity may make implementation challenging for domains with intricate information dependencies

## Confidence
- Optimality proof for DYN-admissible heuristics: High confidence
- Non-reopening guarantees for DYN-monotonic/consistent heuristics: High confidence
- Practical implementation guidance: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Implement DYN-A* on a benchmark planning domain with dynamic heuristics to empirically verify the non-reopening guarantees
2. Test the algorithm with heuristics that violate the "unchanged expanded state values" constraint to identify failure modes
3. Benchmark DYN-A* against alternative approaches for dynamic heuristic search to quantify practical benefits and overhead
