# Uncertainty-Aware Subset Selection for Robust Visual Explainability under Distribution Shifts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08445
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 44.5% improvement in Insertion AUC scores for robust visual explanations under distribution shifts

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in visual explainability: the degradation of attribution quality under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. Existing subset-selection methods for visual attribution often produce redundant, unstable, and unreliable explanations when faced with distribution shifts. The authors propose a lightweight framework that integrates submodular optimization with gradient-based uncertainty estimation via adaptive weight perturbations, requiring no additional training or auxiliary models. Their approach estimates uncertainty by perturbing model weights in a layer-wise, input-aware manner and uses these estimates to guide submodular subset selection, ensuring diverse and stable attribution regions.

The proposed method significantly improves attribution fidelity and robustness under OOD scenarios, closing the robustness gap while also improving in-distribution (ID) performance. Empirical results demonstrate that the framework increases Insertion AUC scores by up to 44.5% and maintains or reduces Deletion AUC scores across various OOD settings, outperforming existing baselines. The framework is generalizable across tasks, including general visual attribution and object-level model interpretation, and produces more precise, interpretable explanations, especially under distribution shifts.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a lightweight framework that combines submodular optimization with gradient-based uncertainty estimation via adaptive weight perturbations to improve visual explainability under distribution shifts. The method estimates uncertainty by perturbing model weights in a layer-wise, input-aware manner and uses these estimates to guide submodular subset selection, ensuring diverse and stable attribution regions. This approach requires no additional training or auxiliary models, making it computationally efficient while addressing the problem of degraded attribution quality under OOD conditions.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 44.5% improvement in Insertion AUC scores for robust visual explanations under distribution shifts
- Maintains or reduces Deletion AUC scores across various OOD settings compared to baseline methods
- Demonstrates generalizability across tasks including general visual attribution and object-level model interpretation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by integrating uncertainty estimation directly into the subset selection process for visual attributions. By perturbing model weights in a layer-wise, input-aware manner, the method captures how sensitive the model's attributions are to small changes in its parameters. This uncertainty signal is then used to guide submodular optimization, which selects diverse and stable attribution regions that are less likely to be spurious or overfit to training distribution characteristics. The approach effectively balances exploration (diversity) and exploitation (relevance) in attribution selection while being robust to distribution shifts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Submodular Optimization**: A mathematical framework for selecting diverse and representative subsets from a larger set. Needed because it provides theoretical guarantees for diversity in attribution selection and enables efficient approximation of the optimal subset.
  - Quick check: Verify that the submodular function satisfies diminishing returns property

- **Gradient-based Uncertainty Estimation**: Methods that estimate model uncertainty by analyzing sensitivity of outputs to input or parameter perturbations. Needed because it provides a computationally efficient way to estimate uncertainty without requiring multiple forward passes or Bayesian approximations.
  - Quick check: Confirm that perturbations are small enough to stay in linear regime but large enough to capture meaningful uncertainty

- **Weight Perturbation Techniques**: Methods that estimate model behavior by systematically perturbing weights and observing output changes. Needed because direct input perturbations may not capture the full range of model uncertainties, especially for attribution stability.
  - Quick check: Ensure perturbations follow appropriate distributions (e.g., Gaussian) with calibrated magnitudes

- **OOD Detection and Robustness**: Techniques for identifying and handling out-of-distribution inputs. Needed because the primary motivation is improving explanations under distribution shifts, requiring the method to be aware of and robust to such shifts.
  - Quick check: Validate OOD detection performance on multiple benchmark datasets

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Image -> Weight Perturbation Module -> Uncertainty Estimation -> Submodular Optimization -> Attribution Selection -> Output Explanations

**Critical Path**: The critical computational path involves forward passes with weight perturbations to estimate uncertainties, followed by submodular optimization to select attribution regions. The weight perturbation step is the most computationally intensive component, as it requires multiple forward passes with perturbed weights for each input.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead (from weight perturbations) for improved attribution quality and robustness. Alternative approaches like input perturbation or ensemble methods were likely considered but rejected due to either insufficient uncertainty capture or excessive computational cost. The layer-wise, input-aware perturbation strategy represents a middle ground between efficiency and effectiveness.

**Failure Signatures**: The method may fail when: (1) Perturbation magnitudes are poorly calibrated, leading to either insufficient uncertainty capture or numerical instability; (2) The submodular function is poorly designed, resulting in suboptimal attribution selection; (3) The model architecture is too shallow or simple, providing insufficient gradients for meaningful uncertainty estimation.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Compare attribution stability under weight perturbations vs. input perturbations on a simple CNN architecture
2. Validate submodular optimization performance on synthetic attribution maps with known ground truth
3. Test attribution quality on a small-scale OOD detection benchmark before scaling to full vision models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Computational overhead of weight perturbation approach may become prohibitive for very large vision models
- Evaluation focuses primarily on Insertion and Deletion AUC metrics, which may not fully capture practical utility in real-world deployment
- Limited diversity of OOD datasets tested, potentially constraining generalizability claims

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core methodological contribution and theoretical soundness of combining submodular optimization with uncertainty estimation
- **Medium confidence** in the empirical improvements under OOD conditions, given the limited diversity of OOD datasets tested
- **Medium confidence** in the generalizability claims across different vision tasks, as the paper demonstrates success primarily in object detection and attribution contexts

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability Validation**: Test the framework's performance and computational efficiency on larger vision models (e.g., ViT-Huge, ConvNeXt-XLarge) to verify that the weight perturbation approach remains tractable and effective at scale.

2. **Cross-Domain Robustness**: Evaluate the method on additional OOD scenarios including domain shifts in medical imaging, remote sensing, and low-resource language contexts to assess broader applicability.

3. **Human Evaluation Study**: Conduct a user study comparing human interpretability and trust in explanations generated by the uncertainty-aware method versus baseline approaches, particularly focusing on decision-making scenarios where explanation quality directly impacts outcomes.
