# Effect of Data Augmentation on Conformal Prediction for Diabetic Retinopathy

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.14266
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14266
- **Reference count**: 24
- **Primary result**: Sample-mixing augmentation strategies like Mixup and CutMix improve both predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation under conformal prediction for diabetic retinopathy

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates how different data augmentation strategies affect conformal prediction performance for diabetic retinopathy grading. Using the DDR dataset with ResNet-50 and CoaT-Lite-Medium architectures, the research compares five augmentation schemes (none, standard, CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix) through conformal prediction metrics including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct efficiency. The findings demonstrate that advanced sample-mixing techniques not only enhance predictive accuracy but also produce more reliable and efficient uncertainty estimates, while CLAHE can negatively impact model certainty. The study emphasizes the importance of co-designing augmentation strategies with uncertainty quantification to build trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

## Method Summary
The study employed a systematic experimental design using the DDR diabetic retinopathy dataset with two neural network architectures: ResNet-50 and CoaT-Lite-Medium. Five augmentation strategies were evaluated: no augmentation, standard augmentations, CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), Mixup, and CutMix. Models were trained and assessed using conformal prediction metrics including empirical coverage (actual vs. expected confidence interval coverage), average prediction set size (efficiency measure), and correct efficiency. The evaluation framework compared how each augmentation strategy influenced both predictive accuracy and the quality of uncertainty estimates generated through conformal prediction methods.

## Key Results
- Mixup and CutMix augmentation strategies significantly improved both predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation quality under conformal prediction
- CLAHE augmentation was found to negatively impact model certainty and prediction efficiency
- Sample-mixing augmentations produced more reliable and efficient uncertainty estimates compared to standard augmentation approaches
- Advanced augmentation techniques yielded better correct efficiency scores while maintaining target empirical coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal prediction**: A framework for quantifying uncertainty by producing statistically valid prediction sets; needed to ensure reliable confidence estimates in medical diagnosis where false negatives are critical
- **Sample-mixing augmentations (Mixup/CutMix)**: Techniques that combine multiple training samples to create synthetic examples; needed to improve model robustness and generalization by exposing models to interpolated data distributions
- **Empirical coverage**: The actual proportion of test instances whose true labels fall within the predicted confidence sets; needed to validate whether uncertainty estimates are well-calibrated
- **Average prediction set size**: A measure of prediction efficiency where smaller sets indicate more precise predictions; needed to balance uncertainty quantification with practical usability in clinical settings
- **Correct efficiency**: A metric combining accuracy and efficiency to evaluate overall prediction quality; needed to assess the practical utility of augmented models in real-world diagnostic scenarios
- **CLAHE**: Contrast enhancement technique for medical images; needed to investigate whether image preprocessing improves or degrades uncertainty estimation in deep learning models

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: DDR dataset -> Augmentation strategy -> CNN architecture (ResNet-50/CoaT-Lite-Medium) -> Conformal prediction layer -> Evaluation metrics (coverage, APS, correct efficiency)
- **Critical path**: Data augmentation -> Model training -> Conformal prediction calibration -> Uncertainty estimation -> Performance evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing augmentation strength vs. preserving clinical features, computational cost of advanced augmentations vs. accuracy gains, model complexity vs. calibration stability
- **Failure signatures**: CLAHE causing degraded certainty suggests over-enhancement destroys relevant diagnostic features; sample-mixing may fail if interpolation creates anatomically implausible combinations
- **First experiments**: 1) Compare baseline vs. Mixup/CutMix on a small validation subset; 2) Test CLAHE at different enhancement strengths to find optimal parameters; 3) Evaluate model calibration before and after augmentation using reliability diagrams

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Conclusions based on a single dataset (DDR) and two specific model architectures, limiting generalizability
- Evaluation metrics focus on coverage and prediction set size without clinical validation of diagnostic performance impact
- The mechanism behind CLAHE's negative impact on model certainty is not deeply investigated
- Does not explore interactions between different augmentation strategies or effects across disease severity levels

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Mixup and CutMix improve both accuracy and uncertainty estimation under conformal prediction
- **Medium confidence**: CLAHE negatively impacts model certainty due to specific experimental setup
- **Medium confidence**: Co-designing augmentation with uncertainty quantification is recommended but needs broader validation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate study using multiple diabetic retinopathy datasets (EyePACS, APTOS) to assess generalization across different data distributions
2. Conduct ablation studies combining different augmentation strategies to identify optimal configurations and understand interaction effects
3. Perform clinical validation with ophthalmologists to evaluate whether uncertainty estimates from sample-mixing augmented models improve clinical decision-making compared to standard approaches
