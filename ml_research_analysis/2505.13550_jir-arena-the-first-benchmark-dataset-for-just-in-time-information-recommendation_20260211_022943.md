## Executive Summary
This paper introduces JIR-Arena, the first benchmark dataset for Just-in-time Information Recommendation (JIR). JIR systems proactively deliver contextually relevant information when users need it most, minimizing cognitive effort and enhancing decision-making. JIR-Arena addresses the lack of formal JIR task definitions and evaluation frameworks by providing a multimodal benchmark with 34 multimedia scenes totaling 831 minutes, focusing on information-intensive scenarios like lectures and conference talks. The dataset is constructed through a two-stage process: user information need simulation and information retrieval-based JIR instance completion, using multi-entity, multi-turn simulations to approximate user needs and static knowledge base snapshots for evaluation. A baseline JIR system is implemented and evaluated, revealing that while large foundation model-based JIR systems can simulate user needs with reasonable precision, they struggle with recall and effective content retrieval.

## Method Summary
JIR-Arena is constructed through a two-stage process. First, user information needs are simulated using multiple LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3) and human annotators, with needs deduplicated based on temporal overlap and semantic similarity (threshold 0.75) and assigned likelihood scores through voting. Second, JIR content is completed through a three-layer retrieval process using static knowledge bases (Wikipedia, textbooks, arXiv papers), with relevance scores assigned based on retrieval layer progression. The benchmark evaluates systems on Recall (coverage of ground truth needs), Precision (fraction of correct JIRs), R_relevance (retrieval quality via nDCG), and R_timeliness (temporal accuracy).

## Key Results
- Multi-entity simulation approximates user information need distribution more reliably than single-source annotation
- Static knowledge base snapshots enable reproducible evaluation but may not reflect real-world utility
- Separating need prediction from content generation allows independent evaluation of each component
- Baseline systems show high precision but struggle with recall and retrieval quality
- R_relevance scores remain low (0.014-0.016) due to context-poor queries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multi-entity simulation approximates the true distribution of user information needs more reliably than single-source annotation. The pipeline aggregates needs from multiple LLMs and human annotators, then deduplicates based on temporal overlap and semantic similarity (threshold 0.75). A separate voting step assigns likelihood scores to each need, reflecting the probability that a typical user would express it. The combination of diverse annotators and models produces coverage that approximates the true distribution of user needs, even though individual annotators show high variance.

### Mechanism 2
Static knowledge base snapshots isolate retrieval quality from knowledge base variability, enabling reproducible evaluation. The benchmark uses fixed Wikipedia dumps, textbooks, and arXiv papers as reference corpora. JIR systems are evaluated on their ability to retrieve relevant documents from these static sources, rather than on their access to dynamic or proprietary knowledge. Retrieval performance on static snapshots correlates with real-world utility, even though deployed systems may use different or evolving knowledge bases.

### Mechanism 3
Separating need prediction from content generation allows independent evaluation of each component. The benchmark evaluates systems on Recall/Precision (need prediction), R_relevance (retrieval quality), and R_timeliness (temporal alignment). Only ts, q, Ref, and te are required fields; display formatting (S, I) is excluded to avoid conflating generation quality with need inference. Need prediction and retrieval are the primary bottlenecks for JIR utility, and display quality can be evaluated separately.

## Foundational Learning

- **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)**: The paper formalizes JIR as a POMDP with discrete time steps, observations (multimodal context, user persona, knowledge bases), actions (initiate/terminate JIR instances), and rewards (timeliness, relevance). Understanding POMDPs is essential to grasp the task formulation. *Quick check: What components of the JIR POMDP are directly observable vs. latent?*

- **nDCG (normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**: Used to compute R_relevance by measuring how well the system's ranked reference list aligns with the ideal ranking based on pre-assigned relevance scores. *Quick check: Why does nDCG penalize relevant documents appearing later in the ranked list?*

- **Semantic similarity matching with sentence embeddings**: The benchmark uses Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-V2) for need deduplication (threshold 0.75) and candidate-ground truth alignment (threshold 0.55). *Quick check: What tradeoffs arise from using fixed similarity thresholds for need matching?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preprocessing -> User information need simulation -> JIR content completion -> Human verification -> Evaluation pipeline
- **Critical path**: Video → Transcript → Need simulation → Deduplication → Likelihood voting → Retrieval for each need → Reference scoring → Metric computation
- **Design tradeoffs**: LLM-only simulation vs. human annotation (LLMs identify more needs but may over-generate; humans show high variance but better reflect real user distributions); Static vs. dynamic knowledge bases (static enables reproducibility but may not reflect real deployment conditions); Excluding display fields (controls for generation model variability but misses UI/UX evaluation)
- **Failure signatures**: Low Recall with high Precision (system is conservative, missing common user needs); Low R_relevance despite high Recall (need prediction works but retrieval fails); Timing errors >10 seconds (processing granularity too coarse or need prediction delayed)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline with GPT-4o and OpenSearch to establish reference scores; 2) Ablation: Add context window to retrieval queries to test impact on R_relevance (hypothesis: context-poor queries cause low scores); 3) Ablation: Reduce chunk size from 2 minutes to 30 seconds to test impact on Recall and R_timeliness (hypothesis: finer granularity improves both)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can contextualized retrieval significantly improve JIR relevance scores compared to context-free query approaches? The authors recommend incorporating contextual background of information needs during retrieval after observing poor R_relevance scores due to context-dependent queries. Experiments comparing retrieval quality when queries include discourse context versus standalone queries, measured via nDCG, would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Does the entropy of scene content predict how well LLMs can cover human information needs? The authors note coverage relates to entropy of information covered, with higher entropy correlating with lower coverage. Quantitative entropy measures for each scene correlated with LLM-to-human coverage percentages across the full dataset would provide systematic analysis.

### Open Question 3
How can JIR systems balance high recall for comprehensive need identification with high precision to minimize irrelevant recommendations? The authors state balancing comprehensive need identification with selective, high-precision recommendations will be a defining feature of effective personalized JIR systems. Development and evaluation of architectures maintaining recall above 0.6 while achieving precision above 0.75 would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Benchmark relies heavily on LLM-based simulations that may not fully capture real-world variability
- Static knowledge base snapshots may not reflect dynamic nature of deployed JIR systems
- Exclusion of display formatting from evaluation may overlook important aspects of user experience

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Benchmark design and evaluation metrics are clearly specified and reproducible; formal POMDP task definition provides solid theoretical foundation
- **Medium Confidence**: Multi-entity simulation approach for approximating user needs is innovative but lacks direct validation against real user behavior; claim that static snapshots enable reproducible evaluation is plausible but not empirically tested
- **Low Confidence**: Assertion that JIR systems struggle primarily with recall and retrieval (rather than need prediction or display quality) is based on single baseline implementation and may not generalize

## Next Checks
1. Deploy a JIR system in controlled study with actual lecture/conference viewers to compare simulated needs against observed needs, measuring coverage and distribution differences
2. Evaluate JIR-Arena scores when using current (vs. static) Wikipedia dumps and real-time web search to assess impact of knowledge base freshness on retrieval quality
3. Implement and evaluate JIR systems with varying display qualities to determine whether current metrics miss critical aspects of user satisfaction and system utility
