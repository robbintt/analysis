# DAVID-XR1: Detecting AI-Generated Videos with Explainable Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14827
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14827
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces first dataset with fine-grained defect-level annotations for AI-generated videos and an explainable detection model

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of explainable detection of AI-generated videos, which current methods often treat as opaque binary classification. The authors introduce DAVID-X, the first dataset providing fine-grained defect-level annotations—including defect categories, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations—for AI-generated videos, along with corresponding real videos. Leveraging these annotations, they present DAVID-XR1, a vision-language model fine-tuned to produce interpretable chains of visual reasoning. The model demonstrates strong generalization to unseen generators and significantly improves backbone accuracy from 26.7% to 76.7% on out-of-domain detection. Manual evaluation shows explanation precision of 54.7%, indicating robust reasoning quality.

## Method Summary
The authors developed DAVID-X, a novel dataset featuring fine-grained defect-level annotations for AI-generated videos, including defect categories, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. Using this dataset, they fine-tuned DAVID-XR1, a vision-language model specifically designed to generate interpretable chains of visual reasoning for detecting AI-generated content. The approach transforms the detection task from black-box classification into an explainable reasoning process by explicitly identifying and describing artifacts present in synthetic videos.

## Key Results
- Backbone accuracy improves from 26.7% to 76.7% on out-of-domain detection
- Manual evaluation shows explanation precision of 54.7%
- Strong generalization demonstrated on unseen generators
- First dataset providing fine-grained defect-level annotations for AI-generated videos

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by explicitly modeling the reasoning process behind AI-generated video detection. By fine-tuning on annotated defect information, the model learns to identify specific visual artifacts and articulate why content is likely AI-generated. This explainable framework not only improves detection accuracy but also provides transparency in decision-making, addressing the opacity problem common in traditional detection methods.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision-language models (Why needed: To bridge visual content with textual reasoning) - Quick check: Model can generate coherent explanations for visual artifacts
- Fine-grained annotation (Why needed: Enables detailed reasoning rather than binary classification) - Quick check: Annotations include defect type, location, and explanation
- Temporal-spatial localization (Why needed: AI artifacts often manifest in specific video regions/times) - Quick check: Model can pinpoint where defects occur
- Chain-of-thought reasoning (Why needed: Mimics human reasoning process for detection) - Quick check: Explanations follow logical progression
- Dataset generalization (Why needed: Real-world detection requires handling unseen generators) - Quick check: Performance on out-of-domain generators

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Video -> Feature Extraction -> Reasoning Chain Generation -> Detection Decision + Explanation

Critical path: The model processes video frames through a vision transformer backbone, extracts features, then passes them through a language model fine-tuned on reasoning chains. The critical path involves correlating visual defects with textual explanations to produce both a detection score and interpretable reasoning.

Design tradeoffs: The approach trades some computational efficiency for explainability and improved generalization. While more complex than simple binary classifiers, the reasoning capability enables better handling of novel generators and provides transparency for trust.

Failure signatures: The model may struggle with subtle artifacts, contradictory defect patterns, or artifacts not represented in training data. Low explanation precision (54.7%) indicates occasional reasoning errors or hallucinations.

First experiments:
1. Test detection accuracy on videos from known vs. unknown generators
2. Evaluate explanation precision against human-annotated reasoning chains
3. Assess localization accuracy for identified defects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Dataset focus on defect-level annotations may miss subtle or emerging artifacts
- Explanation precision of 54.7% indicates room for improvement in reasoning quality
- Substantial performance gap between in-domain (76.7%) and out-of-domain (26.7%) detection suggests potential overfitting

## Confidence
- Dataset annotation quality and coverage: Medium
- Model performance improvements: High
- Explanation quality and interpretability: Medium
- Generalization across unseen generators: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation testing with AI-generated videos from emerging generators not present in any training data to assess true out-of-domain generalization capabilities.
2. Implement human evaluation studies comparing DAVID-XR1's explanations against expert-annotated reasoning chains to validate the model's interpretability claims.
3. Test the model's performance on AI-generated videos with subtle artifacts or those intentionally designed to evade detection to evaluate robustness against adversarial generation techniques.
