core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of industrial anomaly detection
  using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which currently lack domain-specific
  knowledge and fine-grained reasoning capabilities. The authors propose ADSeeker,
  a knowledge-infused framework that integrates a visual document knowledge base (SEEK-M&V)
  and a Query Image-Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Q2K RAG) system to enhance

# ADSeeker: A Knowledge-Infused Framework for Anomaly Detection and Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.03088
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03088
- **Reference count**: 5
- **Primary result**: Introduces ADSeeker framework achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly detection performance

## Executive Summary
This paper presents ADSeeker, a knowledge-infused framework that addresses the limitations of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in industrial anomaly detection. The framework integrates a visual document knowledge base (SEEK-M&V) and a Query Image-Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Q2K RAG) system to enhance anomaly detection and reasoning capabilities. Additionally, the authors introduce Multi-type Anomaly (MulA), the largest-scale AD dataset to date, containing 72 defect types across 26 categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSeeker achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on several benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods in both industrial and medical anomaly detection tasks.

## Method Summary
ADSeeker combines multimodal large language models with domain-specific knowledge infusion to improve anomaly detection and reasoning. The framework leverages a visual document knowledge base and a Q2K RAG system to retrieve relevant domain knowledge for better anomaly reasoning. A Hierarchical Sparse Prompt (HSP) mechanism is introduced to extract type-level features and enhance zero-shot anomaly detection performance. The approach addresses the key limitations of existing MLLMs, which struggle with fine-grained anomaly reasoning and lack domain-specific knowledge.

## Key Results
- ADSeeker achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple benchmark datasets
- The framework demonstrates superior performance in both industrial and medical anomaly detection tasks
- Significant improvements in anomaly reasoning accuracy, defect classification, and localization compared to existing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ADSeeker works by infusing domain-specific knowledge into multimodal large language models through a combination of visual document retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation. The Hierarchical Sparse Prompt mechanism enables the model to extract fine-grained, type-level features that are crucial for distinguishing subtle anomaly patterns. The Q2K RAG system retrieves relevant domain knowledge from the SEEK-M&V knowledge base, providing context-specific information that enhances the model's reasoning capabilities for anomaly detection.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: Why needed - To process and reason across visual and textual data simultaneously for comprehensive anomaly analysis. Quick check - Verify model can handle both image and text inputs for joint processing.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Why needed - To incorporate external domain knowledge into the reasoning process. Quick check - Confirm retrieval system can find relevant documents based on input queries.
- **Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD)**: Why needed - To detect anomalies without requiring labeled training data for each defect type. Quick check - Test model performance on completely unseen defect categories.
- **Hierarchical Sparse Prompting**: Why needed - To extract multi-level features for fine-grained anomaly detection. Quick check - Validate prompt effectiveness across different hierarchical levels.
- **Visual Document Knowledge Base**: Why needed - To provide domain-specific context for enhanced reasoning. Quick check - Ensure knowledge base coverage spans relevant industrial domains.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Image → Visual Encoder → Hierarchical Sparse Prompt (HSP) → Q2K RAG → Knowledge Base (SEEK-M&V) → Reasoning Module → Anomaly Detection Output

**Critical Path**: Image → HSP Feature Extraction → Q2K Retrieval → Knowledge Integration → Final Prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for improved accuracy through knowledge infusion and hierarchical feature extraction. While the Q2K RAG system adds latency, it significantly improves reasoning accuracy compared to pure visual analysis.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor performance on rare defect types not well-represented in the knowledge base
- Degradation when input images have significant domain shift from training data
- Reduced effectiveness when hierarchical prompt levels don't align with defect characteristics

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test zero-shot performance on a held-out subset of defect types from the MulA dataset
2. Evaluate ablation study comparing HSP mechanism with and without Q2K RAG system
3. Measure knowledge retrieval accuracy and relevance scores for different query types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on synthetic defect generation, which may not capture real-world anomaly complexity
- Performance improvements from HSP mechanism lack detailed ablation studies isolating individual contributions
- Knowledge base may have limited coverage of rare or novel defect types not documented in training corpus

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Framework architecture and technical implementation | High |
| Benchmark results and zero-shot claims | Medium |
| Scalability to real-world industrial applications | Medium |
| Long-term generalization to new defect categories | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct real-world field testing on actual industrial equipment to validate synthetic dataset performance claims
2. Perform extensive ablation studies isolating the contribution of each component (HSP, Q2K RAG, knowledge base) to overall performance
3. Test the framework's ability to detect and reason about completely novel defect types not present in any training data
