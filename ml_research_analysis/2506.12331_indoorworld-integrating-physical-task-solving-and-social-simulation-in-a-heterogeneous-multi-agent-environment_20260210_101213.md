core_contribution: IndoorWorld introduces a heterogeneous multi-agent environment
  that tightly integrates physical task solving and social simulation, addressing
  limitations in existing environments that either oversimplify agent individuality
  or lack physical grounding of social behaviors. The platform models agents with
  distinct roles, capabilities, and knowledge levels, enabling realistic interactions
  within indoor spaces.

# IndoorWorld: Integrating Physical Task Solving and Social Simulation in A Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Environment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12331
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12331
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces heterogeneous multi-agent environment integrating physical task solving with social simulation

## Executive Summary
IndoorWorld addresses limitations in existing multi-agent environments by tightly integrating physical task solving with social simulation in a unified platform. The system models agents with distinct roles, capabilities, and knowledge levels, enabling realistic interactions within indoor spaces. By providing 38 distinct actions and supporting heterogeneous agent behaviors, the platform creates a scalable testbed for evaluating LLM-based multi-agent systems in collaborative office environments.

## Method Summary
IndoorWorld implements a heterogeneous multi-agent environment where agents possess distinct roles, capabilities, and knowledge levels. The platform models indoor spaces with realistic spatial layouts and enables agents to perform 38 distinct actions for task completion. The system integrates physical task solving with social simulation, allowing agents to interact with objects and other agents while pursuing individual and collaborative objectives. Task prioritization mechanisms are implemented to improve LLM agent performance in office task scenarios.

## Key Results
- Task prioritization significantly improves LLM agent performance in collaborative office tasks
- Heterogeneous agent modeling enables realistic social interactions and resource allocation behaviors
- Architects surveyed found the tool relevant and useful for understanding occupant behavior and spatial planning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of physical task solving and social simulation creates a realistic multi-agent environment where agents must balance individual goals with collaborative needs. Heterogeneous agent modeling ensures that different roles and capabilities naturally emerge, creating complex interaction patterns that mirror real-world office dynamics.

## Foundational Learning
- Heterogeneous agent modeling: Why needed - captures realistic diversity in agent capabilities and knowledge; Quick check - verify agents exhibit distinct behaviors based on their assigned roles
- Task prioritization algorithms: Why needed - improves LLM agent decision-making efficiency; Quick check - measure performance improvement when prioritization is enabled vs disabled
- Social simulation integration: Why needed - creates emergent behaviors from agent interactions; Quick check - observe agent adaptation to resource constraints and spatial limitations

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Environment Space -> Agent Manager -> Task Scheduler -> Action Executor -> LLM Processor
Critical path: Environment state update -> Agent decision-making -> Action execution -> Social interaction resolution
Design tradeoffs: Physical realism vs computational efficiency; Agent autonomy vs coordination requirements
Failure signatures: Deadlock in task allocation; Inconsistent state updates; Communication breakdowns between agents
First experiments: 1) Single-agent task completion in controlled environment; 2) Multi-agent coordination with simple shared objectives; 3) Social interaction testing with resource competition scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small survey sample (8 architects) limits generalizability of architectural relevance findings
- Limited comparison between task prioritization conditions (only two architectural layouts tested)
- LLM agent social behaviors lack direct validation against real-world human behavior data

## Confidence
High: Technical implementation of IndoorWorld platform, heterogeneous agent modeling, action space definition
Medium: Architectural survey results (small sample size), task prioritization performance improvements (limited scenarios)
Low: None identified

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale architect survey across different experience levels and geographic regions to validate tool relevance
2. Implement benchmark suite with diverse office layouts to systematically evaluate task prioritization effects
3. Design experiments comparing LLM agent social behaviors against observed human behavioral patterns in real office environments
