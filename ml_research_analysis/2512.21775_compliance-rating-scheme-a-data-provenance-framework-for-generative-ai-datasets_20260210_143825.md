# Compliance Rating Scheme: A Data Provenance Framework for Generative AI Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.21775
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21775
- Authors: Matyas Bohacek; Ignacio Vilanova Echavarri
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces a compliance framework that uses cryptographic provenance metadata to evaluate dataset adherence to transparency, accountability, and security principles

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework that evaluates generative AI datasets against six compliance criteria using data provenance technology. The authors developed DatasetSentinel, an open-source Python library that implements the CRS framework. The library serves dual purposes: enabling dataset authors to filter data points during creation and allowing AI practitioners to assess existing datasets' compliance scores. Evaluation shows positive usability results and demonstrates practical application through case studies on public datasets.

## Method Summary
The CRS framework evaluates datasets across six criteria spanning both dataset-level properties (transparent sourcing, opt-out mechanisms, change traceability) and data point-level properties (license compliance, flagging inconclusive provenance, source/retention metadata). DatasetSentinel implements this framework using the C2PA data provenance standard via the Content Authenticity Initiative library to extract cryptographic provenance metadata from individual files. The library operates in two modes: proactive filtering during dataset creation and reactive assessment of existing datasets, producing a letter grade (A-G) that summarizes overall compliance.

## Key Results
- Average usability score of 5.6/7 from user study with 14 AI experts
- Wily maintainability score above 85 for the DatasetSentinel library
- Case studies demonstrated practical application on four public datasets
- Framework addresses ethical and legal challenges in dataset creation and usage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Criterion-Compliance Mapping to Letter Grade
The CRS converts six discrete compliance criteria into a single summary letter grade (A-G) that practitioners can use for dataset selection. Each satisfied criterion increments the score upward by one letter from baseline "G." Criteria span both dataset-level properties and data point-level properties. Core assumption: Users will make dataset selection decisions based on summary grades rather than detailed criterion-level analysis.

### Mechanism 2: Provenance Metadata Extraction via C2PA Standard
Cryptographic provenance metadata embedded in files enables automated verification of licensing and consent claims without trusting the dataset author. DatasetSentinel uses the CAI library implementing the C2PA standard to extract provenance assertions from individual data points. Core assumption: The majority of source content will have C2PA-compliant provenance metadata embedded at creation time.

### Mechanism 3: Dual-Mode Integration (Proactive Filtering + Reactive Assessment)
The same framework serves dataset authors during creation and AI practitioners during selection, creating a closed-loop compliance system. Feature 1 evaluates individual data points before inclusion, while Feature 2 aggregates compliance across all data points and dataset-level properties. Core assumption: Dataset authors are motivated to use proactive filtering even without external mandates.

## Foundational Learning

- **Data Provenance**: Records of a file's origin, ownership, and evolution from creation to current state.
  - Why needed here: The entire CRS framework depends on extracting and verifying provenance metadata.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why provenance metadata differs from standard file metadata like EXIF?

- **C2PA/CAI Standard**: A cryptographic framework for embedding tamper-evident provenance assertions in media files.
  - Why needed here: DatasetSentinel relies on this standard to extract verifiable license and consent information.
  - Quick check question: What types of assertions can C2PA metadata contain, and how does cryptographic signing prevent forgery?

- **Dataset Lifecycle Stakeholders**: Distinction between dataset authors (who create, set policies, and distribute) and AI practitioners (who select and use datasets for training).
  - Why needed here: The two library features map directly to these two stakeholder roles with different incentive structures.
  - Quick check question: At which lifecycle stage does the liability transfer risk described in the LAION-5B example occur?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: DatasetSentinel (main library) -> Feature 1: check_data_point_compliance -> Feature 2: calculate_crs_score -> CAI/C2PA integration layer -> LLM-based inference for dataset-level criteria -> Platform adapters

- **Critical path**: Provenance extraction → criterion evaluation (C2/C3/C6 per-data-point; C1/C4/C5 per-dataset) → grade aggregation → user-facing output

- **Design tradeoffs**: C2PA dependency limits supported file types but provides cryptographic verification; LLM inference for dataset-level criteria on non-standard platforms introduces potential false positives/negatives; letter-grade simplification improves usability but loses criterion-level nuance

- **Failure signatures**: Files without C2PA metadata → C3 flagged as "inconclusive," C2/C6 unverifiable; non-standard distribution platforms → LLM-based inference may misclassify C1/C4/C5; large datasets → per-data-point verification becomes computationally expensive

- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Run calculate_crs_score on MS COCO to reproduce the "F" result and understand which criteria fail
  2. Test check_data_point_compliance on a C2PA-enabled image with known provenance assertions to verify extraction accuracy
  3. Integrate Feature 1 into a minimal scraping pipeline to observe the filtering behavior on a small sample (e.g., 100 candidate images with mixed provenance status)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the Compliance Rating Scheme effectively evaluate legacy datasets where the majority of data points lack embedded provenance metadata?
- Basis in paper: Section 8 (Limitations) states that "the majority of digital media available online still lacks provenance metadata," which currently restricts the library's ability to assess existing content.
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies on the presence of C2PA metadata to function; without it, the automated verification of compliance criteria C2, C3, and C6 is impossible.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validated methodology or technical extension capable of inferring compliance or assigning confidence intervals to datasets lacking cryptographic provenance headers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What mechanisms are required to incentivize dataset-sharing platforms (e.g., Hugging Face, GitHub) to adopt and display the CRS score as a standard metric?
- Basis in paper: Section 7 (Discussion) suggests that "dataset-sharing platforms may adopt this tool on their end" and includes mockups of this integration, but notes the need for a "value shift" in the community.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides the technical tool but does not address the economic or social incentives necessary for platforms to enforce this standard voluntarily.
- What evidence would resolve it: A pilot study or partnership with a major repository demonstrating increased user engagement or reduced legal risk following the integration of CRS scores.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the reported usability and integration ease of the DatasetSentinel library generalize to a broader population of AI practitioners?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.2.2 describes the user study results as "preliminary" based on a sample of only 14 participants, indicating that broader validation is needed.
- Why unresolved: The small sample size and specific demographic profile (85% male, 50% USA) may not accurately represent the global diversity of AI practitioners and their varying technical workflows.
- What evidence would resolve it: A large-scale user study (N > 100) with diverse demographics confirming that the average usability score remains above 5.6/7 across different user groups.

## Limitations

- C2PA adoption rates severely limit the framework's ability to automatically verify compliance for most existing datasets
- LLM-based inference for non-standard platforms introduces uncertainty in dataset-level criterion evaluation
- Small user study sample (14 participants) may not represent broader practitioner community

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Technical implementation using CAI/C2PA standard is well-defined and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: CRS scoring methodology and letter-grade aggregation are mathematically sound but real-world adoption remains unproven
- **Low Confidence**: Framework effectiveness depends on C2PA adoption rates and LLM inference accuracy, neither of which are addressed

## Next Checks

1. Measure C2PA metadata presence rates across a representative sample of web-scraped media to quantify the fraction of data points that can be automatically evaluated
2. Conduct a larger-scale user study (n≥50) with diverse practitioner roles to evaluate CRS score's actual impact on dataset selection decisions
3. Test DatasetSentinel's LLM-based inference accuracy on GitHub and custom platform datasets by comparing automated classifications against manual expert evaluations
