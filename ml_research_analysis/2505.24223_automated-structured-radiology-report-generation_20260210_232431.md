# Automated Structured Radiology Report Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24223
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24223
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel SRRG task and dataset with radiologist-validated structured radiology report generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Structured Radiology Report Generation (SRRG), a novel task that reformulates free-text radiology reports into standardized formats to improve clinical clarity and consistency. The authors created a comprehensive dataset by restructuring MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus reports using large language models following strict clinical reporting guidelines. They also developed SRR-BERT, a fine-grained disease classification model with 55 labels, and introduced F1-SRR-BERT as a new evaluation metric specifically designed for structured radiology report generation.

The research demonstrates that structured report generation models outperform traditional free-form approaches across multiple evaluation metrics. A radiologist reader study involving five board-certified radiologists validated the quality of the restructured reports. The work addresses a critical need in radiology for standardized reporting formats that enhance communication and reduce interpretation variability among clinicians.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a comprehensive methodology for structured radiology report generation by first creating a novel dataset through automated restructuring of existing free-text reports from MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus using large language models guided by clinical reporting standards. They implemented SRR-BERT, a specialized fine-grained classification model trained on 55 disease labels, and designed the F1-SRR-BERT metric to evaluate structured report generation performance. The dataset underwent validation through a reader study conducted by five board-certified radiologists, and extensive experiments compared structured generation models against traditional free-form approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

## Key Results
- Models demonstrated superior performance on structured report generation compared to traditional free-form approaches
- CheXpert-Plus achieved the highest scores across multiple metrics on the SRRG-Impression dataset
- Radiologist validation confirmed quality of restructured reports through reader study

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages large language models to systematically transform unstructured clinical text into standardized formats following established reporting guidelines, which inherently improves consistency and reduces ambiguity in clinical communication. By fine-tuning specialized classification models like SRR-BERT on disease-specific labels, the system can accurately identify and structure relevant clinical findings. The introduction of F1-SRR-BERT as an evaluation metric specifically captures the nuances of structured report generation quality, enabling more precise model assessment compared to traditional metrics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Structured Reporting**: Standardized format for clinical documentation that improves communication consistency; needed to reduce interpretation variability among clinicians and ensure complete information capture
- **Fine-grained Classification**: Multi-label classification with many disease categories (55 labels here); needed to capture comprehensive disease spectrum in radiology reports
- **Evaluation Metrics for Clinical Text**: Specialized metrics like F1-SRR-BERT that account for structured output quality; needed because traditional metrics don't capture clinical reporting nuances
- **Large Language Model Restructuring**: Using LLMs to transform free text into structured formats; needed to scale dataset creation while maintaining clinical guideline adherence
- **Radiologist Reader Studies**: Clinical validation through expert review; needed to ensure generated reports meet practical clinical utility standards
- **Dataset Construction from Clinical Data**: Process of transforming existing clinical datasets into structured formats; needed to create large-scale training data while preserving clinical accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Clinical Reports -> LLM Restructuring -> SRR-BERT Classification -> Structured Output Generation

**Critical Path**: Data preprocessing → LLM restructuring → SRR-BERT fine-tuning → Model training → Evaluation with F1-SRR-BERT

**Design Tradeoffs**: Automated restructuring using LLMs offers scalability but risks hallucination, while manual restructuring would be more accurate but impractical for large datasets; the choice of 55 disease labels balances comprehensiveness with model complexity

**Failure Signatures**: Hallucination in restructured reports, misclassification by SRR-BERT leading to incorrect disease labels, evaluation metric misalignment with clinical utility, and limited radiologist validation sample size affecting generalizability

**First Experiments**: 1) Test LLM restructuring on small sample with manual verification, 2) Evaluate SRR-BERT performance on held-out validation set, 3) Conduct pilot radiologist reader study with 2-3 experts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Potential hallucination and bias introduced by large language model restructuring, though not quantitatively evaluated
- Limited radiologist validation sample size (5 board-certified radiologists) may not capture full clinical interpretation variability
- Automated restructuring process may introduce subtle inconsistencies despite guideline adherence
- F1-SRR-BERT metric lacks independent verification by broader radiology community

## Confidence
High - Core findings regarding structured report generation superiority are well-supported by systematic evaluation
Medium - Dataset construction methodology confidence limited by lack of detailed error analysis
Medium-Low - Clinical relevance confidence affected by limited validation scope and absence of long-term utility assessment

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale radiologist reader study (n≥20) to assess inter-rater reliability and clinical utility across diverse institutions
2. Perform systematic error analysis comparing automated restructuring outputs against gold-standard manual restructuring to quantify hallucination rates
3. Implement longitudinal study measuring impact of structured reports on downstream clinical decision-making and workflow efficiency compared to free-text reports
