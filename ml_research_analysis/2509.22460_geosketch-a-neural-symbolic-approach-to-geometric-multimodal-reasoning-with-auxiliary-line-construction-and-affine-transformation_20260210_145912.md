# GeoSketch: A Neural-Symbolic Approach to Geometric Multimodal Reasoning with Auxiliary Line Construction and Affine Transformation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.22460
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22460
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: GeoSketch addresses geometric multimodal reasoning through dynamic diagram manipulation using auxiliary line construction and affine transformations, showing that smaller specialized models can outperform larger general-purpose models on complex visuospatial tasks.

## Executive Summary
GeoSketch presents a novel neural-symbolic framework for geometric multimodal reasoning that enables dynamic manipulation of diagrams through auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. The system employs a three-tier architecture (perception, symbolic reasoning, and sketch action) to iteratively process and update geometric diagrams in a closed loop. The approach demonstrates that interactive tools and specialized reasoning capabilities can significantly improve performance on geometric problems compared to static perception methods.

## Method Summary
GeoSketch implements a three-tier neural-symbolic architecture for geometric reasoning. The system uses supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 expert-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with symbolic rewards. The framework enables dynamic diagram manipulation through auxiliary line construction and affine transformations, allowing iterative problem-solving. A new GeoSketch Benchmark of 390 geometry problems requiring dynamic manipulation was created for evaluation, testing the system's ability to handle complex visuospatial reasoning tasks that require diagram updates during problem-solving.

## Key Results
- Improved stepwise reasoning accuracy compared to static perception methods
- Higher problem-solving success rates on the GeoSketch Benchmark
- Demonstrated that smaller, specialized models with interactive tools can outperform larger general-purpose models on geometric reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning and interactive sketch capabilities. The three-tier architecture allows the model to perceive geometric diagrams, reason about spatial relationships, and take actions to modify the diagram through auxiliary constructions or transformations. This closed-loop approach enables the model to handle problems that require dynamic diagram updates, which static perception methods cannot address effectively.

## Foundational Learning
- Neural-symbolic integration: Why needed - combines pattern recognition with logical reasoning; Quick check - verify symbolic components can interface with neural outputs
- Dynamic diagram manipulation: Why needed - many geometric problems require auxiliary constructions; Quick check - test with problems requiring multiple construction steps
- Reinforcement learning with symbolic rewards: Why needed - aligns learning with geometric reasoning objectives; Quick check - validate reward function captures correct reasoning patterns
- Expert trajectory curation: Why needed - provides quality training data for complex spatial reasoning; Quick check - assess diversity and coverage of curated examples
- Multimodal reasoning: Why needed - integrates visual and symbolic information for geometric problem-solving; Quick check - evaluate performance on mixed-modality problems

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Perception -> Symbolic Reasoning -> Sketch Action -> Diagram Update -> Perception (closed loop)

**Critical Path:** The core reasoning pipeline processes diagram input through perception modules, applies symbolic reasoning to determine required actions, executes sketch modifications (auxiliary lines or transformations), and updates the diagram state for the next iteration.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Uses smaller specialized models instead of larger general-purpose models, trading broad capability for domain-specific efficiency and accuracy in geometric reasoning tasks.

**Failure Signatures:** May struggle with problems requiring complex auxiliary constructions beyond training distribution, could fail on highly abstract geometric concepts, and might have difficulty generalizing to unseen diagram configurations.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test on basic geometry problems without auxiliary constructions to establish baseline performance, 2) Evaluate with progressively complex auxiliary line requirements, 3) Assess performance on affine transformation-only problems versus combined manipulation tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding scalability of expert-curated trajectory approaches, the effectiveness of symbolic reward functions in capturing all geometric reasoning nuances, the representativeness of the new benchmark across the full spectrum of geometric challenges, and the need for more comprehensive ablation studies to isolate contributions of specific features like auxiliary line construction and affine transformations.

## Limitations
- Reliance on expert-curated trajectories (2,000 examples) raises scalability concerns for broader problem types
- Uncertainty about the symbolic reward function's ability to capture all geometric reasoning nuances
- Limited understanding of how well the benchmark represents the full spectrum of geometric reasoning challenges
- Need for more comprehensive comparisons with larger models across diverse problem types

## Confidence
- High confidence in the architectural design and three-tier framework description
- Medium confidence in the training methodology and its effectiveness
- Medium confidence in the benchmark's representativeness and evaluation results
- Low confidence in the scalability claims and generalization to unseen problem types

## Next Checks
1. Test the model's performance on geometry problems not requiring auxiliary constructions to assess the specific value added by this feature
2. Conduct ablation studies removing either auxiliary line construction or affine transformations to quantify their individual contributions
3. Evaluate the model on a diverse set of geometry problems beyond the GeoSketch Benchmark to assess real-world generalization capabilities
