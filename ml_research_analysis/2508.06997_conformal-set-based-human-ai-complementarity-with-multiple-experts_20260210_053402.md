# Conformal Set-based Human-AI Complementarity with Multiple Experts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06997
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06997
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Conformal-set-based greedy expert selection achieves 98.48% accuracy on CIFAR-10H, statistically significantly better than ALL HUMANS (p<0.001)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of selecting the most relevant human experts for multiclass classification when only certain experts are relevant for each data sample. The authors propose a greedy algorithm that uses conformal prediction sets to guide expert subset selection, identifying which experts are most likely to choose labels within the conformal set. The approach leverages historical expert performance patterns (confusion matrices) to make instance-specific selections that outperform naive approaches like selecting all humans or random subsets.

## Method Summary
The method combines conformal prediction with expert subset selection through a three-stage process. First, conformal prediction sets are constructed using a pre-trained classifier and calibration data to narrow the label space for each instance. Second, confusion matrices are estimated from expert predictions on estimation data to capture each expert's conditional success probabilities within conformal sets. Third, a greedy algorithm selects the optimal expert subset by identifying experts whose likelihood ratios for the pseudo-label exceed 1, then applies majority voting on the selected experts' predictions constrained to the conformal set.

## Key Results
- On CIFAR-10H dataset with 5 experts, greedy selection achieves 98.48% accuracy, significantly better than ALL HUMANS (95.26%) and RANDOM SUBSET (93.71%)
- On ImageNet-16H dataset, the method maintains effectiveness even with only 6 experts, achieving ~92% accuracy
- Conformal-set-based selection outperforms top-k set predictor baselines, demonstrating superior guidance for human subset selection
- Performance degrades with insufficient calibration data (<200 samples), where greedy selection no longer significantly outperforms ALL HUMANS

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Conformal prediction sets improve multi-expert classification accuracy by narrowing the decision space while maintaining coverage guarantees.
- **Mechanism:** A pre-trained classifier computes conformal scores; the conformal predictor constructs a prediction set C(x) satisfying P[y ∈ C(x)] ≥ 1-α. Experts then select from this reduced label set rather than the full label space Y. The algorithm uses the normalized confusion matrix restricted to C(x) to estimate each expert's conditional success probability, enabling instance-specific expert selection.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-trained classifier has reasonably high accuracy and calibration data is well-distributed across classes; experts make independent predictions conditioned on the conformal set.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Decision support systems are designed to assist human experts in classification tasks by providing conformal prediction sets derived from a pre-trained model." [Section 3.2] "The constructed set C(x_test) can be established based on any pre-trained classifier f̂ without relying on any distributional assumptions about the data."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Greedy expert subset selection based on conformal-set-restricted confusion matrices outperforms naive approaches by identifying instance-specific expert relevance.
- **Mechanism:** For each test instance, the algorithm
