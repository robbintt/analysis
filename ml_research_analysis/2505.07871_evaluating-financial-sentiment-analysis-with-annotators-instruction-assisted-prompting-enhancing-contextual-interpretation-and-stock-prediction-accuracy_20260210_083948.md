# Evaluating Financial Sentiment Analysis with Annotators Instruction Assisted Prompting: Enhancing Contextual Interpretation and Stock Prediction Accuracy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.07871
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07871
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AIAP prompt incorporating annotator instructions improves LLM financial sentiment classification accuracy by up to 9.08%

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of subjective sentiment annotations in financial sentiment analysis benchmarks by introducing AIAP, a prompt that incorporates annotators' instructions into LLM evaluation. AIAP aligns machine interpretations with human-defined sentiment classes, improving model performance significantly (up to 9.08% accuracy gain) on a new WallStreetBets dataset. The approach also introduces a confidence-score-based sentiment-indexing method (CSBS) that enhances stock price prediction when used as an additional feature. Results show consistent performance gains across multiple models (FinGPT, Llama3, GPT-4) and demonstrate the value of context-aware prompting in both sentiment classification and financial applications.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces the Annotator Instruction Aware Prompt (AIAP) that incorporates human annotators' guidelines directly into LLM evaluation prompts for financial sentiment analysis. This approach addresses the subjectivity problem in sentiment annotations by ensuring models interpret text according to the same criteria humans used when labeling the data. The authors also develop a Confidence-Score-Based Sentiment (CSBS) indexing method that uses LLM confidence scores to refine sentiment classification. To evaluate these methods, they construct a new WallStreetBets (WSB) dataset from Reddit discussions, providing diverse and challenging financial text examples. The study tests the approach across multiple models including FinGPT, Llama3, and GPT-4, and extends validation to stock price prediction tasks using the enhanced sentiment features.

## Key Results
- AIAP improves sentiment classification accuracy by up to 9.08% compared to standard prompting approaches
- CSBS methodology enhances stock price prediction when used as an additional feature alongside traditional models
- Performance gains are consistent across multiple models including FinGPT, Llama3, and GPT-4

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by explicitly incorporating the subjective guidelines that human annotators used when labeling sentiment data. Financial text often contains context-dependent sentiment where the same phrase can have different meanings based on surrounding context or domain knowledge. By providing LLMs with the same interpretive framework humans used, AIAP reduces the mismatch between human and machine sentiment understanding. The CSBS method leverages the inherent confidence calibration in LLMs to create more nuanced sentiment signals, using confidence score thresholds to distinguish between clear and ambiguous sentiment cases.

## Foundational Learning

**Financial Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding how language conveys market sentiment in financial contexts. Why needed: Forms the core domain for applying LLM improvements. Quick check: Can identify bullish vs bearish sentiment in financial news.

**Large Language Model Prompting**: Engineering effective prompts to guide LLM outputs. Why needed: AIAP is a specialized prompting technique requiring understanding of prompt engineering principles. Quick check: Can design prompts that elicit specific sentiment interpretations.

**Confidence Calibration**: Understanding how LLMs express certainty in their predictions. Why needed: CSBS relies on confidence scores to refine sentiment classification. Quick check: Can interpret and utilize LLM confidence scores effectively.

**Stock Price Prediction**: Using sentiment features as inputs for financial forecasting models. Why needed: Evaluates the practical utility of improved sentiment analysis. Quick check: Can incorporate sentiment features into prediction models and measure performance impact.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: WallStreetBets Data Collection -> AIAP Prompt Construction -> Sentiment Classification -> CSBS Confidence Filtering -> Stock Prediction Model

**Critical Path**: The sentiment classification pipeline (AIAP -> Sentiment Classification -> CSBS) is the critical path, as improvements here directly impact downstream stock prediction performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades increased prompt complexity (through AIAP) for improved accuracy. CSBS introduces an additional filtering step that may reduce coverage but increases precision. The WallStreetBets dataset provides rich, diverse data but may have domain-specific characteristics that limit generalizability.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when annotator instructions are ambiguous or contradictory, confidence score thresholds are poorly calibrated leading to excessive filtering, or when applying the approach to financial text domains significantly different from WallStreetBets discourse.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test AIAP with a simplified version of annotator instructions to identify which guidance elements are most critical
2. Compare CSBS performance using different confidence score thresholds to find optimal calibration
3. Evaluate the approach on a traditional financial news corpus to assess cross-domain applicability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The WallStreetBets dataset represents a single domain with potentially idiosyncratic linguistic patterns that may not transfer to broader financial text corpora
- The CSBS approach relies on confidence score thresholding requiring domain-specific calibration
- Stock price prediction evaluation covers only a limited time window (6 months) and focuses on S&P 500 constituents

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core finding that incorporating annotator instructions improves LLM sentiment classification accuracy, supported by consistent performance gains across multiple models and clear quantitative improvements (9.08% accuracy increase)
- Medium confidence in the CSBS methodology's effectiveness for stock prediction, as results show improvement but depend on parameter tuning and the relatively short evaluation period
- Medium confidence in the generalizability of the WallStreetBets dataset approach, given the unique characteristics of social media financial discourse compared to traditional financial text sources

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the AIAP approach on traditional financial news corpora and regulatory filings to assess cross-domain robustness beyond social media text

2. Conduct longer-term stock prediction validation (minimum 2-3 years) across multiple market regimes to test the stability of CSBS-enhanced models during different economic conditions

3. Perform ablation studies removing individual annotator instructions to quantify which guidance elements contribute most significantly to performance improvements, and test whether instruction-aware prompting transfers across different sentiment classification frameworks
