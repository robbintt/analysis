- Agents learn to avoid terminal states using fear-based intrinsic rewards without explicit negative feedback

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a fear-based intrinsic reward mechanism for reinforcement learning agents that helps them avoid dangerous or terminal states without explicit negative feedback. The approach uses a Siamese Memory-Augmented Neural Network (SMANN) that learns from state sequences rather than single states, inspired by social fear conditioning. The SMANN architecture processes both image sequences and vector representations through a Siamese LSTM controller, enabling comparison of behaviors through cosine similarity. Experiments in the MiniGrid Sidewalk environment demonstrate that the proposed method successfully avoids non-descriptive terminal conditions while solving the task, achieving 0.769 ± 0.060 extrinsic reward compared to PPO's failure to solve the environment.

## Method Summary
The SMANN architecture processes sequences of states using a Siamese LSTM controller that compares current behavior encodings with stored dangerous behaviors via cosine similarity. During training, the network is presented with a dataset of state sequences leading to terminal states (danger) and non-danger sequences. The intrinsic reward is computed as the probability of dangerous behavior multiplied by a β-value, but only applied when similarity exceeds a threshold. The agent uses PPO with this combined reward signal. The method is tested on MiniGrid Sidewalk, where the agent must navigate to a goal while avoiding non-descriptive terminal states.

## Key Results
- SMANN successfully avoids non-descriptive terminal conditions while solving the task in MiniGrid Sidewalk
- Threshold-gating produces different behaviors analogous to anxiety disorders: low thresholds cause over-avoidance (GAD-like), high thresholds allow more risk-taking
- The approach achieves 0.769 ± 0.060 extrinsic reward compared to PPO's failure to solve the environment
- Low-shot vicarious learning works with only 38 danger and 38 non-danger sequences for training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Behavior Sequence Comparison via Siamese Memory-Augmented Networks
Storing and comparing multi-step state sequences enables the agent to recognize dangerous trajectories before reaching terminal states. The SMANN encodes sequences using a Siamese LSTM controller that processes image sequences alongside prior reads and controller state, shifting memory comparison from single-state matching to trajectory-level matching.

### Mechanism 2: Threshold-Gated Intrinsic Punishment
A controllable threshold on the fear classifier output produces a spectrum of risk behaviors analogous to anxiety disorders. The intrinsic reward is computed as bad_behavior_prob × β_value, but only applied when similarity exceeds a threshold. Low thresholds trigger punishment for weak matches, producing GAD-like over-avoidance.

### Mechanism 3: Low-Shot Vicarious Learning from Parent Demonstrations
Agents learn to avoid terminal states without direct experience by memorizing a small set of demonstrated dangerous behaviors. During training, SMANN is presented with β_parent—a dataset of state sequences leading to terminal states, plus non-danger sequences—learning to classify behaviors via cross-entropy loss over ~300 epochs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)**
  - Why needed here: The Miniworld Sidewalk environment is a POMDP where the agent's observation does not fully describe the environment state, requiring memory to maintain belief states.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a standard Markov policy fails when observations don't uniquely identify states?

- **Concept: Memory-Augmented Neural Networks (MANNs)**
  - Why needed here: SMANN builds on neural Turing machine-style external memory with read/write heads for low-shot storage and retrieval of behavior representations.
  - Quick check question: How does a MANN's differentiable memory access differ from a standard LSTM's hidden state?

- **Concept: Intrinsic Rewards in Reinforcement Learning**
  - Why needed here: The fear-based signal is internally generated (not from environment) and shapes exploration without modifying the extrinsic reward function.
  - Quick check question: What problem does intrinsic motivation solve in sparse-reward environments?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input (image sequence) → Siamese LSTM Controller → Encoding → Memory Read Heads → Cosine Similarity → Softmax Classifier → Intrinsic Reward (if > threshold) → PPO Update

- **Critical path:**
  1. Collect parent demonstration dataset (danger vs. non-danger behavior sequences)
  2. Train SMANN classifier on β_parent for 300 epochs
  3. Freeze SMANN, initialize PPO agent
  4. During RL: at each step, SMANN evaluates recent state sequence against memory
  5. If similarity > threshold, apply intrinsic reward = probability × β_value
  6. PPO updates on combined reward signal

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Threshold setting: Low = safer but potentially frozen behavior; High = more exploration but higher death risk
  - Memory size: M=128 locations with N=40 dimensions. Larger memory may capture more behaviors but increases query cost
  - Sequence length: 3-step sequences. Longer sequences capture more context but require more demonstrations

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Agent never reaches goal, maximum episode length every time → threshold too low (over-avoidance)
  - Agent frequently hits terminal states → threshold too high or demonstration coverage insufficient
  - High variance in intrinsic rewards across seeds → random spawn positions cause inconsistent danger proximity
  - SMANN training loss plateaus high → insufficient demonstration diversity or network capacity

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline sanity check: Run PPO without SMANN on Sidewalk—confirm it never finds the goal
  2. Threshold sweep: Train SMANN once, then run PPO+SMANN with thresholds at [0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.95]. Measure episode length and goal-reaching rate
  3. Demonstration ablation: Reduce β_parent from 38 to 10 samples per class. Observe whether avoidance degrades gracefully or collapses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can the misalignment between the agent's feature extractor and the SMANN feature extractor be resolved to ensure consistent state recall and inhibition?
- **Open Question 2:** How does incorporating adaptive trust values (κ) for non-parental peers alter the agent's ability to filter unreliable danger information compared to the static parental assumption?
- **Open Question 3:** Does the intrinsic fear reward improve sample efficiency and goal discovery when paired with off-policy algorithms or those possessing stronger exploration paradigms than PPO?

## Limitations

- The demonstration dataset is artificially constructed rather than derived from real-world demonstrations, limiting generalization testing
- The specific architectural details of the Siamese gate and exact parameter values (β-Value magnitude, sequence buffer size) are underspecified
- The approach has only been tested in one controlled MiniGrid environment with limited demonstration coverage

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The threshold-gating mechanism producing anxiety-like behavioral spectrum (GAD vs. resilience profiles)
- **Medium confidence:** The core claim that behavior sequence comparison via SMANN enables effective avoidance of non-descriptive terminal states
- **Low confidence:** The claim that this approach generalizes to diverse real-world environments with complex danger patterns

## Next Checks

1. **Demonstration Coverage Test:** Systematically reduce the number of parent demonstrations from 38 to 10, 5, and 2 per class to measure degradation in avoidance performance and identify minimum effective demonstration size
2. **Novel Danger Generalization:** Create a variant of Sidewalk with new terminal conditions not present in the original demonstration dataset to test whether SMANN can generalize learned danger patterns or requires retraining
3. **Architectural Ablation:** Replace the Siamese LSTM controller with a standard LSTM while keeping all other components constant to isolate the contribution of sequence-level comparison versus standard recurrent processing
