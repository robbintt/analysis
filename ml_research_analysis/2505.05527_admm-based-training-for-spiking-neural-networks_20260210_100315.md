# ADMM-Based Training for Spiking Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.05527
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05527
- Reference count: 19
- Achieves ~98.6% accuracy on N-MNIST for single hidden layer, but performance degrades with deeper architectures

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) approach for training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), addressing the non-differentiability challenge of the Heaviside step function. The authors formulate SNN training as an optimization problem and relax hard constraints into soft penalties, deriving closed-form updates for weights, membrane potentials, and spikes. The method successfully trains shallow SNNs without surrogate gradients, achieving high accuracy on N-MNIST, though performance degrades with deeper architectures.

## Method Summary
The ADMM-based optimizer formulates SNN training as an optimization problem where the spiking dynamics are expressed through equality constraints. The method splits the problem using ADMM by introducing auxiliary variables for spikes and membrane potentials. Closed-form updates are derived for weight matrices, membrane potentials, and spike variables through minimization of the augmented Lagrangian. The non-differentiability of the Heaviside function is handled via a dedicated subroutine with if-else logic, avoiding the need for surrogate gradients. The approach alternates between updating weights, potentials, and spikes until convergence.

## Key Results
- Achieves ~98.6% accuracy on N-MNIST with a single hidden layer
- Performance degrades with increasing depth (e.g., 3-layer networks show lower accuracy)
- Method is scalable and suitable for federated learning applications
- Avoids surrogate gradient methods through ADMM's handling of non-differentiability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ADMM approach works by decomposing the non-convex SNN training problem into tractable subproblems. By introducing auxiliary variables for spikes and potentials, the method transforms the original problem into a constrained optimization that can be solved through alternating minimization. The key innovation is the direct handling of the Heaviside function's non-differentiability through discrete if-else logic in the spike update step, rather than approximating gradients. This allows for exact updates of the spiking variables while maintaining the overall optimization framework.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)**
   - Why needed: Provides a framework for decomposing complex optimization problems into simpler subproblems
   - Quick check: Verify understanding of ADMM's split-variable and multiplier update steps

2. **Spiking Neural Network Dynamics**
   - Why needed: Understanding how spikes propagate through layers via membrane potential accumulation
   - Quick check: Can you trace a spike's journey from input to output through membrane potential updates?

3. **Augmented Lagrangian Optimization**
   - Why needed: The core mechanism for handling equality constraints in the ADMM formulation
   - Quick check: Understand how penalty parameters control constraint satisfaction vs. objective minimization

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input -> Membrane Potential Update -> Spike Update -> Weight Update -> (loop back)

**Critical Path:** The weight update step is most critical as it directly affects learning; membrane potential update drives spike generation which controls information flow.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Fixed hyperparameters vs. adaptive tuning (simpler but potentially suboptimal); simplified spiking model vs. biological realism (faster computation but limited expressiveness).

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation with depth suggests architectural sensitivity; poor convergence may indicate suboptimal penalty parameter settings.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test convergence behavior on a 2-layer network with varying penalty parameters
2. Compare accuracy vs. iteration count for different network depths
3. Evaluate sensitivity to initial weight conditions and random seeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper highlights several areas for future work, including the need for adaptive hyperparameter tuning of ADMM penalty parameters to improve performance across different architectures. The authors also suggest investigating Anderson acceleration to speed up convergence. Additionally, they note the need for extensive validation of federated learning claims through experiments with distributed training scenarios and heterogeneous client data distributions.

## Limitations

- Performance significantly degrades with deeper architectures (3+ layers), raising scalability concerns
- Fixed hyperparameters may limit adaptability to different datasets and network configurations
- Federated learning suitability claims lack experimental validation
- Simplified spiking model may not capture complex temporal dynamics

## Confidence

- **High**: The mathematical formulation of ADMM for SNN training and the handling of non-differentiability via if-else logic are sound.
- **Medium**: The experimental results on N-MNIST for shallow networks are reproducible, but deeper network performance claims need validation.
- **Low**: Claims about federated learning suitability lack experimental validation and require further investigation.

## Next Checks

1. Test the algorithm on deeper SNN architectures (3+ hidden layers) with various configurations to verify scalability limitations.
2. Implement adaptive hyperparameter tuning for the ADMM penalty parameters and compare with fixed values.
3. Validate federated learning claims by simulating distributed training scenarios with heterogeneous client data distributions.
