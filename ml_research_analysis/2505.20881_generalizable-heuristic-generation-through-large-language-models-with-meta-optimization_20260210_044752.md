# Generalizable Heuristic Generation Through Large Language Models with Meta-Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20881
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20881
- Authors: Yiding Shi; Jianan Zhou; Wen Song; Jieyi Bi; Yaoxin Wu; Jie Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: MoH achieves state-of-the-art performance on TSP and BPP, outperforming traditional heuristics and existing LLM-based approaches, especially in cross-size settings.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MoH, a novel framework that leverages large language models to iteratively refine meta-optimizers for generating generalizable heuristics in combinatorial optimization problems. The approach uses self-invocation of LLMs to evolve diverse optimizers that can then produce effective heuristics across various problem sizes and settings. Through a multi-task training scheme, MoH demonstrates superior performance on classic COPs like TSP and BPP, with claims of improved cross-size generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
MoH employs a meta-optimization framework where large language models are used to construct and refine meta-optimizers through iterative self-invocation. These meta-optimizers then generate diverse heuristics for downstream combinatorial optimization tasks. The framework uses a multi-task training approach to enhance generalization across different problem sizes and settings. The core innovation lies in the autonomous evolution of optimizers that can explore broader heuristic search spaces while maintaining interpretability of the generated solutions.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on classic combinatorial optimization problems (TSP and BPP)
- Demonstrates superior cross-size generalization compared to traditional heuristics and existing LLM-based approaches
- Generates interpretable meta-optimizers incorporating diverse optimization strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a self-improving loop where LLMs generate meta-optimizers that in turn produce better heuristics. Through iterative refinement and multi-task training, the system learns to balance exploration of the heuristic space with exploitation of known good strategies, resulting in more generalizable solutions.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM-based meta-optimization**: Understanding how language models can be used to generate and refine optimization algorithms
  - *Why needed*: Traditional heuristic development is manual and problem-specific
  - *Quick check*: Verify that the LLM can generate syntactically correct optimization code

- **Self-invocation mechanism**: Comprehending how LLMs can recursively improve their own outputs
  - *Why needed*: Enables autonomous refinement without human intervention
  - *Quick check*: Confirm that successive iterations produce progressively better results

- **Multi-task training for generalization**: Understanding how training on multiple problem instances improves cross-domain performance
  - *Why needed*: Prevents overfitting to specific problem instances
  - *Quick check*: Test performance across varying problem sizes and types

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM Meta-Optimizer Generator -> Heuristic Generator -> Combinatorial Optimizer -> Performance Evaluator -> Feedback Loop

**Critical Path**: LLM meta-optimizer generation → Heuristic generation → Problem solving → Performance evaluation → Meta-optimizer refinement

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances between exploration of new heuristic strategies and exploitation of proven approaches, with the multi-task training scheme providing regularization against overfitting while maintaining solution quality.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential issues include LLM hallucination of invalid optimization strategies, convergence to local optima in the meta-optimizer space, and computational inefficiency due to iterative refinement cycles.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify basic heuristic generation capability on small TSP instances
2. Test self-invocation refinement on a single problem type
3. Evaluate multi-task training effectiveness across different problem sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework heavily relies on specific LLM architectures (particularly GPT-4), raising reproducibility concerns
- Evaluation limited to two benchmark problems (TSP and BPP) with limited exploration of other combinatorial optimization domains
- Computational efficiency and scalability of the iterative meta-optimization process are not adequately addressed

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The conceptual framework of using LLMs for meta-optimizer generation is well-articulated and technically sound.

**Medium confidence**: The claimed performance improvements over existing methods, particularly in cross-size generalization settings.

**Low confidence**: The scalability of the approach to more complex, real-world optimization problems beyond the tested benchmarks.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain generalization testing**: Evaluate MoH's performance on a broader range of combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., vehicle routing, scheduling, graph coloring) to validate the framework's claimed generalizability beyond TSP and BPP.

2. **Computational efficiency analysis**: Conduct detailed measurements of the meta-optimization process's runtime and resource requirements across different problem scales, comparing against traditional heuristic development approaches.

3. **Interpretability validation study**: Implement a systematic evaluation of the generated meta-optimizers' interpretability, including expert review of the heuristic structures and their practical implementation feasibility in real optimization systems.
