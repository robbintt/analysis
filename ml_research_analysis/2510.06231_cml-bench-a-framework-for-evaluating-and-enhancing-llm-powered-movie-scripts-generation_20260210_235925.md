# CML-Bench: A Framework for Evaluating and Enhancing LLM-Powered Movie Scripts Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.06231
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06231
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Base LLMs underperform human-written scripts, but CML-Instruction significantly improves quality across nine interpretable metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating and improving LLM-generated movie scripts, which often lack the emotional depth and narrative coherence of human-written screenplays. The authors introduce CML-Bench, a comprehensive framework with nine interpretable metrics across three core dimensions: Dialogue Coherence, Character Consistency, and Plot Reasonableness. They also develop CML-Instruction, a structured prompting strategy to guide LLMs in generating higher-quality scripts. Experiments show that base LLMs underperform compared to human-written scripts, but with CML-Instruction, their performance significantly improves across all metrics. The results align with human preferences, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both evaluation and generation of cinematic content.

## Method Summary
The framework combines interpretable metrics across three dimensions (Dialogue Coherence, Character Consistency, and Plot Reasonableness) with a structured prompting strategy (CML-Instruction). The nine metrics provide granular assessment of script quality, while the instruction strategy guides LLMs through specific requirements for cinematic storytelling. The approach addresses the challenge that current LLMs produce generic, formulaic content lacking human emotional depth. By providing explicit guidance on narrative structure and character development, the framework enables more sophisticated script generation that better aligns with human creative standards.

## Key Results
- Base LLMs significantly underperform human-written scripts across all nine evaluation metrics
- CML-Instruction improves script quality across all metrics compared to base LLMs
- Human preference studies validate that the framework's evaluations align with human judgments of script quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by providing LLMs with explicit structural guidance that mimics human creative processes. CML-Instruction breaks down the complex task of scriptwriting into manageable components with clear requirements for each dimension. This structured approach compensates for LLMs' tendency to generate generic content by enforcing consistency in character behavior, logical plot progression, and coherent dialogue. The interpretable metrics allow for targeted improvements rather than vague quality assessments, enabling iterative refinement of generated scripts.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM script generation limitations**: Understanding why base models produce formulaic content is crucial for developing effective evaluation and enhancement strategies
- **Interpretable metrics design**: Creating measurable, actionable criteria for creative content evaluation requires balancing quantitative assessment with qualitative judgment
- **Structured prompting techniques**: Effective prompt engineering for complex creative tasks involves decomposing the process into specific, enforceable components
- **Human preference alignment**: Ensuring automated evaluations correlate with human creative standards validates the framework's practical utility
- **Narrative coherence assessment**: Developing methods to evaluate logical plot progression and character consistency in generated text
- **Dialogue quality measurement**: Establishing criteria for evaluating conversational realism and character voice differentiation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** CML-Instruction -> LLM Generation -> CML-Bench Evaluation -> Human Preference Validation

**Critical Path:** The evaluation pipeline flows from structured prompts through generation to multi-dimensional assessment, with human validation providing the ultimate quality benchmark.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes interpretability and human alignment over purely statistical evaluation methods, sacrificing some automation efficiency for more actionable feedback.

**Failure Signatures:** Scripts that pass individual metric thresholds but fail holistic human assessment indicate gaps in the metric design or weighting system.

**First Experiments:**
1. Generate baseline scripts using standard prompts to establish performance floor
2. Apply CML-Instruction to the same LLMs and compare metric improvements
3. Conduct human preference studies comparing CML-enhanced scripts with both baseline and human-written content

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas for future research emerge from the work, including extending the framework to other creative domains, exploring genre-specific adaptations, and investigating the integration of real-time feedback during generation.

## Limitations
- The evaluation framework relies on manually curated metrics and human preferences, which may not generalize across different script genres or cultural contexts
- The dataset used for evaluation is not explicitly described in terms of size or diversity, raising questions about potential biases in the assessment
- The improvement from CML-Instruction shows promise but is based on comparisons with base LLMs rather than a broader range of existing script generation approaches

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Base LLMs underperform human-written scripts compared to the proposed framework | High |
| CML-Instruction improves script quality across all metrics | Medium-High |
| Generalizability of findings to other script types or languages | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the framework on scripts from diverse genres and cultural contexts to test generalizability
2. Compare CML-Instruction against a wider range of existing script generation approaches to establish relative performance
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the individual contribution of each metric in the evaluation framework
