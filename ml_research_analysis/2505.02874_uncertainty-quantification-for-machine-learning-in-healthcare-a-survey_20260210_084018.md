# Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.02874
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02874
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey analyzing UQ methods across healthcare ML pipeline stages with proposed framework for systematic uncertainty management

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic analysis of uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods across the machine learning pipeline for healthcare applications. The authors identify a critical gap in how uncertainty is evaluated and integrated across different pipeline stages, particularly in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Through review of recent literature, they categorize UQ methods by domain, dataset, and task, analyzing their integration into each stage of the ML pipeline. The study emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to uncertainty management that addresses sources of uncertainty at each pipeline stage to ensure robust and interpretable AI systems in clinical settings.

## Method Summary
This is a systematic survey paper analyzing UQ methods across healthcare ML pipelines (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation). The authors reviewed 94 open-source clinical datasets including MIMIC-III/IV, ACDC, CAMUS, ISIC, BraTS, EyePACS, and ChestX-ray8 across cardiology, oncology, and neurology domains. The survey recommends standardized evaluation metrics including calibration (ECE, Brier scores), OOD detection, selective prediction/deferral rates, and task performance (AUC, F1, accuracy). The paper reviews 7 primary UQ techniques—Bayesian Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes, Deep Ensembles, Evidential Deep Learning, Conformal Prediction, Monte Carlo Dropout, and Bayesian Deep Ensembles—with qualitative trade-offs but no unified implementation details.

## Key Results
- Identified gap in systematic evaluation of UQ methods across different pipeline stages, particularly in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- Proposed structured framework guiding researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable UQ techniques to enhance reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of ML-driven healthcare solutions
- Highlighted most popular UQ techniques used in healthcare: Bayesian neural networks, ensemble methods, and evidential deep learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Uncertainty-Guided Deferral for Safety
- Claim: Explicit quantification of uncertainty may allow clinical systems to defer ambiguous or high-risk predictions to human experts, thereby potentially reducing critical errors.
- Mechanism: By distinguishing between high-confidence predictions (low entropy) and low-confidence predictions (high epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty), the system can trigger a "human-in-the-loop" protocol specifically when the model lacks sufficient knowledge or data quality.
- Core assumption: Clinicians can accurately interpret uncertainty metrics (e.g., variance, confidence intervals) and use them to adjust decision thresholds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Abstract] Mentions enhancing "reliability, safety, and trust" by guiding practitioners in selecting suitable techniques.
  - [Section 1] States that robust UQ diagnostics help clinicians "distinguish between predictions made with high confidence and those with substantial ambiguity."
  - [Section 2.3] Discusses "selective prediction" where uncertain cases are deferred to improve clinical decision-making.
- Break condition: If the uncertainty estimates are poorly calibrated (e.g., overconfident on errors), deferral mechanisms may either trigger too often (alert fatigue) or fail to trigger on critical errors.

### Mechanism 2: Pipeline-Stage Error Isolation
- Claim: Integrating UQ methods specifically at the data processing, training, and evaluation stages may prevent the propagation and compounding of errors throughout the model lifecycle.
- Mechanism: Instead of treating uncertainty solely as a post-hoc score, the framework applies targeted techniques at each stage—label correction at the data level, robust loss functions at training, and conformal prediction at evaluation—to mitigate specific sources of uncertainty (noise vs. distribution shift).
- Core assumption: Uncertainty sources are decomposable and primarily originate at distinct stages of the pipeline, allowing for localized intervention.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Abstract] Proposes a framework highlighting how methods are "integrated into each stage of the ML pipeline."
  - [Section 3] Warns that current fragmentation leads to "uncertainty propagation and compounded errors."
  - [Section 2.1-2.3] Details specific UQ roles: "label handling" in preprocessing, "loss modification" in training, and "post-hoc calibration" in evaluation.
- Break condition: If uncertainty is holistic and cannot be neatly isolated to one stage (e.g., data noise masquerading as model uncertainty), stage-specific interventions may be ineffective.

### Mechanism 3: Distribution-Shift Detection via Epistemic Uncertainty
- Claim: Estimating epistemic uncertainty (model ignorance) may enable the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, flagging scenarios where the model is operating outside its training domain.
- Mechanism: Methods like Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) or Deep Ensembles produce higher variance in predictions when facing inputs distinct from the training data, signaling that the learned representation is insufficient for the new input.
- Core assumption: The relationship between input distribution novelty and predictive variance holds true for the specific clinical domain and data modality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.3] Notes that epistemic uncertainty estimation is "highly effective" for OOD detection in contexts like radiotherapy.
  - [Section 3] Identifies OOD detection as a core component of the proposed standardized evaluation framework.
  - [Section 1] Highlights that variations in clinical environments (distribution drift) affect performance.
- Break condition: If the model is overconfident on OOD data (a known failure mode in some architectures), epistemic uncertainty metrics will fail to rise, rendering detection mechanisms useless.

## Foundational Learning

- **Aleatoric vs. Epistemic Uncertainty**
  - Why needed here: The paper fundamentally categorizes UQ based on the source of uncertainty (data noise vs. model ignorance). Selecting the right method depends on distinguishing these two.
  - Quick check question: Does the method require more data to reduce uncertainty (Epistemic), or is the uncertainty inherent to the data itself (Aleatoric)?

- **Calibration (ECE & Brier Score)**
  - Why needed here: The survey emphasizes that raw predictive confidence is often miscalibrated. Understanding calibration metrics is necessary to evaluate if a model's "90% confidence" actually corresponds to 90% accuracy.
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts a disease with 0.8 probability, does the disease actually occur 80% of the time in the validation set?

- **The Inference-Time vs. Train-Time Trade-off**
  - Why needed here: The paper reviews methods like BNNs (slow inference, high fidelity) vs. Evidential Deep Learning (single-pass, faster). System architects must choose based on clinical latency requirements.
  - Quick check question: Can the clinical workflow tolerate the computational overhead of Monte Carlo sampling or ensemble aggregation during inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Layer (Label Handling, Noise Reduction) -> Model Layer (Bayesian Layers, Ensembles, Evidential Heads) -> Evaluation Layer (Calibration Metrics, Confidence Intervals, OOD Detectors)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Profile Uncertainty Source: Determine if the clinical problem suffers more from noisy labels (Data stage) or domain shift (Eval stage).
  2. Select Method: Map the source to a technique (e.g., MC Dropout for domain shift, Label Probabilities for noisy data).
  3. Standardize Evaluation: Report calibration (ECE) and OOD performance alongside standard accuracy metrics.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Computational Cost vs. Reliability: Bayesian Neural Networks offer principled uncertainty but are computationally intensive; Evidential Deep Learning is efficient but may require complex regularization to avoid overconfidence.
  - Generality vs. Specificity: Ensemble methods are generally robust but lack a Bayesian theoretical foundation; Conformal Prediction offers statistical guarantees but relies on exchangeability assumptions.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Overconfidence on Noise: Model outputs high confidence (low variance) on clearly noisy or OOD inputs.
  - Alert Fatigue: Excessive false positives from OOD detectors, causing clinicians to ignore warnings.
  - Metric Disconnect: High task performance (Accuracy/AUC) but poor calibration (high ECE), leading to misleading clinical confidence.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline Calibration Check: Train a standard deterministic model and measure Expected Calibration Error (ECE) on a held-out test set to quantify the "overconfidence" problem.
  2. MC Dropout Implementation: Add dropout at inference time to estimate epistemic uncertainty; evaluate if high uncertainty correlates with incorrect predictions.
  3. Ensemble vs. Single Model: Compare the reliability (calibration curves) of a Deep Ensemble against a single model to visualize the variance-reduction benefit.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can a unified pipeline-oriented framework be developed to systematically manage uncertainty propagation across data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages in healthcare?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state that current UQ is applied in isolation and call for a "unified pipeline-oriented approach" to manage uncertainty holistically.
- Why unresolved: Current research fragments UQ by stage (mostly training), leading to uncertainty propagation and compounded errors that are rarely analyzed end-to-end.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive framework that successfully tracks and mitigates uncertainty flow from raw data inputs through to final clinical inference.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can stratified uncertainty analyses be systematically implemented to ensure consistent model reliability across diverse demographic subgroups in clinical settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that current UQ methods often lack systematic evaluations across diverse groups and calls for future work to prioritize stratified uncertainty analyses to mitigate bias.
- Why unresolved: Most existing datasets and evaluation metrics aggregate performance, masking disparities in model confidence across age, sex, and ethnicity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating that UQ methods can reveal discrepancies in model confidence and maintain reliability across specific protected subgroups.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific combination of metrics (task performance, human-machine interaction, calibration, and OOD detection) should constitute a standardized evaluation framework for clinical UQ?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose a framework comprising four core components and emphasize the need for standardized assessment to address inconsistent evaluation protocols across the field.
- Why unresolved: The field currently lacks a unified benchmark, leading to inconsistent reporting where many studies overlook calibration (e.g., ECE) or OOD robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: The adoption of a standardized benchmark suite that mandates reporting performance, selective prediction accuracy, calibration errors, and OOD detection rates simultaneously.

## Limitations
- Method Integration Specificity: While the survey identifies gaps in systematic UQ evaluation, it does not provide a unified implementation pipeline, leaving the practical integration of multi-stage UQ methods open to user interpretation.
- Clinical Threshold Ambiguity: The paper recommends task-specific safety thresholds for uncertainty-based deferral but does not define concrete numerical values, which are domain-dependent and critical for clinical deployment.
- Computational Overhead Trade-offs: The survey qualitatively discusses computational costs of BNNs vs. efficient methods like EDL but does not quantify these trade-offs in a healthcare-specific context.

## Confidence
- Uncertainty-Guided Deferral Safety: High confidence in the theoretical safety benefit, but real-world effectiveness depends heavily on uncertainty calibration and clinician interpretation. **Confidence: Medium**
- Pipeline-Stage Error Isolation: The framework's validity relies on the assumption that uncertainty sources are decomposable; if this is not true, targeted interventions may fail. **Confidence: Medium**
- Distribution-Shift Detection: The claim is well-supported for specific architectures (e.g., BNNs), but overconfidence on OOD data remains a known failure mode. **Confidence: Medium**

## Next Checks
1. **Calibration Validation**: Measure Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier scores on a clinical dataset (e.g., ISIC 2018) for both baseline and UQ-enhanced models to quantify improvement in reliability.
2. **OOD Detection Testing**: Evaluate epistemic uncertainty metrics (e.g., MC Dropout variance) on cross-domain samples (e.g., ISIC vs. ChestX-ray8) to verify detection of distribution shifts.
3. **Clinical Threshold Definition**: Collaborate with domain experts to establish uncertainty thresholds for deferral decisions, ensuring they align with known annotation disagreements and clinical safety requirements.
