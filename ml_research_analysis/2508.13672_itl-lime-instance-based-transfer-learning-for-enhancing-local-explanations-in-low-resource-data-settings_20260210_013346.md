# ITL-LIME: Instance-Based Transfer Learning for Enhancing Local Explanations in Low-Resource Data Settings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.13672
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13672
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Instance-based transfer learning improves LIME explanation fidelity and stability in low-resource data settings by replacing synthetic perturbations with real source domain instances and using contrastive learning-based proximity weighting.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the instability and low fidelity of local explanations in LIME when applied to low-resource data settings. The authors propose ITL-LIME, a framework that leverages instance-based transfer learning to improve explanation quality. Instead of generating random perturbations, ITL-LIME retrieves real instances from a related source domain that are most similar to the target instance, combines them with neighboring target instances, and uses a contrastive learning-based encoder to assign proximity-based weights to these combined instances. Experimental results on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate that ITL-LIME significantly improves both the fidelity and stability of LIME explanations compared to baseline methods, achieving up to 9.6% higher AUC and 100% stability (Jaccard Coefficient) across multiple runs.

## Method Summary
ITL-LIME modifies LIME's sampling and weighting pipeline by replacing synthetic perturbations with real instances from a related source domain. The method uses K-medoids clustering to partition the source domain into clusters with real data points as centroids. For each target instance, the nearest label-consistent source centroid is identified, and its member instances are retrieved as transfer candidates. These are combined with neighboring target instances and weighted using a contrastive learning-based encoder (SCARF) that computes proximity weights based on latent embeddings. The weighted instances are then used to train a local surrogate model. The framework assumes source and target domains share feature and label spaces but differ in input distribution, allowing relevant transfer instances to approximate the target's local decision boundary better than random perturbations.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 9.6% higher AUC compared to baseline LIME methods
- Achieved 100% stability (Jaccard Coefficient) across multiple runs
- Outperformed LIME, D-LIME, and A-LIME on real-world healthcare datasets including Diabetes and Student Depression
- Ablation studies confirmed the contribution of each component, with F1 dropping from 0.8963 to 0.8247 when encoder weighting was removed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Replacing synthetic perturbations with real source domain instances improves explanation fidelity in low-resource settings.
- **Mechanism:** K-medoids clustering partitions the source domain into K clusters with real data points as centroids. For each target instance, the nearest label-consistent source centroid is identified, and its member instances are retrieved as transfer candidates. This avoids generating unrealistic samples that fall outside the true data manifold.
- **Core assumption:** The source domain shares feature and label spaces with the target domain (X_S = X_T, Y_S = Y_T) but differs in input distribution. Relevant transfer instances exist that approximate the target's local decision boundary better than random perturbations.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Instead of generating random perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance."
  - [section 3.1] "K-medoids ensures that the clusters are actual data points from the dataset, which is especially important in applications requiring human interpretability."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support for this specific clustering-to-LIME pipeline; related work (D-LIME, A-LIME) uses clustering but without cross-domain transfer.
- **Break condition:** If source and target domains have fundamentally different decision boundaries (negative transfer), retrieved instances may mislead the surrogate model rather than improve it.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Contrastive learning-based weighting defines a more semantically meaningful locality than distance metrics in raw feature space.
- **Mechanism:** The SCARF encoder is trained on the combined source-target instance set using InfoNCE loss. It learns to bring representations of original and corrupted views closer while pushing apart different instances. Distances computed in this latent space, passed through an exponential kernel, yield proximity weights for surrogate model training.
- **Core assumption:** Semantic similarity captured by contrastive learning better reflects decision-boundary proximity than Euclidean or cosine distance in the original feature space, particularly when source and target have distributional differences.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2] "The pretrained encoder E... serves as the feature representation generator... We compute the latent embeddings of x_t and each instance in I_x_t, and measure their distances d in the embedding space."
  - [table 5] Ablation shows F1 drop from 0.8963 to 0.8247 (STD1-DNN) when encoder weighting is removed.
  - [corpus] SCARF [3] is cited as effective for tabular contrastive learning; no direct corpus validation of its use for LIME weighting.
- **Break condition:** If the combined instance set is too small or homogeneous, the encoder may fail to learn discriminative representations, yielding uninformative weights.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Combining transferred source instances with local target neighbors enriches the training set while maintaining local relevance.
- **Mechanism:** KNN identifies k neighboring target instances (I_tar). These are unioned with transferred source cluster instances (I_source_k) to form I_combined. The ratio ξ = |I_source| / |I_target| controls transfer intensity. This provides more diverse, realistic samples than target data alone while preserving locality.
- **Core assumption:** Target neighborhood alone is insufficient for surrogate training in low-resource settings; augmenting with label-consistent source instances improves boundary approximation without excessive distribution shift.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "combines them with neighboring target instances"
  - [section 4.6.2] "with ξ ratio 1:0.5, ITL-LIME achieved F1-score of 0.8257... while with a significant increase in ξ ratio to 1:1.5, F1-score dropped to 0.7084"
  - [corpus] Instance-based transfer learning literature (e.g., Asgarian et al.) supports selective source instance reweighting, but does not address LIME-specific applications.
- **Break condition:** If ξ is set too high (excessive source dominance) or source instances are insufficiently filtered, negative transfer degrades explanation quality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**
  - **Why needed here:** ITL-LIME modifies LIME's core sampling and weighting pipeline. Understanding how LIME generates perturbed samples, computes proximity weights, and fits local surrogate models is prerequisite to grasping what ITL-LIME changes.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why LIME's random perturbation strategy becomes problematic when training data is scarce?

- **Concept: Transfer Learning (Instance-Based)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper assumes familiarity with transfer learning paradigms—specifically, how source domain instances can be reweighted or selected to improve target domain performance.
  - **Quick check question:** What distinguishes instance-based transfer learning from feature-based or parameter-based approaches?

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning (Self-Supervised)**
  - **Why needed here:** ITL-LIME uses SCARF, a contrastive learning method for tabular data, to learn embeddings for proximity weighting. Understanding how InfoNCE loss and positive/negative pair construction work is necessary to follow the weighting mechanism.
  - **Quick check question:** How does contrastive learning learn representations without labeled data, and why might this be advantageous for tabular domains?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Source Clustering -> Instance Retrieval -> Target Neighborhood -> Fusion & Weighting -> Surrogate Training
- **Critical path:**
  1. Cluster source domain offline (one-time cost).
  2. For each explanation request: retrieve source cluster → identify target neighbors → fuse sets → train encoder (or use cached encoder) → compute weights → train surrogate.
  3. Explanation = surrogate coefficients (feature importance).
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **K (cluster count):** Higher K yields finer-grained source clusters but risks smaller clusters with less relevant transfer instances (paper suggests K=11–15 optimal).
  - **ξ (source-to-target ratio):** Lower ratios (1:0.5 to 1:0.75) balance transfer benefit against target locality; higher ratios risk negative transfer.
  - **Encoder training overhead:** Training SCARF per-instance is costly; Assumption: the paper does not clarify whether encoder reuse across nearby instances is feasible.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Negative transfer:** Fidelity drops below baseline LIME; source instances mislead surrogate (check if source-target label consistency is enforced).
  - **Encoder collapse:** All instances receive similar weights (check latent distance distribution; may indicate insufficient contrastive training data).
  - **Excessive locality loss:** AUC/fidelity degrades when ξ is too high (ablation confirms at ξ = 1:1.5).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Fidelity baseline comparison:** Run ITL-LIME vs. LIME, D-LIME, A-LIME on a held-out target dataset subset; measure AUC and F1 of surrogate predictions against black-box outputs.
  2. **Stability test:** Explain the same 10 target instances across 5 runs; compute Jaccard Coefficient for top-3 features to verify claimed 100% stability.
  3. **Ablation by component:** Remove encoder weighting (use raw-space distance), then remove source transfer (target-only); quantify fidelity drop per component to validate contributions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** What is the computational complexity and runtime overhead of the ITL-LIME framework compared to standard LIME in real-time applications?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that "an analysis of computational complexity and runtime overhead will be conducted to evaluate the method's practical feasibility."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study focuses entirely on explanation quality metrics (fidelity, stability) and does not benchmark the computational cost of the added clustering and contrastive learning encoder steps.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Time complexity analysis and empirical runtime comparisons against baselines on large-scale datasets.

- **Question:** How does ITL-LIME perform across a more extensive and diverse range of domain datasets outside of healthcare?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly propose to "investigate the performance impact across a more extensive and diverse domain datasets to further enhance real-world applicability."
  - **Why unresolved:** The experimental validation is currently limited to two specific healthcare scenarios (diabetes and student depression), leaving the framework's generalizability to other low-resource domains unproven.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results on non-healthcare datasets (e.g., finance or IoT) with varying data distribution shifts.

- **Question:** Can the ITL-LIME framework be adapted to handle heterogeneous transfer learning where the source and target domains do not share identical feature spaces?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 3.2 explicitly assumes that the source and target domains share the same feature space (X_S = X_T) and label space (Y_S = Y_T).
  - **Why unresolved:** In many real-world low-resource settings, the source data may have different features or labels than the target, which the current method cannot process.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified framework tested on datasets with disjoint or partially overlapping feature sets.

## Limitations
- Framework's effectiveness critically depends on source-target domain similarity; negative transfer may degrade explanations if source clusters don't align with target decision boundaries
- Computational expense of SCARF encoder training per-instance is not addressed; encoder reuse across similar target instances is unclear
- Assumes label consistency is enforceable but unclear whether this uses true or predicted labels, which is crucial in real-world low-resource settings

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Fidelity and stability improvements over baseline LIME methods (supported by multiple datasets and ablation studies)
- **Medium Confidence:** The proposed weighting mechanism via contrastive learning improves over raw distance weighting (ablation shows drop but corpus lacks direct validation)
- **Low Confidence:** The method's robustness to negative transfer is not thoroughly tested; only one failure mode (excessive ξ) is demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. **Negative Transfer Test:** Deliberately select a source domain with known distributional shift relative to the target; measure fidelity degradation to quantify robustness
2. **Encoder Reuse Efficiency:** Cache and reuse SCARF encoders for neighboring target instances; measure fidelity trade-off versus computational savings
3. **Label Consistency Clarification:** Implement both true-label and predicted-label consistency filtering; compare explanation quality to determine practical applicability in test-time scenarios
