# Taming the Titans: A Survey of Efficient LLM Inference Serving
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.19720
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19720
- Reference count: 30
- This paper surveys efficient large language model (LLM) inference serving methods, addressing challenges from massive parameters and high attention mechanism computational demands that hinder low latency and high throughput.

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive survey addresses the critical challenges of serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently in production environments. As LLMs grow to billions of parameters with massive attention mechanisms, serving them with low latency and high throughput becomes increasingly difficult. The paper systematically organizes a wide range of optimization techniques across multiple levels - from instance-level optimizations to cluster-level strategies, emerging scenarios, and miscellaneous considerations like hardware and privacy.

The survey identifies key bottlenecks including the KV cache management overhead, heterogeneous resource utilization, and the computational intensity of attention mechanisms. It presents solutions ranging from novel scheduling algorithms and disaggregated architectures to specialized approaches for long-context processing, retrieval-augmented generation, and mixture-of-experts models. The work serves as a valuable roadmap for practitioners and researchers navigating the complex landscape of LLM inference optimization.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a hierarchical organization approach to survey efficient LLM inference serving methods. It categorizes techniques across four main dimensions: instance-level optimizations (model placement, request scheduling, decoding length prediction, KV cache management, PD disaggregation), cluster-level strategies (heterogeneous GPU deployment, load balancing, cloud-based solutions), emerging scenarios (long context, RAG, MoE, LoRA, speculative decoding, augmented LLMs, test-time reasoning), and miscellaneous areas (hardware, privacy, simulator, fairness, energy). The survey draws from 30 references spanning multiple research papers and practical implementations, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLM serving optimization.

## Key Results
- PagedAttention achieves near-zero space waste in KV cache management through innovative memory management
- Skip-Join MLFQ scheduling effectively prioritizes shorter requests to improve overall system responsiveness
- Disaggregated prefill-decoding architectures enable better resource utilization and improved throughput
- Dynamic batch management and semantic-aware cache reuse techniques significantly reduce computational overhead
- Model offloading to CPU/GPU hybrid systems provides flexible resource allocation for varying workload demands

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The efficiency gains stem from addressing fundamental bottlenecks in LLM inference: massive parameter counts create memory pressure, attention mechanisms require quadratic computations, and sequential decoding limits parallelization. By optimizing cache management (PagedAttention), intelligent scheduling (Skip-Join MLFQ), and disaggregated architectures, the methods reduce memory waste, prioritize high-value requests, and enable parallel processing. These optimizations work synergistically - better cache management reduces memory pressure, enabling more efficient scheduling, while disaggregated architectures allow specialized hardware to handle different inference phases optimally.

## Foundational Learning
**KV Cache Management**: Stores key-value pairs from attention mechanisms to avoid recomputation during decoding; essential for efficient inference but creates memory pressure that must be optimized.

**Attention Mechanism**: Computes relationships between all token pairs, creating quadratic computational complexity; understanding its memory and compute requirements is crucial for optimization.

**Batching Strategies**: Grouping multiple requests improves GPU utilization but introduces latency trade-offs; dynamic batch management adapts to workload patterns.

**Disaggregation**: Separating prefill and decoding phases allows specialized hardware and optimization strategies for each phase, improving overall efficiency.

**Scheduling Algorithms**: Request prioritization affects latency distribution and system throughput; advanced schedulers like Skip-Join MLFQ optimize for specific performance metrics.

**Model Parallelism**: Distributing model parameters across multiple devices addresses memory limitations but introduces communication overhead that must be managed.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Client Requests -> Request Scheduler -> Batch Manager -> Model Parallelism Layer -> KV Cache Manager -> Attention Mechanism -> Decoding Layer -> Response Generator

**Critical Path**: Request scheduling and batch formation directly impact latency; KV cache management affects memory utilization and computational efficiency; attention mechanism computation is the primary computational bottleneck.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Low latency vs. high throughput (smaller batches reduce latency but hurt throughput); memory efficiency vs. computational overhead (aggressive caching saves compute but increases memory pressure); hardware specialization vs. flexibility (dedicated hardware for specific phases improves performance but reduces adaptability).

**Failure Signatures**: Memory exhaustion from KV cache bloat; scheduling starvation from poor request prioritization; performance cliffs from batch size misconfiguration; communication bottlenecks from model parallelism overhead.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline latency and throughput measurements with standard batching and KV cache management
2. Performance comparison of different scheduling algorithms under varying request patterns
3. Memory utilization profiling with and without PagedAttention under sustained workloads

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The survey focuses primarily on methods published before mid-2024, potentially missing recent developments in advanced quantization and novel hardware accelerators
- The organization may not fully capture interdependencies between instance-level and cluster-level optimizations in real production environments
- Practical deployment challenges and operational costs for smaller organizations are not extensively discussed

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Characterization of fundamental challenges (massive parameters, attention mechanism demands) is well-established
**Medium confidence**: Effectiveness claims for specific methods like PagedAttention and Skip-Join MLFQ may vary by workload and configuration
**Medium confidence**: Categorization of emerging scenarios reflects current trends but relative importance may shift

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical benchmarking comparing surveyed optimization techniques across diverse workload patterns and model sizes
2. Investigate practical deployment challenges and operational costs in production environments, especially for smaller organizations
3. Analyze energy efficiency and environmental impact of different LLM serving optimization strategies beyond latency and throughput metrics
