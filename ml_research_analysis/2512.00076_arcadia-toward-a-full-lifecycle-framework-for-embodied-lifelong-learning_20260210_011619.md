# Arcadia: Toward a Full-Lifecycle Framework for Embodied Lifelong Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00076
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00076
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 7.07% improvement on navigation and 11.08% on manipulation benchmarks while enabling real-world deployment with 46% navigation and 27% manipulation task completion rates versus 13% and 9% for baselines

## Executive Summary
Arcadia introduces a closed-loop lifecycle framework for embodied lifelong learning that addresses the fundamental limitation of static, siloed approaches in robotics. The framework integrates four key stages: autonomous data collection in real environments, generative scene reconstruction for editable simulation assets, a shared multimodal architecture unifying navigation and manipulation, and real-world feedback incorporation into simulation. By closing the real-to-sim-to-real loop, Arcadia enables continuous policy and asset refinement. The framework demonstrates that tightly coupling real experience, generative simulation, and shared representations supports lifelong improvement and generalization in embodied agents.

## Method Summary
Arcadia establishes a closed-loop embodied learning framework that spans the entire lifecycle from real-world data collection to policy deployment. The system begins with autonomous exploration in real environments to gather diverse interaction data, which is then used to generate realistic simulation assets through generative scene reconstruction. A shared multimodal architecture learns unified representations for both navigation and manipulation tasks, enabling knowledge transfer between skill domains. Critically, the framework incorporates real-world feedback back into the simulation loop, creating a continuous improvement cycle. This integration of real experience, generative simulation, and shared representations enables agents to improve their capabilities over time while maintaining strong generalization across different task types and environments.

## Key Results
- Achieves 7.07% improvement on navigation benchmarks and 11.08% on manipulation benchmarks
- Transfers robustly to physical robots, completing 46% of navigation tasks versus 13% for baselines
- Completes 27% of manipulation tasks on physical robots versus 9% for baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from closing the real-to-sim-to-real loop, which enables continuous policy refinement through real-world feedback. The generative scene reconstruction creates editable simulation assets that bridge the domain gap between real and simulated environments. The shared multimodal architecture allows knowledge transfer between navigation and manipulation tasks, improving generalization. By maintaining tight coupling between real experience collection, simulation generation, and policy learning, Arcadia creates a self-improving system that adapts to new scenarios over time.

## Foundational Learning
- **Embodied lifelong learning**: Continuous improvement of agent capabilities over extended deployment periods
  - Why needed: Static training approaches cannot adapt to new environments and tasks encountered in real-world deployment
  - Quick check: Measure task completion rates over time to verify continuous improvement

- **Generative scene reconstruction**: Creating editable simulation assets from real-world data
  - Why needed: Domain gap between real and simulated environments limits policy transfer
  - Quick check: Compare policy performance on generated vs. real environments

- **Multimodal representation learning**: Learning unified representations across different sensory modalities and task types
  - Why needed: Enables knowledge transfer between navigation and manipulation skills
  - Quick check: Measure performance gains when fine-tuning across task types

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Real Environment -> Data Collection -> Generative Reconstruction -> Simulation Environment -> Shared Multimodal Architecture -> Policy Training -> Real-World Deployment -> Feedback Loop

Critical path: Data Collection -> Generative Reconstruction -> Policy Training -> Real-World Deployment

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes continuous improvement and generalization over peak performance on specific tasks, trading some immediate efficiency for long-term adaptability.

Failure signatures: Poor performance typically indicates domain gaps between generated simulations and real environments, or insufficient diversity in collected real-world data.

Three first experiments:
1. Evaluate navigation policy performance on a simple indoor environment before and after incorporating real-world feedback
2. Test manipulation policy transfer from simulation to physical robot on basic object interaction tasks
3. Measure knowledge transfer between navigation and manipulation tasks using the shared multimodal architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Reliance on simulated environments may not fully capture real-world complexity despite generative reconstruction
- Reported task completion rates (46% navigation, 27% manipulation) indicate significant room for improvement in physical deployment
- Framework effectiveness depends on quality and diversity of generated simulation assets matching real environments

## Confidence
High: Benchmark improvements (7.07% navigation, 11.08% manipulation) and core concept of real-to-sim-to-real loop
Medium: Framework's ability to generalize across diverse real-world scenarios beyond tested benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Arcadia's performance across a wider range of environmental conditions and task types, including stress tests with novel scenarios not present in the training data
2. Conduct long-term deployment studies to assess the framework's lifelong learning capabilities over extended periods, measuring degradation or improvement in task completion rates
3. Compare Arcadia's simulation-generated assets against professionally designed simulation environments to quantify the impact of generative reconstruction quality on policy performance
