# KU AIGEN ICL EDI@BC8 Track 3: Advancing Phenotype Named Entity Recognition and Normalization for Dysmorphology Physical Examination Reports

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.09744
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09744
- Reference count: 10
- Achieved exact extraction and normalization F1 score 2.6% higher than challenge mean

## Executive Summary
This study presents a comprehensive approach for extracting and normalizing phenotype named entities from dysmorphology physical examination reports to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. The system employs a two-stage pipeline combining named entity recognition (NER) using fine-tuned ChatGPT and W2NER models with named entity normalization (NEN) leveraging SapBERT embedding, BioSyn synonym marginalization, and HPO-specific pre-fine-tuning (PhenoSapBERT). The approach achieved significant performance improvements over baseline methods, demonstrating 2.6% higher exact extraction and normalization F1 score compared to the challenge mean, with particular success in handling discontinuous entities and diverse surface forms common in clinical documentation.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage pipeline for phenotype entity extraction and normalization. First, named entity recognition is performed using fine-tuned ChatGPT and W2NER models to identify phenotype mentions in dysmorphology reports. Second, named entity normalization converts these extracted entities to standardized HPO terms using a combination of SapBERT embedding similarity, BioSyn synonym marginalization, and a pre-fine-tuned model (PhenoSapBERT) specifically trained on HPO terminology. The system addresses challenges including discontinuous entities, diverse surface forms, and ambiguity in phenotype mentions through this multi-component approach.

## Key Results
- Achieved exact extraction and normalization F1 score 2.6% higher than the challenge mean
- Normalization-only F1 score exceeded average by 1.9%
- Pre-fine-tuning contributed 1.39% F1 improvement and fine-tuning added 6.20% F1 gain
- Successfully handled discontinuous entities and diverse surface forms in clinical reports

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from combining multiple complementary approaches for both entity recognition and normalization. Fine-tuning large language models like ChatGPT allows adaptation to the specific language patterns and entity structures found in dysmorphology reports. The normalization stage benefits from multiple strategies: SapBERT provides semantic embedding similarity for candidate generation, BioSyn handles synonym marginalization to capture variant surface forms, and HPO-specific pre-fine-tuning (PhenoSapBERT) improves matching accuracy for domain-specific terminology. This multi-strategy approach addresses the inherent ambiguity and variability in clinical language.

## Foundational Learning
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities in text - needed to extract phenotype mentions from clinical reports; quick check: verify model correctly identifies "short stature" as phenotype entity
- Named Entity Normalization (NEN): Mapping extracted entities to standardized ontology terms - needed to convert diverse clinical expressions to HPO terms; quick check: confirm "short height" maps to correct HPO term
- SapBERT embedding similarity: Using biomedical embeddings for semantic matching - needed for candidate generation in normalization; quick check: test similarity between "short stature" and "decreased body height"
- Pre-fine-tuning on domain-specific data: Adapting general models to specialized terminology - needed to improve HPO term matching accuracy; quick check: evaluate performance improvement on HPO-specific test set

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
NER models (ChatGPT, W2NER) -> Entity extraction -> Normalization pipeline (SapBERT -> BioSyn -> PhenoSapBERT)

Critical Path:
The critical path flows from entity recognition through the multi-stage normalization pipeline. Entity extraction quality directly impacts normalization performance, as incorrect or missed entities cannot be normalized. The normalization pipeline's three components work sequentially: SapBERT generates candidate HPO terms through semantic similarity, BioSyn refines candidates through synonym matching, and PhenoSapBERT provides final selection using HPO-specific fine-tuning.

Design Tradeoffs:
The system trades computational complexity for improved accuracy by using multiple normalization strategies in sequence rather than selecting a single best-performing method. This approach increases runtime and resource requirements but captures different aspects of the normalization challenge. The choice of fine-tuning ChatGPT versus using specialized biomedical models represents a tradeoff between leveraging general language understanding and domain-specific optimization.

Failure Signatures:
Primary failure modes include entity extraction errors (missing or incorrect entities), semantic ambiguity where multiple HPO terms are equally similar, and handling of rare or novel phenotypes not well-represented in training data. The system may struggle with highly context-dependent phenotype descriptions or when clinical language significantly deviates from training examples.

First Experiments:
1. Test entity extraction accuracy on a held-out set of dysmorphology reports with known phenotype mentions
2. Evaluate normalization accuracy using synthetic test cases with known HPO mappings
3. Conduct ablation study removing each normalization component (SapBERT, BioSyn, PhenoSapBERT) to quantify individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions or areas for future research beyond the presented work.

## Limitations
- Performance improvements, while statistically meaningful, are relatively modest (1.9-2.6% above challenge mean), suggesting potential ceiling effects
- Reliance on pre-existing HPO mappings and pre-fine-tuned models may limit generalization to other phenotype ontologies or clinical domains
- Ablation study lacks granularity in isolating the impact of combining multiple normalization strategies versus using them independently
- System performance on truly unseen clinical reports or rare phenotypes remains unverified

## Confidence

High confidence: The technical implementation details and ablation study methodology are sound and reproducible

Medium confidence: The performance improvements are real but may be overestimated due to potential dataset overlap or evaluation artifacts

Medium confidence: The claims about handling discontinuous entities and diverse surface forms are supported but need broader validation

## Next Checks

1. Test the system on an independent corpus of dysmorphology reports not used in any training or development phase to assess true generalization

2. Conduct a head-to-head comparison of the combined normalization approach versus each component (SapBERT, BioSyn, pre-fine-tuning) used independently

3. Evaluate performance on rare phenotypes and reports from different medical centers to assess robustness across clinical variation
