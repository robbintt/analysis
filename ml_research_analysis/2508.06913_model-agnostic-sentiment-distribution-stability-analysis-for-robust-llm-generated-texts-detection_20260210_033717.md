# Model-Agnostic Sentiment Distribution Stability Analysis for Robust LLM-Generated Texts Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.06913
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06913
- **Reference count:** 7
- **Key outcome:** Introduces SentiDetect, a model-agnostic LLM detection framework using sentiment distribution stability metrics, achieving over 16% and 11% F1 score improvements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613 respectively across five diverse datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SentiDetect, a novel model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated text by analyzing sentiment distribution stability. The method leverages the observation that LLM outputs exhibit more emotionally consistent patterns compared to human-written text, which shows greater variability. SentiDetect employs two unsupervised metrics - sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment distribution preservation - to capture stability under sentiment-altering and semantic-preserving transformations. The framework demonstrates strong performance across five diverse datasets and multiple LLMs, with particular effectiveness against paraphrasing and adversarial attacks.

## Method Summary
SentiDetect operates by analyzing how sentiment distributions change under two types of text transformations. The framework first applies sentiment-altering transformations (Low-Emotional Rewriting) to measure sentiment distribution consistency, then applies semantic-preserving transformations to measure sentiment distribution preservation. These metrics capture the inherent stability of LLM-generated text, which tends to maintain more consistent emotional patterns compared to human writing. The method is model-agnostic, requiring no model-specific training or fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable across different detection scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieved over 16% F1 score improvement on Gemini-1.5-Pro compared to baseline methods
- Demonstrated 11% F1 score improvement on GPT-4-0613 detection
- Showed strong robustness to paraphrasing, adversarial attacks, and text length variations across five diverse datasets including News, HumanEval, Student Essay, Paper Abstract, and Yelp Review

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits a fundamental difference in how LLMs and humans generate text: LLMs produce outputs with more stable sentiment distributions due to their training on uniformly curated corpora, while human writing exhibits greater emotional variability. This stability manifests consistently across different types of transformations, making it a reliable detection signal. The two-metric approach captures both emotional invariance under sentiment alteration and distribution preservation under semantic-preserving transformations, providing complementary signals that enhance detection accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sentiment Distribution Consistency:** Measures how stable sentiment remains under emotional transformations. Needed to capture the emotional invariance of LLM outputs. Quick check: Compare sentiment variance before/after Low-Emotional Rewriting on human vs LLM text.
- **Sentiment Distribution Preservation:** Evaluates sentiment stability under semantic-preserving transformations. Needed to detect the inherent emotional consistency in LLM outputs even when meaning is preserved. Quick check: Measure sentiment change after paraphrasing on both text types.
- **Model-Agnostic Detection:** Framework operates without requiring access to model parameters or specific training. Needed for broad applicability across different LLM detection scenarios. Quick check: Test framework on unseen LLM models not used during development.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Text Input -> Low-Emotional Rewriting -> Sentiment Distribution Consistency -> Semantic-Preserving Transformation -> Sentiment Distribution Preservation -> Fusion/Merging -> Detection Output

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves applying both transformation types to the input text, computing the two stability metrics, and then combining them for final detection. The sentiment analysis component is crucial as it directly impacts metric computation accuracy.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The unsupervised nature offers deployment flexibility but sacrifices the adaptive learning capabilities of supervised approaches. The two-metric system provides complementary information but adds computational overhead compared to single-metric approaches.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation may occur with domain-specific writing that exhibits stable sentiment patterns (like marketing copy), or when sentiment analysis tools are compromised by adversarial text designed to manipulate sentiment detection.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test SentiDetect on academic writing samples to assess performance on technically-oriented text
2. Evaluate against advanced adversarial attacks specifically targeting sentiment distribution manipulation
3. Measure the relative contribution of SDC vs SDP metrics through ablation studies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the observed sentiment distribution stability stem primarily from model architecture, specific training corpora, or alignment techniques like RLHF?
- Basis in paper: The authors hypothesize that stability "likely stems from the nature of LLM training, which involves exposure to vast, uniformly curated corpora," but do not isolate the cause.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes the existence of the stability phenomenon empirically across different models but does not conduct ablations on the training process to verify the source of this invariance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments where identical architectures are trained on datasets with controlled emotional variability, or comparisons between base models and their instruction-tuned/aligned counterparts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of SentiDetect scale when applied to non-English languages or culturally distinct sentiment expressions?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates exclusively on English datasets (News, Yelp, etc.) using English-specific prompts for Low-Emotional Rewriting (LER), leaving cross-lingual effectiveness unexplored.
- Why unresolved: Sentiment expression and "objectivity" norms vary significantly by language and culture; the LER prompts may not induce the same distribution shifts in non-English texts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the SentiDetect framework on multilingual benchmarks (e.g., multilingual XSum or WikiLingua) using translated or culture-specific LER prompts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can a non-linear fusion of Sentiment Distribution Consistency (SDC) and Sentiment Distribution Preservation (SDP) yield significant performance gains over the individual metrics?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention that "combining SDC and SDP into a unified metric has been explored, [but] the performance gain was marginal and reduced interpretability."
- Why unresolved: The authors report only marginal gains, implying the combination strategy (likely simple concatenation or averaging) may not have captured complex interactions between the two metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments utilizing a learned classifier (e.g., a shallow MLP) to fuse SDC and SDP features, analyzed against the current threshold-based approach.

## Limitations
- The method may produce false positives when applied to human writing styles that exhibit stable sentiment patterns, such as marketing copy or technical documentation
- Performance could be affected by sophisticated adversarial attacks specifically designed to manipulate sentiment distribution patterns
- The unsupervised nature of the approach means it cannot adapt or learn from feedback to evolving LLM generation patterns over time

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core methodology and experimental validation
- **Medium confidence** in the generalizability across all writing domains
- **Medium confidence** in robustness to adversarial attacks based on current evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Test SentiDetect's performance on additional domain-specific corpora (e.g., academic writing, creative fiction) to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate the method against advanced adversarial attacks that specifically target sentiment distribution manipulation
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the relative contribution of sentiment distribution consistency versus preservation metrics to overall detection performance
