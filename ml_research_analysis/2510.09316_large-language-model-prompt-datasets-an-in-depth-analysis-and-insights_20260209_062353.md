# Large Language Model Prompt Datasets: An In-depth Analysis and Insights
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09316

- Primary result: First comprehensive taxonomy of 129 LLM prompt datasets with linguistic analysis and a novel syntactic-centroid-based prompt optimization method

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive taxonomy of 129 large language model (LLM) prompt datasets, categorized by source, content, attributes, and target applications. The authors perform detailed linguistic analysis on seven representative datasets, revealing domain-specific patterns such as medical prompts using more adjectives and specific terminology versus business prompts favoring concise imperatives. They propose a novel prompt optimization method that leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures to identify centroid representations of effective prompts and guide LLMs to rewrite prompts toward these centroids, demonstrating improved meaningfulness and quality of LLM outputs in case studies.

## Method Summary
The research methodology involves three main components: dataset compilation and taxonomy creation (129 datasets), multi-level linguistic analysis (lexical, syntactic, semantic) of seven representative datasets, and a novel prompt optimization approach. For linguistic analysis, the authors use spaCy for dependency parsing and POS tagging, Sentence-BERT for semantic embeddings, and TF-IDF for domain term extraction. The optimization method computes centroids from syntactic embeddings of high-performing prompts and uses LLM rewriting guided by deviation analysis. Case studies demonstrate the method's ability to correct incorrect model responses through syntactic alignment.

## Key Results
- Taxonomy of 129 LLM prompt datasets categorized by source, content, attributes, and applications
- Domain-specific linguistic patterns identified: medical prompts use more adjectives (0.11 ratio) and specific terminology versus business prompts favoring concise imperatives
- Novel syntactic-centroid-based prompt optimization method successfully corrected incorrect model responses in case studies (e.g., seating problem: 10080 vs. 5040)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Syntactic embeddings of POS and dependency structures may capture structural regularities associated with effective prompts.
- Mechanism: Prompts are parsed into POS tags and dependency relations; these are embedded into vectors and averaged to form a centroid representing syntactic patterns of high-performing prompts.
- Core assumption: Effective prompts share learnable syntactic structures that generalize within a domain or task category.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...prompt optimization approach that leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures."
  - [section] §6 describes centroid construction from POS and dependency embeddings and guided rewriting.
  - [corpus] Related work (e.g., GAAPO, Diverse Prompts) explores structured or evolutionary prompt optimization; direct empirical validation of syntactic centroid methods is limited.
- Break condition: If syntactic patterns are not stable across domains or tasks, the centroid may not transfer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Aligning prompts toward a syntactic centroid can improve meaningfulness and quality of LLM responses.
- Mechanism: For a target prompt, its deviation from the centroid is computed; a rewrite plan is generated to reduce this deviation, and an LLM rewrites the prompt accordingly.
- Core assumption: Closer alignment to the centroid increases the likelihood of eliciting correct or more meaningful responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach successfully corrected initial incorrect model responses in case studies, demonstrating improved meaningfulness and quality of LLM outputs."
  - [section] Figure 5 shows a case where optimized prompt led to correct answer (10080 vs. 5040).
  - [corpus] Neighboring papers (e.g., Promptware Engineering, Diverse Prompts) suggest structured prompt manipulation can affect performance, but rigorous causal evidence is limited.
- Break condition: If task semantics dominate over syntax, syntactic alignment may not change response quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain-specific linguistic patterns (e.g., medical prompts with more adjectives) are distinguishable and may inform prompt optimization.
- Mechanism: Multi-level linguistic analysis (lexical, syntactic, semantic) reveals domain-specific distributions of POS, dependencies, and n-grams.
- Core assumption: These patterns can be used to tailor centroid definitions or rewrite strategies per domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...domain-specific linguistic patterns, such as medical prompts using more adjectives and specific terminology versus business prompts favoring concise imperatives."
  - [section] §5.3 shows higher adjective ratio in medical-o1 (0.11) and TF-IDF domain terms (e.g., "patient" in medical, "content" in business).
  - [corpus] Prompt Engineering: How Prompt Vocabulary affects Domain Knowledge explores vocabulary specificity but does not validate syntactic centroids.
- Break condition: If domain boundaries are fuzzy or prompts serve multiple domains, pattern-based optimization may misguide.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dependency parsing
  - Why needed here: Identifies grammatical relations (e.g., subject-verb, object) used to build syntactic embeddings and centroids.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify the dependency type for "quick" in "The quick brown fox"?

- Concept: Centroid clustering
  - Why needed here: Averages multiple embedding vectors to represent a central, prototypical syntactic pattern.
  - Quick check question: How does a centroid differ from a nearest-neighbor prototype?

- Concept: Prompt engineering techniques (few-shot, CoT, role-playing)
  - Why needed here: The taxonomy classifies datasets by techniques; understanding them helps contextualize centroid-based optimization.
  - Quick check question: Which technique uses "you to act as a" (found in OASST1 n-grams)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt dataset → linguistic parser (POS/dependency) → syntactic embedding → centroid computation → deviation analyzer → rewrite planner → LLM rewriter → optimized prompt
- Critical path: 1) Select representative dataset, 2) Parse prompts to extract syntactic features, 3) Compute centroid from high-performing subset, 4) Generate rewrite instructions for target prompts
- Design tradeoffs: Dataset size vs. domain specificity; embedding dimensionality; threshold for centroid membership; cost of LLM-based rewriting
- Failure signatures: 1) Centroid instability across small datasets, 2) Over-regularization losing task nuances, 3) Parse errors in informal or code-mixed prompts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce case study (e.g., seating problem) to validate centroid-driven correction
  2. Ablate features: use only POS or only dependency embeddings to measure impact
  3. Cross-domain test: apply business-domain centroid to medical prompts to assess generalization limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent do the identified linguistic patterns (lexical, syntactic, semantic) correlate with actual LLM performance metrics like accuracy and helpfulness?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Appendix A states the authors did not leverage LLMs to analyze the impact of prompts due to task diversity, focusing instead on descriptive NLP/ML analysis.
- Why unresolved: The paper characterizes prompt structures but stops short of validating if "effective" syntactic patterns (like those in the optimization method) reliably improve model outputs across diverse tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical benchmarks measuring LLM success rates on prompts specifically modified to match or deviate from the identified centroids and linguistic patterns.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do the domain-specific linguistic patterns identified in the 7 selected datasets generalize to the broader collection of 129 datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix A notes that the "number of datasets in each category is relatively limited, which may affect the representativeness of the results."
- Why unresolved: The paper analyzed 7 datasets out of 129 collected; patterns observed in the medical and business subsets may not hold for the omitted datasets or emerging data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Expanding the multi-level linguistic analysis to the remaining datasets in the taxonomy to confirm statistical consistency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed syntactic centroid optimization method be integrated into adaptive quality assessment and pricing models for AI marketplaces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion suggests future work should leverage these datasets for "adaptive quality assessments and pricing models in AI prompt marketplaces."
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates a method to improve meaningfulness, it has not developed the economic or automated assessment frameworks implied by the suggestion.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework that uses syntactic deviation from centroids to automatically price or validate prompt quality in real-time systems.

## Limitations
- The paper does not specify how "high-performing prompts" are selected for centroid computation
- Limited quantitative evaluation of the optimization method's effectiveness beyond qualitative case studies
- The 7 analyzed datasets may not fully represent the broader collection of 129 datasets

## Confidence
- High confidence: The taxonomy compilation and linguistic analysis methodology (POS, dependency, TF-IDF, embedding) are clearly specified and reproducible. The domain-specific linguistic patterns (medical vs. business) are supported by quantitative evidence in the analysis.
- Medium confidence: The claim that syntactic embeddings can capture effective prompt structures is plausible based on related work, but direct empirical validation in this paper is limited to qualitative case studies.
- Low confidence: The generalizability of centroid-based optimization across diverse domains and tasks is uncertain without systematic evaluation or cross-domain testing.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic evaluation with multiple domains and tasks, measuring prompt optimization impact on LLM response accuracy using standardized benchmarks
2. Perform ablation studies comparing POS-only, dependency-only, and combined embeddings to quantify each feature's contribution to optimization effectiveness
3. Test cross-domain transfer by applying business-domain centroids to medical prompts (and vice versa) to assess robustness and generalization limits
