# Evaluating Arabic Large Language Models: A Survey of Benchmarks, Methods, and Gaps

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13430
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13430
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: First systematic review of Arabic LLM benchmarks, analyzing 40+ benchmarks across four categories and identifying critical gaps in evaluation methodology

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first systematic review of Arabic LLM benchmarks, analyzing over 40 evaluation benchmarks across NLP tasks, knowledge domains, cultural understanding, and specialized capabilities. The authors propose a comprehensive taxonomy organizing benchmarks into four categories: Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture and Dialects, and Target-Specific evaluations. Through detailed analysis of benchmark construction methods, scale considerations, and reproducibility standards, the paper reveals significant progress in benchmark diversity while identifying critical gaps including limited temporal evaluation, insufficient multi-turn dialogue assessment, and cultural misalignment in translated datasets. The work serves as a comprehensive reference for Arabic NLP researchers, providing insights into benchmark methodologies and offering recommendations for future development.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic literature review to identify Arabic LLM benchmarks, collecting metadata on 40+ benchmarks across four thematic categories. They analyzed benchmark composition (native, synthetic, or translated), size, accessibility status, and evaluation methods. The study examined three primary benchmark construction approaches - native collection, translation, and synthetic generation - discussing their trade-offs regarding authenticity, scale, and cost. The methodology included verification of benchmark accessibility, assessment of reproducibility through public dataset availability, and evaluation of quality control processes. The survey also analyzed current evaluation metrics, comparing traditional measures (BLEU, ROUGE) with LLM-as-judge approaches, and identified gaps in validation specifically for Arabic contexts.

## Key Results
- Proposed taxonomy organizes 40+ Arabic LLM benchmarks into four categories: Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture and Dialects, and Target-Specific evaluations
- Identified critical gaps including limited temporal evaluation, insufficient multi-turn dialogue assessment, and cultural misalignment in translated datasets
- Found that approximately 25% of benchmarks remain private or partially accessible, limiting reproducibility
- Demonstrated that LLM-as-judge evaluation shows strong correlation with human judgment (0.824 - 0.977) but lacks comprehensive Arabic-specific validation
- Revealed significant progress in benchmark diversity while highlighting the need for improved cultural authenticity and statistical reliability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Native Arabic benchmark collection preserves cultural authenticity that translation-based approaches lose
- Mechanism: Direct sourcing from Arabic-speaking populations captures idioms, proverbs, religious references, and dialectal nuances that machine translation systematically distorts or flattens
- Core assumption: Cultural validity requires linguistic origin in the target culture, not just surface-level language matching
- Evidence anchors: "cultural misalignment in translated datasets" identified as critical gap; "evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural nuances is essential" (Absher paper)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLM-as-judge evaluation shows strong correlation with human judgment in Arabic generative tasks when properly calibrated
- Mechanism: A capable judge model can evaluate semantic equivalence, fluency, and relevance by comparing generated output against reference responses, approximating human preference patterns
- Core assumption: Judge models trained on multilingual data transfer evaluation capabilities to Arabic without systematic bias
- Evidence anchors: "LLM-as-judge correlates more strongly with human judgments (0.824 - 0.977) than traditional metrics" (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore); most benchmarks adopting LLM-as-judge lack validation specifically in Arabic contexts

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Benchmark scale affects statistical reliability—smaller datasets produce noisier signals and increase overfitting risk
- Mechanism: With fewer samples, random variation in model predictions has larger impact on aggregate scores, and models may memorize specific patterns rather than demonstrating generalizable capability
- Core assumption: Question quality is held constant; scale effects are independent of content quality
- Evidence anchors: "small benchmarks provide weaker statistical signals and are more susceptible to overfitting"; "aggregate scores averaging across diverse benchmark sizes can be misleading if not properly weighted"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Arabic Diglossia (MSA vs. Dialects)**
  - Why needed here: Arabic has ~20 dialectal varieties that "function almost as distinct languages" (Section 1). Selecting benchmarks requires knowing which register your application targets
  - Quick check question: Does your deployment scenario require formal writing (use MSL benchmarks), conversational chat (use dialect benchmarks), or both?

- Concept: **Three Benchmark Construction Approaches (Native/Translation/Synthetic)**
  - Why needed here: The paper organizes its analysis around these three methods, each with trade-offs in authenticity vs. scale vs. cost (Abstract)
  - Quick check question: For your use case, is cultural authenticity non-negotiable (prioritize native), or is rapid prototyping more important (translation/synthetic acceptable)?

- Concept: **Evaluation Metric Selection (Traditional vs. LLM-as-Judge)**
  - Why needed here: Generative tasks like dialogue or summarization lack ground-truth references; LLM-as-judge addresses this but requires validation (Section 5.1, 8.2)
  - Quick check question: Is your task objectively scorable (MCQ, classification—use accuracy/F1) or open-ended generation (consider LLM-as-judge with human validation)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Knowledge -> General/STEM (ArabicMMLU, GATmath, AraSTEM) -> Domain-specific (ArabLegalEval, MedArabiQ, Hajj-FAQ); NLP Tasks -> Multi-task suites (LAraBench, BALSAM, ORCA, Dolphin) -> Task-specific (ARCD, TyDiQA); Culture/Dialects -> Cultural reasoning (PALM, PalmX, Jawaher) -> Dialect identification/generation (AraDiCE, AL-QASIDA, Absher); Target-Specific -> Safety (AraTrust, ASAS) -> Hallucination (AraHalluEval, Halwasa) -> RAG (ALRAGE) -> Multimodal (CAMEL-Bench, ARB)

- Critical path:
  1. Define target capability (knowledge, NLP task, culture, or safety/specialized)
  2. Filter by language register (MSA vs. dialect; geographic region if dialect)
  3. Select benchmarks with public datasets AND evaluation code (check PD/PR columns in Table 2)
  4. Validate benchmark against your model's training data to avoid contamination

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Native vs. Translated: Higher authenticity vs. lower cost; translated benchmarks may misalign culturally (Section 1)
  - Synthetic vs. Human-curated: Scalable but risks model bias/circular evaluation vs. expensive but grounded (Section 1)
  - Public vs. Private benchmarks: Reproducibility vs. contamination protection; ~25% remain private/inaccessible (Section 8.1)

- Failure signatures:
  - Cultural invalidity: Model aces translated benchmark but fails on native cultural questions (e.g., proverbs, religious context)
  - Contamination leakage: Unrealistically high scores on benchmarks that may appear in training data
  - Dialect mismatch: Strong MSA performance but poor results on target regional dialect
  - Prompt sensitivity: Performance swings based on few-shot count or prompt formality (Section 8.2)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline sweep on ArabicMMLU + one dialect benchmark (e.g., AraDiCE): Establishes MSA vs. dialect gap; both are public with evaluation code
  2. LLM-as-judge vs. human comparison on 50-100 samples from your target task: Validates whether judge correlation holds for your specific domain before scaling
  3. Contamination check: Query model on benchmark questions; if memorized, switch to blind/private test sets (Section 8.4 recommends blind sets)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Approximately 25% of benchmarks remain private or partially accessible, limiting reproducibility and independent verification
- Translation-based benchmarks show cultural misalignment risks, though quantitative measures of this misalignment are not systematically quantified
- LLM-as-judge methodology shows promise but lacks comprehensive validation specifically for Arabic contexts
- Scale effects on statistical reliability are acknowledged but not empirically tested across the surveyed benchmarks

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The taxonomy framework (Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture & Dialects, Target-Specific) is well-supported by the 40+ benchmark analysis and provides clear organizing principles. The identification of benchmark accessibility issues (25% private) is verifiable through the repository links provided.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about cultural misalignment in translated datasets are supported by theoretical arguments and identified as gaps, but lack systematic empirical measurement across benchmark pairs. The LLM-as-judge correlation claims rely on limited validation studies, particularly for Arabic-specific contexts.
- **Low Confidence**: The statistical reliability claims regarding benchmark scale effects are based on general ML methodology rather than Arabic-specific empirical studies. Claims about contamination risks from training data are plausible but not quantified across the surveyed benchmarks.

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Accessibility Verification**: For each benchmark in Table 2, attempt to access the public datasets and evaluation code through the provided repository links, documenting which remain inaccessible or incomplete.
2. **LLM-as-Judge Validation**: Conduct human evaluation comparison on 50-100 samples from 2-3 diverse Arabic benchmarks (one MCQ, one generative task) to verify the reported 0.824-0.977 correlation range holds in practice.
3. **Cultural Misalignment Quantification**: Select 3 translated benchmarks with native Arabic equivalents and design a pilot study measuring cultural reasoning differences between translated and native versions on identical question sets.
