# AGENTICT$^2$S:Robust Text-to-SPARQL via Agentic Collaborative Reasoning over Heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs for the Circular Economy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.01815
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01815
- Reference count: 7
- Multi-agent text-to-SPARQL framework achieving 17.3% higher execution accuracy over baselines

## Executive Summary
AGENTIC T2S is a modular multi-agent framework designed to generate SPARQL queries from natural language over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs). The system decomposes the task into specialized agents for subgoal parsing, schema-aware graph allocation, pattern-driven SPARQL synthesis, and dual-stage verification. Evaluated on three circular economy KGs, the framework improves execution accuracy by 17.3% and triple-level F1 by 25.4% compared to the best baseline, while reducing average prompt length by 46.4%.

## Method Summary
The framework employs five specialized agents working in sequence: a Subgoal Parser identifies query targets and constraints, a Hierarchical Alignment Allocator maps subgoals to relevant KGs using embedded metadata, a Pattern Synthesizer generates SPARQL queries based on schema-aligned patterns, and a Dual-Stage Consistency Checker validates query structure and intent. This modular design enables interpretable reasoning and leverages heterogeneous KG schemas without requiring unified schema merging.

## Key Results
- 17.3% improvement in execution accuracy over best baseline
- 25.4% increase in triple-level F1 score
- 46.4% reduction in average prompt length

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from decomposing complex text-to-SPARQL reasoning into specialized agents that handle distinct subtasks with appropriate expertise. The schema-aware graph allocation leverages metadata embeddings to efficiently route subgoals to relevant KGs, while pattern-driven synthesis ensures SPARQL queries conform to domain-specific structures. The dual-stage verification catches both syntactic errors and semantic inconsistencies that single-stage validation might miss.

## Foundational Learning
- **Agentic Reasoning**: Breaking down complex reasoning tasks into specialized agents improves accuracy by allowing each component to focus on its specific expertise. *Why needed*: Text-to-SPARQL requires multiple distinct reasoning steps that benefit from specialized approaches. *Quick check*: Can you identify the specific subtask each agent handles?

- **Schema-Aware Allocation**: Using metadata embeddings to match query subgoals with appropriate KGs enables efficient navigation of heterogeneous knowledge structures. *Why needed*: Multi-graph settings require intelligent routing to avoid brute-force search across all available graphs. *Quick check*: What metadata properties are most critical for accurate graph allocation?

- **Pattern-Driven Synthesis**: Generating SPARQL based on domain-specific patterns rather than free-form generation improves query validity and execution success. *Why needed*: SPARQL generation requires adherence to specific structural constraints that generic generation may violate. *Quick check*: How does the pattern library encode circular economy domain knowledge?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Natural Language Query -> Subgoal Parser -> Hierarchical Alignment Allocator -> Pattern Synthesizer -> Dual-Stage Consistency Checker -> SPARQL Output

**Critical Path**: The Subgoal Parser's accuracy is critical as errors propagate through subsequent agents. The Hierarchical Alignment Allocator's performance directly impacts query execution success by ensuring subgoals are routed to appropriate KGs.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Modular architecture enables interpretability and specialized optimization but introduces integration complexity and potential failure propagation between agents. The pattern-based synthesis trades flexibility for higher query validity rates.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Subgoal Parser failures manifest as incorrect query targets or missing constraints
- Allocator errors result in queries executed against wrong KGs with zero results
- Pattern Synthesizer issues produce syntactically invalid SPARQL
- Consistency Checker may over-reject valid but semantically broad queries

**First Experiments**:
1. Test Subgoal Parser on queries with nested subgoals to verify multi-level parsing capability
2. Evaluate Hierarchical Alignment Allocator with queries spanning multiple KGs to test cross-graph reasoning
3. Benchmark Dual-Stage Consistency Checker on intentionally underspecified queries to measure false rejection rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the weak-to-strong alignment strategy maintain retrieval accuracy when applied to knowledge graphs lacking the rich metadata descriptions used for the coarse-grained filtering stage?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Hierarchical Alignment Allocator relies on embedded metadata (schema summaries, domain labels) for initial candidate retrieval, but the robustness of this dependency is not tested on graphs with sparse annotations.
- Why unresolved: The experimental datasets are curated in-house and likely possess the metadata required for the weak retrieval stage, whereas open-domain graphs may not.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance evaluation on public KGs (e.g., DBpedia or Wikidata) where metadata is selectively removed or is naturally sparse.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the multi-agent architecture scale computationally to settings involving significantly larger pools of candidate knowledge graphs (e.g., >10) without excessive latency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The complexity analysis discusses parallelizability, but the empirical evaluation is restricted to a setting with only three specific knowledge graphs ($n=3$).
- Why unresolved: The overhead of managing communication between five agents across a larger graph pool could negate the efficiency gains observed in the small-scale experiment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the system's latency and allocation accuracy as the number of available heterogeneous graphs increases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the counterfactual consistency check impact the recall of valid answers for naturally ambiguous or broad natural language queries?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Dual-Stage Consistency Checker flags "semantically underspecified queries," but the paper does not report the false negative rate where valid broad queries are rejected.
- Why unresolved: A verifier designed to enforce specificity might inadvertently filter out correct but general queries, a trade-off not quantified in the results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the verifier's rejection rate on a dataset containing a controlled subset of intentionally broad or ambiguous questions.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to three circular economy KGs, constraining generalizability to other domains
- Modular architecture introduces potential failure propagation between specialized agents
- Pattern library requires substantial domain adaptation for use outside circular economy context

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Framework's modular design and quantitative improvements in execution accuracy and triple-level F1 scores are well-supported by experimental results.
**Medium Confidence**: Robustness claims over heterogeneous KGs are supported by evaluation across three distinct circular economy graphs, but generalizability to other domains remains uncertain.
**Low Confidence**: Scalability assertions for low-resource, multi-graph settings lack empirical validation beyond the specific circular economy context.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate AGENTIC T2S on knowledge graphs from unrelated domains (e.g., biomedical, financial, or cultural heritage) to assess pattern library adaptability and schema awareness across diverse ontologies.
2. Measure end-to-end latency and resource utilization under varying KG sizes and concurrent query loads to validate scalability claims for production deployment scenarios.
3. Test the framework's performance when knowledge graphs undergo incremental updates during active querying to assess robustness against evolving graph structures and schema modifications.
