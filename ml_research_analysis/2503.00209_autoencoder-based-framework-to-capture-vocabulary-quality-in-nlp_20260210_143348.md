# Autoencoder-Based Framework to Capture Vocabulary Quality in NLP

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.00209
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00209
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** Autoencoder width serves as a proxy for vocabulary quality, outperforming traditional metrics by capturing richness, diversity, and complexity while remaining length-independent.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an autoencoder-based framework that uses neural network capacity as a proxy for vocabulary quality in NLP. Traditional metrics like TTR, VOCD, and MTLD suffer from length dependency and fail to capture contextual relationships. The proposed method trains autoencoders with varying hidden layer widths and analyzes the reconstruction accuracy to determine the minimum capacity required to model a dataset's vocabulary. Validation on DIFrauD and Project Gutenberg datasets demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between vocabulary-rich and vocabulary-poor texts while remaining robust across languages and text lengths.

## Method Summary
The framework trains MLP-based autoencoders with varying hidden layer widths (64-512 neurons) and squeeze ratios (1/2 to 1/16) on tokenized text data. Using sparse categorical crossentropy loss, the model learns to reconstruct input tokens. The key insight is that datasets requiring wider autoencoders to achieve baseline accuracy (51%) contain richer, more diverse vocabularies. A "squeeze layer" bottleneck tests compressibility, revealing information density differences between historical and modern texts.

## Key Results
- Autoencoder width correlates with vocabulary richness: richer vocabularies require wider hidden layers
- Framework remains stable across text lengths (r=0.1219 correlation between accuracy and length)
- 18th-century texts require significantly greater model capacity than 20th-century texts (0.406 vs 0.663 accuracy at 1/16 squeeze ratio)
- Method successfully distinguishes deceptive text types in DIFrauD dataset based on vocabulary complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Neural network capacity acts as a proxy for vocabulary complexity. Rich datasets with diverse tokens require wider hidden layers to capture high-dimensional relationships without information loss, while repetitive text can be compressed effectively by narrow bottlenecks. Core assumption: reconstruction difficulty correlates with vocabulary quality, not just noise. Break condition: noise may falsely signal complexity if the autoencoder cannot model random patterns.

### Mechanism 2
The framework decouples quality measurement from text length. Unlike TTR which decays with length, the autoencoder learns the underlying probability distribution, making capacity requirements independent of sample size once distribution is established. Core assumption: the model converges on the distribution quickly enough that size variations don't skew capacity needs. Break condition: extremely small datasets (<50 tokens) may produce unstable measurements.

### Mechanism 3
"Squeezing" through bottleneck layers reveals information density. Texts with dense content resist compression, showing steeper accuracy drops under squeeze ratios. Historical texts maintain higher accuracy under compression than modern texts, suggesting lower redundancy and higher information density per token. Core assumption: information density differences drive compressibility variations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Autoencoders and Reconstruction Loss
  - **Why needed here:** Framework relies on interpreting reconstruction success/failure to measure vocabulary quality
  - **Quick check question:** If an autoencoder achieves 99% reconstruction accuracy on a narrow bottleneck, what does that imply about the information content of the input data?

- **Concept:** Type-Token Ratio (TTR) Saturation
  - **Why needed here:** Paper positions itself as solution to TTR's flaws in large datasets
  - **Quick check question:** Why does TTR typically decrease as the length of a text increases, even if the author uses varied vocabulary?

- **Concept:** The Manifold Hypothesis
  - **Why needed here:** Explains why neural network width serves as a metric for data complexity
  - **Quick check question:** How does the complexity of the data manifold affect the required dimensionality of the hidden layer in a neural network?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Text -> Keras Tokenizer -> Input Layer -> Hidden Layer (Variable Width) -> (Optional Squeeze Layer) -> Output Layer
- **Critical path:** Width search - sweeping hidden layer widths to find inflection point where accuracy meets threshold
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Surface-level tokenization vs. contextual embeddings (chose surface to avoid external model bias)
  - 51% threshold (beats random 50%) vs. higher thresholds (would require wider models across board)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy saturation at narrow widths suggests dataset is too simple or contains excessive duplication
  - Accuracy near 50% regardless of width indicates vocabulary exceeds training setup or low learning rate
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Create synthetic dataset with duplicated subsets to verify autoencoder width doesn't increase with row count duplication
  2. Train on 18th-century vs 20th-century English text to confirm older texts show steeper accuracy decline under compression
  3. Run TTR and autoencoder width metrics on datasets of varying lengths to confirm TTR drops while autoencoder metric remains stable

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the framework maintain effectiveness on noisy data or low-resource languages? The authors note performance in these settings remains underexplored and list extending the method as future work. Current validation used curated datasets that may not exhibit high volatility or token sparsity typical of low-resource settings.

### Open Question 2
Does incorporating contextual embeddings improve vocabulary quality evaluation compared to surface-level tokenization? The conclusion lists this as a primary avenue for future work. Current implementation uses Keras Tokenizer to avoid bias, limiting ability to capture deep semantic relationships.

### Open Question 3
Can computational overhead of training multiple autoencoder configurations be reduced for real-time applications? The limitations section notes computational overhead can challenge resource-constrained settings. Methodology requires training across varying widths and ratios, which is inherently computationally intensive.

## Limitations

- Framework's ability to distinguish richness from noise depends on autoencoder architecture, may conflate high-entropy noise with high-quality diversity
- Length-independence claim relies on specific dataset analysis; behavior on extremely short texts or skewed distributions unverified
- "Squeezing" mechanism conflates vocabulary richness with syntactic complexity and semantic density without separate controls
- Implementation details (train/test splits, input sample definition, vocabulary handling) unspecified, affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Framework distinguishes datasets with varying vocabulary diversity; traditional metrics are flawed for NLP; framework shows robustness across languages and text types

**Medium Confidence:** Framework successfully decouples vocabulary measurement from text length; historical texts show different compressibility profiles; 51% threshold provides reasonable baseline

**Low Confidence:** Neural network capacity is universal proxy for vocabulary quality across all NLP domains; squeezing specifically measures vocabulary richness rather than other linguistic features; framework generalizes to untested languages and text types

## Next Checks

**Validation Check 1:** Create synthetic datasets with controlled parameters (high/low vocabulary diversity with coherent/random text) to verify framework correctly identifies true richness while distinguishing from noise

**Validation Check 2:** Test framework on dataset spanning multiple language families to verify capacity requirements reflect genuine vocabulary complexity differences rather than language-specific biases

**Validation Check 3:** Systematically vary accuracy threshold (40%, 51%, 60%, 70%) to measure how required model widths change and determine optimal threshold calibration for different domains
