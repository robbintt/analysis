- This work introduces a spectral analysis framework for transformers that tracks algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value) over attention-induced token graphs during syntactic transformations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a training-free spectral analysis framework for transformer models that uses algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value) of attention-induced token graphs to diagnose processing patterns. The method tracks how spectral properties change across layers during syntactic transformations, particularly voice alternation tasks across 20 languages and three model families (Phi-3-Mini, Qwen2.5-7B, LLaMA-3.2-1B). The framework reveals distinct architectural signatures and correlates spectral changes with behavioral performance, validated through targeted attention head ablations. The approach generalizes beyond language tasks to reasoning strategies, demonstrating utility as a training-free diagnostic tool for architectural biases and model reliability analysis.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs token graphs from transformer attention matrices at each layer, then computes the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity) as a spectral fingerprint of processing difficulty. For voice alternation tasks, the method measures spectral disruption when models process syntactic transformations, comparing across languages and model architectures. The analysis correlates spectral signatures with behavioral accuracy and validates findings through attention head ablations. The approach is training-free, relying solely on inference-time attention patterns to diagnose model behavior and architectural biases.

## Key Results
- Phi-3-Mini shows dramatic English-specific early-layer disruption (Δλ2[2,5] ≈ -0.446) during voice alternation
- Qwen2.5-7B and LLaMA-3.2-1B display systematic but smaller spectral effects across languages
- Spectral changes correlate strongly with behavioral performance (Phi-3: r=-0.976)
- Attention head ablations validate functional relevance by recovering Fiedler values
- Framework identifies model-specific tokenizer sensitivities and generalizes to reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The spectral framework works by leveraging the mathematical properties of attention matrices as graph representations. When transformers process syntactic transformations like voice alternation, the attention patterns create specific connectivity structures in the token graph. The Fiedler value captures the algebraic connectivity of these structures, with lower values indicating increased processing difficulty or disruption. By tracking how this spectral property changes across layers and tasks, the framework reveals architectural signatures and processing bottlenecks without requiring training or fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning
- Algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value): Measures graph connectivity using the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. Needed to quantify structural changes in attention-induced token graphs. Quick check: Verify eigenvalues of small sample graphs.
- Spectral graph theory: Uses eigenvalues of graph matrices to analyze network properties. Essential for understanding how attention patterns create meaningful connectivity structures. Quick check: Confirm spectral properties persist across random graph models.
- Attention matrix interpretation: Treats attention weights as weighted edges in a token graph. Required to bridge transformer internals with graph-theoretic analysis. Quick check: Validate that attention normalization preserves spectral properties.
- Cross-linguistic typology: Understanding morphological voice systems across language families. Necessary for interpreting cross-linguistic spectral patterns. Quick check: Verify voice alternation patterns match linguistic typology databases.
- Tokenization effects: How subword tokenization influences spectral signatures. Critical for distinguishing model architectural effects from tokenizer artifacts. Quick check: Compare spectral patterns across different tokenization schemes.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Token input -> Attention matrix computation -> Token graph construction -> Laplacian matrix calculation -> Eigenvalue decomposition -> Fiedler value extraction -> Layer-wise spectral tracking
Critical path: The framework's performance depends on efficient computation of eigenvalues across multiple attention matrices per inference pass, with bottlenecks in the spectral decomposition step for large token graphs.
Design tradeoffs: The method balances computational cost against spectral resolution - more frequent spectral measurements provide finer-grained diagnostics but increase runtime overhead.
Failure signatures: Spectral anomalies may arise from tokenization artifacts, attention matrix sparsity patterns, or model-specific architectural quirks rather than genuine processing difficulties.
First experiments:
1. Run spectral analysis on simple synthetic tasks with known difficulty gradients to validate the framework's sensitivity
2. Compare Fiedler values across different tokenizations of the same input to isolate tokenizer effects
3. Apply the method to attention-only models versus full decoder architectures to test architectural generality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Spectral signatures may be influenced by token-ordering artifacts in attention computation
- The 20-language sample may not capture all typological extremes in voice alternation morphology
- Correlation between spectral disruption and accuracy requires independent replication across model scales

## Confidence
- Cross-linguistic spectral patterns reflect universal transformer processing constraints: Medium
- Early-layer spectral disruption directly indicates processing difficulty: High
- Spectral framework generalizes beyond language tasks: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies targeting specific attention heads across all three model families to verify whether spectral recovery correlates with behavioral performance recovery
2. Test the framework on typologically divergent languages (e.g., polysynthetic languages with complex voice morphology) to assess cross-linguistic robustness
3. Apply the spectral analysis to non-linguistic transformer tasks (e.g., code generation, mathematical reasoning) to evaluate domain transferability of the method
