core_contribution: This paper introduces EXPOTION, a multimodal music generation model
  that leverages facial expressions and upper-body motion alongside text prompts to
  produce expressive and temporally accurate music. The approach uses parameter-efficient

# EXPOTION: Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal Music Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.04955
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04955
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Combines facial expressions, upper-body motion, and text prompts to generate expressive, temporally accurate music, outperforming state-of-the-art video-to-music baselines.

## Executive Summary
EXPOTION is a multimodal music generation model that leverages facial expressions, upper-body motion, and text prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. By integrating visual features into a pretrained text-to-music model via parameter-efficient fine-tuning and a joint embedding framework, EXPOTION ensures precise synchronization through temporal smoothing. The model is trained on a novel 7-hour video-music dataset and demonstrates superior performance over baselines like VidMuse and Video2Music in both objective metrics and subjective evaluations.

## Method Summary
EXPOTION extends a pretrained text-to-music model (MusicGen) by incorporating facial expressions and upper-body motion as additional inputs alongside text prompts. Visual features are extracted using models like FaceNet and Synchformer, then projected into a joint embedding space with text embeddings via a projection network. Temporal smoothing is applied to align the generated music with the video’s motion. The model is fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques on a curated 7-hour video-music dataset, enabling control over music expression and rhythm through visual cues.

## Key Results
- EXPOTION outperforms VidMuse and Video2Music on objective metrics: lower Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), lower KL divergence, and higher Inter-Sample Score (IS Score).
- Subjective evaluations confirm improved musicality, creativity, and expressiveness.
- Motion features (especially from Synchformer) yield better rhythmic and expressive results compared to facial features alone.
- Enhanced text-video-audio consistency scores demonstrate strong multimodal alignment.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EXPOTION leverages the complementary strengths of visual and textual modalities to guide music generation. Facial expressions and upper-body motion provide rich, expressive cues that help control the emotional tone and rhythmic structure of the generated music. By integrating these visual signals into a joint embedding framework with text prompts, the model can produce music that is both contextually relevant and temporally aligned with the video. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning ensures that the pretrained MusicGen backbone is adapted without losing its generative capabilities, while temporal smoothing maintains synchronization between audio and video.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal Music Generation**
- Why needed: Enables expressive, contextually relevant music generation by combining audio, visual, and textual inputs.
- Quick check: Verify that the model can generate music conditioned on both video and text inputs.

**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**
- Why needed: Adapts a large pretrained model to new tasks without full retraining, saving computation and preserving learned capabilities.
- Quick check: Confirm that the model’s performance improves after fine-tuning on the video-music dataset.

**Joint Embedding Framework**
- Why needed: Aligns features from different modalities (text, facial, motion) into a shared space for coherent generation.
- Quick check: Ensure that embeddings from different modalities are meaningfully combined during generation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Visual Feature Extractor (FaceNet/Synchformer) -> Projection Network -> Joint Embedding -> MusicGen Backbone -> Generated Music

**Critical Path**
Visual features → Joint embedding → Music generation. The projection network and temporal smoothing are essential for aligning and synchronizing the generated music with the input video.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Using a small, curated dataset limits generalizability but enables precise control over music-video alignment.
- PEFT allows efficient adaptation but may restrict the model’s capacity to learn entirely new patterns.

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor synchronization between music and video motion.
- Music that does not reflect the emotional tone of facial expressions or body movements.
- Overfitting to the limited dataset, resulting in lack of diversity.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Generate music from a video with clear facial expressions and upper-body motion; evaluate synchronization and expressiveness.
2. Ablate motion features (use only facial features) and compare music quality and rhythm.
3. Test the model on out-of-distribution videos to assess generalization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None.

## Limitations
- The 7-hour video-music dataset is relatively small, which may limit the model’s robustness and generalizability.
- The relative contributions of facial, motion, and text modalities are not fully isolated.
- Subjective evaluation relies on human raters, introducing potential bias and variability.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**
- Improvements in FAD, KL divergence, and IS Score over baselines are well-supported by quantitative metrics.
- The claim that motion features outperform facial features alone is strongly validated through ablation studies.

**Medium Confidence**
- The assertion that the joint embedding framework and temporal smoothing ensure precise synchronization is supported but could benefit from more rigorous temporal alignment analysis.
- The claim of improved text-video-audio consistency is plausible but not fully detailed in the consistency metrics.

## Next Checks
1. Expand the video-music dataset to include a broader range of genres, tempos, and cultural contexts to assess model robustness and generalization.
2. Conduct detailed beat-tracking or frame-level synchronization analysis to quantify how well the generated music aligns with video motion at sub-second intervals.
3. Perform a systematic ablation study isolating the contributions of facial, motion, and text modalities to determine optimal feature weighting and identify potential redundancy or interference.
