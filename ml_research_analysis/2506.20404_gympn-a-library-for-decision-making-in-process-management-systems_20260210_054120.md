# GymPN: A Library for Decision-Making in Process Management Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.20404
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20404
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Successfully learned optimal policies in all eight synthetic business process patterns using PPO

## Executive Summary
GymPN is a Python library that enables reinforcement learning-based decision-making for business process management systems. It extends the Action-Evolution Petri Net framework by supporting partial process observability and modeling multiple decision types within a single process. The library implements a novel mapping algorithm that translates partially observable A-E Petri nets into assignment graphs suitable for Deep Reinforcement Learning agents. Evaluated on eight typical business process decision-making patterns, GymPN successfully learned optimal policies in all cases, achieving maximum cumulative rewards of 9-20 depending on the problem configuration.

## Method Summary
GymPN extends the Action-Evolution Petri Net (A-E PN) framework to support decision-making under partial observability in business processes. The library implements a novel mapping algorithm that translates partially observable A-E Petri nets into assignment graphs, which can then be used by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents. The framework handles both disjoint and joint action transitions within business processes. For evaluation, GymPN uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn optimal policies across eight synthetic business process patterns representing core workflow patterns including sequence, parallelism, cycle, and exclusive choice. The library provides a user-friendly Python interface for modeling and solving complex business process decision-making problems.

## Key Results
- Successfully learned optimal policies in all eight synthetic business process patterns
- Achieved maximum cumulative rewards ranging from 9-20 depending on problem configuration
- Outperformed random policies which scored 2.9-17.8 in cumulative rewards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GymPN works by transforming business process models into reinforcement learning environments through a systematic mapping process. The core mechanism involves converting partially observable A-E Petri nets into assignment graphs that DRL agents can navigate. This mapping preserves the essential decision points and state transitions of the original process while making it compatible with standard RL algorithms. The library handles partial observability by carefully structuring the state representation to include relevant process information while maintaining the inherent uncertainty of real-world business processes. By supporting both disjoint and joint action transitions, GymPN can model the full spectrum of decision types encountered in practical business workflows.

## Foundational Learning
- **Action-Evolution Petri Nets**: A process modeling formalism that extends traditional Petri nets with action specifications; needed to capture dynamic business process behavior; quick check: verify the library can import and validate A-E PN definitions from standard formats.
- **Assignment Graphs**: Data structures that represent decision points and state transitions in a form suitable for RL; needed to bridge process models and DRL algorithms; quick check: confirm the mapping algorithm produces valid assignment graphs from sample A-E PNs.
- **Partial Observability**: The state of a process that is not fully visible to the decision-maker; needed to model realistic business process environments; quick check: test environment generation with varying levels of observability.
- **Disjoint vs Joint Actions**: Types of decision points where either one choice is made at a time (disjoint) or multiple choices can be made simultaneously (joint); needed to accurately model different business process patterns; quick check: verify the library correctly identifies and handles both action types.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization**: A policy gradient method for reinforcement learning that balances exploration and exploitation; needed to learn optimal decision policies; quick check: run a simple training loop and verify policy improvement over time.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
GymPN Architecture:
User Input (A-E PN model) -> GymPN Mapper (Partial Observability Mapping) -> Assignment Graph -> DRL Agent (PPO) -> Optimal Policy

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows from the user-defined A-E Petri net through the mapping algorithm to generate an assignment graph, which serves as the environment for the DRL agent. The PPO agent then interacts with this environment to learn an optimal policy through repeated episodes of process execution and reward collection.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The library prioritizes ease of use and integration with standard RL frameworks over maximum performance optimization. By building on top of OpenAI Gym, GymPN sacrifices some control over the training environment in exchange for compatibility with a wide range of existing RL algorithms and tools. The choice of PPO as the default algorithm balances sample efficiency with stability, though this may not be optimal for all process patterns.

**Failure Signatures:**
Common failure modes include invalid A-E PN specifications that cannot be mapped to assignment graphs, convergence issues with the PPO algorithm on highly stochastic processes, and suboptimal policies when the partial observability mapping loses critical state information. The library may also struggle with extremely large or complex process models that exceed computational resource limits.

**First Experiments:**
1. Run the basic sequence pattern example to verify the complete pipeline from A-E PN to trained policy.
2. Test the library with a simple parallel process to validate handling of joint action transitions.
3. Evaluate the partial observability mapping by comparing performance with full observability on a controlled process model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can GymPN be effectively extended to support multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning where multiple autonomous decision-makers interact within the same business process?
- Basis: [explicit] The conclusion states that "At the time of writing, the GymPN library still supports only single-agent DRL" and explicitly lists "support for multi-agent DRL" as a future step.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture assumes a centralized decision-making agent; the framework and library do not yet implement mechanisms for multiple concurrent learners.
- What evidence would resolve it: An update to the library implementing multi-agent environments and a demonstration of agents learning cooperative or competitive policies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do rollout-based algorithms provide superior data efficiency and performance compared to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in highly stochastic GymPN environments?
- Basis: [explicit] The authors note that future work includes other DRL algorithms because of "the relatively low data-efficiency of PPO, while alternatives like rollout-based algorithms proved to be more efficient, especially in highly stochastic environments."
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation relies solely on PPO; no comparative analysis of algorithm efficiency has been conducted within the GymPN framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative benchmark showing sample complexity and convergence rates of rollout algorithms versus PPO on stochastic problems defined in GymPN.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of policies learned via GymPN degrade when applied to noisy, real-world event logs compared to the synthetic workflow patterns used in the evaluation?
- Basis: [inferred] The evaluation is conducted on eight "typical business process decision-making problem patterns" (synthetic BPMN diagrams), but the paper does not validate the library using real-world industrial data.
- Why unresolved: Real-world processes often contain noise, outliers, and unmodeled dynamics that synthetic patterns may not capture, potentially affecting the "near-perfect performance" reported.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from training and testing GymPN agents on real-life event logs (e.g., from the Business Process Intelligence Challenge) demonstrating robustness to real-world variability.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to eight synthetic business process patterns without real-world validation
- Performance metrics focus solely on cumulative rewards without discussing convergence speed or computational efficiency
- Partial observability mapping algorithm quality and robustness unverified beyond limited test cases
- No exploration of highly concurrent or dynamically changing process environments

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core technical implementation of the GymPN library and its basic functionality (mapping A-E Petri nets to assignment graphs) appears sound based on the described methodology.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claims about successfully learning optimal policies in all eight test cases are supported by the presented results, though the evaluation scope is narrow.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that GymPN provides a comprehensive solution for "complex business process decision-making problems" is not well-supported given the limited evaluation scope and lack of real-world testing.

## Next Checks
1. Test GymPN on real-world business process logs from established process mining datasets to evaluate performance on noisy, non-ideal process executions with genuine partial observability challenges.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of the partial observability mapping algorithm on learning performance compared to baseline approaches that don't handle partial observability.
3. Evaluate computational efficiency metrics including training time, memory usage, and scalability when increasing the number of concurrent processes or the complexity of process structures.
