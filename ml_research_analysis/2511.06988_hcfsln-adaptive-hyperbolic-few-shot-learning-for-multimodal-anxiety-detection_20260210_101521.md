# HCFSLN: Adaptive Hyperbolic Few-Shot Learning for Multimodal Anxiety Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.06988
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06988
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Primary result**: 88% accuracy in 1-shot multimodal anxiety detection using hyperbolic embeddings

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the problem of anxiety detection using multimodal data, addressing the limitations of traditional diagnosis and overfitting in machine learning models due to small datasets. The proposed Hyperbolic Curvature Few-Shot Learning Network (HCFSLN) integrates speech, physiological signals, and video data to improve feature separability and classification accuracy. By leveraging hyperbolic embeddings, cross-modal attention, and an adaptive gating network, HCFSLN enhances few-shot learning performance. Experiments on the Multi-Modal Anxiety Dataset (M2AD) and the Social Anxiety Dataset (SAD) demonstrate that HCFSLN outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 88% accuracy in the 1-shot setting, with the best performance in multimodal fusion settings. This highlights the effectiveness of hyperbolic space for modeling anxiety-related patterns and the potential of few-shot learning for anxiety classification with minimal data.

## Method Summary
HCFSLN addresses binary anxiety classification using few-shot learning with multimodal data including audio, video, PPG, and EDA signals. The method employs modality-specific encoders with convolutional and attention layers, followed by cross-modal attention and a gating network to fuse information. Hyperbolic geometry is incorporated through Poincaré ball projection with learnable curvature, enabling better modeling of hierarchical anxiety-related patterns. The model uses prototype-based classification with a combined loss function incorporating both classification and angular regularization. Training follows an episodic evaluation protocol with 1-shot and 5-shot settings, using Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-3 for 50 epochs.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 88% accuracy in 1-shot multimodal anxiety detection
- Outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines on M2AD and SAD datasets
- Demonstrates superior performance in multimodal fusion settings compared to unimodal approaches
- Shows effectiveness of hyperbolic embeddings for modeling anxiety-related patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging hyperbolic geometry to better capture the hierarchical and non-Euclidean nature of anxiety-related patterns across multiple modalities. The cross-modal attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant information from each modality, while the adaptive gating network dynamically weights contributions based on their importance. The few-shot learning framework with episodic evaluation enables effective learning from limited data by learning to classify from a few examples rather than requiring large labeled datasets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hyperbolic embeddings**: Represent data in Poincaré ball space to capture hierarchical relationships; needed for modeling complex anxiety patterns that may have inherent hierarchy; quick check: verify embedding curvature remains stable during training
- **Few-shot learning**: Learn from very limited examples through episodic training; needed due to small dataset size and expensive clinical labeling; quick check: ensure support and query sets are properly stratified
- **Cross-modal attention**: Dynamically weigh contributions from different modalities; needed to handle noisy or redundant information across modalities; quick check: verify attention weights sum to one
- **Prototype-based classification**: Use class centroids in embedding space for classification; needed for efficient few-shot inference; quick check: ensure prototypes are computed correctly from support set
- **Poincaré distance**: Hyperbolic metric for measuring similarity in curved space; needed for proper distance computation in hyperbolic embeddings; quick check: verify numerical stability of distance calculations
- **Multi-head attention**: Process different aspects of input simultaneously; needed for capturing diverse features from each modality; quick check: verify attention mechanism output dimensions

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Raw data → Modality encoders (Conv1D → Dense → MultiHeadAttention) → Cross-modal attention → Gating network → Poincaré projection → Residual Hyperbolic Block → Prototype classification
- **Critical path**: Modality encoding → Cross-modal fusion → Hyperbolic projection → Prototype computation → Classification
- **Design tradeoffs**: Hyperbolic vs Euclidean space (better hierarchy modeling vs computational complexity), early fusion vs late fusion (integrated cross-modal attention vs separate processing)
- **Failure signatures**: NaN values in hyperbolic distance computation, gradient explosion in Poincaré projection, poor cross-modal attention weights leading to noisy fusion
- **First experiments**: 1) Test single modality performance to establish baseline; 2) Verify cross-modal attention produces meaningful weights; 3) Check numerical stability of hyperbolic projection and distance calculations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Why do specific modality combinations exhibit performance degradation in 5-shot settings compared to 1-shot, despite the theoretical expectation of improvement with more data?
- How can the fusion mechanism be optimized to prevent performance degradation when incorporating all four modalities simultaneously?
- To what extent does the DASS-21 self-report ground truth limit the model's ability to learn representations aligned with clinical diagnoses?

## Limitations
- Experimental setup and baselines are not fully specified, leaving critical hyperparameters ambiguous
- Unknown encoder dimensions and attention mechanism details hinder exact reproduction
- Potential overfitting to self-report questionnaire labels rather than clinical diagnoses

## Confidence
- **Confidence in central claims**: Medium - the approach is plausible but requires clarification of implementation details
- **Confidence in reproducibility**: Low - significant gaps in baseline specifications and hyperparameters
- **Confidence in clinical relevance**: Medium - limited by reliance on self-report questionnaires rather than clinical interviews

## Next Checks
1. Implement a minimal reproducible pipeline with episodic sampling, fixed hyperparameters, and compare HCFSLN to a simple baseline (e.g., late fusion MLP) to verify the core contribution
2. Test numerical stability in hyperbolic projection and distance computation; ensure no NaNs or gradient blowups during training
3. Validate class balance and stratification in episodic splits to rule out sampling artifacts affecting few-shot performance
