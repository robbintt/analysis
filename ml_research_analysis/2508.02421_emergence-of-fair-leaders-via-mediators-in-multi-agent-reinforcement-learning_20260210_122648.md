## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for Stackelberg games with dynamic leader selection via mediators to optimize fairness among self-interested agents. The key innovation is integrating Markov mediators that maximize fairness measures (e.g., minimum welfare) by dynamically choosing leaders based on agents' historical performance and potential future incentives. The proposed Joint Agents-Mediator Q-learning framework (JAM-QL) uses Q-learning for both agents and mediators, with agents receiving higher rewards for being selected as leaders in future states.

The theoretical analysis proves convergence to optimal fair policies under certain conditions, while experiments across iterated matrix games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Chicken) and resource collection environments show that JAM-QL consistently achieves higher fairness levels compared to baselines like fixed leaders, alternating leaders, and vote-based selection. The framework is particularly effective in complex multi-agent settings where traditional approaches struggle to maintain fairness.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes JAM-QL, a reinforcement learning framework where a mediator dynamically selects leaders in a Stackelberg game to maximize fairness. Agents use Q-learning to learn their strategies, while the mediator uses Q-learning over augmented states that include cumulative historical rewards. The mediator selects leaders by maximizing the minimum welfare across all agents. An end-game transfer mechanism applies zero-sum rewards at terminal states to prevent defection. The framework includes a sequential learning procedure where agents update in turn-taking order followed by mediator updates. The approach is evaluated on iterated matrix games and resource collection environments using tabular Q-learning and DQN architectures respectively.

## Key Results
- JAM-QL achieves higher minimum welfare fairness than fixed leader, alternating leader, and vote-based baselines in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken games
- The framework maintains fairness even with increasing numbers of agents (2-4 players)
- End-game transfer mechanism significantly reduces defection at terminal states, improving final fairness outcomes
- JAM-QL outperforms baselines in resource collection environments with complex spatial dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by aligning individual incentives with collective fairness through the mediator's leader selection. Agents receive higher future rewards when selected as leaders, creating a positive feedback loop that encourages fair behavior. The mediator's augmented state representation (including historical rewards) allows it to make informed decisions about leader selection based on past performance. The end-game transfer mechanism addresses the last-mover problem by redistributing rewards at terminal states, preventing agents from defecting when the game ends.

## Foundational Learning
- **Stackelberg games**: Leader-follower strategic interactions where one player moves first and others respond. Needed to model hierarchical decision-making. Quick check: Verify leader's action determines follower's response in implemented games.
- **Markov mediators**: Decision-makers that select leaders based on current state and historical information. Needed to create dynamic fairness optimization. Quick check: Confirm mediator Q-function uses augmented state with cumulative rewards.
- **Minimum welfare fairness**: Objective that maximizes the worst-off agent's payoff. Needed to ensure no agent is exploited. Quick check: Validate that action selection uses min_i Q_ρ^i(s_ρ, a_ρ) for fairness optimization.
- **End-game transfer mechanism**: Zero-sum reward redistribution at terminal states. Needed to prevent last-mover defection. Quick check: Verify θ transfer applies only at terminal states with sum-to-zero constraint.
- **Sequential learning**: Turn-taking update order for agents followed by mediator. Needed to stabilize joint learning. Quick check: Confirm update schedule alternates every 100 episodes as specified.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Agents (Q-learning) -> Mediator (Q-learning with augmented states) -> Leader selection -> Game execution -> Reward feedback

**Critical path**: Mediator selects leader → Leader acts → Followers respond → Rewards collected → Mediator updates Q-values → Agent updates Q-values

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Tabular vs DQN: Tabular for matrix games (smaller state space), DQN for resource collection (complex spatial states)
- End-game transfer: Prevents defection but adds complexity to reward structure
- Historical rewards: Improves mediator decisions but increases state space

**Failure signatures**: 
- Agents converge to unfair actions at terminal states (end-game defection)
- High variance in minimum welfare with JAM-QL(naive)
- Mediator selects same leader repeatedly regardless of state

**First experiments**:
1. Implement 2-player iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with tabular Q-learning and verify leader-follower dynamics
2. Test end-game transfer mechanism by checking minimum welfare variance reduction between JAM-QL and JAM-QL(naive)
3. Validate mediator leader selection by confirming fair action selection rates exceed 70% in Chicken game

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- State representation for historical rewards remains unspecified (continuous vs discretized)
- End-game transfer mechanism details unclear (computation method and selection criteria)
- Vote-based baseline implementation lacks specifics on additional policy learning
- Network architecture and training hyperparameters for DQN not fully specified

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core theoretical framework and JAM-QL algorithmic structure (Q-learning for agents and mediator, sequential update order, minimum welfare objective)

**Medium confidence**: Implementation details for matrix game experiments (tabular Q-learning, payoff structures, leader-follower dynamics)

**Low confidence**: RC environment implementation details, DQN architecture specifics, vote-based baseline implementation, and end-game transfer mechanism

## Next Checks

1. Implement and validate end-game transfer mechanism by checking that minimum welfare variance drops by >50% when comparing JAM-QL vs JAM-QL(naive) in Prisoner's Dilemma

2. Reproduce tabular results for 2-player Chicken game and verify fair action selection rates exceed 70% at convergence

3. Implement vote-based baseline with additional learnable policy per agent and confirm it performs worse than JAM-QL on minimum welfare metric in both matrix games
