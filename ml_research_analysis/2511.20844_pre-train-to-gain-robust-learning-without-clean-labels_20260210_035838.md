core_contribution: This work explores self-supervised learning (SSL) as a way to improve
  deep learning robustness when training on noisy labels, without requiring a clean
  data subset. By pre-training a ResNet18 backbone using SimCLR or Barlow Twins on
  the same noisy dataset, followed by standard supervised fine-tuning, the model achieves
  higher test accuracy and better label-error detection (measured via F1 and Balanced
  Accuracy) compared to training from scratch.

# Pre-train to Gain: Robust Learning Without Clean Labels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20844
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20844
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: SSL pre-training on noisy data improves robustness and accuracy without requiring clean labels

## Executive Summary
This work demonstrates that self-supervised learning (SSL) can be leveraged to improve deep learning robustness when training on noisy labels, without requiring a clean data subset. By pre-training a ResNet18 backbone using SimCLR or Barlow Twins on the same noisy dataset, followed by standard supervised fine-tuning, the model achieves higher test accuracy and better label-error detection compared to training from scratch. The approach is particularly effective at high noise rates (up to 80%) where traditional supervised pre-training methods fail.

The study shows that SSL pre-training not only improves classification accuracy by 5-30% but also enhances the model's ability to detect label errors through improved F1 and Balanced Accuracy scores (4-7 percentage points). The benefits persist even with extended supervised training, showing slower overfitting and reduced loss escalation. The improvements are most pronounced at moderate pre-training durations (≈50 epochs), making this a practical and efficient strategy for noise-robust learning.

## Method Summary
The method involves two-stage training: first, a self-supervised pre-training phase using either SimCLR or Barlow Twins on the noisy dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning on the same data. The pre-training uses standard augmentations (cropping, flipping, color jitter) without any clean label information. During supervised fine-tuning, the standard cross-entropy loss is applied to the noisy labels. The approach is tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with synthetic label noise rates ranging from 20% to 80%. Performance is evaluated using test accuracy, F1 score, and Balanced Accuracy to measure both classification performance and label-error detection capability.

## Key Results
- SSL pre-training improves classification accuracy by 5-30% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with synthetic label noise rates up to 80%
- F1 and Balanced Accuracy scores improve by 4-7 percentage points compared to training from scratch
- SSL pre-training outperforms ImageNet pre-trained models under high noise conditions
- Benefits plateau after ~50 pre-training epochs, with minimal gains from longer schedules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SSL pre-training works because it learns meaningful visual representations from the data structure itself, rather than relying on potentially corrupted label information. When trained on noisy labels, supervised learning tends to overfit to label errors, causing the model to memorize incorrect associations. SSL, by contrast, focuses on learning invariances and semantic similarities in the data through augmentations and contrastive objectives. This representation learning is inherently more robust to label noise because it captures the underlying data distribution rather than spurious label-signal correlations. When fine-tuned with noisy labels afterward, the model already has strong feature representations that help it better distinguish between correct and incorrect labels, leading to improved generalization and error detection.

## Foundational Learning
- **Self-supervised learning**: Learning from unlabeled data by creating auxiliary tasks; needed to extract meaningful representations without relying on noisy labels; quick check: understand SimCLR and Barlow Twins objectives
- **Label noise**: Incorrect or corrupted labels in training data; needed context for why standard supervised learning fails; quick check: can identify different types of label noise (symmetric vs asymmetric)
- **Contrastive learning**: Learning by comparing similar and dissimilar pairs; needed for understanding SSL methods used; quick check: understand positive/negative pairs in SimCLR
- **Overfitting to noise**: When models memorize incorrect label associations; needed to understand why SSL helps; quick check: can recognize signs of overfitting in training curves
- **Representation learning**: Learning features that capture data semantics; needed to understand how SSL builds robustness; quick check: can explain how good representations help downstream tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
ResNet18 backbone -> SimCLR/Barlow Twins SSL pre-training -> Supervised fine-tuning with noisy labels -> Evaluation

Critical path:
The critical path is: SSL pre-training (50 epochs) -> Supervised fine-tuning (typically 100-200 epochs) -> Evaluation. The pre-training duration is crucial as benefits plateau after ~50 epochs, making longer pre-training inefficient.

Design tradeoffs:
The main tradeoff is between pre-training duration and computational cost. While longer pre-training might seem beneficial, the study shows minimal gains beyond 50 epochs. Another tradeoff is choosing between SimCLR and Barlow Twins - both perform similarly, but SimCLR is generally faster while Barlow Twins may provide slightly better representations in some cases.

Failure signatures:
If SSL pre-training doesn't improve performance, it may indicate: (1) insufficient pre-training duration (less than 20-30 epochs), (2) too aggressive data augmentations that destroy semantic content, or (3) extremely high noise rates (>80%) where even SSL struggles. Failure may also occur if the supervised fine-tuning phase is too short to properly adapt the pre-trained representations.

First experiments:
1. Compare SSL pre-training vs random initialization on CIFAR-10 with 50% symmetric label noise
2. Test different pre-training durations (20, 50, 100 epochs) to identify the optimal schedule
3. Evaluate label-error detection performance using F1 and Balanced Accuracy metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experiments limited to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, leaving uncertainty about real-world noisy label scenarios
- Focus on ResNet18 architecture may not generalize to more complex models or domains
- Comparison with ImageNet pre-trained models is limited in scope and doesn't explore other pre-training alternatives
- Optimal pre-training duration may vary by dataset and noise level, but only tested on CIFAR datasets

## Confidence
- Consistent improvements from SSL pre-training on noisy data: **High confidence**
- Reduced overfitting and slower loss escalation during extended training: **High confidence**
- Universal effectiveness without clean data subsets: **Medium confidence**

## Next Checks
1. Test SSL pre-training on real-world datasets with naturally occurring label noise rather than synthetic corruption
2. Evaluate performance across diverse architectures (e.g., ResNet50, Vision Transformers) and domain-specific backbones
3. Investigate the impact of varying pre-training durations systematically across different noise levels and dataset complexities
