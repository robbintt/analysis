# A2Perf: Real-World Autonomous Agents Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.03056
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03056
- Reference count: 40
- A comprehensive benchmark suite evaluating autonomous agents across chip floorplanning, web navigation, and quadruped locomotion domains with metrics for data cost, system performance, application performance, and reliability.

## Executive Summary
A2Perf is a benchmarking suite for autonomous agents that evaluates them across three real-world domains: computer chip floorplanning, web navigation, and quadruped locomotion. It provides metrics for data cost, system performance, application performance, and reliability to enable comprehensive comparisons between algorithms. Key findings include: web navigation agents can achieve latencies comparable to human reaction times on consumer hardware; PPO exhibits superior reliability for chip floorplanning layouts; and SAC demonstrates more consistent gaits during quadruped locomotion deployment. A2Perf includes a novel data cost metric that quantifies the effort required to collect training data, enabling fair comparisons between offline and online learning approaches. The benchmark is open-source and designed for easy expansion to new domains and metrics.

## Method Summary
A2Perf benchmarks autonomous agents using three real-world domains: Circuit Training (chip floorplanning), Web Navigation, and Quadruped Locomotion. It evaluates algorithms across four metric categories: Data Cost (energy consumption for data generation and training), System (energy, GPU power, RAM, latency, wall-clock time), Reliability (IQR dispersion and CVaR risk metrics), and Application (episodic returns and generalization). The benchmark uses Gymnasium environments with standardized training/inference pipelines, tracking metrics via CodeCarbon and custom wrappers. Training employs distributed setups (4x A100 GPUs) while inference runs on single V100 GPUs, with 10 random seeds per algorithm-domain pair.

## Key Results
- Web navigation agents achieve latencies (~200ms) comparable to human reaction times on consumer hardware
- PPO exhibits superior reliability (lower CVaR) for chip floorplanning layouts compared to BC and DDQN
- SAC demonstrates more consistent gaits (lower IQR) during quadruped locomotion deployment compared to PPO
- Data cost analysis reveals that while BC has low training energy, its reliance on pre-collected data incurs high sample cost, whereas online RL methods have high training energy but zero sample cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Separating "training sample cost" from "training energy" allows for fair comparison between imitation learning and reinforcement learning methods.
- **Mechanism:** The benchmark calculates total energy cost by summing energy consumed during agent training and energy required to generate the offline dataset used. This reveals that while BC has low training energy, its reliance on pre-collected data incurs high sample cost, whereas online RL methods have high training energy but zero sample cost.
- **Core assumption:** Energy consumption serves as a stable proxy for the broader economic and computational effort of data collection across different hardware setups.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 3.2] Defines Training Sample Cost $C_D$ as average energy to train policies for dataset generation. [Section 5.1] Shows BC's total energy cost (48.39 kWh) is lower than PPO (120.53 kWh) but significantly higher than its standalone training energy (0.11 kWh).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Statistical reliability metrics (IQR, CVaR) expose deployment risks that mean performance returns mask.
- **Mechanism:** By measuring dispersion (Interquartile Range) and risk (Conditional Value at Risk) across rollouts, the framework distinguishes algorithms that perform well on average but fail catastrophically in specific instances.
- **Core assumption:** The statistical distribution of rewards in simulation directly correlates with the physical consistency or safety requirements of the real-world domain.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 3.4] Details use of IQR for dispersion and CVaR for worst-case risk analysis. [Section 5.3] Reveals SAC offers 3.7x better performance in worst-case rollouts for quadruped locomotion despite overlapping error bars with PPO.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Disaggregating system performance metrics validates the feasibility of asymmetric training/deployment pipelines.
- **Mechanism:** The benchmark tracks resource usage distinctively during training versus inference, identifying that high-resource training does not preclude low-resource deployment.
- **Core assumption:** Inference latency measured on specific test GPU scales predictably to target consumer hardware.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 5.2] Notes web navigation training requires ~2.3 TB peak RAM but inference runs at ~200ms latency. [abstract] Mentions "web navigation training requires substantial memory but inference can run in real-time."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Offline vs. Online Reinforcement Learning**
  - **Why needed here:** A2Perf explicitly compares algorithms that learn from fixed datasets (BC/Offline RL) against those that learn from environment interaction (PPO/SAC). Understanding the difference in data dependence is required to interpret the "Data Cost" metrics.
  - **Quick check question:** If an agent achieves high performance with low training energy but requires an "Expert" dataset, which metric category will reflect the hidden cost?

- **Concept: Statistical Dispersion and Risk (IQR & CVaR)**
  - **Why needed here:** The benchmark moves beyond "mean return" to evaluate reliability. Interquartile Range (IQR) measures the spread of typical results, while Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) measures expected performance in worst-case scenarios.
  - **Quick check question:** If Algorithm A has a higher mean return but a significantly worse CVaR than Algorithm B, which one is safer for a physical robot?

- **Concept: Sim2Real Transfer Gap**
  - **Why needed here:** The domains were selected specifically because they have demonstrated capability to cross the simulation-to-reality gap.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is a benchmark domain that runs in a real Chrome browser or uses motion capture from a real dog considered to have a "low Sim2Real gap"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** A2Perf harness -> Environment wrapper (Gymnasium interface) -> Metric collector (CodeCarbon/System metrics) -> Training/Inference pipeline
- **Critical path:** 1) Setup Docker container for hardware counters, 2) Configure domain and datasets, 3) Run benchmark harness for training phase, 4) Switch to inference phase for reliability and latency metrics
- **Design tradeoffs:** Web Navigation uses real Chrome instances for high fidelity but requires massive RAM (up to 2.3TB); system metrics are hardware-dependent requiring normalization for meaningful comparisons
- **Failure signatures:** WebNav OOM errors from insufficient RAM; reliability noise from insufficient random seeds (<10); energy metric inconsistencies on non-Intel CPUs
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Run BC baseline on "Toy Macro" chip task to verify data cost pipeline, 2) Compare PPO vs. SAC on "Dog Pace" task to confirm SAC's lower variance in deployment, 3) Run Web Navigation training with maximum parallel environments to identify RAM ceiling on specific hardware

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can A2Perf be extended to effectively evaluate multi-agent systems, particularly regarding coordination efficiency and emergent social behaviors?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6 states, "Future work could expand A2Perf to include multi-agent domains... requiring additional metrics to capture interaction dynamics, such as coordination efficiency, communication overhead, and emergent social behaviors."
- **Why unresolved:** The current benchmark framework is designed for single-agent interactions and lacks the environment complexity and metric definitions to assess cooperative or competitive dynamics between multiple autonomous agents.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Integration of a multi-agent environment with defined metrics for coordination overhead, showing distinct performance trade-offs compared to single-agent baselines.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do the system performance rankings observed in A2Perf hold when evaluated on resource-constrained edge computing platforms, such as NVIDIA Jetson or custom FPGAs?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6 notes that current evaluations are conducted on desktops and servers, and "future work is the addition of support for measuring system performance on custom hardware platforms... to provide more precise insights into performance in target deployment environments."
- **Why unresolved:** Inference efficiency and power consumption can scale non-linearly or differ fundamentally on edge architectures compared to server-grade GPUs used in the paper's experiments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative study running the benchmark's inference tasks on edge devices, demonstrating whether relative latency and energy efficiency of PPO vs. SAC remain consistent with server-based results.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the "Training Sample Cost" metric be standardized to equate the qualitative costs of human demonstrations with the quantitative energy costs of synthetic data generation?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 3.2 defines training sample cost using energy but notes the difficulty of comparing this across data sources: "The choice of metric may depend on the specific application... [such as] human operators."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper adopts a simplified energy metric for RL-generated data but lacks a unified model to compare this against time, labor, and monetary costs associated with human expert demonstrations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Proposed cost model that successfully normalizes human annotation time against compute energy, resulting in consistent "total cost" ranking for algorithms using mixed data sources.

## Limitations

- Energy consumption measurements are highly dependent on hardware specifics and measurement methodology, making absolute values difficult to reproduce across different setups
- Neural network architecture specifications are incomplete, particularly for policy/value networks across all algorithms and domains
- Web navigation domain requires substantial resources (up to 2.3TB RAM) that may limit reproducibility on standard research hardware
- HTML processing pipeline details for web navigation are not fully specified, potentially affecting task complexity and agent performance

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The framework's core architecture and metric definitions are well-specified and reproducible. The separation of training sample cost from training energy, and the inclusion of reliability metrics (IQR, CVaR), represent meaningful methodological contributions that can be validated independently of specific hardware configurations.

**Medium Confidence:** The domain implementations and baseline algorithm performance comparisons are reproducible given the specified hyperparameters, though exact performance numbers may vary due to hardware differences and incomplete neural architecture specifications.

**Low Confidence:** The absolute energy consumption values and web navigation resource requirements are difficult to reproduce without access to the exact hardware configuration and implementation details used in the original experiments.

## Next Checks

1. **Energy Measurement Validation:** Reproduce the energy consumption measurements for a single algorithm-domain pair using CodeCarbon on available hardware, then compare with the reported values to establish the measurement variance and hardware dependency.

2. **Architecture Reconstruction:** Reconstruct the neural network architectures for PPO on the quadruped locomotion task based on TF-Agents conventions and domain requirements, then validate that the architecture supports the specified training hyperparameters.

3. **Web Navigation Resource Profiling:** Run a scaled-down version of the web navigation training (fewer parallel environments) to empirically measure RAM usage and identify the minimum resource requirements for task completion.
