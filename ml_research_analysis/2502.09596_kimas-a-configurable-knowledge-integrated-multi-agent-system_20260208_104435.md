# KIMAs: A Configurable Knowledge Integrated Multi-Agent System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.09596
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09596
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: Configurable knowledge-integrated multi-agent system achieving under 10 seconds latency for knowledge-intensive QA applications

## Executive Summary
KIMAs is a configurable knowledge-integrated multi-agent system designed to address challenges in building practical knowledge-intensive QA applications. The system combines conversation context management, efficient multi-source knowledge retrieval, and optimized parallelizable multi-agent pipeline execution. Demonstrated through three real-world applications—AgentScope QA, ModelScope QA, and Olympic Bot—KIMAs achieves reliable performance with end-to-end latency reduced to under 10 seconds per query.

The system features query rewriting mechanisms, a routing system using embedding clustering, and citation generation strategies to enhance retrieval accuracy, handle heterogeneous knowledge formats, and ensure low-latency responses. The architecture is designed for scalability and adaptability across diverse use cases while maintaining robustness in handling complex knowledge queries.

## Method Summary
KIMAs implements a multi-agent architecture with configurable components for knowledge retrieval and response generation. The system employs query rewriting to optimize search effectiveness, embedding clustering for intelligent routing, and parallel execution pipelines to minimize latency. Knowledge sources are integrated through a unified retrieval layer that handles heterogeneous formats, while citation generation ensures traceability of responses. The architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing modes to balance performance and resource utilization.

## Key Results
- Achieves end-to-end latency under 10 seconds per query across three real-world applications
- Demonstrates reliable performance in knowledge-intensive QA scenarios through AgentScope QA, ModelScope QA, and Olympic Bot deployments
- Successfully handles heterogeneous knowledge formats through unified retrieval layer

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
KIMAs works by integrating multiple specialized agents that collaborate to handle complex knowledge queries. The query rewriting component optimizes initial search terms, while the embedding clustering-based routing system directs queries to appropriate knowledge sources. Parallel execution pipelines enable concurrent processing of retrieval and generation tasks, reducing overall latency. The citation generation mechanism ensures response traceability, enhancing reliability and trustworthiness.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge retrieval optimization** - Why needed: Essential for efficient access to relevant information across diverse sources; Quick check: Measure retrieval precision and recall across different knowledge domains

**Multi-agent coordination** - Why needed: Enables parallel processing and specialized handling of different query aspects; Quick check: Monitor agent communication overhead and task completion rates

**Query rewriting techniques** - Why needed: Improves search effectiveness by optimizing initial query formulation; Quick check: Compare retrieval performance with and without rewriting

**Embedding clustering for routing** - Why needed: Enables intelligent query distribution across knowledge sources; Quick check: Analyze routing accuracy and load balancing metrics

**Citation generation mechanisms** - Why needed: Ensures response traceability and builds user trust; Quick check: Verify citation accuracy and coverage across generated responses

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: User Query -> Query Rewriting -> Embedding Clustering Router -> Knowledge Retrieval Agents -> Response Generation Agents -> Final Response + Citations

**Critical path**: Query rewriting and routing occur first, followed by parallel knowledge retrieval, then response generation, and finally citation attachment

**Design tradeoffs**: Parallel execution reduces latency but increases resource consumption; centralized routing simplifies architecture but may create bottlenecks; configurable components enable adaptability but add complexity

**Failure signatures**: High latency indicates routing or retrieval bottlenecks; inaccurate responses suggest rewriting or knowledge source issues; missing citations point to generation agent failures

**First experiments**:
1. Measure end-to-end latency with varying query complexity and knowledge source sizes
2. Compare retrieval accuracy with and without query rewriting across different knowledge domains
3. Test system scalability under concurrent user loads with different query patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance metrics lack independent validation and third-party verification
- Claims of superiority over existing systems not supported by standardized benchmark comparisons
- Scalability assertions based on implementation details rather than stress-tested deployments

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Architectural design principles and component descriptions are technically coherent and well-documented

**Medium confidence**: Latency measurements and parallel execution claims, as they are internally reported but not independently verified

**Low confidence**: Comparative performance advantages over existing systems, due to absence of standardized benchmark comparisons

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing KIMAs against established multi-agent and RAG systems using standard QA benchmarks (NaturalQuestions, HotpotQA) with documented metrics

2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of query rewriting, routing system, and citation generation components to overall system performance

3. Deploy the system under realistic load conditions with concurrent users to validate the scalability claims and measure actual latency distribution across different query types and knowledge domains
